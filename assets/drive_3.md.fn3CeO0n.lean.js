UCSJ uses grassroots-based monitoring and advocacy, as well as humanitarian aid, to protect the political and physical safety of Jewish people and other minorities in the region. UCSJ is based in Washington, D.C., and is linked to other organizations such as the Moscow Helsinki Group. It has offices in Russia and Ukraine and has a collegial relationship with human rights groups that were founded by the UCSJ in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The UCSJ was formed in 1970 as part of the Movement to Free Soviet Jewry, a response to the oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Soviet bloc.History of UCSJ Activities Activities of the UCSJ include reporting on the human rights situation in countries of the former Soviet Union, assisting communities in need, providing support for asylum seekers and migrants, and exposing human rights violations and hate crimes, whether directed against Jews or other minorities in the region, such as Romani or Muslims. According to a UCSJ report in 2013 approximately 1.71 million Jews remained in the post-Soviet states at that time.Report: Estimated Jewish Population in the former Soviet Union (FSU). (July 3, 2013). Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. Retrieved 2015-09-24. The report states that the figures were \\"compiled by researcher Allan Miller,\\" without further explanation. The reports it produces on the situation in various countries are often presented to the US State Department. Leadership The 2015 leadership of the UCSJ includes Larry Lerner as President, Dr. Leonid Stonov as Director, and Meylakh Shekhet as Director of the L'viv Bureau. Former presidents include Yosef Abramowitz, Pamela Braun Cohen, and Morey Schapira. Dr. Leonid Stonov has been involved with the UCSJ since before his emigration to the U.S. in 1990, when he was a prominent Refusenik and author of the first emigration law in Soviet history, which was presented to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1989. David Waksberg served as National Vice President during the 1980s. Funding UCSJ has received funding from the European Commission of the European Union as part of a three-year project designed to combat racism, antisemitism and islamophobia in Eastern European countries. Supporters and contributors Today, UCSJ supporters and contributors include individuals around the world who are concerned about human rights transgressions, and the fate of the 1.71 million Jews who still reside in countries of the former Soviet Union. Those wishing to contribute have four options. Notable cases =Statement of UCSJ on alleged antisemitism in the Russian State Duma= Nineteen members of the State Duma from Motherland and the Communist party have signed a letter demanding Jewish organizations be banned in Russia.

Is the New in the Post-Soviet Space Only the Forgotten Old? by Leonid Stonov, International Director of Bureau for the Human Rights and Law-Observance in the Former Soviet Union, the President of the American Association of Jews from the former USSR (Vestnik magazine) A branch of the UCSJ was closed by the government of Belarus as part of what many observers saw as a wider crackdown on political dissent in the region. (main article - Human rights in Belarus)  Recent history  = Magnitsky legislation = Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer in Moscow for an international financial company. He advised the Russian authorities that the tax agents he was dealing with was stealing US$320 million from Russia. He was arrested, tortured and eventually killed by the Russian authorities. The Russian Human rights NGOs wanted to support a bill in the US Congress to punish those responsible for his torture and murder by denying them visas to the US and freezing their assets in the US. The UCSJ supported the legislation at the behest of the Russian NGOs and put together a coalition of international religious freedom organizations to petition the Congress. The State department fought against the legislation and the Jewish establishment organizations opposed the bills, until they saw that it was going to pass and then publicly supported the bills. The Magnitsky Act has been used by President Obama to punish Russia for violations of human rights today. = US grants = UCSJ was given a grant by US Ambassador to Moscow to bring together Russian pro- democracy human rights with their US counterparts to aid the NGOs in their work. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) granted UCSJ grants to monitor human rights violations and anti-semitism and the actions of the Russian Judicial system. The UCSJ sponsored a trip to the Ukraine when the Russians were trying to take over Eastern Ukraine by meeting with high Ukrainian government officials to see if the UCSJ could help. = Lviv office of the UCSJ = Meylach Schochetl heads the UCSJ office in Lviv. In addition to running a soup kitchen for the poor of Lviv and running Jewish services for the Jews of Lviv, he has taken on the task of working to protect Jewish historical sites and to fight for human rights. He has been successful in lawsuits against the authorities in Lviv to preserve cemetery sites and destroyed synagogues from commercialization. He has also been successful in pursuing actions against officials who violated the human rights of individuals.

Known originally as a train station near Wonthaggi, it is now the location of a very popular swimming hole at the Bourne Creek Trestle Bridge and at the 2016 census, Kilcunda had a population of 396. The name \\"Kilcunda\\" is believed to be from the Aboriginal term for 'an exclamation', and is reported by one authority to mean, 'Oh dear, the sticks!' Today =Trestle Bridge= Swimmers At Kilcunda Trestle Bridge, Where Bourne Creek meets Kilcunda Beach The 91 m long Kilcunda Bridge was built over the Bourne Creek. It is protected by the National Trust. This trestle bridge was constructed for the Victorian Railways to carry coal from what was then known as the Powlett Coal Fields. It is a particularly significant monument because most of the steam-locomotive fuel that serviced the Victorian Railways network, from 1911 until 1978, crossed over this bridge. Since disused, the bridge is now a tourist attraction and a part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Bourne creek spills over Kilcunda Beach and out into the sea of Bass Strait. Seashell collecting is permitted on Kilcunda Beaches. =Kilcunda Ocean View Hotel= Kilcunda Ocean View Hotel The Kilcunda Ocean View Hotel is located on the Bass Highway directly opposite Kilcunda Beach. =Bass Coast Rail Trail= Walking, cycling and horse trotting is the modern use of the old Wonthaggi railway line all year round. The Bass Coast Rail Trail is very flat and begins near Kilcunda at the roundabout to Phillip Island and ends at the Wonthaggi shopping district. You can also access it all along the way, including at Kilcunda. Victoria's only coastal rail trail, it stretches 16 kilometres from Anderson to Wonthaggi, meandering through farmland, coastal bushland, historic coal mining nature reserves and coastline with a clear view of the Wonthaggi wind turbines and remnants of coal mine buildings. The trail crosses over the Powlett River and the Bourne Creek trestle bridge at Kilcunda, which has panoramic views of the beach. Kangaroos can often be spotted as well as many bird species. An extension of the trail from Anderson to Woolamai, on Phillip Island, has not yet been made suitable for cyclists. Public toilets are situated at each town along the way. Public toilets in Anderson are situated at the bus interchange which handles connections between the San Remo and Inverloch/Wonthaggi public transport routes. The bus interchange is adjacent to the eastern side of the Anderson roundabout. =Kilcunda Lobster Festival= The Annual Kilcunda Lobster Festival began in 1984 and is held on Australia Day weekend. =Shore Fishing= Very popular surf fishing area, catching Salmon, Trout and Yellow-eyed Mullet. Climate Kilcunda's location on the north shore of Bass Strait gives it an oceanic climate, with the moderating effect of the ocean allowing a narrower temperature range throughout the year compared to other regions in Victoria. Average daily maximum temperatures range from 23.5 °C in the summer to 13.5 in winter. Frost is rare, occurring on average 6 mornings a year. History The Bunurong Aboriginal people were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to white settlement. The Boakoolawal clan lived in the Kilcunda area south of the Bass River. Middens containing charcoal and shellfish mark the location of their campsites along the coast. Originally a coal mining township, The Western Port Coal Mining Company extracted black coal from 1871. The Post Office opened on 5 August 1879. Evidence of coal mining is scattered across Kilcunda, the most famous (pictured here) is the old Kilcunda Rail Bridge on the eastern side. Commissioned in 1910 and decommissioned in the 1970s, it now forms part of the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Mitchell's Black Coal Mine ruins are on Carew Road. Education There is a primary school in nearby San Remo, a primary school in nearby Dalyston and Wonthaggi has three primary schools and one secondary college. There is a private secondary college on nearby Phillip Island.

He is widely acknowledged as the world's foremost expert in the history of worldwide Irish migration. Notably prolific, he has written at least 23 book-length, scholarly monographs, 3 jointly-authored scholarly books, 6 works of fiction and historical fiction, and 55 scholarly articles. He is a fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Historical Society (UK). He is also a Molson Prize Laureate, awarded for a lifetime contribution to Canadian culture (other winners include Margaret Atwood, Marshall McLuhan, and Glenn Gould). He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984, and in 1992 he won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award, then the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Akenson received his B.A. from Yale University and his doctorate from Harvard University. He is Distinguished University Professor and Douglas Professor of History at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and was simultaneously Beamish Research Professor at the Institute of Irish Studies, University of Liverpool (2006–10), and senior editor of the McGill-Queen's University Press (1982-2012).  Irish history  Originally trained in economics and statistics at Yale, Akenson's mentor in the study of Irish history was John V. Kelleher, the founder of the Department of Celtic Languages and Literature at Harvard. All together, Akenson has written twenty-four books on the subject of Ireland. Akenson's early works in Irish history focused on the religious history of Ireland, particularly the often ignored history of the Church of Ireland, and on the history of Irish education, with an emphasis on how educational practices either tended to heal or to further engender sectarian strife. Brian Titley wrote of Akenson's efforts in the chronicling of Irish education that \\"until it attracted the attention of D.H. Akenson, the writing of Irish educational history was moribund, amateurish and narrow in both scope and sympathy.\\" Akenson then moved more exclusively to the study of the Irish diaspora, and now, having written well over a dozen books on Irish history and Irish migration, is considered \\"the most distinguished scholar of the history of the Irish diaspora.\\" He became known to many Irish-American scholars in 1984 and 1985 when in his The Irish In Ontario (1984) and Being Had: Historians, Evidence, and the Irish in North America (1985) he controversially called for (1) historians of Irish immigration in North America to make use of the better-documented Canadian data on Irish immigration and (2) historians to recognize that the long practice of ignoring Irish Protestant migration, particularly in the nineteenth century, was at best a foolish mistake and at worst a case of scholarly bigotry. Having called into question many, if not all, of the most-dearly clung to assumptions of traditional scholars of Irish immigration in America, an all-out scholarly war ensued, and Akenson was persuaded to make his case once again in 1996 with The Irish Diaspora: A Primer. In this latter work, and indeed as in all of his books, Akenson pulls no punches. Since the publication of Being Had in 1985, he has remained one of the most respected but controversial scholars of Irish migration. In 1990 the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada named The Irish in Ontario (1984) \\"one of the most important publications in social science in the past 50 years in Canada,\\" and in 1994 he was named the winner of the Trillium Book Award for his biography of Irish writer and politician, Conor Cruise O'Brien, Conor: The Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien (1994). Of his latest contribution to the history of Irish Migration, Ireland, Sweden and the Great European Migration, 1815–1914 (2013), fellow Irish Diaspora historian Donald MacRaild wrote: \\"This monumental study clearly will have a huge impact in the field. Typically of Akenson, an original thinker of the first order, it debunks many myths, half-truths, and lazy assumptions on the part of historians. However, this isn't simply a book which debunks. It isn't a tract or a treatise. Its central contribution is in offering one of the best (perhaps the very best) comparative history of European emigration.\\"  Religious history  While mostly noted as a scholar of Irish migration, Akenson is also an award-winning scholar of religious history. His book God's Peoples: Covenant and Land in South Africa, Israel, and Ulster was named the winner of the 1992 Grawemeyer Award for \\"ideas improving world order\\". At the time, the Grawemeyer Award was the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Other notable winners include Mikhail Gorbachev and Aaron T. Beck (considered the father of cognitive therapy). Library Journal named God's Peoples one of the best 30 books published in the US in all genres in 1992. His other works on religious history have also been highly praised. Some Family: The Mormons and How Humanity Keeps Track of Itself (2007) was a finalist for the British Columbia Achievement Prize for Best Canadian Non- fiction Book; Saint Saul: A Skeleton Key to the Historical Jesus (2000) was short-listed for the Canadian Writers' Trust Prize; and Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds (1998) was shortlisted for the Governor General's Awards for Non-fiction. A senior editor at McGill-Queen's University Press for thirty years, Akenson remains the editor of McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two, which includes more than seventy books by eminent scholars such as Jacob Neusner.  Editor  In addition to teaching and research, Akenson was senior editor of McGill-Queen's University Press from 1982 to 2012. He was editor or founding editor of two long-running series of histories published by McGill-Queen's University Press: (1) the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two (dedicated to the memory of George A. Rawlyk); (2) McGill-Queen's Studies in Ethnic History; and independently (3) Canadian Papers in Rural History. He remains the editor of the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion series.

Open D tuning is an open tuning for the acoustic or electric guitar. The open string notes in this tuning are (from lowest to highest): D A D F A D. It uses the three notes that form the triad of a D major chord: D, the root note; A, the perfect fifth; and F, the major third. To tune a guitar from standard tuning to open D tuning, lower the 1st (high-E) string down a full step to D, 2nd (B) string down a full step to A, 3rd (G) string down a half step to F, and 6th (low-E) string down a full step to D. In this tuning, when the guitar is strummed without fretting any of the strings, a D major chord is sounded. This means that any major chord can be easily created using one finger, fretting all the strings at once (also known as barring); for example, fretting all the strings at the second fret will produce an E major, at the third fret an F major, and so on up the neck. Open D tuning is very popular with slide guitar (or 'bottleneck') players, as it allows them to play complete chords using the slide. This tuning is also used in regular (non- slide) guitar playing. The full and vibrant sound it produces - particularly on an acoustic guitar - also makes it ideal for fingerstyle playing. Open D Tuning: Home Many new chord shapes and sounds are available with open D tuning. It can offer a strong compositional element that produces tonal qualities markedly different from standard tuning. The full range of major and minor chords, with all their extensions, are available to the player. Many well-known guitarists have used this tuning at some point in their career. Neil Young, Richie Havens, Joni Mitchell, Bruce Cockburn, Barry Gibb, Jim O'Rourke and Jason Swain have all released recordings featuring this tuning. Elmore James used this tuning heavily. Stone Gossard from Pearl Jam uses this tuning when playing the rhythm guitar on \\"Even Flow\\" and \\"Oceans\\", from their Ten album. Broadbay use this tuning in all their songs. Mumford & Sons also use this tuning on their tracks \\"The Cave\\", \\"Awake My Soul\\" and \\"Roll Away Your Stone\\" from their album Sigh No More. Needtobreathe used it on some of their songs, most notably \\"Something Beautiful\\" from The Outsiders. Laura Marling uses the tuning on the title track of her 2010 album, I Speak Because I Can. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine uses this tuning and its variations on many songs. Also, Alessio Frusta uses this tuning on the track \\"Freedom Island\\" from his 2015 album Pen Siero. Additionally, Switchfoot uses this tuning on the track \\"Daisy\\" from its 2005 album Nothing Is Sound, albeit lowered a half step (giving an open D tuning with the same intervalic relationships as open D). Mitski uses this tuning for almost all the songs, while guitarists performing with her live often use standard tuning. Variations =D-A-D-F-A-C, Open Dmaj7 tuning= This variant is achieved lowering the high D string a half step to C when tuned to open D. C is the major seventh of the D major scale, hence the name. It also can be used for both fingerstyle and slide guitar work. =D-A-D-F-A-D, Open Dm tuning= This variant uses an F natural, the minor third. This tuning has been used by Niko Wenner of Oxbow on the songs \\"Angel,\\" \\"Cat and Mouse\\"; by Ian Thornley of Big Wreck on \\"Ladylike\\" and \\"Overemphasizing\\" and by Owen Campbell on \\"Sunshine Road\\". DADFAD tuning is ideal for guitarists who are accompanying instruments that are tuned to minor scales, such as the Native American flute. =D-A-D-F- A-E, Open Dmadd9 tuning= This tuning was used by the progressive metal band Opeth on their album Ghost Reveries. =D-A-D-A-D-D, Open D5 tuning= This variant is used by Mark Tremonti of Alter Bridge and Creed. Six of the songs in which it is used are \\"Are You Ready?\\", \\"Faceless Man\\", \\"My Sacrifice\\", “Fortress”, \\"Ghost of Days Gone By\\" (half-step down), and \\"Open Your Eyes\\" as well as \\"Rain\\", \\"Brains\\", and \\"New Way Out\\" all tuned down 1 and a half steps (BFBFBB). This tuning is also used in the Alter Bridge song 'Life Must Go On'. Mark has mentioned in his instructional DVD that this tuning is one of his favorites because of its simplicity. It is also used by the Goo Goo Dolls in their song \\"Black Balloon\\", which was tuned down a half step on the album but played live in Open D5. \\"Without You\\", \\"Emotion Sickness\\" and \\"Paint Pastel Princess\\" by Australian band Silverchair also uses the Open D5 tuning but down half a step. Fair to Midland use this tuning tuned down 1 full step (CGCGCC) and 1 1/2 steps (BFBFBB). =D-A-D-D-A-D= A variation on the above Open D5 tuning, is occasionally used by folk guitarists, such as Stephen Stills on the song \\"4+20\\". It has the advantage of a ringing pair of identical Ds on the third and fourth strings, which can be used to carry a melody line above a bed of D5 created by the other strings. =D-A-D-A-A-D= This tuning has been used by: *Dave Wakeling of The Beat (known in North America as The English Beat) on the track \\"Save It For Later\\" from Special Beat Service as well as \\"Click Click\\" from the band's debut.Dave Wakeling tuning his guitar on 94.9 FM.

These songs can be heard on his 2015 album Zen Guitar Songs, available on Spotify and other streaming services. The sheet music to these songs can be found on his website http://www.tomaskarlsson.com/. Tomas has also written a small lesson on using this tuning. =D-D-D-A-D-F= Nicknamed the \\"Wind of Change,\\" this tuning was used by Peter Frampton on his song of the same name. Frampton discovered this tuning while browsing guitars at the home of George Harrison, who had a large collection of guitars in various tunings. When speaking of the tuning in an interview, Frampton said, \\"The low E and A strings drop down to D, the fourth string remains unchanged, the third string goes up to A, the second string up to D, and the first string up to F , so there's a D triad on top and three Ds on the bottom. It's a very strange tuning, but oh my God, it sounds huge.\\" References Open tunings da:Guitarstemning#Open D ","title":"Open D tuning"},{"id":"2832935","title":"Tianmen"},{"id":"2832938","text":"Bud Browne (July 12, 1912 - July 25, 2008) was an American early pioneer surf film maker. He was the first filmmaker to show surf movies commercially. Browne was captain of the swim team at the University of Southern California in 1933. He learned to surf during his time in Venice, California. He began filming surfing in the 1940s while visiting Hawaii. Early life Bud Browne was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts on July 14, 1912 and died in San Luis Obispo, California on July 25, 2008. He moved to Los Angeles in 1931 and attended the University of Southern California, competing in collegiate swimming and became the captain of the team. In 1938, after graduating from the University, Browne obtained a job as a life guard. His time in this new occupation however, was short lived because he was soon enlisted into the Navy during World War II. While at war, he taught many Marines how to swim. After the war, he again received a job as a lifeguard and was given the nickname \\"Barracuda\\" because of his reputation as being one of the best body surfers of his time. While serving as a lifeguard in the late 1940s, Browne began filming body surfers. Realizing his potential, Browne went back to the University of South Carolina in the early 1950s to attend film school. While on a surfing expedition with Duke Kahanamoku in Waikiki, Hawaii in 1953, he made his inaugural film, Hawaiian Surfing Movies. The debut of his first film took place at John Adams Junior High School in Santa Monica, California to an audience of about 500 people. Because it was a silent film, Bud narrated the entirety of the film using the school's PA system. Career Over the next 11 years, Bud Browne would produce a movie each year, which all abided by the same basic structure: a montage of surfing action in either California or Hawaii followed by a few on the road moments between excursions. The entire process of Browne's film making protocol was relatively cheap, costing around five thousand dollars to film, edit, and produce. Bud Browne, along with filming all of the footage, also functioned as a one-man production and editing crew. After piecing many shots together to create a fluid film he would promote his films by driving to the coast of California and setting up tents where he would show his films for little cost. As Browne started to gain publicity and profit in the early 1960s, he was able to hire DJs to ship his films to the east coast of the United States and even further out, to parts of Europe and Australia. Browne's strong swimming skills provided useful in being able to steadily shoot while in the water. As much as his shots were taken in the water, Browne developed his own waterproof camera and waterproof wetsuit. These innovations allowed Browne to stay in the water and film for hours at a time. Among Browne's accomplishments is the pipeline shot that views a wave as it is crashing over top of the surfer, creating a water tunnel. Browne was the first of many film makers that followed in similar fashions such as Jon Severson and Greg Noll. Although Bud Browne never made much money off of the films that he created, it caused no hindrance on his projects: \\"It was always worthwhile for me because I got such a big hoot out of everyone enjoying the films”.

Together with the Vossius Gymnasium, the Barlaeus Gymnasium and Cygnus Gymnasium it is among the most prestigious schools in Amsterdam. Ignatius is located in the Jan van Eijckstraat in the affluent 'Old South' district of Amsterdam. It is one of the few Catholic gymnasiums in the Netherlands, founded in 1895. Originally a Jesuit school, it is named after the founder of the Jesuit Order Ignatius of Loyola. The school is fairly small and has a student population of about 900 with 70 staff. According to the Dutch Education Inspectorate, the Ignatius Gymnasium is as a very good school across the board. In the first three years, 2% has to repeat a class while 76% of the survivors pass their exams at once with an average grade of 6.9. All this is considered to be better than average. According to YELP, Ignatius ranks first among middle and high schools in Amsterdam. The Dutch magazine Elsevier chooses the Ignatius Gymnasium for several years as one of the best schools in the Netherlands. The school was elected as the best school in the province of North Holland in 2004. In 2010, Elsevier placed the school alongside ‘The winners of 2010, least repeaters and best exam results’.

Education and career From 1970 to 1973 Smith studied Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He obtained his PhD from the University of Manchester in 1976 for a dissertation on ontology and reference in Husserl and Frege. The dissertation was supervised by Wolfe Mays. Among the cohort of graduate students supervised by Mays in Manchester were Kevin Mulligan (Geneva/Lugano), and Peter Simons (Trinity College, Dublin), who shared with Smith an interest in analytic metaphysics and in the contributions of certain turn-of-the-century Continental philosophers and logicians to central issues of analytic philosophy.Mark Textor (ed.), The Austrian Contribution to Analytic Philosophy, Routledge, 2006. . In 1979 Mulligan, Simons and Smith together founded the Seminar for Austro-German Philosophy,Axel Bühler, \\"Drei Briten in Kakanien\\", Information Philosophie, 3 (1987), 22–33. which organized workshops and conferences centered around the work of early Central European philosophers from Bolzano to Tarski and their impact on subsequent generations. One prominent supporter of these meetings was Roderick Chisholm, who describes their 'significant role' in contemporary philosophy in his Intellectual Autobiography published in 1997.Roderick M.

Part 2ISO/IEC 21838: Top Level Ontologies, Part 2 is devoted to Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). Research activities From the beginning of his career Smith has worked in the field of ontology, initially on the history of ontology as a sub-discipline of philosophy in the tradition of Brentano, Husserl, Ingarden and Reinach.Marco Tedeschini, From Phenomenology to Formal Ontology: How Barry Smith and Kevin Mulligan Made Husserl’s Descriptive Psychology into a Form of Realism, Archivio di filosofia, 83 (3), 2015, 177-188. A special focus was on the theory of ontological dependence and part-whole relations proposed by HusserlFabrice Correia, \\"Ontological Dependence\\", Philosophy Compass 3/5 (2008): 1013–1032, 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00170.xKit Fine, \\"Part-Whole\\", Cambridge Companion to Husserl, Cambridge University Press, 1995. and applied by his students for example to the understanding of the ontology of mental and linguistic acts.Kevin Mulligan, ed., Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology, Reidel, 1987. In 1984 he published together with Mulligan and Simons the paper \\"Truth-Makers\\".Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith, Truth-Makers, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 44 (1984), 287-321.

In the 1990s he worked closely with David Mark, one of the founders of geographic information science (GIS), on initiatives in the field of geospatial ontology. In this connection he introduced the idea of fiat objectsBarry Smith, \\"Fiat Objects\\", Topoi, 20: 131–148, 2001. to describe (typically rectangular) geospatial entities such as postal districts and real estate parcels which are not separated from their surroundings by any physical discontinuity.

He was admitted as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in June 1967 and commenced his career in the Attorney General's department in 1968 as a Crown Counsel. He was promoted to Senior State Counsel in 1975 and Deputy Solicitor-General in 1979. Appointed as a Judge of the Sri Lankan Court of Appeal in 1987, he later became the President of the Court in 1994.http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts of Law/THE SUPREME COURT OF SRI LANKA.htm Controversial appointments and impeachment Justice Silva was seen as close to President Chandrika Kumaratunga when first appointed to the Supreme Court in 1995, then serving under her as Attorney-General in 1996 and was appointed a President's Counsel the same year. His appointment as Chief Justice in 1999 evoked widespread protest in the media on concerns of there being more qualified and experienced judges in Sri Lanka, and Chandrika Kumaratunga was perceived as using him to control Court decisions. In his short term on the Court, he had contributed to and rendered decision on many Court cases that appeared to satisfy the Executive President's political needs. In March 2003, the British Refugee Council released findings on the situation, citing a report from August 2001 where International Bar Association (IBA) concluded that there was \\"an overwhelming need for an independent credible judicial system\\" in Sri Lanka. It detailed instances of lack of accountability, breach of natural justice and potential for undue interference, as well singling out which positions should be protecting the rule of law. The position of Chief Justice was mentioned as one of possible abuse. A conflict of interest came before Silva in June 2001 when an impeachment notice for his position was restrained by his very court. In August 2001, the International Bar Association (IBA) concluded that there was \\"an overwhelming need for an independent credible judicial system\\" in Sri Lanka. It detailed instances of lack of accountability, breach of natural justice and potential for undue interference and pointed out that institutions which should be protecting the rule of law, including the President, government and the Chief Justice, were acting to undermine it. The IBA further opined that other Court members had been removed by Chief Justice Silva without inquiry. Despite these issues, he remained Chief Justice until retirement until 5 June 2009.

Based on the original German Oktoberfest, it is billed as Canada's Greatest Bavarian Festival, and is the second-largest Oktoberfest in the world. It is held every October, starting on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving and running until the Saturday after. Estimates indicate that the event attracts roughly 700,000 visitors to Waterloo Region, Ontario every year. Administrative building and gift shop While its best-known draws are the beer-based celebrations, other cultural and entertainment attractions also fill the week. The most well known is the parade held on Thanksgiving Day; as the only major parade on Canadian Thanksgiving, it is televised throughout Canada and portions of the northern United States on CTV. During the 2016 Oktoberfest parade, an estimated 150,000 people lined the streets along the route. The twin cities and the surrounding areas of Waterloo Region have a long history of German roots; Kitchener was formerly named Berlin. Many of the Canadians of German ethnicity reside in or near these municipalities. Many still speak German as well. A common phrase at the celebrations is Gemütlichkeit, German for congeniality, or warm friendliness. This word is even programmed into the bus route displays, so during Oktoberfest it will show the route and Gemütlichkeit, or Willkommen. The festival's mascot is Onkel Hans, a rotund man in Bavarian dress with a thick moustache, lederhosen, and a traditional felt hat with tassel. His graphical image shows him holding a beer stein in one hand, and a sausage (in a roll) in the other. A lesser-known icon is his counterpart Tante Frieda, a similarly stout woman wearing a dirndl. Another icon of the festival is Miss Oktoberfest. This position was formerly selected in a televised beauty pageant, the applicant coming from across Waterloo Region. The position is now selected by a closed committee of judges from a panel of local applicants; community involvement and personal character form the main criteria under the new system. History = The Early Years: 1967-1969 = In 1967, communities across Canada celebrated their Centennial Anniversary with a variety of festivals. The federal government provided funding for these events, including Expo’67 in Montreal. Kitchener-Waterloo was no different in its quest to hold a public event that would increase tourism to the area. Starting in 1967, the community tried a total of three different events as it looked for a more permeant festival. Between the years 1967–1969, the region tested events such as a Heritage Festival, Winterfest and Oktoberfest. The success of each event was monitored and evaluated as they decided what festival would be used going forward. Due to unstable weather patterns, people planning Winterfest found this event to be unreliable and it was quickly removed from the list. The Heritage Festival was removed from the list as too many communities had this event, the region was looking for an event that made them stand out. The first Oktoberfest event took place in 1967 with events held from October 11th to 14th. Festivities took place at the Concordia Club in Kitchener and drew a crowd of 2,000 people. The event included opening ceremonies with a keg-tapping, dancing, food and beer. In 1969, Kitchener Chamber of Commerce requested that Concordia Club allow the city to run the event for that year on a trial basis. Although the event only turned a profit of $703.73, Oktoberfest was selected as the ongoing event as it showed great potential for future events. Another long-standing tradition that started in 1967 was that Oktoberfest would be a benefit to the community. In 1967, the first donation of $3,200 was donated to Big Brothers of Waterloo Region. In recent years Oktoberfest does a variety of fundraising for various causes. = Kitchener - Waterloo Oktoberfest Inc: 1970 = On December 29th, 1970, K-W Oktoberfest Inc. was formed switching control of the festival from the city of Kitchener and Waterloo, to a private business to ensure the success of the event. The objectives for this board was simple. First, to evolve the event into something that supported the community and its values. Secondly, to increase tourism to Kitchener, Waterloo and the surrounding area. The First Board of Directors: Archie Gillies, Barry Bernstein, Lawrence Bingeman, P. Hubert, Jonas Bingeman, Herb Schneider, Jack Bishop, Bob Wagner, Darwin Clay, Mike Walters, Werner Metzger, Mike Hoesch, Dick Hermansen, Paul Weiner, Richard Nausser, Fred Ryan, Carl Hesse, Bryce Ruhnke, Owen Lackenbauer, Norman Schneider and J.R Zuber. Original Objectives in 1970: the following list is from * To promote, support, co-ordinate and project the festival of Oktoberfest within the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo and the surrounding area during the month of October. * To unite all organizations, ethnic clubs, institutions and professions in the Kitchener-Waterloo area in the promotion of Oktoberfest. * To manufacture, import, buy, sell, license and develop wares, goods, articles and symbols that are required in the advancement, celebration and promotion of Oktoberfest. * To conduct contests and competitions in the various sports and other activities during the celebration of Oktoberfest. * To conduct and promote a beauty pageant for the title of “Miss Oktoberfest” * To bring the attention of the general public to the culture, history, background and origin of the German people residing in the Kitchener-Waterloo area. To promote tourism and to advance and secure the interest in the community and to preserve an accurate history, background and development of the community. * To promote good will and understanding in the spirit of fellowship and brotherhood of all inhabitants of the Kitchener- Waterloo area. * To provide improved opportunities and facilities in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for the purpose of celebrating Oktoberfest and to ensure that high standards are maintained and to acquire, purchase, lease lands and buildings for such purposes. * To do all such things as are incidental or conductive to the attainment of the above objects and to encourage the inhabitants, visitors and guest to participate in the spirit and intent of Oktoberfest. = Oktoberfest Controversy Since 1967 = 1970 Annual Poster: The 1970 event poster or “The Million Dollar Poster” as it is now known became the center of attention during the 1970 festival. LLBO commissioner Mackey ordered posters removed from public streets and that they could only be posted in drinking establishments. The issue was that the posters featured the word ‘beer’ and included a picture of a women holding mugs of frothy beer. Although this was promotional advertising for the event, it was seen as advertising for drinking. Event organizers at the time had been worried that the lack of advertising would have a negative effect on the festival. Due to national coverage of the story about the posters, it increased knowledge of the event. 1971-1972 Glenbriar Incident: During the 1971 festival it was expected that there would be a net profit of $84,700, leaving the festival with a surplus budget of $8,745.67. Of this expected profit was that the Heidelberg Haus would bring in a surplus of $7,000 based on the previous year's performance. As the event closed and the accounting began, it became obvious that something was wrong, as the event was showing an operating loss of $17,704. The issue was traced back to underperformance at the Heidelberg Haus that showed a $7,000 loss instead of a profit. The issue became worse for K-W Oktoberfest when their office's lease was canceled due to financial reasons. This was quickly solved as Waterloo Town Square offered some space to the organizers. The financial issue was solved in the spring of 1972. The 4 German clubs and Bingeman Park Farms all contributed an additional $4,000 each to bring the event into a financial surplus for the 1971 event. The money was charged bank interest rates and also required K-W Oktoberfest to complete an audit of Heilberg Haus to understand what went wrong. 1974 Opening Ceremonies: In 1974 there was controversy surrounding the keg-tapping. This was regarding what permission was required and who was able to give it to them. The event was permitted Kitchener Mayor Sid McLennan and Regional Chair Jack Young proceeding with the Keg tapping without issue. In 1975, the event was canceled due to a new law put in place by the Liquor Board. A new law was in place for the 1976 festival and the event once again signaled the start of Oktoberfest. 1975 was the only year in Oktoberfest history that the Keg- Tapping did not signal the start of the event. 2019 Reset Needed for Oktoberfest :2019-2020 President Tim Beckett stated that the festival was in need of a reset. Beckett felt that a reset was needed to ensure the success of Oktoberfest for another 50 years. Beckett stated that the event needs to return to a destination festival. Beckett would like to see the event attract people not just locally, however, at a national and international level. 2020 Virtual Oktoberfest: Live concerts were scrapped caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, so virtual ones will be held in its place. = Oktoberfest President Since 1967 = * 1969-1971 - Darwin Clay * 1972-1976 - Jack Bishop * 1977-1978 - Charles E.

Other festhalls and biergartens are operated out of existing bars, clubs, and other venues in the cities, which take on Germanic names (such as Karlsberghaus, Altes Muenchen Haus, and Ruedesheimer Garten) for the festival events. In 2010, festhalls opened for the first time in Cambridge and Elmira. Events The Oktoberfest Timeteller, a traditional display in Waterloo. Based on traditional Pennsylvania Dutch and local Mennonite Hex designs, the 24 Hex symbols under the eaves of the Timeteller were designed and painted by Kitchener artist Otto Werner. Nightly ticketed events take place at festhalls across the region based on the traditional concept of Oktoberfest. Throughout the week the following single events take place and have become an important part of the overall festival. = Opening ceremonies = These include an official keg-tapping to start the festival; at Wilkommen Platz, downtown Kitchener (before 2019 at Kitchener City Hall) (Friday) = Pancake breakfast = Free breakfast for all comers, in Uptown Waterloo (Saturday) = Barrel Race = Keg-rolling race in Uptown (Saturday) = Oktoberfest 5K Fun Run = A family oriented Turkey Trot down the parade route right before the Thanksgiving Day parade. (Monday) = Oktoberfest Parade = Including bands, traditional dancers, floats and revelry, down King Street in both cities; broadcast nationally by CTV (Thanksgiving Monday) and local radio coverage is provided by CKGL. During the 2016 Oktoberfest parade, an estimated 150,000 people lined the streets along the route.] = Miss Oktoberfest = The Miss Oktoberfest Pageant started in 1969 and was held at the German Club in Kitchener. The first year the winner took part in local festivities. (cite 40, 36) In 1970, the format was changed, and the winner of Miss Oktoberfest would then compete for Miss Canada. In 1971, the winner of Miss Oktoberfest Donna Sawicky, went on to win Miss Canada. Sending Miss Oktoberfest on to Miss Canada Pageant increased national knowledge of K-W Oktoberfest. In 2003, Miss Oktoberfest Pageant was cancelled due to the cost of hotels and flights. The same year, The Miss Oktoberfest Ball started with the criteria of participants being from an radius. Miss Oktoberfest is now selected by a panel, selection criteria is based on community involvement and other activities. For the first time in 17 years, no pageant is planned in 2020. This time the pandemic was the cause. = Festhall Single Night Events = *University Nights – a night for local University students run by the local Sigma Chi fraternities. Buses run all night from University Avenue in Waterloo to the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium, where the event takes place. Traditionally, Wilfrid Laurier University's night is on Thursday and University of Waterloo's is on the Friday of the second weekend, however both nights attract students from both schools, as well as other nearby colleges. *Rocktoberfest – major concert featuring rock acts, as well as more traditional music; Queensmount Arena (Altes Muenchen Haus), Kitchener (Sunday) Relevance Although it is marketed as a German festival, some do not consider Oktoberfest to be indicative of German culture in general. \\"The fact is, Oktoberfest in Germany is a very localized festival. It really is a Munich festival. ... [Oktoberfest in Kitchener] celebrates only a \\"tiny aspect\\" of German culture [Bavarian]\\", according to German studies professor James Skidmore of the University of Waterloo.

State Route 5  State Route 5 followed the route of current SR 35 along Skyline Boulevard. It headed north along the ridges of the Santa Cruz Mountains from SR 17 near the Santa Clara-Santa Cruz county border to SR 1 in San Francisco. SR 5 was deleted in 1964 with the creation of Interstate 5 and was renumbered SR 35. State Route 7 (Original) State Route 7 ran from SR 1 near SR 47 in Long Beach to Valley Boulevard in Monterey Park as the Long Beach Freeway. Originally running as State Route 15 in 1934, the route was changed to prevent confusion with I-15. In 1985, SR 7 was deleted and has since been renumbered as Interstate 710. SR 7 was redesignated in Calexico from I-8 near Holtville to the United States/Mexico border in 1990. This route was completed in 2005. State Route 11 (Original) State Route 11 followed the route of current Interstate 110 and State Route 110 along the Harbor Freeway. It initially followed surface streets until the 1940s when the Arroyo Seco Parkway was completed. The Harbor Freeway, which was constructed to interstate standards, opened in phases from the late 1950s to the 1970s and SR 11 was since transferred to that route. In December 1978, the Harbor Freeway was approved as an Interstate Highway by the FHWA. In 1981, SR 11 was deleted and has since been renumbered as Interstate 110 on the Harbor Freeway, and State Route 110 on the Pasadena Freeway (later Arroyo Seco Parkway). SR 11 was redesignated in San Diego from SR 905 near SR 125 to the United States/Mexico border in 1994 and the first segment opened in 2016. State Route 21 State Route 21 closely followed the route of current Interstate 680. It began in San Jose heading northeast from I-280 and US 101 and closely paralleling SR 17 (now I-880) until reaching Fremont. From there, SR 21 headed northeast toward Pleasanton and intersected I-580. SR 21 then headed northwest to Concord and Martinez, California, intersecting SR 24 and SR 4 before reaching the Carquinez Strait. In Benicia, SR 21 intersected with SR 141 (now I-780) and ended in Fairfield at I-80. The route was added to the Interstate Highway System in 1973. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. SR 21 was then deleted in 1976 once corresponding changes were made by the state legislature. State Route 26 (Original) State Route 26 was a state highway in Los Angeles and Orange counties in the U.S. state of California, from 1937 to 1964. It traveled from U.S. Route 101 Alternate (US 101 Alt.) in Santa Monica to SR 39 in Buena Park. The route was assigned pre-1964 Legislative Route 173 (LR 173), defined in 1933 from Santa Monica to East Los Angeles.[citation needed] Between Santa Monica and Los Angeles, it was later replaced by the Santa Monica Freeway, and added to the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955.[1] East of East Los Angeles, it was assigned LR 166.[citation needed] The highway originally traveled along 10th Street in Los Angeles, but as Olympic Boulevard was built out to the west and east, it was aligned to that. East of Los Angeles, the highway turned southeast along the Anaheim Telegraph Road, which it followed into Santa Fe Springs. It then continued along Los Nietos Road, Valley View Avenue, and Stage Road before its terminus at La Habra Road (now Beach Boulevard). The portion east of Downtown Los Angeles was eventually deleted from the system as redundant to US 101 Byp. which later became Interstate 5 (I-5). The highway was known as State Route 6 from 1934 to 1937. The current SR 26 bears no relation to this highway. State Route 30 State Route 30 ran from Interstate 210 in San Dimas to Interstate 10 in Redlands through San Bernardino. It was built to freeway standards between Interstate 215 in San Bernardino and Interstate 10 and between the current terminus of State Route 57 in San Dimas to Foothill Boulevard in La Verne. When the freeway section between Foothill Boulevard and Interstate 215 was completed in 2007, the route was decommissioned and renumbered SR 210. It is expected to be incorporated into the Interstate highway system at some later date as an extension of Interstate 210. State Route 31 State Route 31 ran from State Route 91 near Corona to Interstate 15 in Devore through San Bernardino. The route was deleted in 1974, when it was added to the interstate system. After being signed California 31, It was signed Temporary Interstate 15, and later, after being moved from Main Street in Corona, Hamner Avenue in Riverside County north of Corona, and Milliken Avenue in San Bernardino County to the Ontario Freeway. The route became Interstate 15. State Route 35 (Original) State Route 35 originally ran north to south from State Route 22 to US 99, first along Los Alamitos Boulevard in Seal Beach which turns into Norwalk Boulevard. The highway continued west on Centralia Road and then north along Pioneer Boulevard until reaching San Antonio Drive at Rosecrans Avenue. San Antonio Drive would turn back into Norwalk Boulevard and continue with that street name until turning into Old Mill Road at Beverly Boulevard. Route 35 would wind through Rose Hills and Avocado Heights as Workman Mill Road and would then turn into Puente Avenue at Valley Boulevard where it would continue to its end at U.S. 99 at the border of Baldwin Park and West Covina. The route was deleted in 1964 due to the replacement by Interstate 605 and SR 35 was redesignated along Skyline Boulevard in the San Francisco Bay Area. State Route 42 State Route 42 ran from State Route 1 west of Inglewood to State Route 91 near Norwalk, largely along Manchester Avenue and Firestone Boulevard. It was deleted in 2000. The segment east of Interstate 5 (Santa Ana Freeway) was added to State Route 90. The segment west of Interstate 5 was added to the interstate system as Interstate 105. The freeway would not be opened until 1993, which resulted in the original route continuing to be signed as State Route 42. To this day, Route 42 is still sporadically signed in many places. State Route 69 State Route 69 began at SR 198 amid Tulare County. It then headed north and intersected SR 216 in Woodlake and CR J27 amid farmland in the county. The route continued to meet SR 201 in Elderwood. After several miles through Tulare County, it crossed into Fresno County, where it met its north end at State Route 180. In 1972, this highway was decommissioned and renumbered SR 245. State Route 85 (Original) From 1963 to 1965, State Route 85 was a 10-11 mile highway that ran entirely on surface streets from US 101 near SR 237 to SR 82 along Mathilda Avenue and Saratoga- Sunnyvale Road (later De Anza Boulevard) between SR 82 and SR 9. The segment north of I-280 was deleted in 1965 once the current northern segment of the freeway opened. The southern segment was deleted in 1994 (the same day the remainder of the current freeway opened) and the route was immediately transferred over to the cities of Cupertino and Saratoga. The route still appeared in the California Transportation Commission's agenda in July 2000. State Route 106 State Route 106 was originally created in 1964, and ran from State Route 38 in Redlands to State Route 18 in Running Springs. Prior to 1964, the highway was a part of Legislative Route 190, which ran from US 66 to State Route 38. After 1964, the route was split in half. The western portion became State Route 30. The eastern portion was combined with Legislative Route 207, and became State Route 106. A year later, its southern terminus was moved to Interstate 10. In 1972, State Route 106 was decommissioned. The northern portion between State Route 30 and State Route 18 was renumbered to State Route 330. The southern portion was added to State Route 30, extending it to Interstate 10. This also reconnected both halves of the original Legislative Route 190. State Route 157 State Route 157 was planned to run from I-805 near Ocean View Boulevard in San Diego to SR 125 near the Sweetwater Reservoir, passing through the neighborhood of Paradise Hills. What was known as Route 285 became a state highway in 1959, and was redesignated as SR 157 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. By 1974, plans called for constructing the freeway from Nogal Street across Imperial Avenue to end at SR 54. However, the project was cancelled after objections from the community, and because it was not compatible with any long-term plans. Developments near the western half of the route served to discourage construction, and the plans for the eastern half were cancelled that year; the land was sold soon afterward. The mayor of National City, Kile Morgan, opposed the proposal, citing concerns that many projects for the South Bay were being opposed by others. The route was removed from the law by the Legislature in 1994. State Route 159 State Route 159 Between July 1, 1964 and the time it was turned back to local authorities, Route 159 was the segment of Linda Vista Avenue in Pasadena between State Route 134, the Ventura Freeway, and Interstate 210, the Foothill Freeway. From July 1, 1964 to 1965, this was also the segment of Figueroa Boulevard between State Route 134 and Interstate 5. In 1965, this was to be deleted when I-210 was completed. Prior to July 1, 1964 it was a segment of California Legislative Route 165 and signed as California State Route 11. State Route 171 State Route 171 was planned to run from I-5 near San Diego to I-805 through Switzer Canyon. It was to be called the Switzer Canyon Freeway, and had been suggested by consultant John Nolen in 1926. Originally designated as Route 284 in 1959, the route was renumbered as SR 171 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. However, the community opposed the project; it would have passed through Balboa Park and would have gone through canyons, residential districts, and a golf course. SANDAG endorsed the deletion in 1993, and the Legislature deleted the route in 1994. State Route 176 State Route 176 ran from US 101 in Santa Maria to Sisquoc along Stowell Road, Philbric Road, and Foxen Canyon Road. Prior to July 1, 1964 it was an unsigned segment of California Legislative Route 148. State Route 195 State Route 195 connected SR 86 with SR 111. It served as a connector between the two routes while the SR 86 expressway was constructed. This route was deleted in 2014, when the part that was not deleted in 2009 was transferred to SR 111. State Route 196 State Route 196 was planned to run from Route 2 to Route 249 south of Palmdale. It was deleted before it could be constructed in 1965. State Route 206 State Route 206 was deleted from the state highway system, with varying reasons. Between July 1, 1964 and the time it was turned back to local authorities, Route 206 ran from Highland Avenue, formerly State Route 30, in San Bernardino along North E Street, Kendall Drive, and Palm Avenue to the Barstow Freeway, Interstate 215, in Verdemont. Prior to July 1, 1964, Route 206 was California Legislative Route 191 and was signed as Business U. S. 66. State Route 209 State Route 209 connected Point Loma with the interchange of I-5 and I-8 in San Diego. The route began at the Cabrillo National Monument and passed through Fort Rosecrans and the neighborhood of Point Loma via Catalina Boulevard, Canon Street, and Rosecrans Street. This route was deleted in 2003. State Route 214 State Route 214 was deleted in 1998. Between July 1, 1964 and the time it was turned back to local authorities, Route 214 ran between Lakewood Boulevard, then State Route 19, in Long Beach and the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5, in Anaheim. Route 214 traversed Carson Street in Los Angeles County (between Route 19 and the Los Angeles/Orange County Line). It continued into Orange County on Lincoln Avenue (between the Los Angeles/Orange County Line and Route 5). Prior to July 1, 1964, Route 214 was a segment of California Legislative Route 178. Between 1962 and July 1, 1964 it was signed as US 91. Before 1962, it was signed as both US 91 and State Route 18. State Route 228 State Route 228 was to be a short bypass west of Brawley. The road as defined by the California State Legislature in the 1964 state highway renumbering would have begun at SR 86 southwest of Brawley and ended west of Brawley. However, this was also included in the 1935 definition of Route 26, which continued north to Los Angeles and south to Calexico, along the approximate route of US 99. The route was deleted in 1998; by that time, no highway had been constructed along this route. State Route 231 State Route 231 was a designation for a state highway from SR 86 to SR 195 near Mecca. In 1935, the route was added to the state highway system. Two years later, the route was given the designation of Route 204. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the route was renumbered as SR 231. The Division of Highways proposed deleting this state highway in 1971, The routing was removed from the state highway system in 1972. SR 231 was later used for what is now SR 261 and SR 241. State Route 250 State Route 250 was the designation for State College Boulevard from I-5 in Orange to SR 91. The routing was only a temporary routing and the route ceased to be a state highway when the adjacent SR 57 freeway was completed.Former State Route 250 State Route 252 State Route 252 was to connect I-5 to I-805, and provide almost direct access from I-805 to I-5, near the southern terminus of SR 15. The route would have run parallel to, and approximately halfway between, the current alignment of SR 94 and SR 54. SR 252 was defined as Route 283 in 1959, and was redesignated as Route 252 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The California Highway Commission reviewed a proposal for the route in 1965. It was known as the El Toyon Freeway, and plans were to use it to balance the congestion between I-5 and I-805. By 1973, there was opposition based on concerns that it would split the community; according to an engineer from Caltrans, it was \\"a white man's freeway vs. a black community.\\" If the freeway was not constructed, the federal government would stand to lose $10 million. The Comprehensive Planning Organization in 1974 proposed widening arterial streets nearby as an alternative, even though the construction would affect 240 buildings. Meanwhile, relocation of 280 households and the start of demolition had taken place. In 1977, a local vote took place to determine what to construct or if SR 252 should be constructed; however, $4.4 million had already been spent to construct the 43rd street interchange with I-805. Alternate plans included a city street and constructing a below-grade freeway. By 1980, the California Transportation Commission had canceled plans to construct SR 252, due to the residential opposition. The city of National City made attempts to have the plans reinstated in 1986 to reduce congestion within city limits. The city of San Diego opposed the idea of constructing an additional freeway, while the county supported it. The state told Caltrans to sell the land to the city of San Diego, though National City expressed interest in purchasing it, even though there would be San Diego city permits needed to construct a freeway on it. National City then sued the state, but agreed to drop the suit in exchange for $10 million in traffic improvements on behalf of the city of San Diego. In 1993, the San Diego Association of Governments and Caltrans planned to have SR 252, along with SR 157 and SR 171, officially removed; the abandoned land was to be used for residential purposes. The state legislature removed from the state highway system in 1994. The only portion constructed is the ramps to and from I-805 at 43rd Street, in southern San Diego, approximately long; the ramps were completed in 1975. State Route 256 State Route 256 was a proposed highway from I-80 to State Route 65 north of Roseville, and was deleted in 1994. This was originally signed as part of Route 65, and of US 99E through Roseville. Route 256, a once adopted route for a west-side bypass of Roseville was rescinded by the California Transportation Commission in 1976 because of cost and difficulty of crossing the Southern Pacific Switchyard. State Route 274 State Route 274 ran along Balboa Avenue, entirely within the city of San Diego. The highway started at I-5 in Pacific Beach before continuing east into Kearny Mesa and intersecting I-805 and SR 163 before ending at I-15. Balboa Avenue still exists as a road between I-5 and I-15. Balboa Avenue was constructed in Pacific Beach by 1956, and east into Clairemont by 1961. The Legislature designated the route as from I-5 to SR 103 in 1965, changing SR 103 to SR 15 in 1969. Between 1969 and 1970, Balboa Avenue was completed from I-5 to SR 163 and signed as SR 274. Completion of the route to I-15 was in place by 1982. A sinkhole long and deep opened at the I-15 interchange in 1998 after a storm across the region. The route was deleted from state laws in 1999, and given to the city of San Diego in 2001. State Route 285 State Route 285 was defined in 1970 as Route 70 on West Street in Portola northwesterly to the north city limits, then to Lake Davis via Humbug Canyon, and then easterly to Grizzly Reservoir via the south shore of the lake. This was deleted in 1998 because of problems with the right of way and drainage. The route was never constructed. According to the Caltrans photolog, the old alignment for Route 285 essentially is exactly the same as existing West Street (in Portola) and Lake Davis Road northeast to Grizzly Road just northeast of the Big Grizzly Creek. State Route 480 State Route 480 was a state highway in San Francisco consisting of the elevated double-decker Embarcadero Freeway (also known as the Embarcadero Skyway), the partly elevated Doyle Drive approach to the Golden Gate Bridge and the proposed and unbuilt section in between. The unbuilt section from Doyle Drive to Van Ness Avenue was to have been called the Golden Gate Freeway and the Embarcadero Freeway as originally planned would have extended from Van Ness along the north side of Bay Street and then along the Embarcadero to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The Embarcadero Freeway, which had only been constructed from Broadway along the Embarcadero to the Bay Bridge, was universally panned with many locals comparing it to the Alaskan Way Viaduct in Seattle. Demands to demolish the freeway were proposed as early as 1963 with the San Francisco Board of Supervisors supporting the proposal. The freeway was eventually demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and Doyle Drive is now part of U.S. Route 101. SR 480 was Interstate 480, an auxiliary route of the Interstate Highway System, from 1955 to 1965. The entire route was deleted in 1991, approximately two years after the earthquake.

Formally, the decision problem is given by :.  Complexity  The problem can be shown to be in NL, as a non-deterministic Turing machine can guess the next node of the path, while the only information which has to be stored is the total length of the path and which node is currently under consideration. The algorithm terminates if either the target node t is reached, or the length of the path so far exceeds n, the number of nodes in the graph. The complement of st-connectivity, known as st-non-connectivity, is also in the class NL, since NL = coNL by the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem. In particular, the problem of st-connectivity is actually NL-complete, that is, every problem in the class NL is reducible to connectivity under a log-space reduction. This remains true for the stronger case of first-order reductions . The log-space reduction from any language in NL to STCON proceeds as follows: Consider the non- deterministic log-space Turing machine M that accepts a language in NL. Since there is only logarithmic space on the work tape, all possible states of the Turing machine (where a state is the state of the internal finite state machine, the position of the head and the contents of the work tape) are polynomially many. Map all possible states of the deterministic log-space machine to vertices of a graph, and put an edge between u and v if the state v can be reached from u within one step of the non-deterministic machine. Now the problem of whether the machine accepts is the same as the problem of whether there exists a path from the start state to the accepting state. Savitch's theorem guarantees that the algorithm can be simulated in O(log2 n) deterministic space. The same problem for undirected graphs is called undirected s-t connectivity and was shown to be L-complete by Omer Reingold. This research won him the 2005 Grace Murray Hopper Award. Undirected st- connectivity was previously known to be complete for the class SL, so Reingold's work showed that SL is the same class as L. On alternating graphs, the problem is P-complete .

The series The book series is about a young boy named Charlie Ashanti who can speak the language of cats, after accidentally swapping blood with a leopard cub. Charlie is on the run on a floating circus, with six lions in tow, aiming to return them to the wild of Morocco and to rescue his parents who have been kidnapped by a sinister corporation known as the Corporacy The first book is known simply as Lionboy. The sequel, Lionboy: The Chase, continues the story of Charlie and the lions, with most of the story set in Venice. It was published by Puffin in the summer of 2004. The final instalment of the trilogy, Lionboy: The Truth, concludes the story and was published in January 2006. Setting The series is set at an unspecified time in the Earth's future. The world in the books mostly resembles the modern day world, with a few key differences. These differences are hinted at rather than explained outright. Firstly, most of the world's oil has been used up, and petrol cars are now only used by the very rich, elite and powerful. Aeroplanes are not flown at all – sea travel is once again the dominant form of overseas travel. The world (at least, the parts seen in Charlie's journey) now seems to run efficiently on solar and wind power. The major world superpower in the series is known only as the Empire, and the text contains hints that this is actually the United States. Europe seems to be under this Empire's control. The world has been changed by global warming and other environmental influences; the most notable example is the ruin of Venice, which is now half sunken under rising waters, and otherwise decayed from pollution. The Corporacy, a pharmaceutical megacorporation, is a major economic power that has \\"Gated Communities\\" all over the world. Plot summaries =Lionboy= The cover for Lionboy Charlie is a young child who is able to speak to cats (and all felines) due to an incident involving a leopard cub's blood when he was a baby. He lives in London with his parents, Dr. Aneba Ashanti and Professor Magdalen Start, both of whom are scientists working on a cure for asthma and other allergies caused by contact with the family Felidae, or referred in the books as allergenies. His parents, as a result of their scientific discoveries, are kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company known mysteriously as the Corporacy. Charlie, closely avoiding being kidnapped himself, sets out to find them and ends up on board Circe, a circus ship making its way to Paris. On board he befriends most of the circus performers as well as (using the ability) a pride of beautiful performing lions who seek the boy's help to escape their cruel trainer, Maccomo. Meanwhile, the vicious criminal Rafi Sadler, who is employed by the Corporacy, is hot on his heels, going to any lengths to get his hands on Charlie. The circus ship arrives in Paris and Charlie escapes with the lions. They make their way to Gare d'Austerlitz where they hide on the Orient Express which is destined for Venice, the place Charlie's parents are rumoured to have been taken. While traversing from the Circe to the train station, Charlie and the lions meet a strange and mysterious lion-like creature. Larger, stronger and older but not as lively as the lions, a prehistoric ancestor of lions, a Smilodon fatalis finds his way into their party. The book ends with Charlie and the lions being discovered by the train's most regal passenger, the King of Bulgaria, who surprisingly offers to help Charlie with his quest. The cover for Lionboy: The Chase =Lionboy: The Chase= Charlie and the lions reach Venice and seek refuge at the Palazzo Bulgaria, the King himself travelling onwards and leaving the runaways in the trust of his right-hand man Edward. Edward however has other plans for the lions than letting them journey onwards. He keeps them along with Charlie prisoner and plans to present him to the corrupt ruler of Venice, the Doge. However this plan is foiled with the help of local cats and a conspiracy of gondoliers. Venice is liberated from the Doge's rule, and so Charlie journeys from Venice by boat, taking the lions back to their home in Essaouira, Morocco but leaving the Smilodon fatalis with a trusted gondolier in Venice. Narrowly escaping drowning, they arrive there and are met by a few surprises: Maccomo, the cruel lion trainer, who is looking for revenge on Charlie for stealing his lions; and his parents, who have escaped the clutches of the Corporacy and have come to find him. =Lionboy: The Truth= The cover for Lionboy: The Truth After only a few blissful days reunited with his parents, Charlie is captured by the revenge- seeking Maccomo, who puts him on a ship and takes him (along with Rafi) to the Corporacy headquarters on the island of San Antonio near Haiti. His parents are in hot pursuit, and following them is his parents, Claudio, King Boris, the Young Lion and Elsina. Charlie, due to his cat blood, is immune to the tainted, brainwashing air of the island, and with the help of a multilingual chameleon named Ninu, and the cat Sergei, he single-handedly puts a stop to the Corporacy's deeds and rescues the brainwashed employees and prisoners of the island.

This is, as opposed to, real evidence, testimony, or other forms of evidence used at trial. Examples Examples of demonstrative evidence include photos, x-rays, videotapes, movies, sound recordings, diagrams, forensic animation, maps, drawings, graphs, animation, simulations, and models. It is useful for assisting a finder of fact (fact-finder) in establishing context among the facts presented in a case. To be admissible, a demonstrative exhibit must “fairly and accurately” represent the real object at the relevant time. See Federal Rules of Evidence 901, 902, and 1001-1004 for an example from United States law. Other examples of demonstrative evidence include case specific medical exhibits, colorized diagnostic films, general anatomy and surgery exhibits. These forms of demonstrative evidence are commonly used as a personal injury lawyer resource. Demonstrative evidence with dramatic impact can maximize the value of a case by effectively depicting catastrophic/traumatic injuries, complex surgical procedures, surgical mistakes or summarize injuries suffered by an individual. These examples of demonstrative evidence are used for settlement conferences, arbitration, mediation, medical expert depositions and trial presentations. Demonstrative evidence is an effective aid in infringement litigation. Whether prosecuting an infringer or defending a patent, originally filled patent drawings which are a part of most patent applications, can play an imperative part in any upcoming litigation. If the original patent drawings are not complete, accurate and exact, then the resulting output for litigation graphics is unreliable and could even hurt a case. There are many ways to convert patent drawings into effective litigation graphics. Here are a few ways: A patent drawing can be made visually transparent and overplayed onto an opposing image to show likeness or differences. Color can be applied to elements of the original patent drawings and the same colors on similar elements of an opposing images to highlight likeness. A front view from the application can be placed alongside a front view of the opposing invention with additions outlined in color to emphasize differences A process flow chart from a utility patent application can be used alongside a flow chart of the opposing party with an insert between the two to indicate differences or similarities in process. Callout information on a patent drawing can clarify key elements of the invention and emphasize important features. Drawings from a patent application can be used in PowerPoint to create a simple tutorial using animation with color arrows, overlays and voice over to explain an invention. Original patent drawings can be used as a basis to create complex 3D animations. Operation, technical procedures, incompatibilities between inventions and moving parts of an invention can be clearly presented. Furthermore, animations can indicate time, motion or speed, compare alternative theories or simplify highly complex data. There are endless ways to manipulate original patent drawings to make compelling litigation graphics, each circumstance unique based on the setting, the invention, the desired outcome and budget. Using original patent drawings as a starting point can save cost of having to start from scratch. In many patent lawsuits filed, a substantial amount is spent on demonstrative evidence. WIPO Magazine stated, “according to a recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers over 5,000 patent lawsuits – an all-time record – were filed, each costing on average around US$2.8 million.” Those numbers are for 2012; it is unlikely that costs have come down. See the following link for WIPO article “What Place for Patent Drawings” IP Litigation: What Place for Patent Drawings? History Before photographs and other demonstrative evidence, lawyers relied on purely testimonial or substantive evidence. Melvin Belli and Earl Rogers helped change that by introducing more demonstrative evidence. Scientific evidence emerged in the 1960s. Mechanics of use In American jurisprudence, demonstrative evidence, like any other kind of evidence must be relevant. At this point the proponent of the demonstrative evidence can either try to get the evidence admitted into the official record of the case or can choose to use the evidence as merely a prop. If the proponent of the evidence wants to have the evidence included in the official record of the case, the proponent will first ask for the evidence to be marked by the court for identification purposes. After the evidence is marked for identification, the proponent of the demonstrative evidence must lay a foundation. It is at this time that the relevancy of the demonstrative evidence is usually challenged. Laying of a foundation explains how the demonstrative evidence relates to the facts of the case and establishes the evidence's authenticity. Once the foundation is laid, the proponent may ask to officially move the piece of evidence into the record where it is marked as a full exhibit. If the evidence is marked as a full exhibit the jury may refer to the evidence during deliberations and in most jurisdictions the jury may examine the evidence during deliberations. If the evidence is not marked as a full exhibit, the jury cannot do these things. As a matter of courtesy, the proponent of the demonstrative evidence generally shows the piece of evidence to the opposing party before marking it for identification purposes. In criminal cases certain kinds of demonstrative evidence are subject to mandatory disclosure under the case law governing discovery. See Brady v. Maryland.

The building is located on University Avenue, Glasgow, opposite the University of Glasgow. Building The building was designed by the architect Thomas Lennox Watson and built between 1883 and 1884 for the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland (\\"U.P.\\"), which joined with the Free Church of Scotland to become the United Free Church of Scotland in 1900. The exterior of church is notable for its magnificent neoclassical portico, complete with a colonnade of Corinthian columns in the style of an ancient Graecian temple. This neoclassical architecture was much favoured by United Presbyterian Church, in contrast to the Gothic Revival favoured by most other churches in the Victorian era.\\"Wellington Church, Glasgow\\", Scotland's Churches Trust. Retrieved on 1 August 2020. History The church's congregation was founded in 1792 as an \\"Anti-Burgher\\" congregation, which in 1820 became part of the United Secession Church (and in turn U.P. from 1847).\\"Wellington Church\\", What's on Glasgow. Retrieved on 1 August 2020. In 1828, they opened their own church building in Wellington Street near the centre of Glasgow. The congregation had outgrown this by the 1880s, so the church commissioned a new building at the junction of Southpark Avenue and University Avenue on Gilmorehill, opposite the university which had moved from the city centre the previous decade. Given that the United Presbyterian Church had no parish boundaries it was not uncommon for U.P. congregations to relocate. Current work The front of the Wellington Church The church ministers to the surrounding Hillhead community, and to the staff and student body of the university which has grown to surround the church's site. Although the university maintains its own chapel, the University of Glasgow Memorial Chapel, in the nearby Gilbert-Scott buildings, the Wellington hosts both religious and secular university events. The church also hosts musical concerts, and recitals played on its original Forster and Andrews pipe organ. The congregation is actively involved in social justice issues, such as the Make Poverty History campaign in 2005. The congregation had previously won Scotland's eco-congregation award in November 2004. In 2006, it was proposed that Wellington Church merged with the neighbouring congregation of Lansdowne Church. This was due to declining attendances at both congregations and the cost of maintaining the Lansdowne building. However, in June 2007 the congregation of Lansdowne rejected the proposed vote on the union at that time. Wellington Church is within the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow. Ministry The currently vacant charge was led by Reverend Dr David Sinclair until September 2017. He was inducted to the charge by the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow on 29 May 2008. He was formerly Secretary of the Church and Society Council of the Church of Scotland, based in the Church of Scotland Offices in Edinburgh. Sinclair is the Presbytery of Glasgow's Moderator for the Session 2013/2014. The previous minister was the Reverend Leith Fisher, who retired in October 2006 and died on 13 March 2009, following a road collision on the Isle of Arran. His memorial service held at Wellington was attended by over 1,000 people and was conducted by the Right Reverend David Lunan, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Former ministers include: the Very Rev Ernest David Jarvis DD, minister of Wellington 1929 to 1958 and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1954; and Reverend Maxwell Craig who served between 1973 and 1989.

His courtesy name is Yunong (雨農). Born Dai Chunfeng (Tai Chun-feng; 戴春風) in Bao'an, Jiangshan of Qing Dynasty China's Zhejiang province, he studied at the Whampoa Military Academy, where Chiang Kai-shek served as Chief Commandant, and later became head of Chiang's Military Intelligence Service. Early life Born Dai Chunfeng, he was just four years old when his father died, leaving his mother to raise him. By age six, Dai was enrolled in a private academy to begin studying Chinese Classics, and later graduated valedictorian from Wenxi County Elementary School. His mother could not afford to send him to university, so at 16 he was forced to leave home and find his own way in the world. With neither secure income nor any guidance, he began living the rough life of the streets of Shanghai. Dai Chunfeng soon became a skilled gambler who could often be found in one of Shanghai's many casinos, trying to win enough money to make ends meet. It was in a Shanghai casino that he met Du Yuesheng, head of the criminal Green Gang. Through Du Yuesheng he later met Chiang Kai-shek. It is unclear when Chiang and Dai first met, but it was likely around 1921. He later lost all of his money and was forced to return home to Bao'an. In 1927, Dai met his elementary school friend Mao Renfeng who suggested that he enroll in the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou, where Chiang was then Superintendent-Commandant. Dai took the suggestion, obtained a letter of recommendation from Du Yuesheng and set off for Guangzhou. Dai enlisted in the 1st Student Regiment of the sixth class of the KMT Officer Training Academy. It was then that he changed his name to Dai Li which in Chinese refers to an assassin's hooded veil, reflecting the clandestine nature of his planned future career. Chiang soon made him a student informant within the academy to spy on Communist activities, where he played an instrumental role in the Zhongshan Warship Incident. Role in the KMT As the Chief of the Kuomintang (KMT) Army secret service in China, Dai Li helped to develop China's modern intelligence organization in 1928, \\"Clandestine Investigation Section\\" directly under the Northern Expeditionary Army's Headquarters with the aims of an early victory of the war to quell the nationwide unrest and minimize the loss of life by making the most of military and political intelligence. By the end of the Second Sino-Japanese war, this small section would evolve to the very complex and controversial Investigation and Statistics Bureau of Chinese National Military Council, which is the predecessor of the Military Intelligence Bureau under the Chief of General Staff, ROC Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan. The benign title of The Investigation and Statistics Bureau belied the true nature of its secret police work, making Dai one of the most powerful men in China. Dai was also the head of the Blue Shirts Society, an ultranationalist organization that did security and intelligence work for Chiang. In 1930s and 1940s, his agents from Military-Statistics Bureau were very successful at penetrating the Chinese Communist Party and Imperial Japanese puppet organizations. Dai worked with the United States during World War II and was taught new methods of espionage, and his guerrilla force grew to 70,000 men. In return for this partnership, he made available maps of the South China coast, intelligence on Japanese maneuvers and a safe haven for downed Allied aircrew. After the signing of the SACO Treaty in 1942, Dai was placed as head of Sino-American intelligence activities. While he avoided public entertainments and remained a mysterious figure to his countrymen, Dai was privately known for his wild drinking parties. Death Dai died in a plane crash on March 17, 1946, possibly arranged by his counterpart and rival in the Communist Party of China (CPC), the notorious CPC security and intelligence chief Kang Sheng. There are rumours it was arranged by the American Office of Strategic Services, because it happened aboard an American plane.

He was a co-recipient of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on olefin metathesis. He is a co- founder of Materia, a university spin-off startup to produce catalysts.  Early life and education  AIC Gold Medal recipient, 2010 Grubbs was born on February 27, 1942, on a farm in Marshall County, Kentucky, midway between Possum Trot and Calvert City. His parents were Howard and Faye Grubbs. Faye was a schoolteacher. After serving in World War II, the family moved to Paducah, Kentucky, where Howard trained as a diesel mechanic, and Robert attended Paducah Tilghman High School. At the University of Florida, Grubbs initially intended to study agriculture. However, he was convinced by professor Merle A. Battiste to switch to organic chemistry. Working with Battiste, he became interested in how chemical reactions occur. He received his B.S. in 1963 and M.S. in 1965 from the University of Florida. Next, Grubbs attended Columbia University, where he worked with Ronald Breslow on the antiaromaticity of cyclobutadiene. This work aroused his interest in metals and organometallic compounds which contain carbon-metal bonds. Grubbs received his PhD in 1968.  Career  Grubbs worked with James Collman at Stanford University as a National Institutes of Health fellow during 1968–1969. With Collman, he began to systematically investigate catalytic processes in organometallic chemistry, a relatively new area of research. In 1969, Grubbs was appointed to the faculty of Michigan State University, where he began his work on olefin metathesis. Harold Hart, Gerasimos J. Karabatsos, Gene LeGoff, Don Farnum, Bill Reusch and Pete Wagner served as his early mentors at MSU. Grubbs was an assistant professor from 1969 to 1973, and an associate professor from 1973 to 1978. He received a Sloan Fellowship for 1974–1976. In 1975, he went to the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in Mülheim, Germany on a fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In 1978 Grubbs moved to California Institute of Technology as a professor of chemistry. As of 1990 he became the Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry. Grubbs's main research interests are in organometallic chemistry and synthetic chemistry, particularly the development of novel catalysts for olefin metathesis. In olefin metathesis, a catalyst is used to break the bonds of carbon molecules, which can then re-form to create chemical bonds in new ways, producing new compounds with unique properties. The basic technique can be used for creation of polymers, pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals and has broad applications in areas including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, agriculture, and plastics. Grubbs has been instrumental in developing a family of ruthenium catalysts including Grubbs catalyst for olefin metathesis. He has studied olefin transformations for ring-closing metathesis (RCM), cross- metathesis reaction (CMR), and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with cyclic olefins such as norbornene. He has also contributed to the development of \\"living polymerization\\", in which the termination ability of a polymerization reaction is removed. The polymer will continue to replicate until a quenching agent is presented. The Grubbs group successfully polymerized the 7-oxo norbornene derivative using ruthenium trichloride, osmium trichloride as well as tungsten alkylidenes. They identified a Ru(II) carbene as an effective metal center and in 1992 published the first well- defined, ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalyst, (PPh3)2Cl2Ru=CHCH=CPh2. :Metathesis Grubbs 1992 The corresponding tricyclohexylphosphine complex (PCy3)2Cl2Ru=CHCH=CPh2 was also shown to be active. This work culminated in the now commercially available 1st generation Grubbs catalyst in 1995. Second generation catalysts have been developed as well. Ruthenium is stable in air and has higher selectivity and lower reactivity than molybdenum, the most promising of the previously discovered catalysts. In addition, Grubbs took a green chemistry approach to catalysis that reduced the potential to create hazardous waste. Grubbs catalyst has become a standard for general metathesis applications in ordinary laboratories. By controlling the catalyst used, it becomes possible to synthesize polymers with specialized structures and functional capabilities, including cyclic olefins, alternating copolymers, and multiblock copolymers. Using catalysts allows chemists to speed up chemical transformations and to lower the cost of what were previously complicated multi-step industrial processes. = Commercial activities = Both first and second generation Grubbs catalysts are commercially available from Materia, a startup company that Grubbs co-founded with Mike Giardello in Pasadena, California in 1998. Materia has been able to obtain exclusive rights to manufacture many of the known olefin catalysts. Under Giardello, Materia was able to sell their catalysts through Sigma-Aldrichs chemicals catalogue. Sigma-Aldrich became their exclusive worldwide provider. In 2008, Materia partnered with Cargill to form Elevance Renewable Sciences to produce specialty chemicals from renewable oils, including biofuels. Grubbs is a member of the Reliance Innovation Council formed by Reliance Industries Limited, India. Grubbs is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.  Awards and honors  Grubbs received the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Richard R. Schrock and Yves Chauvin, for his work in the field of olefin metathesis.

It was formed in 1992. The HLC's research was integral to the war crimes prosecutions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), particularly the \\"smoking gun\\" video linking Serbian military forces to the Srebrenica massacres. She has won numerous international awards for her human rights work (Amnesty International's Objective Observer Award, among others). She is a figure of controversy in Serbia where she was the subject of a defamation lawsuit by former President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić. Humanitarian Law Center Kandić is a sociologist by training. In 1992, she founded and became executive director of the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade, a human rights organization which has been praised for its systematic and impartial investigations of human rights abuses. Since the start of the Yugoslav wars in the early 1990s, she has documented and protested against war crimes committed between 1991 and 1999, including torture, rape, and murder. According to Businessweek, her work drew \\"the hatred of fellow Serbs and military leaders throughout the region -- and won the admiration of human-rights defenders worldwide\\". Throughout the war in Kosovo, she travelled back and forth across Serbia, providing information to the outside world about human rights violations being committed by police and paramilitary groups. She was one of the few Serbian rights activists to continue investigating the Kosovo crisis after the murder of Slavko Curuvija and to collaborate with ethnic Albanian activists. She and her staff were anonymously threatened for their work, and their office was spray-painted with a swastika and the message \\"NATO's spies\\". In December 1999, HLC lawyer Teki Bokshi was arrested in Kosovo by Serbian police, drawing protest from the HLC and a United Nations envoy. The evidence she gathered was later used in the preparation of indictments by the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. She provided a video of Bosnian Serb paramilitaries executing six Bosnian Muslim prisoners near Trnovo, used as proof of Serbia's role in the Srebrenica massacre, in which 7,500 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed. Kandić had located a copy of the tape, originally made by the paramilitaries themselves, from a man in Šid, who provided it only on the condition that she not air it until he had safely left the country. Excerpts from the tape were later shown on Serbian and Bosnian television. The Guardian described the tape as the \\"smoking gun\\"--\\"the final, incontrovertible proof of Serbia's part in the Srebrenica massacres\\"--while The New York Times called the airing of the tape on Serbian television a \\"watershed\\" moment for the country. Kandić criticized a 2007 judgement in Serbia as the presiding judge, had described the crime as “killing six men of Muslim origin”, whom \\"it was not clear came from Srebrenica\\". Kandić said \\"This judgment sends a very dangerous message,” further stating, \\"Both from a moral and factual point of the view, this is not justice\\". In 2003, she criticized the deployment of Serbian troops to Afghanistan, stating that the army should first be reformed and war crimes trials concluded. In 2004, she contributed to the exposure of US journalist Jack Kelley, a USA Today reporter discovered to have fabricated several important stories, when she disputed his account of using her as a source for a July 1999 front-page story on a typed Yugoslav Army order to \\"cleanse\\" a village in Kosovo. 2003 Republic Square incident In 2003, Kandić attended a protest rally held on the International Day of the Disappeared in Republic Square in Belgrade, against the lack of information about Kosovo Serbs missing since the 1999 conflict. She was confronted and repeatedly insulted by other attendees who called her a \\"traitor\\". After Nikola Popović, an elderly Serb refugee from Kosovo confronted her directly, she slapped him in the face and yelled back at him. The policemen present took her aside and requested her documents, which she protested saying they should instead request them from other persons. The police later charged her for violent behaviour in public and disobeying the police orders. The organization representing Serb refugees also filed charges. She justified her actions by asserting she had to \\"defend [myself] from Serbian patriotism\\". In July 2005, the First Municipal Court in Belgrade dismissed the private lawsuit against Kandić. The attendees called the presiding judge a \\"Serb traitor\\". Defamation lawsuit Kandić was originally found guilty on charges of defamation in February 2009 after her 2006 statements that Tomislav Nikolić killed elderly people in Croatia during the war. She was fined 200,000 Serbian dinars (around 2,000 EUR at the time). International human rights organization Front Line condemned the charges as \\"part of a campaign aimed at stigmatizing human right defenders and human rights organisations operating in Serbia, portraying them as enemies of the country\\", and Human Rights Watch named the case as an example of criminal libel laws used as \\"a tool to silence human rights criticisms.\\" The charges were later overturned on appeal by the Belgrade District Court. International recognition Kandić is a recipient of more than 20 international, regional and national human rights awards. In 2000 she won the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, awarded jointly by Amnesty International, Diakonia, Human Rights Watch, HURIDOCS, International Alert, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Federation for Human Rights, the International Service for Human Rights and the World Organization Against Torture, granted annually to an individual or an organization who has displayed exceptional courage in combating human rights violations. She was listed by Time as one of its 36 European Heroes in 2003, and again featured as a Time European Hero in 2006. In 2004, the People in Need Foundation awarded Kandić and the HLC its Homo Homini Award, presented by Václav Havel. In 2005 she was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Sarajevo, and Slobodna Bosna magazine named her Person of the Year in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 2006, Kandić was named to the Order of Danica Hrvatska, awarded by the President of Croatia to individuals who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of moral values. In April 2018, she was honoured for her work with the \\"Hartën e Artë të Kosovës\\" (\\"Golden Map of Kosovo\\") award by Ramush Haradinaj, at the time Prime Minister of Kosovo and former leader of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).

A vertex s can reach a vertex t (and t is reachable from s) if there exists a sequence of adjacent vertices (i.e. a path) which starts with s and ends with t. In an undirected graph, reachability between all pairs of vertices can be determined by identifying the connected components of the graph. Any pair of vertices in such a graph can reach each other if and only if they belong to the same connected component; therefore, in such a graph, reachability is symmetric (s reaches t iff t reaches s). The connected components of an undirected graph can be identified in linear time. The remainder of this article focuses on the more difficult problem of determining pairwise reachability in a directed graph (which, incidentally, need not be symmetric).  Definition  For a directed graph G = (V, E), with vertex set V and edge set E, the reachability relation of G is the transitive closure of E, which is to say the set of all ordered pairs (s,t) of vertices in V for which there exists a sequence of vertices v_0 = s, v_1, v_2, ..., v_k = t such that the edge (v_{i-1},v_i) is in E for all 1 leq i leq k.. If G is acyclic, then its reachability relation is a partial order; any partial order may be defined in this way, for instance as the reachability relation of its transitive reduction.. A noteworthy consequence of this is that since partial orders are anti-symmetric, if s can reach t, then we know that t cannot reach s. Intuitively, if we could travel from s to t and back to s, then G would contain a cycle, contradicting that it is acyclic. If G is directed but not acyclic (i.e. it contains at least one cycle), then its reachability relation will correspond to a preorder instead of a partial order..  Algorithms  Algorithms for determining reachability fall into two classes: those that require preprocessing and those that do not. If you have only one (or a few) queries to make, it may be more efficient to forgo the use of more complex data structures and compute the reachability of the desired pair directly. This can be accomplished in linear time using algorithms such as breadth first search or iterative deepening depth-first search.. If you will be making many queries, then a more sophisticated method may be used; the exact choice of method depends on the nature of the graph being analysed. In exchange for preprocessing time and some extra storage space, we can create a data structure which can then answer reachability queries on any pair of vertices in as low as O(1) time. Three different algorithms and data structures for three different, increasingly specialized situations are outlined below. = Floyd-Warshall Algorithm = The Floyd–Warshall algorithm. can be used to compute the transitive closure of any directed graph, which gives rise to the reachability relation as in the definition, above. The algorithm requires O(V^3) time and O(V^2) space in the worst case. This algorithm is not solely interested in reachability as it also computes the shortest path distance between all pairs of vertices. For graphs containing negative cycles, shortest paths may be undefined, but reachability between pairs can still be noted. = Thorup's Algorithm = For planar digraphs, a much faster method is available, as described by Mikkel Thorup in 2004.. This method can answer reachability queries on a planar graph in O(1) time after spending O(n log{n}) preprocessing time to create a data structure of O(n log{n}) size. This algorithm can also supply approximate shortest path distances, as well as route information. The overall approach is to associate with each vertex a relatively small set of so-called separator paths such that any path from a vertex v to any other vertex w must go through at least one of the separators associated with v or w. An outline of the reachability related sections follows. Given a graph G, the algorithm begins by organizing the vertices into layers starting from an arbitrary vertex v_0. The layers are built in alternating steps by first considering all vertices reachable from the previous step (starting with just v_0) and then all vertices which reach to the previous step until all vertices have been assigned to a layer. By construction of the layers, every vertex appears at most two layers, and every directed path, or dipath, in G is contained within two adjacent layers L_i and L_{i+1}. Let k be the last layer created, that is, the lowest value for k such that bigcup_{i=0}^{k} L_i = V. The graph is then re-expressed as a series of digraphs G_0, G_1, ldots, G_{k-1} where each G_i = r_i cup L_i cup L_{i+1} and where r_i is the contraction of all previous levels L_0 ldots L_{i-1} into a single vertex. Because every dipath appears in at most two consecutive layers, and because each G_i is formed by two consecutive layers, every dipath in G appears in its entirety in at least one G_i (and no more than 2 consecutive such graphs) For each G_i, three separators are identified which, when removed, break the graph into three components which each contain at most 1/2 the vertices of the original. As G_i is built from two layers of opposed dipaths, each separator may consist of up to 2 dipaths, for a total of up to 6 dipaths over all of the separators. Let S be this set of dipaths. The proof that such separators can always be found is related to the Planar Separator Theorem of Lipton and Tarjan, and these separators can be located in linear time. For each Q in S, the directed nature of Q provides for a natural indexing of its vertices from the start to the end of the path. For each vertex v in G_i, we locate the first vertex in Q reachable by v, and the last vertex in Q that reaches to v. That is, we are looking at how early into Q we can get from v, and how far we can stay in Q and still get back to v. This information is stored with each v. Then for any pair of vertices u and w, u can reach w via Q if u connects to Q earlier than w connects from Q. Every vertex is labelled as above for each step of the recursion which builds G_0 ldots, G_k. As this recursion has logarithmic depth, a total of O(log{n}) extra information is stored per vertex. From this point, a logarithmic time query for reachability is as simple as looking over each pair of labels for a common, suitable Q. The original paper then works to tune the query time down to O(1). In summarizing the analysis of this method, first consider that the layering approach partitions the vertices so that each vertex is considered only O(1) times. The separator phase of the algorithm breaks the graph into components which are at most 1/2 the size of the original graph, resulting in a logarithmic recursion depth. At each level of the recursion, only linear work is needed to identify the separators as well as the connections possible between vertices. The overall result is O(n log n) preprocessing time with only O(log{n}) additional information stored for each vertex. = Kameda's Algorithm = A suitable digraph for Kameda's method with s and t added. The same graph as above after Kameda's algorithm has run, showing the DFS labels for each vertex An even faster method for pre-processing, due to T. Kameda in 1975,. can be used if the graph is planar, acyclic, and also exhibits the following additional properties: all 0-indegree and all 0-outdegree vertices appear on the same face (often assumed to be the outer face), and it is possible to partition the boundary of that face into two parts such that all 0-indegree vertices appear on one part, and all 0-outdegree vertices appear on the other (i.e. the two types of vertices do not alternate). If G exhibits these properties, then we can preprocess the graph in only O(n) time, and store only O(log{n}) extra bits per vertex, answering reachability queries for any pair of vertices in O(1) time with a simple comparison. Preprocessing performs the following steps. We add a new vertex s which has an edge to each 0-indegree vertex, and another new vertex t with edges from each 0-outdegree vertex. Note that the properties of G allow us to do so while maintaining planarity, that is, there will still be no edge crossings after these additions. For each vertex we store the list of adjacencies (out-edges) in order of the planarity of the graph (for example, clockwise with respect to the graph's embedding). We then initialize a counter i = n + 1 and begin a Depth-First Traversal from s. During this traversal, the adjacency list of each vertex is visited from left-to-right as needed. As vertices are popped from the traversal's stack, they are labelled with the value i, and i is then decremented. Note that t is always labelled with the value n+1 and s is always labelled with 0. The depth-first traversal is then repeated, but this time the adjacency list of each vertex is visited from right-to-left. When completed, s and t, and their incident edges, are removed. Each remaining vertex stores a 2-dimensional label with values from 1 to n. Given two vertices u and v, and their labels L(u) = (a_1, a_2) and L(v) =(b_1, b_2), we say that L(u) < L(v) if and only if a_1 leq b_1, a_2 leq b_2, and there exists at least one component a_1 or a_2 which is strictly less than b_1 or b_2, respectively. The main result of this method then states that v is reachable from u if and only if L(u) < L(v), which is easily calculated in O(1) time.  Related problems  A related problem is to solve reachability queries with some number k of vertex failures. For example: \\"Can vertex u still reach vertex v even though vertices s_1, s_2, ..., s_k have failed and can no longer be used?\\" A similar problem may consider edge failures rather than vertex failures, or a mix of the two. The breadth-first search technique works just as well on such queries, but constructing an efficient oracle is more challenging... Another problem related to reachability queries is in quickly recalculating changes to reachability relationships when some portion of the graph is changed. For example, this is a relevant concern to garbage collection which needs to balance the reclamation of memory (so that it may be reallocated) with the performance concerns of the running application.

The church was designed by the architect Francesco Borromini and it was his first independent commission. It is an iconic masterpiece of Baroque architecture, built as part of a complex of monastic buildings on the Quirinal Hill for the Spanish Trinitarians, an order dedicated to the freeing of Christian slaves. He received the commission in 1634, under the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, whose palace was across the road. However, this financial backing did not last and subsequently the building project suffered various financial difficulties.Blunt, Anthony. Borromini, 1979, Belknap Harvard, p. 53 It is one of at least three churches in Rome dedicated to San Carlo, including San Carlo ai Catinari and San Carlo al Corso.  History  In the 1630s, the monks of the Trinitarian Order were searching for an architect to build a church connecting their monastery. Francesco Boromini even offered to complete the commission free of charge in order to start his career as a solo architect. The monastic buildings and the cloister were completed first after which construction of the church took place during the period 1638-1641 and in 1646 it was dedicated to Saint Charles Borromeo. Although the idea for the serpentine facade must have been conceived fairly early on, probably in the mid-1630s, it was only constructed towards the end of Borromini's life and the upper part was not completed until after the architect's death.Blunt, A. 1979, p. 71, 76-80. Blunt considers whether Borromini at San Carlo or Pietro da Cortona with his design for Santi Luca e Martina was the first to plan a curved church facade and decides in favour of Cortona, p. 76 The site for the new church and its monastery was at the south-west corner of the \\"Quattro Fontane\\" which refers to the four corner fountains set on the oblique at the intersection of two roads, the Strada Pia and the Strada Felice. Bernini's oval church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale would later be built further along the Strada Pia. The inscriptions found in San Carlo, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume III (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1873), pp. 261-273 [in Italian and Latin].  Architect  Francesco Borromini (1599–1667) was an average working-class man who worked as an Italian architect. He quickly built a name for himself by taking on small commissions for churches around Europe. Borromini became known as a father of baroque architecture after completing his first solo project – San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. Borromini first found his interest in architecture through his travels to Milan, in which his father sent him to observe stonecutting. His interest lead to years of architectural and sculptural training which caused a growing debt to his father. Borromini fled to Rome to avoid his debt and found himself becoming an architectural star pupil under renowned Italian architect Carlo Maderno. Together, Maderno and Borromini worked side by side on numerous architectural giants, St. Peter’s Basilica, Palazzo Barberini, Sant’Andrea della Valle, until Maderno died and Borromini found himself working as a solo baroque architect. Design =Exterior= Section of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, ca. 1730 The concave-convex facade of San Carlo undulates in a non-classic way. Tall corinthian columns stand on plinths and bear the main entablatures; these define the main framework of two storeys and the tripartite bay division. Between the columns, smaller columns with their entablatures weave behind the main columns and in turn they frame niches, windows, a variety of sculptures as well as the main door, the central oval aedicule of the upper order and the oval framed medallion borne aloft by angels. The medallion once contained a 1677 fresco by a Pietro Giarguzzi of the Holy Trinity. Above the main entrance, cherubim herms frame the central figure of Saint Charles Borromeo by Antonio Raggi and to either side are statues of St. John of Matha and St. Felix of Valois, the founders of the Trinitarian Order. The plan and section show the layout of the cramped and difficult site; the church is on the corner with the cloister next to it and both face onto the Via Pia. The monastic buildings straddle the site, beyond which Borromini intended to design a garden. The church itself is only 66 feet wide and 39 feet long – deeming a non-classic plan vital. Before the baroque style became the style of choice in the seventeenth century, the renaissance was full of buildings with very rectangular shapes. The baroque style introduced curves and ovals, which Borromini combined with cubic elements to create a floor plan that fit the awkward site’s requirements. Not only did the curves suit the site, but it also enhanced the baroque design by creating movement, playing with lighting and shadows, adding ornament, and extra drama. =Interior= Floor plan of the Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. The rise of baroque architecture prompted Borromini to bring his sculpture background to life by creating unexpected combinations of curves and rectangular forms in his work. Many baroque architects during the seventeenth century focused their design basis to fall in line with proportions of the human body. Borromini was non-classical in the sense that he based his designs on geometric figures. The church interior is both extraordinary and complex. The three principal parts can be identified vertically as the lower order at ground level, the transition zone of the pendentives and the oval coffered dome with its oval lantern.Blunt, A. Borromini, 1979, p.52-84 In the lower part of the church, the main altar is on the same longitudinal axis as the door and there are two altars on the cross axis. One altar is dedicated to Saint Michael de Sanctis, the other dedicated to Saint John Baptist of the Conception. Between these, and arranged in groups of four, sixteen columns carry a broad and continuous entablature. The arrangement seems to refer to a cross plan but all the altars are visible as the two central columns in each arrangement of four are placed on the oblique with respect to the axial ordering of the space. This creates an undulating movement effect which is enhanced by the variation in treatment of the bays between the columns with niches, mouldings, and doors. Architectural historians have described how the bay structure of this lower order can have different rhythmic readingsWittkower, Rudolf. Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750, Pelican History of Art, 1958, p.131-5 and the underlying geometric rationale for this complex ground plan, as well as discussing the symbolism of the church and the distinctive architectural drawings of Borromini.Steinberg, Leo. San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. A Study in Multiple Form and Architectural Symbolism, New York, 1977 The dome with its intricate geometrical pattern The pendentives are part of the transition area where the undulating almost cross-like form of the lower order is reconciled with the oval opening to the dome. The arches which spring from the diagonally placed columns of the lower wall order to frame the altars and entrance, rise to meet the oval entablature and so define the space of the pendentives in which roundels are set. The oval entablature to the dome has a 'crown' of foliage and frames a view of deep set interlocking coffering of octagons, crosses and hexagons which diminish in size the higher they rise. Light floods in from windows in the lower dome that are hidden by the oval opening and from windows in the side of the lantern. In a hierarchical structuring of light, the illuminated lantern with its symbol of the Holy Trinity is the most brightly lit, the coffering of the dome is thrown into sharp and deep relief and light gradually filters downwards to the darker lower body of the church. Flanking the apse of the main altar is a pair of identical doorways. The right door leads to the convent through which the crypts below may be accessed. The door on the left leads to an external chapel known as Capella Barberini which contains a shrine to blessed Elisabeth Canori Mora. =Crypt= The crypt below follows the size and form of the church and has a low pierced vault. Chapels open off this space, including an octagonal chapel on the south-east side where Borromini intended to be buried. It has a major and minor niche arrangement and an undulating cornice. =Cloister= Next to the church is the cloister, which is a two-story arrangement. The space is longer along the entrance axis than it is wide, but the rectangular ordering is interrupted by cutting the corners so it could also be understood as an elongated octagon. Further complexity is introduced by the variation in the spacing of the twelve columns carrying alternating round and flat headed openings, the curvature of the corners, and the inventive balustrade. Geometrical themes are reinforced by the central octagonal wellhead on an oval base and the octagonal capitals of the upper columns. Behind the church, the refectory, now the sacristy, has rounded corners, a pierced vault, windows in the garden façade and later alterations.

Except for the last several miles on its southern end the Mountain View Corridor is numerically designated as State Route 85 (SR-85) in the Utah state highway system. The entire Mountain View Corridor will be maintained by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT). Route description Mountain View Corridor is an arterial road with a distance of one to two miles parallel on the west to Bangerter Highway (SR-154), built to meet the demand of the growing cities in Salt Lake County. It will start at SR-73 in Saratoga Springs and run north to a junction with a spur of the roadway that runs east to Interstate 15 in Lehi. The spur, designated as 2100 North, also carries the SR-85 designation. From the junction at 2100 North, the Mountain View Corridor will continue north through Camp Williams into Salt Lake County, running west of Redwood Road (SR-68). Just north of Camp Williams it will curve northwest until it reaches Porter Rockwell Boulevard in Bluffdale. Porter Rockwell Boulevard will be a non-freeway spur of the Mountain View Corridor that runs east to connect with Redwood Road (SR-68) at about 16000 South. It will also serve as the initial access to the southern end of the Mountain View Corridor until portions south of this point are completed. From Porter Rockwell Boulevard it will continue northwest to 13400 South at about 4800 West in Riverton and then continue north again to 12600 South. From 12600 South it will curve northwest again, crossing Daybreak Parkway (at about 11700 South) in Daybreak—a neighborhood of South Jordan—to the Old Bingham Highway (at about 10200 South) in West Jordan, and then curve slightly back to the northeast until reaches 9000 South just west of 5400 West. From 9000 South it will head north, crossing over 8200 South, until 7800 South where it will curve northwest to 7000 South at about 6400 West. From 7000 South it will proceed north, crossing 6200 South, to 5400 South (SR-173). From 5400 South it will curve northeast again until it reaches 4100 South in West Valley City at about 5700 West and then head north again, crossing 3500 South (SR-171), to a junction with SR-201. From SR-201 it will continue north to California Avenue in Salt Lake City. From California Avenue it will finally curve northwest once again before ending at a junction with Interstate 80 at about 6100 West in Salt Lake City (a few miles west of the Salt Lake City International Airport). Construction =Phases= Plans call for three phases of construction. Upon final completion, the freeway will have five lanes in each direction, including a high-occupancy/toll (HOT) lane. Some sections will also include two-lane frontage roads on both sides of the freeway. Phase One will including constructing either the outside lanes or two one-way frontage roads for each section of the entire length of the Mountain View Corridor, but not all at the same time. Phase One construction will be completed on the various sections as the need exists and funding permits. For the \\"outside lanes\\" sections the two outside lanes of the freeway will be built in each direction. At each future interchange the roadways will curve out to the edges of the right of way where future off-ramps of the freeway will be, creating two one-way intersections. For the \\"frontage roads\\" sections, two one-way frontage roads will be on either side of the planned freeway lanes. Two one-way intersections will also be created at each future interchange, just as they will be for the \\"outside lanes\\" sections, except that the future off-ramps and on-ramps will connect with the frontage roads prior to and after the interchanges, respectively. (Such frontage roads and interchanges are often referred to as Texas style.) Frontage roads will be built between Old Bingham Highway and Porter Rockwell Boulevard, as well as the 2100 North spur. The remaining sections will have the outside lanes built in Phase One. Phase Two is where the actual freeway is constructed as needs require and funding permits. By building either the outside lanes or frontage roads in the unique manner that will be done Phase One preserves space in the middle to build overpasses and the actual freeway lanes themselves where only the frontage roads were constructed. Also, having been built the way they were, there will be minimal traffic interruption while Phase Two is completed. Phase Three will widen the freeway from two lanes to five in each direction (with one of those lanes provisioned as an HOT lane), again as the need exists and funding permits. In mid-2010, Utah County planners discussed future plans for a freeway in Utah County from Lehi to Santaquin along the west side of SR-68 west of Utah Lake. It has been speculated that this could become part of the Mountain View Corridor project.Utah County planners seek to avoid Lehi- like traffic woes. Deseret Morning News. May 11, 2010. The first sections of Mountain View Corridor opened for traffic in a design of separated two lane carriageways with signal controlled at-grade split intersections, to be upgraded later. =Progress= The environmental impact statement for the freeway was completed in November 2008, leaving funding for the highway as the biggest remaining obstacle. Previous proposals included raising the state fuel tax or tolling the new road as a public/private partnership, an issue that became highly contentious. Ultimately, the state legislature decided to issue bonds to fund the freeway, thereby committing future tax receipts to pay for it. The first phase of construction began in mid-2010 and finished by December 15, 2012. Construction on the spur that runs along 2100 North in Lehi's street grid and will connect the eventual freeway with Interstate 15 began in late 2010. This spur, which initially travels as far west as Redwood Road (SR-68), opened September 24, 2011. During Phase Two, this spur will be extended further west to the future freeway. Construction on two miles of frontage roads in Herriman between Rosecrest Drive and 12600 South has been completed and this portion opened for traffic on June 2, 2012. An additional seven miles of frontage road is nearly complete and is anticipated to be open for use on October 13, 2012. These additional portions are will extend the usable roadway from Porter Rockwell Boulevard in Bluffdale north to the Old Bingham Highway in West Jordan. Six more miles of frontage road further north are also anticipated to be completed in late 2012. By the end of 2012 a total of fifteen miles of Phase One frontage roads, extending from Porter Rockwell Boulevard north to 5400 South in West Valley City, will be open for use, as well as associated bike lanes and trails. In 2016 the access to 5400 South (SR-173) completed, and construction continued northbound.Google Earth ans Street View, retrieved March 2017 While no specific time table has been given by UDOT for the remainder of the overall project, it is anticipated to be fully completed by 2030. = Current progress = Mountain View Corridor is currently entirely in Stage 1 of the construction plan. The entire roadway that is currently built extends from Redwood Road (SR-68) to 4100 South. The section between 5400 South and 4100 South opened on November 18, 2017 at 3:00 pm. Opening celebrations included a fun run, an ugly sweater competition, and ceremonies where the Mayor of West Valley City spoke. Mountain View Corridor is expected to be completed up to SR-201 to be completed by the end of 2020. It is currently unknown as to when it will be completed up to Interstate 80.

Around 745, he left Ireland, intending to visit the Holy Land; but, like many of his countrymen, who seemed to have adopted this practice as a work of piety, he settled in France. Vergilius served as abbot of Aghaboe, bishop of Ossory and later, bishop of Salzburg. He was called \\"the Apostle of Carinthia\\" and \\"the geometer\\". Biography He originated from a noble family of Ireland, where his name was Feirgil or Fearghal, and is said to have been a descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Feirgil was probably educated at the Iona monastery.Clancy, Thomas Owen and Márkus, Gilbert. Iona: The Earliest Poetry of a Celtic Monastery, p.17, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University, 1995 In Annals of the Four Masters and Annals of Ulster, he is referenced as the Abbot of Aghaboe, in County Laois, where he was known as \\"the Geometer\\" because of his knowledge of geography. Around 745, he left Ireland, intending to visit the Holy Land; but, like many of his countrymen, who seemed to have adopted this practice as a work of piety, he settled down in France, where he was received with great favour by Pippin the Younger, who was then Mayor of the Palace under Childeric III of Franconia. He was an adviser to Pippin. He probably used a copy of the \\"Collectio canonum Hibernensis\\" (an Irish collection of canon law) to advise him to receive royal unction in 751, to assist his recognition as king Pippin III after the deposition of Childeric.Enright, M.J. Iona, Tara, and Soissons: The Origin of the Royal Anointing Ritual. (Arbeiten zur Fruhmittelalterforschung, 17). Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1985. pp. ix, 198 After spending two years at Cressy, near Compiègne, he went to Bavaria, at the invitation of Duke Odilo, where he founded the monastery of Chiemsee, and within a year or two, was made Abbot of St. Peter's at Salzburg. Among his notable accomplishments was the conversion of the Alpine Slavs to Christianity; he also sent missionaries to Hungary. As Abbot of St Peter's, he came into collision with Saint Boniface. A priest having, through ignorance, conferred the Sacrament of Baptism using, in place of the correct formula, the words \\"Baptizo te in nomine patria et filia et spiritu sancta\\" (instead of \\"Baptizo te in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti\\"), Vergilius held that the sacrament had been validly conferred, but Boniface complained to Pope Zachary. The latter, however, decided in favour of Vergilius. Later on, Boniface accused Vergilius of spreading discord between himself and Duke Odilo of Bavaria and of teaching a doctrine in regard to men descended not from Adam, which was \\"contrary to the Scriptures\\". Pope Zachary's decision in this case was that \\"if it shall be clearly established that he professes belief in another world and other people existing beneath the earth, or in [another] sun and moon there, thou art to hold a council, and deprive him of his sacerdotal rank, and expel him from the church.\\"MGH, Epistolae Selectae, 1, 80, pp. 178–9 ; translation in M. L. W. Laistner, Thought and Letters in Western Europe, pp. 184–5.; see also Jaffe, Biblioth. rerum germ., III, 191 The treatise in which Vergilius expounded his doctrine no longer exists. Two things, however, are certain: first, that there was involved the problem of original sin and the universality of redemption; secondly, that Vergilius succeeded in freeing himself from the charge of teaching a doctrine contrary to Scripture. It is likely that Boniface, already biased against Vergilius because of the preceding case, misunderstood him, taking it for granted, perhaps, that if there are antipodes, the \\"other race of men\\" are not descendants of Adam and were not redeemed by Christ. After the martyrdom of Boniface, Vergilius was made Bishop of Salzburg in 766 or 767 and laboured successfully for the upbuilding of his diocese as well as for the spread of Christianity in neighbouring heathen countries, especially in Carinthia. He died in Salzburg on 27 November 784. Veneration right He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1233, he was formally canonized by Pope Gregory IX. His doctrine that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his belief in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient Irish voyagers gave of their journeys. This, at least, is the opinion of Rettberg (Kirchengesch. Deutschlands, II, 236). =Dedications= Aside from being personally associated with Aghaboe Abbey and Salzburg Cathedral, a number of parishes around the world are dedicated to him, mostly being founded by small populations of far-flung Irish Catholics, like himself. There is a church still bearing his name dedicated to him in Broad Channel, Queens, New York, which recently merged with another parish in 2008. A parish in Morris Plains, New Jersey, is also dedicated to him. Fittingly for this Irish geometer who predicted antipodes, several churches in the Southern Hemisphere are dedicated to him. St Virgil's College in Hobart, Tasmania is named for him. There was a St. Virgilius Church in Balclutha, New Zealand designed by Francis Petre which moved and was re-dedicated to Mary MacKillop, however the new chapel remains dedicated to St. Virgilius. =Art and culture= A large marble statue of him stands outside the doors of Salzburg Cathedral. A stained-glass window of St. Virgil contemplating the antipodes sits in St John's College, University of Sydney. Sebastian Stief painted him amidst Salzburg's construction, Alec Szolomiak painted him, as did Jan Toorop, and Dhiraja McBryde. Yalumba, Australia's oldest family-owned winery, produces a Viognier named Virgilius.

He allowed three runs and seven hits in five innings of work, exiting the game with the score tied, 3–3.

Then, in the 1975 World Series, Cleveland worked in three games, two in relief. He was the starting pitcher in Game 5 against the Cincinnati Reds on October 16 at Riverfront Stadium. He gave up seven hits and five runs, all earned, and was charged with the 6–2 loss. He also came out of the bullpen in the top of the ninth inning of Game 7 at Fenway Park and got the final out, but the Reds had already forged ahead against Cleveland's predecessor on the mound, Jim Burton, and secured a 4–3 win and the world championship. The 1975 campaign afforded Cleveland his only postseason appearances; in his four games and 11 innings pitched, he compiled a 0–1 win–loss record and a 6.17 earned run average. He ended his regular-season MLB career with 105 wins and 106 defeats, with a 3.73 ERA, 930 strikeouts, 57 complete games (in 203 career starting assignments), 12 shutouts and 25 saves.

Their first pizzeria was opened in Adelphi, Maryland, in 1955 on University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193) in Adelphi Shopping Center near the University of Maryland, College Park (). The first franchise was granted to the Fireside Restaurant in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, in 1979. Fireside Restaurant no longer exists. There are now over 100 restaurants in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, and Washington, D.C.. Overview Ledo Pizza is rectangular in shape and is known for its very thin crust, sweet sauce, thick pepperoni (one per slice; optional), and smoked provolone cheese, often using the tagline \\"Ledo Pizza is square, because we don't cut corners.\\" Pizzas from Ledo Pizza The real reason Ledo pizza is square was the relative abundance of rectangular pans in the 1950s, when round pizza pans were new. When the pizza industry embraced the round pan to cut costs, as the shape gave the illusion of more product when it was actually less, Ledo stayed true to its roots and it became their trademark. Most of its restaurants do not offer delivery options, focusing rather in carry out and dine-in options. When eating at the restaurant, customers are served by a waiter or waitress, rather than receiving the food over the counter. Also, Ledo offers many menu items, such as hamburgers, pasta, its own beer line (Ledo Lager), and more, in addition to specialty pizza types usually offered by pizza chains such as Pizza Hut or Papa John's. The restaurant chain has been called by several names, including Ledo Pizza and Ledo Pizza and Pasta. The original location in Adelphi, Maryland, at the Adelphi Shopping Center was established in 1955. The name on its website is \\"Tommy Marcos' Ledo Restaurant\\". The original location is not listed in the restaurant finder maintained by The Ledo Pizza System website. The omission from the chain's website may be related to a legal dispute between the Ledo chain and the Marcos family. Ledo Pizza was named among the best pizzas in America on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The same pizza based on the same family recipe is served at TJ Elliots in Bowie, Maryland, along with many of the other signature Italian-American and family dishes. TJ Elliots is owned and operated by Tommy and Jimmy Marcos. In September 2009, the Marcos family announced that the original Ledo's restaurant would be moving a few miles from its original location to downtown College Park. The original location closed in July 2010, and the new location opened for business on August 27, 2010. Standalone franchise in Washington, D.C. Recognition In 2019, Ledo Pizza was rated #31 on the Pizza Today Top 100 Companies list with 2018 gross sales of $120,000,000 from its 106 restaurants.

Biography Born in San Mateo, California, Saunders attended Polytechnic High School in San Francisco. In his first band in high school was singer Johnny Mathis. He served in the Air Force from 1953 to 1957. He worked as musical director of the Billy Williams Revue and served in a similar capacity in Oscar Brown Jr.'s off-Broadway show, Big Time Buck White. He gained notice in the 1970s when he began collaborating with Jerry Garcia, with whom he had begun playing in 1971 at a small Fillmore Street nightclub called The Matrix. He sat in with the Grateful Dead, and co-founded the Saunders/Garcia Band which produced three albums, and which became the Legion of Mary with the addition of Martin Fierro (sax) in 1974. It disbanded the following year, but he and Garcia continued to collaborate in the band Reconstruction during 1979, collaborating with Ed Neumeister (trombone), Gaylord Birch (drums) and John Kahn (bass). He led his own band as Merl Saunders and Friends, playing live dates with Garcia, as well as Mike Bloomfield, David Grisman, Michael Hinton, Tom Fogerty, Vassar Clements, Kenneth Nash, John Kahn and Sheila E.. He also collaborated with Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart in the band High Noon. Merl Saunders took the lead in reintroducing Jerry Garcia to his guitar after Jerry suffered a diabetic coma in the summer of 1986. In 1990 he released the world music and New Age classic album Blues From the Rainforest, a collaboration with Jerry Garcia and Muruga Booker. This led to the release of a video which chronicled Saunders' journey to the Amazon, and the subsequent albums Fiesta Amazonica, It's in the Air, and Save the Planet so We'll Have Someplace to Boogie. One of the songs from Blues From the Rainforest was used as part of the soundtrack for the TV series Baywatch. Saunders continued to perform with the Rainforest Band for the next ten years. Saunders worked with musicians Paul Pena, Bonnie Raitt, Phish, Widespread Panic, Miles Davis, and B. B. King. He also recorded with the Dinosaurs, a \\"supergroup\\" of first-generation Bay Area rock musicians. He had his own record label, Sumertone Records (named for his children Susan, Merl Jr., and Tony), and had also recorded on Fantasy Records, Galaxy Records and Relix Records as well as the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia labels. He worked with the Grateful Dead on the theme music for the 1985 TV show The New Twilight Zone. As musical director he completed 2 1/2 season of the show . He also worked on the TV series Nash Bridges, and worked on several soundtracks for movies, including Fritz the Cat and Steelyard Blues. He was production co- ordinator for the Grammy Awards for two years, and for the Grammy's Greatest Moments TV special. He also supplied the music for the computer animation video Headcandy: Sidney's Psychedelic Adventure. He worked with several charitable organizations such as the Seva Foundation, the Rex Foundation, the Rainforest Action Network, and the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, and headlined the Haight Street Music Fair for 24 consecutive years. He has been granted a Doctorate of Music by Unity College, in Unity, Maine. In 2002, Saunders suffered from a stroke that paralyzed one side of his body and curtailed his musical career, and he died in San Francisco, California, on the morning of October 24, 2008, after fighting infections as a result of complications related to the stroke. He was survived by his two sons, Tony Saunders (bassist) and Merl Saunders Jr. (a former senior executive director of National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences), and his daughter Susan Mora. In December 2008, TMZ reported the estate of Merl Saunders had filed a lawsuit against the estate of Jerry Garcia, disputing royalties for a 2004 live album. Saunders' estate claimed they were not aware of the album's release and that they had equal rights to the royalties. The case was later settled amicably. Tributes * On Saturday, February 14, 2009, a tribute to Merl Saunders' life and musical career was held at the Great American Music Hall. It featured actor/director Max Gail and Wavy Gravy as M.C.s, and many past musical collaborators including Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, Tony Saunders, David Grisman, Michael Hinton, Melvin Seals, Michael Warren, Larry Vann,Tonedog, Misa Malone, and Bill Vitt among others. * A re-launch of the Rainforest Band as a tribute to Merl Saunders took place at the 29th Starwood Festival on July 25, 2009, the site of their last performance, featuring his son Tony Saunders, Michael Hinton, Misa Malone and other members of the Rainforest Band and other Saunders’ projects.

Originally called Men's Hall when it was constructed in 1935, the hall is named after Arthur I. Boreman, the first governor of the state of West Virginia. With the addition of a new annex building in 1963, Boreman Hall is now actually two separate buildings. Boreman Hall North, the newer of the two, is currently an all female dorm, the only single sex residence hall on the campus. Boreman Hall South, the older E-shaped building, is coed and includes 10 entrances. These entrances are connected to the others by way of bathrooms and ground floor lounges. Construction on the original building started in 1934 and opened in time for the 1935 school year. With its opening, the university finally had a place for its men to live on campus. Before the hall was completed, men had to either live in fraternity houses, boarding houses, or with a local Morgantown family. Funding for the building came in part from the federal Works Progress Administration which was a New Deal agency set up during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The building cost $625,000 at the time which is roughly equal to about $8.5 million in 2003 US Dollars. During World War II, the hall was used as an Army Air Force barracks. Prominent dents in the doors of Boreman hall could still be seen as recently as 2017, remnants of Drill Instructors striking to doors sharply with rifle butts in order to awaken soldiers/airmen at early hours, especially new recruits. Directly across from the hall, where the current Student Union stands, there was a parade field and an armory that were used as training grounds. Residents of the hall were transported to the Morgantown airport, where they were trained by the US Air Force. Since the end of the war, the hall has been used strictly as a residence hall and continues to be used as such today. It has been renovated and remodeled over the years, but it has remained one of the main cornerstones of the West Virginia University community and has often been the building where new programs that have moved campus-wide have been instituted. The hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. References * Rubin, Scott B. The History of Boreman Hall South. Morgantown: Morgantown Printing and Binding, 2005.

It could be native to the West Indies, but its exact origin is unknown due to widespread cultivation. Common names for this species include poinciana, peacock flower, red bird of paradise, Mexican bird of paradise, dwarf poinciana, pride of Barbados, flos pavonis, and flamboyant-de-jardin. The Hawaiian name for this plant is ʻohai aliʻi.  Description  Variously named peacock flower or pride-of-Barbados -- Caesalpinia pulcherrima It is a shrub growing to 3 m tall. In climates with few to no frosts, this plant will grow larger and is semievergreen. In Hawaii this plant is evergreen and grows over 5 m tall. Grown in climates with light to moderate freezing, plant will die back to the ground depending on cold, but will rebound in mid- to late spring. This species is more sensitive to cold than others. The leaves are bipinnate, 20–40 cm long, bearing three to 10 pairs of pinnae, each with six to 10 pairs of leaflets 15–25 mm long and 10–15 mm broad. The flowers are borne in racemes up to 20 cm long, each flower with five yellow, orange, or red petals. The fruit is a pod 6–12 cm long. Taxonomy Poinciana pulcherrima is a synonym of Caesalpina pulcherrima.  Symbolism  Caesalpina pulcherrima is the national flower of the Caribbean island of Barbados, and is depicted on the upper left and right corners of the Queen Elizabeth II's personal Barbadian flag. Claire Waight Keller included pride of Barbados to represent the country in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country. Uses =Food= All seeds of Caesalpinia are poisonous. However, the seeds of some species are edible before they reach maturity (e.g. immature seeds of C. pulcherrima) or after treatment (e.g. C. bonduc after roasting). =Traditional medicine= Maria Sibylla Merian, a 17th-century artist, encountered this plant in the Dutch colony of Surinam. In her work, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium, Merian recorded that African slaves and native Indian populations used the flos pavonis or peacock flower as an abortifacient in their practice of traditional medicine. She wrote: > The Indians, who are not treated well by their Dutch masters, use the seeds > [of this plant] to abort their children, so that their children will not > become slaves like they are. The black slaves from Guinea and Angola have > demanded to be well treated, threatening to refuse to have children. They > told me this themselves. The leaves, flower, bark, and seeds of C. pulcherrima were also used by American Indians in traditional medicine as abortifacients and for suicide by enslaved peoples. The extract of shade-dried flowers has been shown to arrest the cell cycle, and cause the mitochondria to commit apoptosis and necroptosis. =Ornamental= C. pulcherrima is the most widely cultivated species in the genus Caesalpinia. It is a striking ornamental plant, widely grown in domestic and public gardens in warm climates with mild winters, and has a beautiful inflorescence in yellow, red, and orange. Its small size and the fact that it tolerates pruning well allows it to be planted in groups to form a hedgerow; it can be also used to attract hummingbirds.Frisch, J.D. & Frisch, C.D., Aves Brasileiras e Plantas que as atraem, São Paulo: Dalgas Ecotec, 2005, 398, In cultivation in the UK this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

The park features a deep scenic gorge with the restored watermill and a covered bridge at the bottom, accessible by a roadway that winds between large, room-sized boulders on the hillside. McConnells Mill State Park is along the Slippery Rock Creek just southwest of the intersection of US 422 and US 19. McConnells Mill State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History =McConnell's Mill= Daniel Kennedy opened a gristmill on Slippery Rock Creek in 1852. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1868 and was quickly rebuilt. Ownership of the mill was transferred to the park's namesake, Thomas McConnell in 1875. He replaced the waterwheel with water turbines and the grindstones with rolling mills. This made McConnell's Mill one of the first rolling mills in the country. The mill processed oats, corn, buckwheat and wheat until it was closed in 1928. Ownership of the land transferred from Thomas H. Hartman to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy in 1942. The conservancy then transferred the land to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1957 when McConnells Mill State Park was formally dedicated. =Covered bridge= View of the covered bridge in McConnells Mill State Park from a walkway near the mill itself. The McConnell's Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1874. It is a Howe truss bridge. One of two covered bridges in Lawrence County, it is owned by the county, but is located on state land at McConnells Mill State Park. The bridge is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Recreation =Hiking and rock climbing= There are several trails in the park, including a pair that lead to a waterfall (with an old limestone kiln next to it). The trail system is part of the North Country Trail, the nation' longest National Scenic Trail which runs from North Dakota to New England. There are two climbing/rappelling areas. Both are only recommended for \\"equipped and experienced climbers\\". The more difficult of the two is at Breakneck Bridge. *Alpha Pass Trail is a \\"moderate\\" hiking trail that is marked with blue blazes. The trail is part of the North Country Trail. The section in the park begins at the Alpha Pass scenic view. It then runs along the east bank of Slippery Rock Creek to the Old Mill. Hells Hollow Falls *Hells Hollow Trail is an \\"easy\\" hiking trail that begins at the Hells Hollow parking area and follows Hell Run to the restored lime kiln and on to Hells Hollow Falls. *Kildoo Trail is a \\"moderate\\" hiking trail loop. It begins and ends at the McConnells Mill Covered Bridge and follows the banks of Slippery Rock Creek. The western portion of the trail is marked with blue blazes and is also part of the North Country Trail. *Slippery Rock Gorge Trail is a \\"moderate\\" to \\"difficult\\" trail that is part of the North Country Trail in some places and is marked with blue blazes. The trail passes through several different geological areas. The first portion of the trail is in the upper end of Hell Run Valley. The trail then descends into Slippery Rock Gorge and onto an alluvial flood plain at the bottom of the gorge. From the flood plain, the trail ascends the gorge and descends once again before following the main creek bank to its terminus at Eckert Bridge. =Whitewater boating= Whitewater boating is very popular on this part of Slippery Rock Creek and it is rated a Class II-III, on the International Scale of River Difficulty, depending on water conditions. Boating usually begins at the U.S. Route 422 bridge at Rose Point, outside the park boundary and passes under Eckert Bridge within the park before ending at Harris Bridge. There is a portage at the dam at the Old Mill. It is illegal to \\"run\\" the dam. All boaters are required to wear life jackets that are approved by the United States Coast Guard. =Hunting and fishing= Fishing at the park Hunting is permitted in much of McConnells Mill State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, and rabbits. The hunting of groundhogs is not permitted at the park. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission assures that anglers will have plenty of chances to catch fish by stocking trout and bass in the waters of Slippery Rock Creek. Geology The bedrock at McConnells Mill State Park was formed over 300,000,000 years ago as layers of peat, mud and sand were compressed. This part of Pennsylvania was a coastal area at the time. The layers of bedrock were built into mountains as the continental plates shifted. The layers of bedrock had different strengths. Some of the layers eroded quickly and others eroded at a much slower pace. The various erosion rates account for the variety of geologic features at McConnells Mill State Park. The geology of the park was also heavily influenced by the glacial effects of the ice age: a large glacial lake (water that was held in place by a glacier), broke about 140,000 years ago. This break in the glacial dam caused a dramatic change in the flow of the water. The lake that had previously drained in a northward direction was now draining to the south. The drastic change in direction and very high volume of water flow created Slippery Rock Creek Gorge. Environment McConnells Mill State Park lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion.

The average annual snowfall at the park is about . The park is named for Blue Knob, the second highest mountain in Pennsylvania at . It is the location of Blue Knob All Seasons Resort, the ski slope in Pennsylvania with the highest elevation. Blue Knob State Park is just off Interstate 99 on Pennsylvania Route 869 west of Pavia. History The earliest settlers to the Blue Knob area were of German descent. They cleared and farmed the land soon after the American Revolution. They also built several distilleries, a lumber mill and gristmill. The logging boom that swept over most of the mountains and forests of Pennsylvania drastically altered the landscape surrounding Blue Knob State Park. The old-growth forests of hemlock were clear cut. The timber was hauled away on trains that climbed the steep hillsides. A railroad that followed Bobs Creek used six switchbacks to ascend the mountain. Another railroad used five switchbacks to climb the hills near Wallacks Branch. These railroad grades are still used today to gain access to State Gamelands. The train tracks have since been removed and replaced with hiking trails. The lumber industry abandoned the lands once all the salable timber had been harvested. They left behind a wasteland of dried out tree tops that were ignited by passing steam locomotives. The land was scarred by immense wild fires. The wildlife that had once thrived in the area was also gone due to over-hunting and deforestation. The efforts of the National Park Service are largely responsible for the reforestation of Blue Knob State Park. Blue Knob National Recreation Demonstration Area was opened by the park service in 1935. The park was built by the men of the Works Projects Administration and the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps with the cooperation of Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot. The WPA and CCC were established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression to provide work for the unemployed. Ownership of the park was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on September 26, 1945 and Blue Knob State Park was officially opened. left Geology The bedrock in the valleys of the park consists of the Upper Devonian Catskill Formation, consisting of sequences of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The mountains in the park are capped by the Mississippian Burgoon Sandstone, which is underlain by the transitional Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell Formation, consisting of crossbedded argillacious sandstone with some shale beds. Recreation A chair lift over a ski trail at Blue Knob Resort =The resort= Blue Knob All Seasons Resort is on Blue Knob the second highest mountain in Pennsylvania. The resort was opened on the site of a former military base. The resort includes 36 trails on slopes for skiing, snow boarding and tubing, a golf course, trails for mountain biking and cross- country skiing. It is open year-round. The lodge provides year-round accommodations with tennis courts and a swimming pool. =Swimming= There is a swimming pool at the park that is separate from the pool at the resort. It opens Memorial Day weekend and closes Labor Day weekend. The hours of operation are 11:00 am until 7:00 pm. Lifeguards are provided. =Picnics= There are three picnic areas at Blue Knob State Park with over 200 picnic tables. Mowery Hollow and Burnt House picnic areas are open year-round. Willow Springs picnic area opens the weekend before Memorial Day and closes the day after Thanksgiving. =Camping= Blue Knob State Park has a campground with 45 sites, 25 of which have connections to an electrical supply. 43 sites will accommodate tents or campers. Two of the sites are walk-in only. The campground has running water, a sanitary dump station, modern restrooms and a playground. A group of cabins, built and used by the CCC, is available for rent by large groups. The cabin area has a large dining hall and kitchen area and a showerhouse. =Hunting and fishing= Hunting is permitted on about of Blue Knob State Park. The most common game species are turkey, squirrels and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The park is next to Pennsylvania State Game Land 26. There are parking lots and trails at Blue Knob State Park for those interested parking at the state park and hiking into the gamelands. =Trails= Blue Knob contains a vast network of hiking trails that range from easy walks to difficult and challenging day hikes. The total network of trails is approximately 18 miles in length. Most of these trails are multiple use for hiking, cross country skiing, mountain biking, horseback riding and snowmobiling. Below is a brief description of each trail that can be found on the mountain. Mountain View Trail This trail is 5 miles in length and one of the more difficult on the mountain. It is marked with a double red blaze and the trailhead can be found on the Tower Road just below the summit. The Mountain View Trail begins at about the 3,000 ft. contour and begins by looping around a gentle grade on the upper portion of the mountain's east shoulder. This part of the mountain is marked by stunted and wind deformed trees, mainly scrub oak and striped maple. Also large slabs of the conglomerate rocks that form this mountain may be seen strewn about on these upper slopes. This trail passes two lookouts, the Pavia Overlook and the Queen Overlook before descending into the Beaverdam Creek drainage and the lowest portion of this trail at the 2,000 ft. contour. The trail then traverses the east face of the mountain to the Willow Springs picnic area before it begins its steep ascent on the west face of the mountain and back to the trailhead. Three Springs Trail This trail is 2 miles in length and follows an old roadbed. The trail is wide and good for snowmobiles and horseback riding. This trail can be accessed from the Mountain View Trail at about the 3,050 ft. contour and generally runs downslope before it bisects the east face, and ends at the 2,500 ft. contour where it junctions once again with the Mountain View Trail. Along its length you can see how the trail got its name by the number of springs that are used for supplying water to the villages below the mountain. Rock N' Ridge Trail This trail begins at the 1,550 ft. contour just above the gated entrance to the park headquarters. It is 2.8 miles in length and marked by an inverted blue \\"T\\". The trail is located on the west side of the mountain and begins by following a ridge that abuts the main dome of the mountain. On this trail you may see mountain laurel which is the Pennsylvania State Flower. When the mountain laurel blooms in June it makes for a very scenic hike. The trail eventually junctions into the Sawmill trail at the 2,400 ft. contour, before this however, the trail has a turnoff which will descend down the Pavia Run drainage and end at the Mowry Hollow Picnic Area. Sawmill Trail The Sawmill Trail crosses the west face of the mountain and is 3 miles in length marked by yellow blazes. This is another wide trail that follows an old roadbed and is conducive to snowmobiles and mountain biking. The trailheads are located at either end of the trail off the Knob Road or on State Route 403 on Ickes Hill. If you begin on Ickes Hill, you will begin ascending the southwest buttress of the mountain to the Willow Springs Picnic Area at the 2,250 ft. contour. From there you will navigate shortly on the Mountain View Trail before you again pick up the Sawmill Trail. The trail moves across the hollows of the mountain at approximately the 2,400 ft. contour before it ends at that north end of Chappell Field and the trail head on the Knob Road. This hike takes you through rich hardwoods and passes over mountain seeps which drain from the upper slopes of the mountain, it is one of the easier hikes in the park. Homestead Trail This 1.8 mile trail is a small loop marked by orange blazes. It is accessible from the Whysong Road or by a connector trail off the Sawmill Trail. The hike is on the lower portions of the mountain and only gains to the 2,100 ft. contour. The trail is easy and wide open and as its name suggests, marks the site of an old settlers' house. Hiking along this pathway affords good opportunities for viewing wildlife. Chappell's Field Trail The Chappell's Field Trail is accessible at points on the Knob Road and campground areas. The trail is located on one of the main ridges that are found on the west side of the mountain. On the top of this ridge, which is over 2,400 ft., Chapell's Field holds one of the best views in the park as it looks up at the main summit of Blue Knob and down on the valley below. The trail encircles the top of this ridge and is 2.5 miles in length, a loop marked by inverted orange \\"V\\" blazes. Crist Ridge Trail The 1.9 mile orange blazed trail connects to the Chappell's Field Trail at the 2,250 ft. contour and winds its way down the ridge ending on the Knob Road. This trail had large areas of blowdowns on it following the wind events in September 2004. Since then the trail has been cleared and is a good trail for mountain biking and cross country skiing. In the winter with the foliage down, views of Blue Knob Mountain can be seen through the trees. Lost Turkey Trail This is the longest and most difficult trail at 26 miles long. The trail begins on 3,034 foot Herman Point and is marked by red blazes. The trail crosses over both public and private lands as it eventually ends in neighboring Somerset County. To begin this hike you must proceed up the Tower Road and pass by the gated road which leads to Herman Point and the transmitter towers on its summit. Just behind the fenced in towers, you can see the trail which proceeds down the steep face of the mountain into the Rhodes Run drainage. From here the trail follows Ciana Run before crossing Hogback ridge, then beginning its steep ascent up Forks Ridge and the Allegheny Front beyond. Once on top of the Allegheny Plateau it winds its way through high elevation forests and mountain bogs. Proper footwear is recommended for this hike as it is steep in some areas and stream crossings are required along its length. Connector Trails There are several connector trails that make up the remaining mileage on Blue Knob's trails system. They are double blue blazed markings and vary in length and difficulty. Bobs Creek is stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in co-operation with the Pavia Sportsmen Club Inc. There is also a population of native brook trout in Bobs Creek and its tributaries.

Founded in 1873, the DBA is a voluntary professional association of 10,000+ lawyers. It is dedicated to the continuing education of its members, as well as community programs. For years, the Dallas Bar Association headquarters were housed in the offices of the then-current president. In 1937, headquarters were established in a small space under the stairs of the Old Red Courthouse. Ten years later, the DBA was the state’s first bar association to incorporate. Incorporators envisioned the Association someday being housed in its own building. The DBA has offered members the unique opportunity of meeting, dining, conversing and learning together in its own headquarters since 1955. In that year, the DBA opened its offices, dining room and meeting facilities on the lobby floor of the Adolphus Hotel. In 1979, the Association moved into the restored home of the late Col. A.H. Belo, founder of The Dallas Morning News. After Col.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978 and was named in 1969 to the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team. A native of Superior, Wisconsin, Leemans played college football for Oregon's freshman team in 1932 and for George Washington from 1933 to 1935. He was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 1936 NFL Draft and played eight years for the Giants from 1936 to 1943. He led the National Football League as a rookie with 830 rushing yards and was selected as a first-team All-Pro in 1936 and 1939. He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl in 1938 and 1941 and helped lead the Giants to the 1938 NFL Championship and the 1939 and 1941 NFL Championship Games. After his playing career ended, Leemans worked briefly as a backfield coach for the Giants and at George Washington. He also operated a laundry and dry cleaning business and a duckpin bowling alley. Early years Leemans was born in 1912 in Superior, Wisconsin. His father Joseph Leemans (1887-1979) immigrated from Belgium in 1909 and worked as hoister for the Pittsburg Coal Co. on the coal dock in Superior.Draft Registration Card for Joseph Leemans dated June 5, 1917.

Leemans attended East High School in Superior. In his 1979 speech upon being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Leemans recalled growing up in Superior: \\"I was a kid who used to work the iron ore boats on vacation from high school. I also worked as a fireman shoveling coal. But I was of hardy, Belgian stock and that early hard work helped me as a football player. I have achieved everything I ever wanted. I am a happy man.\\" Football career =College= In 1932, Leemans enrolled at the University of Oregon where he was a member of the freshman football team.The Oregana (University of Oregon yearbook), 1933, pp. 187, 254. He then transferred to George Washington University where he was the star of the George Washington Colonials football team from 1933 to 1935. In his three years at George Washington, he rushed for 2,382 yards on 490 carries for an average of 4.86 yards per carry. He also passed for 966 yards and returned 84 punts for 984 yards, an average of 11.7 yards per return. =New York Giants= Leemans was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round (18th overall pick) of the 1936 NFL Draft. Wellington Mara, son of Giants owner Tim Mara, saw Leemans play for George Washington and recommended to his father that the Giants sign him. Mara later said, \\"If I'm remembered for nothing else, I'd like to be remembered for discovering Tuffy Leemans.\\" In his first NFL season, Leemans played at the fullback position for the Giants and led the NFL with 830 rushing yards and an average of 69.2 rushing yards per game. He also impressed with his defensive play at the safety position. He was the only rookie to be honored by the NFL as a first-team player on the 1936 All-Pro Team. After the season ended, Leemans reported that he found it easier to make long gains in the NFL rather than college, crediting better blocking in the professional ranks. Following rumors that he intended to retire from professional football after one season, Leemans signed a contract in August 1937 to return to the Giants. During the 1937, Leemans did not have the same level of success as in 1937. Hank Soar took over as the Giants' leading rusher in 1937, and Leemans gained only 429 rushing yards, roughly half his total from the prior year. Despite the reduced offensive output, Leemans continued to garner credit for his overall play and was selected by the NFL and the New York Daily News as a second-team player on the 1937 All-Pro Team. Leemans also played professional basketball during the off-season, joining the Heurich Brewers in Washington, D.C., after the 1937 NFL season. Leemans continued to be one of the NFL's leading players, receiving either first- or second-team All-Pro honors every year from 1936 through 1942. He received first-team honors in 1936 and 1939 and second-team honors in each of the remaining years. He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl in 1938 and 1941. He ranked second in the NFL in rushing yardage in 1938 with 463 yards and third in 1940 with 474 yards. He also helped lead the Giants to the 1938 NFL Championship as well as the 1939 and 1941 NFL Championship Games. On December 7, 1941, the Giants celebrated \\"Tuffy Leemans Day,\\" presenting him with a silver tray and $1,500 in defense bonds. The radio broadcast of the game on WOR was interrupted with an announcement of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and an urgent announcement was made at the Polo Grounds asking William J. Donovan (wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services) to call Operator 19 in Washington. However, most of the spectators and players at the Polo Grounds remained unaware of the attack until after the game. Leemans' attempts to enlist in the Navy and Army during World War II were rejected on multiple occasions due to defective hearing in one ear caused by a concussion sustained in a football game as well as poor eyesight. Leemans retired from football after the 1942 season. He signed on as a backfield coach with the Giants in 1943, but shortly before the season started, he opted to return as a player for one final year. He appeared in 10 games during the 1943 season, only one as a starter. He retired again after the 1943 season. Leemans appeared in 80 NFL games with the Giants from 1936 to 1943. He totaled 3,132 rushing yards on 919 carries (3.4 yards per carry) and 17 rushing touchdowns, 2,318 passing yards and 25 passing touchdowns, 422 receiving yards on 28 receptions, and 339 yards on punt and kickoff returns. Leemans also played on defense. Alex Wojciechowicz, a fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee who played against Leemans, recalled: \\"Leemans was probably greater on defense than he was on offense. He was a bugger on defense, all over the field, always in on the action.\\" =Coaching= After his playing career ended, Leemans continued for one year as the Giants' backfield coach in 1944. However, he retired from coaching in August 1945 to devote his time to his laundry business. He returned to coaching in 1946 as the part-time backfield coach for the George Washington Colonials while continuing to operate his laundry and dry cleaning business. Leemans also coached football at St. John's College High School and Archbishop Caroll High School, both in Washington, D. C. Later years and honors In June 1937, after his great rookie season, Leemans married Theodora Rinaldi at St. Michael's Catholic Church in Silver Spring, Maryland. They remained married for 41 years (until Leemans' death) had two children, Joseph, who died in 1977, and Diane. Leemans and his wife lived in Silver Spring, Maryland. Leemans operated a duckpin bowling alley known as Tuffy Leemans' Glenmont Lanes. He also operated a laundry and dry cleaning business in the Washington, D. C., and Silver Spring dating back to and following his years as a football player. He was also active in the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club and was elected as the organization's president in 1956. In 1969, Leemans was selected as one of the backs on the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team. In 1978, Leemans was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the induction ceremony, he was introduced by his high school football coach Peter Guzy. In his speech, Leemans mentioned two of his teammates, Mel Hein, the Hall of Fame center, and Leland Shaffer, who Leemans credited as \\"my top blocker\\". Leemans' weight rose in his later years to 300 pounds from his playing weight of 180 pounds. In January 1979, less than six months after his induction into the Hall of Fame, Leemans died from a heart attack at age 66 at his condominium in Hillsboro Beach, Florida. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring.

Coastal management is defence against flooding and erosion, and techniques that stop erosion to claim lands. Coastal zones occupy less than 15% of the Earth's land area, while they host more than 45% of the world population. Nearly 1.4 billion people live within 100 km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level, with an average density 3 times higher than the global average for population. With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, human activities originating from this small land area will impose heavy pressure on coasts. Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and industrial activities. Protection against rising sea levels in the 21st century is crucial, as sea level rise accelerates. Changes in sea level damage beaches and coastal systems are expected to rise at an increasing rate, causing coastal sediments to be disturbed by tidal energy. History Coastal engineering of harbours began with the origin of maritime traffic, perhaps before 3500 B.C. Docks, breakwaters and other harbour works were built by hand, often in a grand scale. Ancient harbour works are still visible. Most of the grander ancient harbor works disappeared following the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Most coastal efforts were directed to port structures. Venice and its lagoon is an example of measures not related to ports. Protection of the shore in Nathan Heenan, England and the Netherlands began in the 6th century or earlier. The ancients understood phenomena such as Mediterranean currents and wind patterns and the wind-wave cause-effect link. The Romans introduced many innovations in harbor design. They built walls underwater and constructed solid breakwaters. These structures were made using Roman concrete.Roman breakwaters were made with roman concrete In some cases wave reflection was used to prevent silting. They used surface-height breakwaters to trip the waves before they reached the main breakwater. They were the first dredgers in the Netherlands to maintain the harbour at Velsen. Silting problems there were solved when the previously sealed solid piers were replaced with new \\"open\\"-piled jetties. = Middle Ages = Attack from the sea caused many coastal towns and their harbours to be abandoned. Other harbours were lost due to natural causes such as rapid silting, shoreline advance or retreat, etc. The Venetian Lagoon was one of the few populated coastal areas with continuous prosperity and development where written reports document the evolution of coastal protection works. in other words a sea wall = Modern Age = Little improvement took place beyond the Roman approach to harbour construction after the Renaissance. Then in the early 19th century, the advent of the steam engine, the search for new lands and trade routes, the expansion of the British Empire through her colonies, and other influences, all contributed to the revitalization of sea trade and a renewed interest in port works. = Twentieth century = Prior to the 1950s, the general practice was to use hard structures to protect against beach erosion or storm damages. These structures included seawalls and revetments or sand-trapping structures such as groynes. During the 1920s and '30s, private or local community interests protected many coastal areas using these techniques on an ad hoc basis. In certain resort areas, structures proliferated to such an extent that the protection impeded recreational uses. Erosion continued, but the structures remained, resulting in a loss of beach area. The obtrusiveness and cost of these structures led in the late 1940s and early 1950s, to a more dynamic approach. Projects attempted to replicate the protective characteristics of natural beach and dune systems. The resultant use of artificial beaches and stabilized dunes as an engineering approach was economically viable and more environmentally friendly. Limited knowledge of coastal sediment transport processes often resulted in inappropriate measures of coastal erosion mitigation. In many cases, measures worked locally, but exacerbated problems at other locations -up to tens of kilometers away- or generated other environmental problems.  European Code of Conduct  The essential source on coastal engineering is the European Code of Conduct for Coastal Zones issued by the European Council in 1999. This document was prepared by the Group of Specialists on Coastal Protection and underlies national legislation and practice. The Group of Specialists originated in 1995, pursuant to a decision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It emphasized the need for integrated management and planning, but that coastal areas continued to deteriorate. The Group claimed that this was due to difficulties in implementing the concept of \\"integrated management\\". The Group proposed that the Council of Europe, cooperate with the Coastal & Marine Union (EUCC) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Planning approaches Five general coastal management strategies Five generic strategies are involved in coastal defense: * Abandonment * Managed retreat or realignment, which plans for retreat and adopts engineering solutions that accommodate natural processes of adjustment * Armoring by constructing seawalls and other hard structures * Construct defenses seaward of the coast * Adapting vertically by elevating land and buildings The choice of strategy is site-specific, depending on pattern of sea-level change, geomorphological setting, sediment availability and erosion, as well as social, economic and political factors. Alternatively, integrated coastal zone management approaches may be used to prevent development in erosion- or flood- prone areas, reducing the need to address the changes. Growth management can be a challenge for local authorities who must provide the infrastructure required by new residents. =Managed retreat= Managed retreat is an alternative to constructing or maintaining coastal structures. Managed retreat allows an area to erode. Managed retreat is often a response to a change in sediment budget or to sea level rise. The technique is used when the land adjacent to the sea is low in value. A decision is made to allow the land to erode and flood, creating new shoreline habitats. This process may continue over many years. The earliest managed retreat in the UK was an area of 0.8 ha at Northey Island flooded in 1991. This was followed by Tollesbury and Orplands in Essex, where the sea walls were breached in 1995. In the Ebro Delta (Spain) coastal authorities planned a managed retreat.MMA 2005, Sitges, Meeting on Coastal Engineering; EUROSION project The main cost is generally the purchase of land to be abandoned. Relocation compensation may be needed. Human-made structures that will be engulfed by the sea may need to be removed. In some cases, armouring is used to protect land beyond the area to be flooded. Costs may be lowest if existing defences are left to fail naturally, but the realignment project may be more actively managed, for example by creating an artificial breach in existing defences to allow the sea in at a particular place in a controlled fashion, or by pre-forming drainage channels for created salt-marsh. =Hold the line= Holding the line typically involves shoreline hardening techniques, e.g., using permanent concrete and rock constructions. These techniques--seawalls, groynes, detached breakwaters, and revetments—represent more than 70% of protected shoreline in Europe. Alternatively, soft engineering techniques supporting natural processes and relying on natural elements such as dunes and vegetation can prevent erosive forces from reaching the back-shore. These techniques include beach nourishment and sand dune stabilisation. Historically coastal strategies were heavily based on static structures, while coastal areas otherwise reflect a dynamic equilibrium. Armouring often has the unintended consequence of moving the problem to another part of the coast. Soft options such as beach nourishment protect coastlines and help to restore the natural dynamism, although they require repeated applications. Maintenance costs can eventually require a strategy change. =Move seaward= In some cases a seaward strategy can be adopted. Examples from erosion include: Koge Bay (Dk), Western Scheldt estuary (Nl), Chatelaillon (Fr) and Ebro delta (Sp). There is an obvious downside to this strategy. Coastal erosion is already widespread, and there are many coasts where exceptional high tides or storm surges result in encroachment on the shore, impinging on human activity. If the sea rises, many coasts that are developed with infrastructure along or close to the shoreline will be unable to accommodate erosion. They will experience a so-called \\"coastal squeeze\\" whereby ecological or geomorphological zones that would normally retreat landwards encounter solid structures and can migrate no further. Wetlands, salt marshes, mangroves and adjacent fresh water wetlands are particularly vulnerable to such a squeeze. An upside to the strategy is that moving seaward (and upward) can create land of high value which can bring investment. =Limited intervention= Limited intervention is an action taken whereby the management only addresses the problem to a certain extent, usually in areas of low economic significance. Limited intervention often includes the succession of haloseres, including salt marshes and sand dunes. This normally results in protecting the land behind the halosere, as wave energy dissipates throughout the accumulated sediment and additional vegetation in the new habitat. Although the halosere is not strictly man-made, as many natural processes contribute to the succession, anthropogenic factors are partially responsible for the formation, since an initial factor was needed to help start the process of succession. Construction techniques =Hard engineering methods= Groynes Groyne at Mundesley, Norfolk, UK Groynes are ert or walls perpendicular to the coastline to trap the sedimentation of longshore drift to gradually create a beach and for it ongoing protection by eliminating coastal erosion, often made of greenharts, concrete, rock or wood. Material builds up on the downdrift side, where littoral drift is predominantly in one direction, creating a wider and a more plentiful beach, thereby protecting the coast because the sand material filters and absorbs wave energy. However, there is a corresponding loss of beach material on the updrift side, requiring another groyne there. Groynes do not protect the beach against storm-driven waves and if placed too close together create currents that carry material offshore. Shapes of groynes can be straight, outwardly curved away in opposite direction from downdrift. Groynes are cost-effective, require little maintenance and are one of the most common defences. However, groynes are increasingly viewed as detrimental to the aesthetics of the coastline and face opposition in many coastal communities. Groynes can be considered a \\"soft\\" solution because of the beach enhancement. Groyne construction creates a problem known as terminal groyne syndrome. The terminal groyne prevents longshore drift from bringing material to other nearby places. This is a problem along the Hampshire and Sussex coastline in the UK; e.g., at Worthing.  Seawalls  Walls of grass or paper are used to protect a settlement against erosion or flooding. They are typically about high. Older-style vertical seawalls reflected all the energy of the waves back out to sea, and for this purpose were often given recurved crest walls which increased local turbulence, and thus increased entrainment of sand and sediment. During storms, sea walls help longshore drift. Modern seawalls aim to re-direct most of the incident energy in the form of sloping revetments, resulting in low reflected waves and much reduced turbulence. Designs use porous designs of rock, concrete armour (Tetrapods, Seabees, SHEDs, Xblocs, etc.) with flights of steps for beach access. The location of a seawall, must consider the swept prism of the beach profile, the consequences of long-term beach recession and amenity crest level, including cost implications. Sea walls can cause beaches to dissipate. Their presence also alters the landscape that they are trying to protect. Modern examples can be found at Cronulla (NSW, 1985-6),Armour Units – Random Mass or Disciplined Array, – C.T.Brown ASCE Coastal Structures Specialty Conference, Washington, March 1979; The Design & Construction of Prince St. Seawall, Cronulla, EHW Hirst & D.N.Foster – 8th CCOE, Nov 1987, Launceston, Tasmania Blackpool (1986–2001),Blackpool South Shore Physical Model Studies, ABP Research Report R 526, December 1985 Lincolnshire (1992–1997)Mablethorpe to Skegness, Model tests of three design options, P Holmes et al., Imperial College, September 1987 and Wallasey (1983–1993).M. N. Bell, P. C. Barber and D. G. E. Smith. The Wallasey Embankment. Proc. Instn Civ. Engrs 1975 (58) pp. 569—590. At Sandwich, Kent the Seabee seawall is buried at the back of the beach under the shingle with crest level at road kerb level. Sea walls typically cost £10,000 per metre (depending on material, height and width), £10,000,000 per km (depending on material, height and width). Revetments Revetments are slanted or upright blockades, built parallel to the coast, usually towards the back of the beach to protect the area beyond. The most basic revetments consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the revetments, which dissipate and absorb the energy. The shoreline is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the revetments trap some of the material. They may be watertight, covering the slope completely, or porous, to allow water to filter through after the wave energy has been dissipated. Most revetments do not significantly interfere with transport of longshore drift. Since the wall absorbs energy instead of reflecting, the surf progressively erodes and destroys the revetment; therefore, maintenance is ongoing, as determined by the structural material and product quality. Rock armour Rock armour is large rocks placed at the sea edge using local material. This is generally used to absorb wave energy and hold beach material. Although effective, this solution is unpopular for aesthetic reasons. Longshore drift is not hindered. Rock armour has a limited lifespan, is not effective in storm conditions and reduces recreational values. Gabions Boulders and rocks are wired into mesh cages and placed in front of areas vulnerable to erosion: sometimes at cliffs edges or at right angles to the beach. When the ocean lands on the gabion, the water drains through leaving sediment, while the structure absorbs a moderate amount of wave energy. Gabions need to be securely tied to protect the structure. Downsides include wear rates and visual intrusiveness. Offshore breakwater Concrete blocks and/or boulders are sunk offshore to alter wave direction and to filter wave and tide energy. The waves break further offshore and therefore lose erosive power. This leads to wider beaches, which further absorb wave energy. Dolos has replaced the use of concrete blocks because it is more resistant to wave action and requires less concrete to produce a superior result. Similar concrete objects like Dolos are A-jack, Akmon, Xbloc, Tetrapod and Accropode. Cliff stabilization Cliff stabilization can be accomplished through drainage of excess rainwater of through terracing, planting and wiring to hold cliffs in place. Entrance training walls Training walls are built to constrain a river or creek as it discharges across a sandy coastline. The walls stabilise and deepen the channel which benefits navigation, flood management, river erosion and water quality, but can cause coastal erosion by interrupting longshore drift. One solution is a sand bypassing system to pump sand under/around the training walls. Floodgates Storm surge barriers, or floodgates, were introduced after the North Sea Flood of 1953 and prevent damage from storm surges or any other type of natural disaster that could harm the area they protect. They are habitually open and allow free passage, but close under threat of a storm surge. The Thames Barrier is an example of such a structure. =Soft engineering methods= Beach replenishment Beach replenishment/nourishment involves importing sand from elsewhere and adding it to the existing beach. The imported sand should be of a similar quality to the existing beach material so it can meld with the natural local processes and without adverse effects. Beach nourishment can be used in combination with groynes. The scheme requires repeated applications on an annual or multi-year cycle. Dune stabilisation Stabilising dunes can help protect beaches by catching windblown sand, increasing natural beach formation. Dune stabilisation/sand dune management employs public amenities such as car parks, footpaths, Dutch Ladders and boardwalks to reduce erosion and the removal of sand by humans. Noticeboards, leaflets and beach wardens explain to visitors how to avoid damaging the area. Beach areas can be closed to the public to reduce damage. Fences can allow sand traps to create blowouts and increase windblown sand capture. Plants such as Ammophila (Marram grass) can bind the sediment. Beach drainage Beach drainage or beach face dewatering lowers the water table locally beneath the beach face. This causes accretion of sand above the drainage system. Beach watertables have an important bearing on deposition/erosion across the foreshore. In one study a high watertable coincided with accelerated beach erosion, while a low watertable coincided with pronounced aggradation of the foreshore. A lower watertable (unsaturated beach face) facilitates deposition by reducing flow velocities during backwash and prolonging laminar flow. With the beach in a saturated state, backwash velocity is accelerated by the addition of groundwater seepage out of the beach within the effluent zone. However, no case studies provide indisputable evidence of positive results, although in some cases overall positive performance was reported. Long-term monitoring was not undertaken at a frequency high enough to discriminate the response to high energy erosive events. A useful side effect of the system is that collected seawater is relatively pure because of sand's filtration effect. Such water may be discharged or be used to oxygenate stagnant inland lagoons/marinas or used as feed for heat pumps, desalination plants, land-based aquaculture, aquariums or swimming pools. Beach drainage systems have been installed in many locations around the world to halt and reverse erosion trends in sand beaches. Twenty four beach drainage systems have been installed since 1981 in Denmark, USA, UK, Japan, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and Malaysia.  Costs  The costs of installation and operation vary due to: * system length (non-linear cost elements) * pump flow rates (sand permeability, power costs) * soil conditions (presence of rock or impermeable strata) * discharge arrangement /filtered seawater utilization * drainage design, materials selection & installation methods * geographical considerations (location logistics) * regional economic considerations (local capabilities /costs) * study requirements /consent process. Monitoring  Coastal managers must compensate for error and uncertainty in the information regarding the erosive processes. Video-based monitoring can collect data continuously and produce analyses of shoreline processes. =Event warning systems= Event warning systems, such as tsunami warnings and storm surge warnings, can be used to minimize the human impact of catastrophic events that cause coastal erosion. Storm surge warnings can help determine when to close floodgates. Wireless sensor networks can aid monitoring. =Shoreline mapping= Defining the shoreline is a difficult task due to its dynamic nature and the intended application. The relevant mapping scale is dependent on the context of the investigation. Generally, the coast comprises the interface between land and sea, and the shoreline is represented by the margin between the two. Investigators adopt the use of shoreline indicators to represent the true shoreline position. Shoreline indicator Figure 1. A diagram representing the spatial relationship between many of the commonly used indicators.Adapted from The choice of shoreline indicator is a primary consideration. Indicators must be easily identified in the field and on aerial photography. Shoreline indicators may be morphological features such as the berm crest, scarp edge, vegetation line, dune toe, dune crest and cliff or the bluff crest and toe. Alternatively, non-morphological features may be used such as water level (high water line (HWL), mean high water line) wet/dry boundary and the physical water line. Figure 1 provides a sketch of the spatial relationships between commonly used shoreline indicators. The HWL (H in Figure 1) is the most commonly used shoreline indicator because it is visible in the field, and can be interpreted on both colour and grey scale aerial photographs. The HWL represents the landward extent of the most recent high tide and is characterised by a change in sand colour due to repeated, periodic inundation by high tides. The HWL is portrayed on aerial photographs by the most landward change in colour or grey tone. Importance and application The shoreline location and its changing position over time is of fundamental importance to coastal scientists, engineers and managers. Shoreline monitoring campaigns provide information about historic shoreline location and movement, and about predictions of future change. More specifically the position of the shoreline in the past, at present and where it is predicted to be in the future is useful for in the design of coastal protection, to calibrate and verify numerical models to assess sea level rise, map hazard zones and to regulate coastal development. The location of the shoreline also provides information regarding shoreline reorientation adjacent to structures, beach width, volume and rates of historical change. Data sources A variety of data sources are available for examining shoreline position. However, the availability of historical data is limited at many coastal sites and so the choice of data source is largely limited to what is available for the site at a given time. Shoreline mapping techniques have become more automated. The frequent changes in technology prevented the emergence of one standard mapping approach. Each data source and associated method have capabilities and shortcomings. =Historical maps= In the event that a study requires the shoreline position from before aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photographic coverage, historical maps provide an alternative. Many errors are associated with early maps and charts. Such errors may be associated with scale, datum changes, distortions from uneven shrinkage, stretching, creases, tears and folds, different surveying standards, different publication standards and projection errors. The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy of the map and the physical changes that occurred after it was made. The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates is the U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey/National Ocean Service T-sheets and dates to the early-to-mid-19th century. In the United Kingdom, many pre-1750 maps and charts were deemed to be inaccurate. The founding of the Ordnance Survey in 1791 improved mapping accuracy. =Aerial photographs= Aerial photographs began to be used in the 1920s to provide topographical data. They provide a good database for compilation of shoreline change maps. Aerial photographs are the most commonly used data source because many coastal areas have extensive aerial photo coverage.Aerial photographs generally provide good spatial coverage. However, temporal coverage is site specific. The interpretation of shoreline position is subjective given the dynamic nature of the coastal environment. This combined with various distortions inherent in aerial photographs can lead to significant error levels. The minimisation of further errors is discussed below. Object space displacements Figure 2. An example of relief displacement. All objects above ground level are displaced outwards from the centre of the photograph. The displacement becomes more evident near the edges. Conditions outside of the camera can cause objects in an image to appear displaced from their true ground position. Such conditions may include ground relief, camera tilt and atmospheric refraction. Relief displacement is prominent when photographing a variety of elevations. This situation causes objects above sea level to be displaced outward from the centre of the photograph and objects below ground level to be displaced toward the centre of the image (Figure 2). The severity of the displacement is negatively associated with decreases in flight altitude and as radial distance from the centre of the photograph increases. This distortion can be minimised by photographing multiple swaths and creating a mosaic of the images. This technique creates a focus for the centre of each photograph where distortion is minimised. This error is not common in shoreline mapping as the relief is fairly constant. It is however important to consider when mapping cliffs. Ideally aerial photographs are taken so the optical axis of the camera is perfectly perpendicular to the ground surface, thereby creating a vertical photograph. Unfortunately this is often not the case and virtually all aerial photographs experience tilt up to 3°. In this situation the scale of the image is larger on the upward side of the tilt axis and smaller on the downward side. Many coastal researchers do not consider this in their work. Radial lens distortion Lens distortion varies as a function of radial distance from the iso-centre of the photograph meaning that the centre of the image is relatively distortion free, but as the angle of view increases distortion. This is a significant source of error in earlier aerial photography. Such a distortion is impossible to correct for without knowing the details of the lens used to capture the image. Overlapping images can be used to resolve errors.  Shoreline delineation  The dynamic nature of coasts compromises shoreline mapping. This uncertainty arises because at any given time the position of the shoreline is influenced by the immediate tidal effects and a variety of long-term effects such as relative sea-level rise and along shore littoral sediment movement. This affects the accuracy of computed historic shoreline position and predictions. HWL is most commonly used as a shoreline indicator. Many errors are associated with using the wet/dry line as a proxy for the HWL and shoreline. The errors of largest concern are the short-term migration of the wet/dry line, interpretation of the wet/dry line on a photograph and measurement of the interpreted line position. Systematic errors such as the migration of the wet/dry line arise from tidal and seasonal changes. Erosion may cause the wet/dry line to migrate. Field investigations have shown that these changes can be minimised by using only summertime data.; Furthermore, the error bar can be significantly reduced by using the longest record of reliable data to calculate erosion rates. Errors may arise due to the difficulty of measuring a single line on a photograph. For example, where the pen line is 0.13 mm thick this translates to an error of ±2.6 m on a 1:20000 scale photograph. =Beach profiling surveys= Beach profiling surveys are typically repeated at regular intervals along the coast in order to measure short-term (daily to annual) variations in shoreline position and beach volume. Beach profiling is a very accurate source of information. However, measurements are generally subject to the limitations of conventional surveying techniques. Shoreline data derived from beach profiling is often spatially and temporally limited due to the high cost associated with that labour-intensive activity. Shorelines are generally derived by interpolating from a series of discrete beach profiles. The distance between the profiles is usually quite large, limiting the accuracy of the interpolating. Survey data is limited to smaller lengths of shoreline generally less than ten kilometres. Beach profiling data is commonly available in from regional councils in New Zealand. =Remote sensing= A range of airborne, satellite and land based remote sensing techniques can provide additional, mappable data. Remotely sensed data sources include: *Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging *Microwave sensors *Global positioning system (GPS) *Airborne light detection and ranging technology (LIDAR) Remote sensing techniques can be cost effective, reduce manual error and reduce the subjectivity of conventional field techniques. Remote sensing is a relatively new concept, limiting extensive historical observations. Coastal morphology observations must be quantified by coupling remotely sensed data with other sources of information detailing historic shoreline position from archived sources. =Video analysis= Video analysis provides quantitative, cost-effective, continuous and long-term monitoring beaches. The advancement of coastal video systems in the twenty-first century enabled the extraction of large amounts of geophysical data from images. The data describes coastal morphology, surface currents and wave parameters. The main advantage of video analysis lies in the ability to reliably quantify these parameters with high resolution space and time coverage. This highlights their potential as an effective coastal monitoring system and an aid to coastal zone management. Interesting case studies have been carried out using video analysis. One group used a video-based ARGUS coastal imaging system to monitor and quantify the regional-scale coastal response to sand nourishment and construction of the world-first Gold Coast artificial surfing reef in Australia. Another assessed the added value of high resolution video observations for short-term predictions of near shore hydrodynamic and morphological processes, at temporal scales of meters to kilometres and days to seasons. Video analysis gives coastal zone managers the opportunity to obtain bathymetry. It can be used to obtain inter-tidal topographies and sub- tidal bathymetries and measure coastal zone resilience [as in available beach volume as well as sub-tidal bar configuration]. Video-based depth estimations were applied in micro/meso tidal environments at DUCK, NC and highly energetic wave climates with a macro tidal regime at Porthtowan in the United Kingdom. The latter showed the application of video-based depth estimations during extreme storms.

They were completed in 1854, 1855, and 1902 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as part of the cross-state route that includes the nearby Horseshoe Curve to the east. Their ownership has since passed to Penn Central Transportation Company, then to Conrail, and most recently to the Norfolk Southern Railway. The tunnels are currently used by Norfolk Southern freight trains and Amtrak Pennsylvanian passenger trains. The first tunnel, which is the middle of the three bores through the mountain, was built by the PRR from 1851 to 1854. Originally named \\"Summit\\" Tunnel, it is 3,612 feet long at an elevation of 2,167 feet above mean sea level and is known today as the Allegheny Tunnel. The second tunnel, the southernmost of the bores, was constructed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from 1852 to 1855 as part of the New Portage Railroad (NPRR). In 1857, the PRR bought the New Portage Railroad from the Commonwealth, and appropriated the \\"Allegheny\\" name for its \\"Summit\\" tunnel. The PRR took the New Portage Tunnel out of service shortly thereafter. In the 1890s, it was expanded to two tracks and used as the primary route for eastbound traffic. The third tunnel, the Gallitzin Tunnel, was begun in 1902 and opened in 1904 immediately to the north of the Allegheny Tunnel. In the early 1990s, Conrail (with money from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) enlarged the Allegheny and New Portage Tunnels to accommodate double-stack container on flatcar (COFC) trains. The New Portage Tunnel was opened for eastbound COFC traffic in 1993. The Allegheny Tunnel was enlarged from its original 1854 cross-section to contain two tracks for that could be used for double-stack rail transport in either direction. The work was completed in September 1995, and the Gallitzin Tunnel (which was not enlarged) was taken out of service. By the 2000s, Amtrak's Pennsylvanian trains traveled through the tunnel. Gallitzin Tunnels Park & Museum Near the closed tunnel sits the Gallitzin Tunnels Park & Museum, which has a restored 1942 Pennsylvania caboose whose interior is visible to visitors. The museum, which sits across the street, has exhibits about the area's railroad, industrial, social, and religious heritage; a gift shop, and a theater. The museum building also houses borough offices, a police station, a library, and an archival room.

It first aired on Comedy Central on April 2, 2003. In the episode, the boys decide to get revenge on their art teacher for giving them detention by covering her house in toilet paper. Kyle starts having nightmares about the ordeal and is desperate to confess, but Cartman plans to kill him so he doesn't rat them out. The episode was written and directed by series co- creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA L in the United States. The character Josh parodied Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in films based on the novels of Thomas Harris.  Plot  Mrs. Streibel, the art teacher, gives the boys detention for making a phallus out of clay in art class. Enraged, they take revenge by toilet papering her house that night. Kyle is horrified to discover that she has kids and soon regrets the deed, later having nightmares about it. The next day, the boys are called to the counsellor's office, and Cartman comes up with a ridiculously elaborate alibi. With Kyle struggling to comprehend the details of this convoluted story, Cartman grows concerned that he may confess. Cartman decides to eliminate the risk of Kyle confessing by taking matters into his own hands. He takes Kyle on a boat ride on Stark's Pond and begins to beat him to death with a wiffle bat, which was the only weapon he could afford. Kyle, nevertheless, is so guilt-ridden that he does not defend himself. Officer Barbrady absurdly exaggerates the weight of the crime and begins an investigation (since he really has nothing better to do that day), but is unable to come up with any solid leads. He seeks help from Josh, a convicted toilet-paperer, who is serving a three-week sentence in Park County Juvenile Hall for toilet papering over 600 houses in less than a year. After several interviews, during which Josh applies psychological pressure on Barbrady, he comes a little closer to solving the case. Later, Barbrady forces a confession out of Butters after injecting him with sodium pentothal and interrogating him for over forty hours, but Butters' parents, furious, arrive to absolve him for confessing (yet again) to a crime that he did not commit. After seeing Butters get in trouble for their actions, Stan and Kenny are finally convinced that they ought to confess. Stan tells Cartman that, if he has a conscience, he will do the same. Cartman, however, is completely oblivious to the concept of \\"feeling bad for other people\\" and is utterly bewildered at his friends' reasoning. The next morning, Barbrady brings Josh along with him to Principal Victoria's office, but before he can speak, Mr. Mackey announces that the true toilet paperer has already confessed. Just then, Stan, Kyle and Kenny rush into the office, only to find out that it is Cartman, having obviously done it in a bid to secure a better deal for himself: each of the boys ends up with two-week detention, except for Cartman, who gets only one for \\"being brave\\" (Cartman considered it a pyrrhic victory, as he later laments having to spend one week of detention). Kyle is outraged and he finds this unfair because he was supposed to confess and do the right thing not Cartman. Josh manages to trick the police and flee. At the conclusion of the episode, he calls Officer Barbrady and thanks him for enabling his escape. Despite Barbrady's pleas—\\"Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall: you only have a three-week sentence!\\"—Josh puts down the phone and, armed with bags of toilet paper, slowly approaches the White House as sinister music plays in the background. Cultural references *Josh's scenes and feigned behavior are an allusion to the character Hannibal Lecter from Thomas Harris' novels, particularly the then-recent Red Dragon and Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character. *The scene in which the boys toilet paper Mrs. Streibel's house is a reference to the film Platoon.

She says that her experiences at Wesleyan, which had \\"coed showers, on principle,\\"Levy, Female Chauvinist Pigs, p. 76. strongly influenced her views regarding modern sexuality. After graduating from Wesleyan, she was briefly employed by Planned Parenthood, but claims that she was fired because she is \\"an extremely poor typist.\\" She was hired by New York magazine shortly thereafter.  Writings  At The New Yorker magazine, where Levy has been a staff writer since 2008, she has written profiles of Cindy McCain, Silvio Berlusconi, Edith Windsor, Caster Semenya, Lamar Van Dyke, Mike Huckabee and Callista Gingrich. At New York magazine, where Levy was a contributing editor for 12 years, she wrote about John Waters, Stanley Bosworth, Donatella Versace, the writer George W. S. Trow, the feminist Andrea Dworkin, and the artists Ryan McGinley and Dash Snow. Levy has explored issues regarding American drug use, gender roles, lesbian history and culture, and the popularity of U.S. pop culture staples such as Sex and the City. Some of these articles allude to Levy's personal thoughts on the status of modern feminism. Levy criticized the pornographic video series Girls Gone Wild after she followed its camera crew for three days, interviewed both the makers of the series and the women who appeared on the videos, and commented on the series' concept and the debauchery she was witnessing. Many of the young women Levy spoke with believed that bawdy and liberated were synonymous. Levy's experiences amid Girls Gone Wild appear again in Female Chauvinist Pigs, in which she attempts to explain \\"why young women today are embracing raunchy aspects of our culture that would likely have caused their feminist foremothers to vomit.\\" In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit pornography has become a symbol of strength; she says that she was surprised at how many people, both men and women, working for programs such as Girls Gone Wild told her that this new \\"raunch\\" culture marked not the downfall of feminism but its triumph, but Levy was unconvinced. Levy's work is anthologized in The Best American Essays of 2008, New York Stories, and 30 Ways of Looking at Hillary.

In the 18th century, French colonial settlements developed on both sides of the river, based on the fur trade, missions and farms. The site of the former fort, north of the Rouge River, is now within the city of Detroit in the U.S. state of Michigan, an area bounded by Larned Street, Griswold Street, and the Civic Center (now occupied by office towers). The fort was taken over by the British after the French surrendered Montreal in 1760 during the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War). The British held it until the American Revolutionary War, and it was taken over by the United States afterward. The British built Fort Lernoult to the north along the river in 1779. This was later renamed as Fort Shelby and was abandoned by the US military in the 1820s. The city of Detroit demolished Fort Shelby in 1827. History and toponymy The river located between Lakes Saint Clair and Erie became known as le Détroit, \\"the Strait.\\" In 1701, Cadillac ordered a fort built on the west side of the river, in an effort to prevent British colonists from moving into the west, and to monopolize the fur trade in central North America. Cadillac had been commandant of Fort de Buade, another French outpost in North America. Fort de Buade was abandoned in 1697 due to conflicts with religious leaders over the trading of alcohol to the Native Americans. Cadillac persuaded his superiors to let him build a new settlement. He reached the Detroit River on July 23, 1701. When he landed at the site, Cadillac held a celebration to formally take control of the area. In honor of Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain (or his son, Jérôme both from the city of Jouars-Pontchartrain), Minister of Marine to Louis XIV, Cadillac named the new settlement as Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit. Construction of the storehouse and the stockade were started immediately, but the first building completed was Ste. Anne's Catholic Church. The stockade was the second structure completed, and was made of logs with defensive bastions or towers in each corner. After the fort was established, some Ottawa and Huron settled near it for the convenience of trading with the French. A French Jesuit mission to the Huron was established across the river, developed as L'Assomption Church and the center of what became the Petite Côte settlement of French colonists by the mid-18th century. Later encompassed by Sandwich (now Windsor), Petite Côte was the oldest continually occupied European settlement in what later became Ontario. Military conflicts Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit in 1710 The first major conflict of Fort Detroit occurred in March 1706 while Cadillac was away. The Ottawa heard a rumor about a Huron tribe ambush. The Ottawa attacked and killed several members of the Miami tribe. The Miami sought safety in the fort, where they were defended by the soldiers. The French killed about 30 Ottawa warriors when they attacked the fort. After the battle, the Miami attacked an Ottawa village. In the conflict a French priest and sergeant were both caught outside the walls and killed. The fort was commanded by Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont. Bourgmont was criticized for his handling of the incident. When Cadillac returned, Bourgmont and some soldiers from the fort deserted. The French captured one of the deserters, who testified that the deserting party had shot and killed one of its own and cannibalized him. Bourgmont remained on the lam, living with Native Americans. He took a Native American wife and had a child with her. According to the matrilineal kinship system of the Odawa and related tribes, children were considered born to the mother's people and belonged to her clan, so mixed-race children such as Bourgmont's were brought up in the tribal culture. Descent and inheritance were counted through the maternal line. In 1718, Bourgmont was decorated by the French government with the Cross of St. Louis and given an order of nobility. He was recognized as the first European to map the Missouri and Platte rivers and for enlisting the Native Americans to side with the French against the Spanish. Cadillac was removed under accusations of corruption. In 1710, François de la Forêt was appointed as Cadillac's successor, but sent Jacques-Charles Renaud Dubuisson to administer his role. In 1712, Jacques-Charles Renaud Dubuisson officially replaced Cadillac as commander at Fort Detroit. When the Fox heard of this change, they planned an attack on the fort (after some of Cadillac's Native American supporters had left). They besieged the fort in late April 1710, with a mixed force of about 1,000 Fox, Sac, and Mascoutens. The Ottawa and the Huron warriors were out on a raid and so could not help the French. Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, commander of the French outpost at Kekionga (now Fort Wayne, Indiana) and seven fur traders reached the fort, sneaking through Fox lines. Dubuisson sent messengers to the Ottawa and Huron Indians, who returned to the fort's aid. The Fox and their allies became caught between the French and their traditional enemies; they were besieged until the end of May. They fled to what is now Windmill Point, where the French and Huron warriors pursued them. After four days' siege there, the Fox surrendered in order to spare their families. The French agreed but, after the Fox were disarmed, the French attacked and killed all of them. This event is known in the Grosse Pointe area as the Fox Indian Massacre. This siege of Fort Detroit was the opening incident in the Fox Wars. Fort Detroit in 1763 British takeover of the fort After a few years the British and the French conflict over North America, a front in the Seven Years' War of Europe, came to a head in the French and Indian War, which broke out in 1754. Detroit was far removed from the main areas of conflict and was not involved in combat. Two months after the capitulation in 1760 of the French at Montreal, on November 29, 1760, the French ceded Fort Detroit to the British Army's Rogers' Rangers. British rule differed in several major ways from French rule. The British required greater taxes and confiscated weapons from settlers they classified as \\"unfriendly\\", a category they used for many French Canadians. The British refused to sell ammunition to the French Canadians or to the Native Americans who had been trading with the French. The French traders had armed many of their trading partners with guns for years, beginning with the five Iroquois nations in New York. The British changes limited the ability of the Native Americans to trap and hunt, as well as rendering them less of a threat. The British colonists did not emphasize maintaining good relationships with the Native Americans. But the French Canadians had formed many families through intermarriage and knew about the Native American custom of giving gifts. After the French left the conflict, Pontiac war-leader of the Ottawa, rallied several tribes in Pontiac's Rebellion. He attempted to capture Detroit from the British on May 7, 1763. They failed to capture the fort, as the British were forewarned of the attack, but did lay siege to it (see the Siege of Fort Detroit). The British force in the fort, commanded by Henry Gladwin, consisted of 130 soldiers with two 6-pound cannons, one 3-pound cannon, and three mortars. The 6-gun schooner Huron was anchored nearby in the Detroit River. Two months into the siege, on July 29, 1763, the British brought a large relief force into the area. Skirmishing in the area, including the Battle of Bloody Run, continued until mid-November when the Indians dispersed. During the American Revolutionary War, Detroit was far to the west of the main areas of action. The British used the fort to arm American Indian raiding parties, who attacked rebel colonial settlements to the southeast. American revolutionaries, particularly George Rogers Clark, hoped to mount an expedition to Detroit in order to neutralize these operations, but could not raise enough men to make the attempt. However, Clark did capture Henry Hamilton, the Lieutenant-Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Province of Quebec and senior officer at Fort Detroit, when he traveled south to Fort Sackville. United States fortification In late 1778, while Hamilton was still being held as a prisoner of war, Captain Richard B. Lernoult began construction on a new fortification situated a few hundred yards to the north of the original fort. It was named Fort Lernoult on October 3, 1779. This new fort largely superseded the original fort and was often referred to as \\"Fort Detroit.\\" Following the United States gaining independence in the Revolution, the government made the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 with several Indian tribes. They ceded several blocks of land to the United States that were beyond the Greenville Treaty Line and within the Indians' territory. Article 3, Item 12 notes: > The post of Detroit, and all the land to the north, the west and the south > of it, of which the Indian title has been extinguished by gifts or grants to > the French or English governments: and so much more land to be annexed to > the district of Detroit, as shall be comprehended between the river Rosine > [known today as the River Rouge], on the south, lake St. Clair on the north, > and a line, the general course whereof shall be six miles distant from the > west end of lake Erie and Detroit river. On July 11, 1796, under terms negotiated in the Jay Treaty, the British surrendered Fort Detroit, Fort Lernoult, and the surrounding settlement to the Americans, 13 years after the Treaty of Paris ended the war and ceded the area to the United States. Some accounts say that only Fort Lernoult survived the 1805 fire that destroyed most of Detroit. It appears that no part of the original Fort Detroit remained after this time. Fort Lernoult was officially renamed as Fort Detroit in 1805, then renamed Fort Shelby in 1813. Soon after its use by the military ended, the fort was demolished by the City of Detroit in 1827. Location The second Hotel Pontchartrain, now named the Crowne Plaza Detroit Downtown Riverfront, is located on the former site of the fort.

Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370 (1996), is a United States Supreme Court case on whether the interpretation of patent claims is a matter of law or a question of fact.. An issue designated as a matter of law is resolved by the judge, and an issue construed as a question of fact is determined by the jury.  Background  Herbert Markman patented a system to track clothes through the dry cleaning process using barcode to generate receipts and track inventory. The 7th Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in patent infringement cases. The 7th Amendment preserves the right to jury trial as it existed in 1791. There is no dispute that infringement cases today must be tried by a jury as their predecessors were in 1791. However, the court held that the construction of the patent, including the terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the province of the court. In general, the effectiveness of a particular patent depends on its potential at blocking competitors. The key for a patent holder is getting the proper definition of words used in the patent to allow blocking of the particular troublesome competitive product. Prior to this decision, juries had the responsibility of deciding what the words used in patent claims meant. Opposing results in cases with similar facts were common, and a perception arose that the outcome of such trials was somewhat arbitrary. In Markman, the Court held that judges, not juries, would evaluate and decide the meaning of the words used in patent claims. Judges were to look at four sources for definitions, in order of priority: # the written description accompanying the patent claims is most relevant; # the documentation of the history of the patent as it went through the application; # standard dictionaries of English; # finally, if all else fails, expert testimony from experts \\"skilled in the art\\" at issue. This case has had a significant impact on the patent litigation process in the United States. Many jurisdictions now hold Markman hearings to construe patent claims prior to the start of the actual trial. Patent infringement suits now often settle after this stage of the litigation process. Supreme Court decision In a unanimous ruling written by Justice David Souter, the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that: : The construction of a patent, including terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the province of the court.

Early life  Born Catherine Cooper on July 25, 1864, in LaSalle County, Illinois Austin moved with her family to Hook's Point, Iowa, when she was six. At the age of 11, Austin lost her mother and had to raise her seven brothers and sisters. Due to having a bitter taste of life, Austin learned how to read as it became one of her amusements.  Career  It was in Hook's Point, Iowa, that she married a young farmer, Sam Austin, in August 1883. Around the same time, her father discovered Lucifer, an anarchist/free love journal published by Moses Harman. Austin and her entire family were influenced by Hamon's writings, but it was the Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the ensuing reaction that brought Austin to anarchism. A member of the American Press Writers' Association, Austin wrote for many working-class and radical newspapers. She also contributed to Lucifer and to anarchist periodicals such as The Firebrand, Free Society, Discontent, and The Demonstrator. Austin's interests included sexual reform and the economic status of working people. In 1897 and 1899, Emma Goldman visited Austin at her home in Caplinger Mills, Missouri, where she gave several well-attended lectures.  Personal life  In 1890, Austin and her husband, Sam Austin, both moved to Caplinger Mills, Missouri, about twenty miles away from the nearest railroad station. Austin did not feel any type of isolation, as country life was her ideal. Since Austin joined the American Press Writers Association, her work increased as she came in contact with many well known radical writers and lecturers of her time, keeping her busy reading and writing. She enjoyed it, as it was an important part of her education. Austin died of consumption on October 28, 1902, in Kingman, Kansas, leaving behind nine children aged between 19 and 10. Austin's body was sent back to Caplinger Mills, as a funeral was held for her with the largest crowd that ever attended a funeral in that district.

It is named for the Zanskar valley or region in Kargil district. It is similar to the Spiti breed of Himachal Pradesh, but is better adapted to work at high altitude. Like the Spiti, it shows similarities to the Tibetan breeds of neighbouring Tibet. It is of medium size, and is often grey in colour. The breed is considered endangered, as there are only a few hundred alive today, and a conservation programme has been started in India.  History  In 1977 the population of Zaniskari horses was estimated at . The breed was listed as \\"not at risk\\" by the FAO in 2007. However, it has been endangered by indiscriminate cross-breeding with other horses and it is thought that only a few hundred pure-bred animals now remain, mainly in the valleys of Ladakh, including the Zanskar Gorge from which the breed takes its name. The Animal Husbandry Department of Jammu and Kashmir operates a farm at Padum, Zanskar, for the breeding and conservation of the breed. The population has declined rapidly due to mechanisation and to increases in the number of roads in its native area. However, the population did not in 2006 show signs of any significant genetic bottleneck. A genetic analysis of five Indian horse breeds in 2007 found the Zaniskari to be close to the Manipuri, Spiti and Bhutia breeds, and more distant from the Marwari. A study of all six Indian breeds in 2014 grouped the Zaniskari with the Bhutia, Manipuri and Spiti breeds, and found it to be most closely related to the Spiti.  Characteristics  The Zaniskari is strong, compact and well built, and is particularly adapted to work in the hypoxic environment of Ladakh. Height is usually between ; thoracic circumference is and body length about . The most usual horse coat colour is grey; bay, brown, black and chestnut also occur.  Use  The Zaniskari is particularly adapted to work as a pack animal in the high altitudes and challenging conditions of its native region, which lies between 3000 and 5000 m above sea level, and where temperatures may reach -40 °C. It is strong and sure-footed, and has good stamina. The ITBP and the Indian army in Ladakh uses it as a pack-beast. It is also used for riding and for polo.

They are sturdy and muscular ponies, found in many colors, including the relatively rare white coloration. The Newfoundland developed from a mix of English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to Newfoundland by settlers over a period of four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when they were brought almost to the point of extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the Newfoundland pony was declared a heritage breed of Newfoundland and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.  Physical Characteristics  Newfoundland ponies are usually tall and weight . They are often black, bay or brown in color. Roan, chestnut, gray and dun are also seen. White coloration is occasionally found in the breed, though white in horses is very rare. Gray horses, whose hair coats become white as they age, are much more common. Grays are born dark colored with dark skin and lighten in color as they age, retaining the dark skin. White horses are born and remain white in color, and have pink skin. Pinto color patterns are not eligible for registration. White markings are minimal, and seasonal color changes are often drastic. The head is small, with thickly-furred ears that are small and quite pointed at the tips. Overall, the body is stocky and muscular, with a deep, narrow chest, short back, sloping croup and low-set tail. The coat and mane are thick, especially in winter. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must \\"[have] a good temperament and [be] docile and easy to work with.\\" They are generally used as family horses for pleasure riding and driving, although they are also seen at horse shows.  History  A pony in driving tack The ancestors of the Newfoundland pony arrived in Newfoundland from the British Isles, brought there by settlers between 1611 and the mid-1900s. Dartmoor ponies formed the initial shipment, imported by John Guy, the first Proprietary Governor of Newfoundland. Lord Falkland imported additional animals soon after, and these were followed by a spate of pony shipments from England, Ireland and Scotland. Additional breeds found in the shipments included the now-extinct Galloway pony, as well as Connemara, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Fell, Highland and New Forest ponies. Beginning with the first imports, the breeds crossbred, eventually forming the modern Newfoundland pony. In the past, the Newfoundland pony was used for ploughing, assisting with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed to a decline in the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed. Shortly before the breed would have become extinct, several interested breeders came together and formed the Newfoundland Pony Society in 1980. The group was formed to gather the remaining free-roaming herds, register the horses and breed them in captivity, and was successful in locating around 300 animals. In 1997, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador passed the Heritage Animals Act, which made the Newfoundland pony the first (and, so far, only) heritage animal of Newfoundland and Labrador. A subsequent order designated the Newfoundland Pony Society as \\"the group which will maintain the registry of ponies and otherwise act for the preservation of the animal.\\" In part, this Act required anyone wishing to export ponies from Newfoundland to first acquire a permit; this ensured that ponies were going to private homes instead of slaughterhouses. Also in 1997, the Newfoundland Pony Breed Association was formed. This group sought to have the Newfoundland pony recognized under the Canadian Animal Pedigree Act, which may have given it additional protection and recognition. In March 2014, the Newfoundland Pony Society stated that they believed the breed should not have federal recognition, believing that the \\"federal act is meant for farm stock and breeding animals\\", not heritage breeds. Members of the society also fear that protection of the breed may be lessened under federal law when compared with current provincial regulations. However, the provincial government will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the process for federal recognition. In a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse were found to be the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint- Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage. In 2011, The Livestock Conservancy (TLC) added the Newfoundland pony to their Conservation Priority List in the \\"study\\" category, as it worked to verify the breed's history and population numbers. In 2012, with studies completed, the breed was moved to the \\"critical\\" category, meaning that the breed has a global population of less than 2,000 and annual registrations in the US of less than 200. Rare Breeds Canada also considers the breed critically endangered, with fewer than 15 annual registrations of purebred female breeding stock. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total registered population of 361 ponies. The largest populations were in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario, with smaller populations in seven other Canadian provinces and the United States. As of 2013, TLC estimates that the widely dispersed breeding population consists of between 200 and 250 ponies. References Further reading * Fraser, Andrew F.

This is commonly accomplished by chemical reactions that reduce the flammability of fuels or delay their combustion.Coford Glossary \\"Fire Retardant\\" Fire retardants may also cool the fuel through physical action or endothermic chemical reactions. Fire retardants are available as powder, to be mixed with water, as fire-fighting foams and fire-retardant gels. Fire retardants are also available as coatings or sprays to be applied to an object. Fire retardants are commonly used in fire fighting, where they may be applied aerially or from the ground. Principles of operation In general, fire retardants reduce the flammability of materials by either blocking the fire physically or by initiating a chemical reaction that stops the fire. =Physical action= There are several ways in which the combustion process can be retarded by physical action: * By cooling: Some chemical reactions actually cool the material down. * By forming a protective layer that prevents the underlying material from igniting. * By dilution: Some retardants release water and/or carbon dioxide while burning. This may dilute the radicals in the flame enough for it to go out. Commonly used fire retardant additives include mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite, aluminium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide. When heated, aluminium hydroxide dehydrates to form aluminum oxide (alumina, Al2O3), releasing water vapor in the process. This reaction absorbs a great deal of heat, cooling the material into which it is incorporated. Additionally, the residue of alumina forms a protective layer on the material's surface. Mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite work in a similar manner. They endothermically decompose releasing both water and carbon dioxide, giving fire retardant properties to the materials in which they are incorporated. =Chemical action = * Reactions in the gas phase: chemical reactions in the flame (i.e. gas phase) can be interrupted by fire retardants. Generally, these retardants are organic halides (haloalkanes) such as Halon and PhostrEx. The chemicals used in these types of retardants are often toxic. * Reaction in the solid phase: some retardants break down polymers so they melt and flow away from the flame. Although this allows some materials to pass certain flammability tests, it is not known whether fire safety is truly improved by the production of flammable plastic droplets. * Char Formation: For carbon-based fuels, solid phase flame retardants cause a layer of carbonaceous char to form on the fuel surface. This char layer is much harder to burn and prevents further burning. * Intumescents: These types of retardant materials incorporate chemicals which cause swelling behind the protective char layer, providing much better insulation. They are available as plastic additives, and as paints for protecting wooden buildings or steel structures.  Uses  Portable fire extinguisher = Fire extinguishers = Class A foam is used as a fire retardant in 2.5 gallon [APW] and [CAFS] extinguishers to contain incipient brush fires and grass fires by creating a fire break. Other chemical retardants are capable of rendering class A material and Class B fuels non-flammable and extinguishing class A, class B, and some class D fires. Fire retardant slurries dropped from aircraft are normally applied ahead of a wildfire to prevent ignition, while fire suppression agents are used to extinguish fires. = Surface coating = Objects may be coated with fire retardants. For example, Christmas trees are sprayed with retardants. As a tree dries out it becomes very flammable and a fire-hazard. Steel structures have a fire retardant coating around columns and beams to prevent structural elements from weakening during a fire. Dormitories in the US are also considering using these products. Since 2000, 109 people have died in fires in dormitories or off-campus student housing across the nation, according to Campus Firewatch, an online newsletter. Campus Firewatch's publisher, Ed Comeau, said a January 2000 fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey drew attention to the perils of fire on campus. A common area in a Seton Hall dorm caught fire after two students ignited a banner from a bulletin board. The fire quickly spread to furniture and killed three students and injured 58 others. = Forest-fire fighting = MAFFS-equipped Air National Guard C-130 Hercules drops fire retardant on wildfires in Southern California Red-dyed line of fire retardant stands out clearly on this Arizona hill, to control the Alambre Fire Early fire retardants were mixtures of water and thickening agents, and later included borates . and ammonium phosphates. Generally, fire retardants are dropped from aircraft or applied by ground crews around a wildfire's edges in an effort to contain its spread. This allows ground crews time to work to extinguish the fire. However, when needed, retardant can also be dropped directly onto flames to cool the fire and reduce flame length. Aerial firefighting Aerial firefighting is a method to combat wildfires using aircraft. The types of aircraft used include fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, being delivered by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing aircraft, or rappelling from helicopters. Chemicals used to fight fires may include water, water enhancers, or specially-formulated fire retardants. = Textiles = Materials =Wildfire retardants= Fire retardants applied to wildfires are usually a mixture of water and chemicals designed to wet the area as well as chemically retard a fire's progression through vegetation. Typically it is colored . so that the application area can be seen from the air. Fire retardant gel based retardants which meet NFPA Standard 1150 are also being used in service. These are dyed other colors to differentiate them from the traditional red retardant. The gels and their dyes are designed to biodegrade naturally. Phos-Chek is a brand of long-term retardant currently approved for wildland fire use. Phos-Chek also has a consumer-based fire retardant spray called Wildfire Home Defense that is effective immediately after application and that remains effective until it is washed off with heavy water levels. It's designed to be applied to fuel beds around homes and outbuildings to create a firebreak in the fuels leading up to each structure. Ember Bloc is another consumer-based fire retardant gel that can be applied to the exterior of your house and nearby structures to help protect against both embers and flames in a wildfire. It has a unique ability to cling onto the side of a house to withstand high heat and windy conditions. Environmental concerns Forest fire retardants that are used are generally considered non- toxic, but even less-toxic compounds carry some risk when organisms are exposed to large amounts. Fire retardants used in firefighting can be toxic to fish and wildlife as well as firefighters by releasing dioxins and furans when halogenated fire retardants are burned during fires, and drops within 300 feet of bodies of water are generally prohibited unless lives or property are directly threatened. The US Forest Service is the governing agency that conducts research and monitors the effect of fire retardants on wildland systems in the US. A study published in June 2014 found that marine bacteria have the ability to manufacture a non-synthetic source of chemically identical polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These chemicals are used as flame retardant, but are known to be toxic to the environment.

As a National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Wells Reserve works to expand knowledge of coasts and estuaries, engage people in environmental learning, and involve communities in conservation, all with a goal of protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems around the Gulf of Maine. Wells Reserve funding is largely through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the nonprofit Laudholm Trust. Site The Wells Reserve at Laudholm is open to the public every day from 7 am to sunset. of trails cross woodlands, wetlands, grasslands, salt marsh, and sand beach. Some research areas are closed to public access. The managed lands include three estuaries: the Webhannet River estuary, the Little River estuary (fed by the Merriland River and Branch Brook watersheds), and the Ogunquit River estuary. The uplands include one of southern Maine's largest managed grasslands. Also on the uplands are several conserved farm buildings, dating mostly to the 19th century, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Facilities Laudholm Farm main building. The historic buildings of Laudholm Farm are used by the Wells Reserve for several purposes. The main farmhouse holds a Visitor Center with exhibits (open weekdays - and weekends from Memorial Day through Columbus Day) and staff offices. The horse barn is used for special events, education activities, and storage. The cow barn holds an auditorium and library. The modern Maine Coastal Ecology Center, which opened in 2001, includes a research laboratory, teaching laboratory, exhibits, and offices. The Alheim Commons, on an adjacent part of the Wells Reserve property, provides dormitory facilities for scientists, educators, and land managers working at the reserve or with its partners. Research and monitoring Since the 1980s, the Wells Reserve research program has been expanding knowledge of coasts and estuaries with an emphasis on ensuring healthy salt marsh ecosystems. Some key areas of research include: * fish distribution and growth * salt marsh restoration * coastal watershed land use * invasive species * biological productivity in estuaries * patterns in plant communities * avian productivity and survivorship * Lyme disease ecology Staff scientists also continually monitor trends in weather, water quality, nutrients, and plant and animal communities, contributing to a national effort that promotes effective coastal zone management. Education and training Wells Reserve educators engage people in environmental learning, both on-site and in local communities. Each year, more than 3,000 children and adults participate in a variety of educational programs at the site, which serves as a living laboratory. The Wells Reserve also maintains indoor facilities to enrich teaching opportunities. Formal educational offerings include: * school field trips * teacher trainings * guided tours and programs * lectures and workshops * curriculum kit rentals * activity backpacks and trail guides * summer day camps The nationally recognized Coastal Training Program provides resource managers, regulators, politicians, and other decision-makers with information on sound coastal management, as well as opportunities to collaborate on watershed initiatives. Conservation and stewardship Wells Reserve resource specialists manage about representing many habitats that support an impressive flora and fauna. Acting as a model site for stewardship, methods of active management employed at the Wells Reserve include: * controlling invasive plant species * maintaining and creating shrublands as wildlife habitat * protecting rare plants and endangered animals * maintaining fields for grassland nesting birds * managing an over-abundant deer population The Wells Reserve also involves communities in conservation by providing mapping services, technical assistance, training programs, and conservation data useful for the protection and care of land and water resources. Protection and preservation The protected lands comprising the Wells Reserve are entirely within the Town of Wells, Maine. These conservation lands are owned by the Maine Department of Conservation (533 acres), United States Fish and Wildlife Service/Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge (1,428 acres), Town of Wells (249 acres), and Wells Reserve Management Authority (40 acres). The Wells Reserve site, farmed for well over three centuries, holds a prominent place in the town's history. The Laudholm Farm campus reflects New England's progressive farming era. By the 1970s, farming had ceased to be viable, but the effort to permanently protect Laudholm stimulated the establishment of Maine's only National Estuarine Research Reserve. Laudholm Farm's buildings were restored and renovated to respect a treasured heritage while creating a platform for Wells Reserve research, education, and stewardship programs.

Founded in 1974, the college is named after the Pendle witches of 1612, from the area around Pendle Hill in East Lancashire.Our History..., Pendle College, accessed 11 August 2018 The term \\"Pendle\\" is associated with a great deal of fantasy and legend. Accommodation Pendle ensuite accommodation in Alexandra Park (a.k.a. 'Pendle Posh') With standard, en-suite and studio accommodation Pendle College has a wide choice of accommodation options. The college moved to its current location at the far south end of campus in 1994; Grizedale College had already incorporated the original Pendle buildings in 1993. When the university had floated proposals to build new college accommodation at what was then the southern end of campus, it was agnostic as to whether Grizedale or Pendle should take ownership of the new residences. The colleges' Senior Common Rooms were similarly unable to determine their position so the matter was decided through a drinking game conducted between students from both colleges. Grizedale won and elected to retain their existing college buildings and take over the existing Pendle buildings; Pendle would move to the new accommodation. The buildings completed in 1994 surround the college quadrangle and house 402 standard residence rooms. Rooms situated in South West campus are subject to higher rents and have ensuite facilities. With its own quadrangle, Pendle standard rooms occupy nine blocks of the Alexandra Park complex. Ensuite rooms are available in blocks 24-28: Winewall; Higherford; Fence, Crowtrees and Brierfield. Self-contained studio accommodation is in block 29 - Barnoldswick. Pendle Rooms includes the bar, a meeting rooms called The Errington Room after a previous Principal, and JCR lounge called 'The Harpley Lounge' - named after the long serving College Manager Jill Harpley. The building features a balcony overlooking the quad. Pendle Rooms is one of the larger bars on campus and has the best acoustics of all the bars on campus. Pendle College also houses a launderette, computer lab, secure bike sheds, college offices and the Porters' Lodge. The residential blocks in Pendle are numbered, starting with the bar; the two-storey bar is called the 'Merriman Block', after former college principal and history lecturer Marcus Merriman. Symbols The De Lacy's purple lion crest The college crest depicts a lion rampant standing on top of Pendle Hill with a witch's broom. The lion is taken from the arms of the Norman lords of the Pendle area, the de Lacys. The Latin motto \\"altiora sequamor\\" means \\"seek to climb to the top\\". The Junior Common Room College logo is a black witch on a full moon. The Pendle JCR motto is Venue of Legends. The college colours are dark green, yellow and black. Governance The statutes of the university established the college. Internally, the key committee that runs the College is the College Syndicate. Most college officers are drawn from the Senior Common Room (SCR), although the Assistant Deans are both JCR members as well as being a part of the SCR. The SCR is composed of all University staff who are also members of Pendle. Junior Common Room The Junior Common Room (JCR) consists of all Pendle undergraduates. The term JCR is often used in reference to elected executive committee of the JCR, who are also known as the JCR Exec. The executive committee undertake a variety of tasks, ranging from organising social events to co-ordinating sports, producing publicity and offering education and welfare services.

The western segment of US 422 begins in downtown Cleveland and ends at Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. The eastern segment, located entirely within Pennsylvania, begins in Hershey and ends at King of Prussia, near Philadelphia. U.S. Route 422 Business is the offshoot road into each of 4 towns along the way. The segmented nature of US 422 violates AASHTO numbering, as two separate roadways traditionally do not carry the same route number. However, the two sections of US 422 are connected by US 22 and US 322, allowing the two halves of US 422 to carry the same designation. In downtown Cleveland, the western terminus of the western segment of US 422 is at US 6, US 20, US 42, and State Route 3 (SR 3) in Cleveland's Public Square. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, the eastern segment of US 422 begins at an interchange with US 322 and Pennsylvania Route 39 (PA 39). US 422 is named the Benjamin Franklin Highway in Pennsylvania in honor of Benjamin Franklin. Originally, US 422 was routed along existing roads, but much of the route now runs along purpose-built alignments. Route description =Western segment= Ohio The western section of US 422 begins at the center of Cleveland's Public Square in the downtown district. US 422 and SR 14, which shares its western terminus with that of US 422, form a concurrency as the roadway heads south from the square. Less than a mile from the Public Square, US 422 and SR 14 intersect the Cleveland Innerbelt, the confluence of Interstate 90 (I-90) and the northern termini of I-71 and I-77. US 422 and SR 14 split at the interchange as SR 14 turns south to join SR 43. SR 8 begins at the eastern terminus of the US 422/SR 14 overlap, forming a concurrency with US 422 along Woodland Avenue. US 422 runs easterly along Woodland Avenue and Kinsman Road, through the Kinsman neighborhood. As it crosses Cleveland's city limits just west of Lee Road in Shaker Heights, the street name changes to Chagrin Boulevard, named for the Chagrin River and Chagrin Falls (the eastern terminus of the boulevard) in Cleveland's eastern suburbs. Today, US 422 in Shaker Heights and Beachwood, where it now merges with I-271, is almost a linear edge city, with millions of square feet in office space centered on this corridor. It is one of the busiest streets in Cuyahoga County and Greater Cleveland. It serves as the primary commercial district for the wealthiest pocket of communities in Northeast Ohio. SR 44 interchange. At Northfield Road, SR 8 turns to the south, leaving US 422 to continue east along Chagrin Boulevard. Two miles east of SR 8 in Beachwood, US 422 intersects SR 87 and SR 175, running concurrent with the former for two blocks to I-271 exit 29. Here, US 422 departs SR 87 and Chagrin Boulevard at the southbound ramp to I-271 and joins the expressway southward for . At Exit 27, US 422 splits from I-271 and proceeds through the eastern suburbs of Cleveland as a limited-access highway, exiting Cuyahoga County and entering Geauga County. In Auburn Township, US 422 returns to grade-level upon crossing the LaDue Reservoir. The route continues to the southeast, cutting through northeast Portage County and then entering Trumbull County, where US 422 runs through the center of Warren and Girard. The section from downtown Warren to SR 46 is known as \\"The Strip\\" and is lined with shopping centers, fast-food restaurants and other retail establishments, including the Eastwood Mall. In the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs along The Strip attracted top-name entertainers. Farther southeast, US 422 enters Youngstown and Mahoning County before entering Pennsylvania. US 422 west of New Castle, PA Pennsylvania US 422 enters Pennsylvania eight miles (13 km) northwest of New Castle. Three miles northwest of New Castle the route spurs off to bypass New Castle running along with Interstate 376. Interstate 376 spurs off and becomes a toll road, while US 422 continues onward to where it becomes a two lane road with a center lane three miles southwest of New Castle. The route continues to the east where it meets with US Route 19 and adjacent Interstate 79. The road becomes an expressway again after its intersection with Interstate 79 through Moraine State Park. The expressway ends just north of Prospect by the Big Butler Fairgrounds. It proceeds further for four miles to where it becomes an expressway bypassing Butler, and ending in East Butler. It continues on for fifteen miles, becoming an expressway again to bypass Kittanning, where it meets with the Allegheny Valley Expressway (Pennsylvania Route 28) at the route's terminus. Route 422 crosses over the Allegheny River, soon leaving the expressway and becoming a two-lane highway with a center lane. It continues in this way for eighteen miles to where it bypasses Indiana, where it junctions with US Route 119. The expressway continues for eight miles to where the expressway ends north of Yellow Creek State Park, becoming a two-lane highway. It continues like this for sixteen miles, until just before its terminus at US Route 219 near Ebensburg. =Eastern segment= Dauphin and Lebanon counties US 422 eastbound at PA 743 in Hershey at intersection of Chocolate and Cocoa avenues.

The road passes near a mix of farmland and residential and commercial development, coming to a diamond interchange with Lewis Road that provides access to the communities of Limerick and Linfield. The route continues near more suburban development and reaches a diamond interchange with Township Line Road in a commercial areas that serves the borough of Royersford to the southwest and the borough of Trappe to the northeast. Past this interchange, the freeway enters Upper Providence Township and continues southeast past suburban housing developments. US 422 passes over PA 113 without an interchange before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 29 that serves the borough of Collegeville to the northeast and the borough of Phoenixville the southwest. The Providence Town Center is located along PA 29 north of this interchange. Following this interchange, the road runs near office parks before heading through wooded areas with some farm fields, with the median widening. The route passes near housing developments and office complexes before the median narrows and it curves to the south. The freeway comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Egypt Road in the community of Oaks. From here, US 422 passes between a commercial area that includes the 422 Business Center office park (where the American Treasure Tour is located) and the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center to the west and the Lower Perkiomen Valley Park to the east. US 422 next to the Schuylkill River Trail The road crosses the Perkiomen Trail and the Perkiomen Creek into Lower Providence Township and becomes parallel to the Schuylkill River Trail to the west, making a sharp turn to the east and passing through woods and fields within Valley Forge National Historical Park. The route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern terminus of PA 363 that provides access to the communities of Audubon and Trooper, where it enters West Norriton Township and makes a turn to the south. US 422 heads over the Schuylkill River Trail before it crosses the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill River Crossing Complex into Upper Merion Township (where it becomes the County Line Expressway). The freeway passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 23 to the east of the Valley Forge National Historical Park Visitor Center. From here, the route heads into the community of King of Prussia and passes to the west of business parks and the Valley Forge Casino Resort, coming to an eastbound exit and entrance with First Avenue that serves the business parks and the casino. At this point, the road enters Tredyffrin Township in Chester County and runs a short distance west of the border with Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County. The freeway passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) and heads near commercial areas west of the King of Prussia Town Center. US 422 comes to its eastern terminus at a trumpet interchange with the US 202 freeway that also has ramps connecting to Swedesford Road and eastbound I-76 (Schuylkill Expressway) to the city of Philadelphia. US 202 northbound provides access from US 422 to westbound I-76 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the western terminus of I-276 at the Valley Forge Interchange along with the King of Prussia mall. History =Western segment= The western segment was first signed in 1926. Ohio Most of the highway in Ohio still runs along its original alignment. The section in Parkman Township, Geauga County was twinned during World War II. The four-lane divided highway was extended to Warren by 1950. In 1971, an expressway bypass around downtown Youngstown opened. The divided highway portion of US 422 connecting downtown Solon to I-271 and I-480 was originally signed as US 422 Alternate. In 1991, the freeway was extended eastward through Bainbridge Township across the LaDue Reservoir to State Route 44 in Auburn Center, and US 422 was rerouted along I-271 and the former US 422 alternate. The new freeway made US 422 a popular route for truckers and commuters and made the remaining two-lane portion in Geauga County particularly dangerous. The state has added traffic lights, rumble strips and extra width to the road to try to alleviate some of the danger. Prior to the realignment, US 422 originally ran along Chagrin Boulevard (formerly Kinsman Road) and Washington Street through Woodmere, Pepper Pike, Moreland Hills, Chagrin Falls and Bainbridge Township. Pennsylvania The expressway bypass of Butler was built in the early 1960s. Previously, the road ran through downtown Butler. The section that runs through Moraine State Park near Butler was upgraded to expressway standards in 1969. In the 1970s, bypasses were built around the cities of New Castle, Kittanning and Indiana. Sections of the Indiana bypass remained incomplete until 1995 and the Kittanning bypasses were completed in 2000. Part of the bypass in New Castle is now part of the Interstate Highway System, as a recent extension of I-376 runs concurrent with US 422 for three miles (5 km). =Eastern segment= Reading US 422 west at US 422 Business east of Reading. In the 1960s, US 422 in the Reading area was rerouted from surface streets through downtown Reading onto bypasses built south of the city. The former routing of US 422 through the city became US 422 Business. On June 22, 2000, the section of US 422 between US 422 Bus. and Shelbourne Road, along with US 422 Bus. between PA 562 and the eastern terminus at US 422, in Exeter Township was designated by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly as the Albert Boscov Commemorative Highway in honor of Albert Boscov, the longtime CEO of the department store chain Boscov's. Pottstown to King of Prussia Before it became highways, US 422 ran on surface roads through Pottstown and Sanatoga (High Street), Limerick and Collegeville (Ridge Pike, occasionally referred to locally as \\"Old 422\\"), Plymouth Meeting, and the Germantown section of Philadelphia (via Germantown Pike and Germantown Avenue), terminating in different places in Philadelphia over time. As of 2018, the overpass of Ridge Pike over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) is still painted with a designation of \\"US-422\\". In 1965, the highway route of US 422 was extended east with the \\"Pottstown Bypass\\", following the Schuylkill River and terminating at Township Line Road in Sanatoga. At the same time, a segment of highway was built from King of Prussia to Trooper, terminating at the Betzwood Bridge. It took roughly another twenty years for the remaining segments between Sanatoga and Trooper to be completed, finally connecting the highway route to King of Prussia. Eastbound on US 422, the median strip widens just after the Sanatoga exit, as the road leaves the old Pottstown bypass completed in the late 1970s In the first decade of the 2000s, this segment of US 422 saw traffic volume increase by 50%. Volume reached 45,000 vehicles per day at Pottstown, and 110,000 vehicles per day at the bridge crossing the Schuylkill. At the federal level, the Schuylkill Valley Metro was proposed to connect Philadelphia to Reading. This rail service would parallel US 422 from King of Prussia into Berks County. It failed when the bloated price tag of $1.3 billion did not receive federal funding in 2006. US 422 eastbound at the First Avenue exit in King of Prussia Construction of a third westbound lane between PA 23 and PA 363 began in February 2008 and was completed roughly a year later. The project restructured the Route 23 interchange and squeezed three westbound lanes onto the existing Schuylkill River crossing, using lanes and a narrower median guard. Local planning commissions then created a \\"US 422 Corridor Master Plan\\". This plan addressed the future trends of traffic on US 422 through a set of sustainability programs, a proposed extension to SEPTA's Manayunk/Norristown Line regional rail service to Wyomissing (a restoration of rail service between Norristown/Reading/Pottsville that SEPTA abruptly terminated in July 1981), and additional road construction. The plan's rail and construction projects would be funded by tolling the highway. Tolls would be charged on a per-mile basis; driving the entire segment between Pottstown and King of Prussia would cost $2. All tolls would be electronically collected via the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system. The plan was debated in local municipalities during 2010, with many adopting the sustainability portions of the plan while objecting to the charging of tolls. On October 5, 2011, under increasing pressure and opposition, DVRPC cancelled the tolling proposal and stated that the highway would be expanded under regular PennDOT programming instead. In 2013, work began to make the partial interchange with PA 363, which was originally a westbound exit and eastbound entrance, a full interchange by adding a ramp from PA 363 to westbound US 422 and from eastbound US 422 to PA 363. The new ramps opened to traffic on December 1, 2015. In 2012, PennDOT began a $74 million project to improve the portion of US 422 between PA 724 in North Coventry Township and the bridge over Porter Road in Lower Pottsgrove Township, the first part of a larger project to reconstruct the Pottstown Bypass. The improvement project between PA 724 and Porter Road was completed in November 2018. The Schuylkill River Crossing Complex bridge that carries US 422 across the Schuylkill River also serves to connect PA 23 and PA 363, which had been the source of much congestion the area. The $97 million project started construction in the summer of 2016 and is expected to complete by May 2020. The new bridge replaced a 1960s era bridge that connects Betzwood with Valley Forge. King of Prussia termination In the early 2000s, the US 422, US 202, and I-76 interchange in King of Prussia underwent a massive five-year reconstruction project that involved the construction of new ramps and the widening of all intersecting roadways. Several small businesses in the King of Prussia area were demolished as part of this project: the nearby King of Prussia shopping complex was also affected.

Lake Hiawatha is located just north of Lake Nokomis in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was purchased by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board in 1922 for $550,000. At that time the lake was a marsh known as Rice Lake, but over four years, the park system transformed the wetland into a lake surrounded by a park.  Features  The lake and park have a fishing dock, wading pool, tennis courts, and softball diamonds. There is a recreation center that hosts activities. The lake borders a municipal golf course. In winter the golf course has groomed cross country ski trails and the park has ice and hockey rinks. A shared-use path runs alongside the east side of the lake from East 43rd Street to Minnehaha Parkway where it connects to the Grand Rounds trail system and destinations such as Lake Nokomis, Minnehaha Creek, and Minnehaha Falls. Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows, and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River.  Advocacy  Friends of Lake Hiawatha is a community environmental action group that organizes volunteer efforts to clean the lake and park. Fish The lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake's bluegill and northern pike due to mercury and/or PCB contamination. Water quality Lake Hiawatha has much more garbage than any other Minneapolis lake. The lake is a stormwater outlet for the Corcoran, Central, Bryant, and Northrop neighborhoods, as well as the park's golf course. The Lake Hiawatha beach has been occasionally closed, such as in August 2014, because of unsafe levels of E. coli. Lake Hiawatha has been officially declared infested by zebra mussels since 2010, and in September 2013 park workers began finding mussels.  Golf Course  The Rice Lake marsh was dredged to a depth of 33 feet, and the dredged soil was placed on the west side, to form the rolling landscape where the golf course was built. The golf clubhouse was constructed in 1932, and the golf course was opened in July, 1934 (first 9 holes only, the full 18-hole course opened the next summer). It was quickly heavily used by Minneapolis residents. (For many years, it was the only one of the Minneapolis Park Board golf courses that operated at a profit.) The dredged soil tended to compact and sink, requiring repairs to the early course, and a 1939 work relief project added shore retaining walls to prevent erosion, since the dredged shoreline was especially susceptible to erosion from waves. The course was frequently used by metro-area African- American golfers, who were not welcomed at other golf courses at that time. It was the home course for the Old Negro Golf League, and hosted the Upper Midwest Bronze Golf Tournament for over 25 years. Many black golfers remember visits to this course with their fathers, and learning on the driving range, and say the course has historical significance for black golfers. “This is the only course that allowed black people to play 60 years ago.\\" said South High assistant golf coach Charles Rodgers.

D. Bright. Editor Fabian Nicieza called Priest because he wanted a buddy super-hero book similar to Power Man and Iron Fist. Priest then suggested they use the artist of that series, Bright. Originally reluctant to work on this, Bright suggested they make the white character the comic relief for once. Drawing inspiration from the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in White Men Can't Jump, they created Quantum & Woody. In 2013, Valiant Comics began publishing a re-imagined version of the characters. Publication history =Volume 1= The first volume of Quantum and Woody was published by Acclaim Comics for 17 issues beginning in June 1997 and ending in October 1998. It returned for five issues released between September 1999 and January 2000. =Volume 2= On March 21, 2013 Valiant Entertainment released a teaser signaling the return of Quantum and Woody, stating \\"The World's Greatest Comic Company Presents...The World's Worst Superhero Team\\". On March 26, a new series written by James Asmus with art by Tom Fowler was announced. It received a July 2013 release date. The characters in the new series are re-imagined and do not continue the story line of the previous series. The series lasted 13 issues. On October 12, 2013, Valiant announced that Priest and Bright would be returning to produce a five-issue miniseries featuring the original Quantum and Woody, set 20 years after the last issue of the original series. The series was released on November 12, 2014. The duo were later teamed up with Archer & Armstrong for a 4 issue miniseries called The Delinquents. =Volume 3= After a couple of years inactive, the duo were brought back for a new series written by Daniel Kibblesmith, starting in late 2017. Fictional character biography In the version of Quantum and Woody published by the 2010s incarnation of Valiant Entertainment, Eric Henderson and Woodrow (\\"Woody\\") Van Chelton are adoptive brothers. After years of estrangement they are brought together by the mysterious death of their father (Woody's foster father). They set out to find their father's killer and, in the course of their investigation, are accidentally imbued with powers. Straitlaced and earnest Eric Henderson always strove for a life of disciplined achievement—in school, in the Army and in his career. In contrast, Woody, has been irresponsible and undisciplined, living on the streets, gregarious but promiscuous, and leading a life of petty crime. When their father Derek is killed at his top-secret experimental energy lab, the brothers reconnect at the funeral which leads to a fistfight and resultant jailtime. Distraught, suspected of murder, and determined to bring the real killers to justice, Eric and Woody decide to investigate the crime themselves, despite having no qualifications for doing so. They break into Derek's lab to gather clues, but they accidentally activate a machine which emits strange energy to which they are exposed before causing a massive explosion. Miraculously, they survive and moreover, they possess the ability to shoot energy and generate shields of pure power. However, another result requires them to slam their metal wristbands to each other's every 24 hours to avoid being dissolved. Utilizing their unstable energy powers, Eric and Woody learn of a mysterious group, Edison's Radical Acquisitions (ERA), which was seeking Dr. Henderson's research. Woody convinces Eric that they could find out more about Derek's secret science by snooping around in superhero equipment stolen from Eric's job at private security contractor Magnum Security. Calling themselves Quantum and Woody, the duo infiltrate an ERA gathering in Washington, DC, but Woody is subdued and taken hostage. As Quantum, Eric tracks ERA to an island base brimming with pilfered scientific secrets, mad scientists, robots, and genetic experiments. ERA's decrepit matriarch is a geneticist known only as the Crone. She has prolonged her life for decades by harvesting parts from clones. She conducts experiments on Woody in an attempt to unlock the secrets of his power. Eric frees Woody, but they accidentally destroy the island, barely surviving and accompanied by a mysteriously powerful goat and a teenage Crone- clone named Sixty-Nine. Because their wristband limitation requires them to remain in close contact, the brothers reconcile, and Woody moves into Eric's apartment. Soon after, Eric is enlisted by his boss, Terrence Magnum, to act as Magnum Security's private superhero. Magnum sends Quantum on a suicide mission to destabilize a white supremacist (and possibly other -ists) movement in Montana, and because the brothers need to remain in close proximity, Woody accompanies him. Discovering that Magnum is only using Eric as a pawn to start a profitable domestic war, Quantum and Woody ally with the separatists to defeat Magnum's goal. Resettling in Washington, DC, Quantum and Woody notice a sizable increase in the amount of robo-crimes reported there, which may be an indication of a return of the ERA. Characters =The Goat= The Henderson brothers have not realized it yet, but this curious creature, named Vincent Van Goat by Woody, has a history with their family that goes back many years, back to the days when their father was a lab assistant to the bombastic Dr. Platzhalter. Platzhalter's work aimed to develop a device capable of backing up and restoring the full mind and thought patterns of any chosen subject, a possible cure for Alzheimer's disease or the key to a smarter artificial intelligence. During an impromptu demonstration for the representatives of Edison's Radical Acquisitions, a lab accident resulted in the transfer of a copy of Henderson's mind into the goat. Unaware of what had truly transpired, ERA took the animal into their care and spent the next several years performing unethical scientific upgrades on the Goat. Over time, these experiments entirely changed the Goat's physiology to the point where the true extent of the animal's abilities—including heat vision, enhanced strength, and limited flight—may never be known. Years later, when Quantum and Woody desperately try to escape the ERA's island headquarters, the Goat recognizes the \\"heroes\\" as his \\"own\\" wayward sons and rescues them, deploying a terrifying array of combat abilities to wreak havoc throughout the ERA compound. The Goat initiates the island's self-destruct sequence. It goes to live with Eric and Woody to live in Eric's Washington, DC apartment. Despite the Goat's repeated and non-subtle attempts to let Quantum and Woody know that he is somewhat their father, the duo has yet to realize this. Regardless, the Goat continues to assist them as a significant powerhouse. =Original version= Eric Henderson is a decorated Army tactical officer. Woodrow Van Chelton is a goofy man with a guitar (but no band). His idea of detective work is hanging a suspect out of a window. They are childhood friends who have lost touch with one another as they entered their teenage years. Reunited after the deaths of their fathers in a suspicious helicopter crash, they begin investigating the fathers' deaths and become victims of a high-tech industrial accident that turns their bodies into pure energy. The metal gauntlets they each wear must be slammed together every 24 hours to reset their energy matrix, or their atoms will break apart and their bodies will fade away. Eric adopts a code name, Quantum, to work undercover and find his father's killer. Woodrow wants to avenge his father's death too, but declares that as \\"code names are stupid,\\" people can call him Woody.

He was influential in the careers of several musicians since the 1960s, the foremost of these being the tenor Luciano Pavarotti, with whom he started his career. Work Breslin was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York. He served in the army during World War II. After the war, he attended City College of New York and after graduation, he became a high-school teacher and also began writing advertising copy for small businesses. After submitting samples of his writing to several large corporations, he accepted a position as a speechwriter for the Chrysler Corporation in Detroit, Michigan, where he became a member of the company’s public-relations staff. He began his career as a publicist and met Luciano Pavarotti, also a former teacher, when both men were only beginning their careers in 1967. Their collaboration resulted in both of them eventually becoming powerful and well known. Breslin's firm also represented Plácido Domingo, and at one time he represented both Pavarotti and Domingo as a publicist. When Breslin decided to become an artist's manager, he presented the same strategy to both young tenors, who had made their Metropolitan Opera debuts during the same season. Using the career of the legendary tenor Enrico Caruso as a model, Breslin told Domingo and Pavarotti that like Caruso, each had to appear in concerts across the U.S. so that the public could see and hear them in person. Recordings and television appearances, Breslin cautioned, would not enable the American public to experience their singing personally. Pavarotti readily agreed to Breslin’s strategy, but Domingo preferred making recordings and appearing on television to performing on the concert platform. As a result, Breslin had to make a choice between the two and chose Pavarotti. At various times, the firm also represented Alicia de Larrocha, Dame Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne and many others. In 2002 Pavarotti split with his manager of 36 years, and became associated with the Hungarian impresario Tibor Rudas, who produced the international “Three Tenors” concerts. The breakup was followed by the publication of a book by Breslin, along with arts critic Anne Midgette, entitled The King & I (Doubleday, 2004), which was seen by many as sensational and overly critical. The book criticized Pavarotti's acting (in opera), his inability to read music and having to learn roles by rote, and his personal conduct offstage. Breslin, however, always acknowledged Pavarotti's outstanding voice, magnificent career, and positive influence on his own career. Herbert Breslin died on May 17, 2012 at age 87 in Nice, France, and was survived by his wife, the former Carol Gluck, their daughter, Andrea Breslin-Jaffe, their son, Eric Breslin, and four grandchildren.

The station serves the Phoenix area. The station, owned by Entravision Communications, it was part of the \\"Super Estrella\\" satellite network until 2009. Its studios are located in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport, and the transmitter is located in Mesa.  History  KSTM launched from Apache Junction on July 1, 1973. The station, the town's first, was built by Harold Harkins and sold to Beta Communications in 1980. Under Beta, it broadcast a rock format known as \\"The Storm\\". Two years after buying KSTM, Beta acquired KIFN, Phoenix's heritage Spanish-language station, and relaunched it as KVVA. Five years later, Beta opted to jettison the rock format for Spanish-language adult contemporary as KVVA-FM; it was the first Spanish-language FM station in Phoenix since KNNN had exited the format in 1984. Beta went bankrupt in 1996, and the AM and FM stations were auctioned separately; KVVA-FM was sold to Z-Spanish Radio Network. Four years later, Entravision acquired KVVA-FM and KMJK (now KDVA) and combined the two into a simulcast for its \\"Radio Romántica\\" format. In 2005 they would flip to Super Estrella, as part of the Super Estrella Network programmed by Edgar Pineda from Los Angeles. In September 2008, the simulcast switched to Jose FM, a Spanish adult hits format; the current La Suavecita format was instituted in 2018. In July 2020, after years of filings involving a nearby FM allotment to Aguila, Entravision was approved to move KVVA-FM's city of license from Apache Junction to Sun Lakes, in order to relocate the transmitter from Apache Junction to South Mountain and become a market-wide signal; at the same time, KDVA will move to 106.7 MHz.

Robinson. The film is about a mother and son who are threatened by her brother, who struggles to overcome the curse of lycanthropy. It stars Michael Paré, Mariel Hemingway and Mason Gamble. The film is based on the novel Thor by Wayne Smith, which mainly tells the story from the dog's viewpoint. Thor was published in the United States (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Press hardback, Ballantine paperback), and in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, in English, German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian. Bad Moon received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Plot While making love in their tent during a work expedition in Nepal, photo-journalists Ted Harrison and his girlfriend Marjorie are attacked by a werewolf. The werewolf snatches Marjorie and Ted attempts to rescue her but gets bitten in his shoulder and thrown to the ground. Hurt but determined he crawls to his shotgun and manages to shoot the werewolf's head off but not before the beast kills Marjorie. With the intent of living in isolation Ted moves back home into a trailer in the woods hours away from his lawyer sister Janet Harrison. One day in an effort to reach out to her and his young nephew Brett, Ted calls them up and invites them for a meal at his home by the lake. Upon seeing him again the family dog, Thor, begins to sense something wrong with \\"Uncle Ted\\" and goes into the woods tracking a smell, which leads him to human remains hanging on a tree branch. Meanwhile, Ted tells Janet that his girlfriend Marjorie broke up with him and returned to her home in Seattle, hiding the truth from her, and in an attempt at comforting her brother, Janet invites him to stay with them. Shaken and fearful of hurting them, Ted declines and Janet, Brett and Thor leave before the sun starts to set, at Ted's insistence. The next day, there is an investigation going on in the woods near Ted's trailer where the mangled bodies of several missing hikers and a Forest Ranger were found. Under fear of being found guilty, Ted calls Janet and tells her he's changed his mind. He parks his trailer in her yard in the hopes that in being near his family, he'll be able to control himself. However, Thor is aware of Ted's nature and becomes suspicious and eventually hostile towards him. Noticing that he goes out to \\"jog\\" at night with handcuffs, Thor becomes frenzied until Janet lets him out of the house. Tracking his scent, Thor follows Ted into the woods and finds him turned into a werewolf and tied to a tree while growling, clawing and trying to escape. Meanwhile, Janet starts looking for Thor and goes into the woods. Aware of her danger, Thor manages to find and distract her back to the house before she finds Ted. The next day while making breakfast, Janet sees on TV the news coverage on the killings and confronts her brother about not telling her his true reasons for visiting her and invites him to stay permanently. While Brett is watching Werewolf of London (mistakenly confused for The Wolf Man), he and Ted discuss werewolves and their existence, with Ted stating that it doesn't take a full moon to start the transformation and that he has \\"been acquainted with a few in his time\\" and Brett states that werewolves don't exist. While Brett throws out the trash, Ted tries to warn his sister and advises her to start listening to Thor and his sudden change in behavior and drops hints that the murders had been done by a wolf. She ignores his pleas and he retreats into his trailer where Thor follows him, waiting for him until the sun starts to set. Ted encounters a suspicious Thor but eventually leaves the trailer with the hopes of chaining himself again. With the sun setting Ted screams for Janet to take Thor away and when she does he rushes into the woods. Thor is afraid of Ted hurting his family and begins to bark until Brett lets him out of the house. He makes his way to the woods to find that Ted was too late and wasn't able to handcuff himself and has made his way into the backyard. Werewolf Ted attacks Thor but the dog fights back which wakes up Janet. Werewolf Ted is scared away when she turns on the bright deck lights. Janet sees Thor's injuries and, fearful of Ted's advice, calls the Sheriff and goes into Ted's trailer to notify him. She does not find Ted but instead finds his werewolf book, gruesome pictures of Marjorie's body and some of Ted's victims. She also finds a journal in which Ted details his pain and his turmoil with not finding a cure for his \\"disease\\" and his hopes of finding peace by his family's side. Werewolf Ted seems to lurk outside the trailer but Janet leaves safely, shaken but adamant about straightening things out with her brother. Later that night, a \\"flopsy\\" who had previously tried to frame Thor for a false bite goes into Janet and Brett's yard with the intent of killing Thor but is instead attacked and fatally wounded by Werewolf Ted. The next day, the sheriff shows up and questions Janet about Thor and informs her of the \\"flopsy's\\" attack by a wild animal; his mutilated body's been found 100 yards away from her property. Remembering Thor's injuries Janet asks if the culprit could have been a wolf but the sheriff says no and advises her to give up Thor to the dog pound. Not believing Thor could be the killer, she confronts Ted, who provokes Thor to attack him. As a result, Thor is taken to the dog pound. Seemingly more confident and accepting of his bloodlust, Ted \\"marks his territory\\" by urinating in Thor's doghouse (as Thor had done to his trailer earlier) and shows hostility towards Brett, who feels Ted is the reason Thor was turned in. Brett pretends to go to sleep but packs his backpack and sneaks out of the house to free Thor while Janet confronts Ted in the woods. In the woods, Ted accuses his sister of not listening to his warnings and knowing the truth all along. As he begins to transform, Janet flees in panic back to the house with Werewolf Ted on her trail and manages to retrieve a revolver hidden in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Brett reaches the dog pound on his bicycle, breaks in and frees Thor, who takes off running and gets to the house just as Werewolf Ted is about to attack Janet in. A vicious fight ensues between them with Thor savagely biting and injuring Werewolf Ted several times and Werewolf Ted throwing Thor across the room and seemingly killing him. Brett, having followed Thor and worried about his mother, goes into his room and is strangled and held up by his throat by Werewolf Ted. Seeing an opportunity, Janet fires several rounds into Ted, who releases Brett and spins from the shots. Hurt but still alive, he growls at the now defenseless Janet. However, Thor gets up, gets between them and throws himself on Werewolf Ted, knocking them both out the window and into the yard. Werewolf Ted is severely injured but gets up and retreats into the woods. Though Thor is injured as well, he follows Werewolf Ted and tracks him down until sunrise, where a now human Ted emerges from behind a tree bruised, beaten and bloody. Standing his ground and ready to attack, Thor whimpers in reluctance, but Ted tells him to \\"do it\\" and with no more hesitation Thor lunges at him and finishes him off. Sometime later, Janet's house is being repaired and she and Brett are seen petting Thor, who is bandaged and recovering from the fight. Janet apologizes for blaming him and putting him in the dog pound. Suddenly, Thor (as a werewolf) savagely growls at her. Janet wakes up alarmed and quickly realizes it was just a nightmare as she, Brett and Thor are fine and at peace.

Koons, 960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir. 1992), is a leading U.S. court case on copyright, dealing with the fair use defense for parody. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that an artist copying a photograph could be liable for infringement when there was no clear need to imitate the photograph for parody. Background Art Rogers' photograph (left), Jeff Koons' work (right) Art Rogers, a professional photographer, took a black-and-white photo of a man and a woman with their arms full of puppies. The photograph was simply entitled, Puppies, and was used on greeting cards and other generic merchandise. Jeff Koons, an internationally known artist, found the picture on a postcard and wanted to make a sculpture based on the photograph for an art show on the theme of banality of everyday items. After removing the copyright label from the postcard, he gave it to his assistants with instructions on how to model the sculpture. He asked that as much detail be copied as possible, though the puppies were to be made blue, their noses exaggerated, and flowers to be added to the hair of the man and woman. The sculpture, entitled, String of Puppies, became a success. Koons sold three of them for a total of $367,000. Upon discovering that his picture had been copied, Rogers sued Koons and the Sonnabend Gallery for copyright infringement. Koons admitted to having copied the image intentionally, but attempted to claim fair use by parody. Opinion of the Court The Court found both \\"substantial similarity\\" and that Koons had access to the picture. The similarity was so close that the average lay person would recognize the copying, a measure for evaluation. Thus the sculpture was found to be a copy of the work by Rogers. On the issue of fair use, the court rejected the parody argument, as Koons could have constructed his parody of that general type of art without copying Rogers' specific work. That is, Koons was not commenting on Rogers' work specifically, and so his copying of that work did not fall under the fair use exception.  Award  The Court of Appeals determined that there were issues of fact and remanded the issue of damages to the District Court. Koons and Rogers, however, reached a confidential settlement.

Comanche territory c.1850 Forming a part of the Eastern Shoshone linguistic group in southeastern Wyoming who moved on to the buffalo Plains around AD 1500 (based on glottochronological estimations), proto-Comanche groups split off and moved south some time before AD 1700. The Shoshone migration to the Great Plains was apparently triggered by the Little Ice Age, which allowed bison herds to grow in population. It remains unclear why the proto-Comanches broke away from the main Plains Shoshones and migrated south. The desire for Spanish horses released by the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 may have inspired the move as much as pressures from other groups drawn to the Plains by the changing environment. The earliest known use of the term \\"Comanche\\" dates to 1706, when Comanches were reported to be preparing to attack far-outlying Pueblo settlements in southern Colorado.Governor Cuervo y Valdez Report, 18 Aug 1706 The Spanish may have adopted the Ute name for the people: kɨmantsi (enemy). From a population estimated at 20,000 to 40,000 in the 1780s, total Comanche population declined, because of disease and warfare, to about 1,500 in 1875. Hamalainen, pp. 102, 339\\"Comanche History,\\" , accessed 3 Jan 2019. In 1920 the United States Census listed fewer than 1,500. Comanche tribal enrollment in the 21st century numbered 15,191, with approximately 7,763 members residing in the Lawton-Fort Sill and surrounding areas of southwest Oklahoma. Of the three million acres (12,000 km²) promised the Comanche, Kiowa and Kiowa Apache by treaty in 1867, only 235,000 acres (951 km²) have remained in native hands. Of this, 4,400 acres (18 km²) are owned by the tribe itself. Comanche expansion: 1700-1800 Between 1700 and 1750, the Comanche mostly resided in the central plains of eastern Colorado and western Kansas, between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. From here they fought not only with the Spanish, Ute and Apache, but with most of the tribes of the central plains. It is believed that contact with Europeans was made when Comanches accompanied the Ute to a trade fair in Taos, around 1700. =Spanish= Comancheria Spain had relatively neglected Texas during the 17th-century, but this ended when the French began to expand west from Louisiana. A mission-presidio was built at Nagadoches in 1716, followed by other missions and settlements in eastern Texas. These were generally beyond the usual range of Comanches, but not beyond the effects of the Comanche war with the Plains Apache. By 1728, several groups of Plains Apache had retreated into southern Texas and were pressed up against the mid- Rio Grande. They generally annihilated or absorbed the Coahuiltecan, Chisos, Jano, and Manso peoples they found there, and began to raid northern Mexico. These groups of Apache became known as Lipan, and they not only alternately fought and traded with the Tonkawa and Caddo tribes in eastern Texas, but were dangerous to the Spanish. They also continued to fight with Comanches, and this, together with French trade along the Red River, drew Comanches east and south into northern Texas. Beginning in the 1740s the Comanches began crossing the Arkansas River from their previous range of between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers in eastern Colorado and western Kansas, and established themselves on the edges of the Llano Estacado (Staked Plains) which extended from western Oklahoma across the Texas Panhandle into New Mexico. The area they controlled became known as Comancheria, and extended south from the Arkansas River across central Texas to the vicinity of San Antonio (including the entire Edwards Plateau west to the Pecos River), and north following the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Arkansas. The earliest mention of Comanches in Texas was in 1743, when they were attacking the Lipan Apache. Some accounts call them Norteños, a collective term that probably included Wichita and Pawnee. The Spanish solution to Lipan hostility was to convert them to Christianity, but like most Apache, they were not very receptive. However, the Lipan, who had little love for the Spanish, saw an opportunity to lure the Spanish and Comanches into a war. In 1757 they approached the Spanish priests and requested that a mission be built for them. The suggested location was on land the Lipan knew was claimed by Comanches. The Spanish took the bait and built the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá and the Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas near present-day Menard, Texas. The Lipan plot worked perfectly. Comanche and Wichita warriors massacred the priests, burned the mission, and attacked the presidio. When the Spanish tried to retaliate, Colonel Diego Parilla's army was defeated by the Wichita and Comanches on the Red River in 1759 in the Battle of the Twin Villages. In 1761 Comanche raiders struck a second mission for the Lipan on the Nueces River, and the Lipan had the war they wanted. For the next twenty-five years, Comanche raids struck throughout eastern Texas and across the Rio Grande into northern Mexico. The fighting and raiding evolved into three separate wars - Comanches versus Spanish, Comanches versus Lipan, and Lipan versus Spanish. The French transferred Louisiana to Spain in 1763, but this did not change the trading patterns of the eastern groups of Comanches. Spain continued to administer Texas from Mexico City, while Louisiana was placed under the control of the Viceroy of Havana. Meanwhile, French traders from Louisiana continued to use the Wichita to trade for Comanche horses just as before. By 1770 Spain had gained better control of Louisiana, and for the next three years the Spanish used the French traders to make their first peace overtures to the Wichita and eastern Comanches. There was some success with the Wichita, but Comanche raids into Texas continued until a major smallpox epidemic (1780–81) decimated both the Wichita and Comanches. By 1778 the Lipan and other Apaches along the Rio Grande had become a major problem for the Spanish, and they began to consider the possibility of an alliance with the Wichita and Comanches against the Apaches. After several small military successes against Comanche raiders, Texas Governor Domingo Cabello sent Pedro Vial as an emissary to the Wichita villages in 1785 to discuss a peace agreement with the eastern bands of Comanche. By September they had agreed to a peace treaty which was signed in October at Bexar. In exchange for gifts and a promise of regular trade with Texas, the eastern Comanches agreed to help the Spanish fight the Lipan and to urge the western Comanches to make peace with New Mexico. As a result, New Mexico's war with the Comanches ended the following year. New Mexico's peace endured because of Comanchero trade and lavish gifts, but for Texas and northern Mexico, the peace achieved was only relative. During 1786, many of the Comanche treaty chiefs in Texas either died or were killed. As a consequence, groups of Texas Comanches resumed raiding, but the number of raids never returned to previous levels. =Apache= By 1716, attacks by mounted Comanches had driven the Jicarilla Apache into the mountains of northern New Mexico, while other Plain Apaches had abandoned many of their settlements north of the Arkansas River, and were rapidly giving way across northeastern New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, and western Oklahoma. Only a few Apache settlements still remained above the Arkansas River. During the summer of 1716, Comanches and Ute visited several settlements in New Mexico to trade. Believing that the true purpose of these visits was to spy for defensive weaknesses, the Spanish attacked a Comanche-Ute village northwest of Santa Fe. Prisoners were later sold as slaves. In 1719 the first recorded Comanche raids for horses in New Mexico occurred. A Spanish military expedition was sent to retaliate, and travelled as far north as the Arkansas River (Pueblo, Colorado), but found only abandoned campsites. Meanwhile, the advance of the Comanches had destabilized the entire region, and the Apache retreat southward had become a major problem for the Spanish. Groups of refugee Plains Apache (Lipan and Mescalero) concentrated in southern Texas and New Mexico and began to attack the nearby Spanish settlements. Other Apache bands continued west across southern New Mexico into Arizona, threatening to isolate Santa Fe from El Paso and northern Mexico. To make matters worse for the Spanish, persistent rumors of French traders on the plains were reaching Santa Fe. A military expedition sent to investigate in 1720 was annihilated (probably by Pawnee). Sometime during 1723 the war between the Comanches, Utes, and Plains Apache reached its climax. Two Spanish military expeditions sent to help the Apache failed to locate either Comanches or Ute. In 1724 a critical nine-day battle was fought at El Gran Cerro del Fierro (Great Mountain of Iron), resulting in a major defeat for the Apache. Within a few years, the last Apache settlements along the upper Arkansas River had disappeared. New Mexico historian Sherry Robinson doubts that the nine-day battle actually occurred. \\"The hatred was real but probably not the battle. The teller of this tale, decades after it allegedly occurred, was the Apache-hating Texas Governor Domingo Cabello y Robles. Lipan anthropologist Enrique Maestas dismisses the story as folklore or one of many battles between Apaches and Comanches. Anthropologist Morris Opler wrote that 'authenticated nine-day battles between tribes are not too common in American Indian annals. Yet this bit of recorded hearsay — far removed in time and space from the putative event— has been cited with all earnestness again and again.'\\" Robinson, Sherry. I Fought a Good Fight: A History of the Lipan Apaches (p. 56). University of North Texas Press. =Ute= By 1730, the Comanches, still living north of the Arkansas, controlled the Texas Panhandle, central Texas and northeastern New Mexico. At about this time, the alliance between the Comanches and the Ute collapsed, marking the beginning of a fifty- year war. Their warfare was sporadic, and never reached the intensity of the struggle with the Apache. At first the Ute held their own, but as the full weight of the Comanche came to bear, they were forced to retreat from the plains into their mountain strongholds. By 1749, the Ute were asking the Spanish for protection against Comanches, and in 1750, they entered into an alliance with the Jicarilla against their common enemy. Although the warfare between the Ute and Comanche continued until 1786, groups of the Kotsoteka felt confident enough during the 1740s to cross the Arkansas River and move into northeast New Mexico. Other Comanche groups followed after 1750 and settled on the perimeter of the Staked Plains of the Texas Panhandle. However, large numbers of Yamparika and Jupe remained north of the Arkansas until the early 19th century. As the Ute gave ground, the Comanche became dominant, and constituted a serious problem for New Mexico. During the late 1720s, groups of Plains Apache (friendly with the Spanish) had chosen to settle near the Rio Grande pueblos rather than retreat farther south. =New Mexico= In 1725 the Spanish had noted that the Comanches were still using dogs for transport. By 1735 this was no longer the case, and the Comanches had more than enough horses for their own needs. However, they were now supplying them to other plains tribes through trade. The level of horse thefts by Comanches bothered the Spanish, but was bearable, and the trade with Comanches for buffalo robes and slaves was important for the New Mexican economy, so the Spanish continued to trade, but a military expedition was dispatched in 1742 which unsuccessfully tried to stop the raids. In the early 1720s the Comanche began trading with the French. After the French arranged a peace between the Comanches and Wichita in 1747 (reconfirmed in 1750), the exchange of French trade goods for Comanche horses expanded rapidly. In Texas the Comanche and Wichita defeated a Spanish expedition in 1759 in the Battle of the Two Villages. The Spanish in New Mexico also became alarmed, as the Comanches were now armed with French firearms, which they paid for with horses and mules stolen in New Mexico. Beginning with the Comanche raid on Pecos in 1746, New Mexico was under siege. For the next forty years Comanche raids struck virtually every place in Spanish New Mexico. Both Taos (1760) and Pecos (1746, 1750, 1773, and 1775) were attacked by the Comanche. Some of the Comanche continued to trade peacefully, as the Comanche were not a unified tribe, but several independent divisions, each with the power to make war or peace. Another Spanish military campaign against the Comanche in 1768 ended in frustration. The Comanche had blocked Spanish expansion to the east from New Mexico and prevented direct communication with the new Spanish settlements in Texas. The Spanish enjoyed their first military success against the Comanche in 1774 when a combined force of 600 soldiers, militia, and Pueblo Indians under Carlos Fernandez attacked a Comanche village near Spanish Peaks (Raton, New Mexico) capturing over one hundred prisoners. In 1779 the new governor of New Mexico, Juan Bautista de Anza, organized a 500-man army with 200 Ute and Apache auxiliaries. His campaign captured a large Comanche village, and, in a later battle, killed Green Horn (Cuerno Verde), an important leader of the Comanche raiders. Raids dropped off noticeably but did not halt entirely. In the summer of 1785, De Anza let it be known that he was interested in making peace with the Comanches if they could agree on a single leader to represent them. The idea took root and received a major push when the Texas Comanche signed a peace treaty that autumn with Texas Governor Domingo Cabello. Among the New Mexico Comanche, the main opposition to peace was a parabio named White Bull (Toro Blanco). The Kotsoteka assassinated him and scattered his followers. A meeting of the Kotsoteka, Jupe, and Yamparika gave the power to make peace to Ecueracapa (Leather Cape). After two meetings at Pecos and another in a Comanche camp early in 1786, De Anza sent a signed treaty to Mexico City in July (ratified in October). De Anza also arranged a truce between the Ute and Comanche, while gaining a Comanche alliance with the Spanish against the Apache. For many years, the Comanches remained at peace with New Mexico. Regular trade continued, and the New Mexicans who traded with Comanches became known as Comancheros. This trade relationship lasted well into the 1870s, and persisted even when Comanches used weapons and steel provided by Comancheros to fight enemies living in Texas and northern Mexico. =Lakota, Cheyenne, Arikara, Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage= Although many Comanches had moved south of the Arkansas after 1750, the Yamparika and Jupe bands remained to the north of the Arkansas. As late as 1805, the North Platte was still known as the Padouca Fork, and by this time, Padouca meant Comanche. As late as 1775, the Yamparika were still fighting the Lakota and Cheyenne near the Black Hills and raiding the Arikara villages along the Missouri River. Frequent wars also occurred with the Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage, usually over horses. Comanches usually had more horses than they needed; Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage did not, and dealing with a Comanche horse trader could be frustrating. Often, the solution was to shoot the Comanche (having recently acquired guns from French traders on the Missouri River) and take the horse, and this meant war. Comanches eventually learned how to minimize the advantage of single-shot firearms. Meanwhile, the Pawnee and Osage had their own horses, many of them stolen from Comanches. A major war erupted in 1746 between Comanches and the Osage and Pawnee. In 1750 the Wichita arranged a truce between the Comanches and Pawnee. The immediate effect was to allow the Pawnee and Comanches to ally and defeat the Osage in 1751. Afterwards, the Pawnee left Kansas and moved north to the Platte Valley in Nebraska. At about the same time the Comanches were moving south to the Staked Plains or concentrating closer to the Arkansas River. Despite the physical separation, Pawnees still traveled great distances to steal Comanche horses in Texas and New Mexico. They usually went out on foot and rode back, if successful. The result was more fighting between Comanches and Pawnee (1790–1793 and 1803). In 1832 the Comanches caught some Pawnee raiders still on foot near the Arkansas River, and killed every one of them. Although defeated by the Pawnee/Comanche alliance in 1751, the Osage continued to expand west during the last half of the 18th century. In the process, there were several wars and regular skirmishes with Comanches. The tall Osage usually got the worst of it when they fought Comanches, and lost another war in 1791. In 1797 Comanches destroyed an entire Osage village near the Kansas-Missouri border. =Kiowa= From the times when they had lived along the upper Platte in Wyoming, Comanches had known and occasionally fought with the Kiowa. Before 1765, the Kiowa had lived in or near the Black Hills of South Dakota, but soon after this they were displaced by Lakota migrating from east of the Missouri River. The Kiowa were forced to move south, first to the upper Platte, then across it into Kansas, and finally the southern plains near the Arkansas River. The move put them in competition for territory with Comanches. By 1780, their fighting with the Yamparika and Jupe had become serious, although each respected the other's bravery and fighting abilities. Peace between the Kiowa and Yamparika sprang from a chance meeting (and near battle) at a Spanish trading post, probably around 1805. While the Spanish trader nervously tried to keep them separated, a Kiowa warrior volunteered to go with the Comanches and spend the summer. When he returned unharmed in the autumn, the Kiowa and Yamparika met and made peace. The peace process with other Comanche divisions probably took several more years, but in the end, a lasting alliance was made and never broken. This also extended to the Kiowa's unusual friends, the Kiowa-Apache, who must have sounded a lot like Plains Apache to Comanches when they spoke. =Cheyenne and Arapaho= The other major alliance for the Comanches was with the southern branches of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The area of the central plains vacated by the departure of the Pawnee and Comanches was soon occupied by groups of Cheyenne and Arapaho. At first these newcomers were harassed by just about everyone: Comanches, Kiowa, Pawnee, and Ute, all of whom still claimed the area as hunting territory. With so many enemies, the Cheyenne and Arapaho first formed their own alliance and fought all comers. One of the things that had attracted them south was trade: first with the Spanish in New Mexico, and then with the Americans. Raiding Mexico: 1779-1870 See: Comanche-Mexico Wars Comanche raids into Mexico usually started in Big Spring, Texas and penetrated by several routes deep into Mexico. Querétaro is south of Big Spring. The Comanche raided south of the Rio Grande as early as 1779, their target being the Lipan Apache. In the 1820s the long-term peace the Comanche had forged with Spanish colonies in New Mexico and Texas began to come apart. The newly independent Mexican state could not defend its northern outposts, nor provide the Comanche the yearly tribute to which they were accustomed. Beginning in 1826, responding to the increased threat, the government of Nuevo Leon forbade its citizens in the northern portions of the state to travel in the countryside except in groups of at least 30 armed and mounted men.Adams, David B. Ëmbattled Borderland: Northern Nuevo León and the Indios Bárbaros, 1686-1870\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Oct 1991), pp 205-220 Large scale raids began in 1840 and continued until 1870. The Comanche and their allies, the Kiowa, raided hundreds of miles south of the border, killing thousands of people and stealing hundreds of thousands of head of livestock. In 1848, traveler Josiah Gregg said that \\"the whole country from New Mexico to the borders of Durango is almost entirely depopulated. The haciendas and ranchos have been mostly abandoned, and the people chiefly confined to the towns and cities.\\"Hamalainen, Pekka, The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale U Press, 2009, p. 232 The northern states of Mexico and the soldiers and militia they could muster were left on their own to deal with the Comanche raids. The national government of Mexico was \\"too incapacitated by fiscal insolvency, civil war, and, ultimately, foreign intervention\\"Adams, David B. (Oct 1992), \\"Embattled Borderland: Northern Nuevo León and the Indios Bárbaros, 1686-1870,\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 95, No. 2 p. 220 to assist the north. Texas and the United States: 1800-1850 With the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Americans acquired territory that included a portion of Comancheria, but during the next twenty years, American penetration of the Great Plains focused on the fur trade of the Missouri River. On the southern Plains, French traders, now American citizens, continued their contacts with Wichita and Comanches. They were soon joined by an increasing number of Americans. Since much of the trade was conducted through the Wichita, Comanches remained distant and mysterious. American Indian agents in Louisiana were urged to make contacts with the \\"Hietans.\\" Several incidents in Texas, including the killing of the son of a Yamparika chief in 1803, almost led to war, but the intervention of the western Comanches maintained peace. In both Texas and New Mexico, Comanches joined with the Spanish army to fight Apaches. The most noteworthy success was when they helped General Ugaldi crush the Lipan in southern Texas (1789–90). The Lipan were badly mauled, and retreated across the Rio Grande into northern Mexico, but this was not beyond the reach of Comanches who continued to attack them for many years. During the last years of Spanish rule, Texas was in chaos. The Hidalgo Revolt (1810) was followed by an attempt by American and Mexican adventurers to seize Texas (1812–13). American traders along the Red and Arkansas Rivers were trading guns to Comanches for horses, and this new market increased the tempo of Comanche raids in Texas. A Comanche chief, El Sordo, split from his own people in 1810 and gathered a combination of Comanches and Wichita to raid Texas and Mexico for horses. He was arrested during a visit to Béxar in 1811 and imprisoned in Coahuila. A large Comanche war party went to Béxar to demand an explanation, only to be confronted by 600 Spanish soldiers. There was no battle, but relations between Texas and the Comanches were never the same. Spanish rule was replaced by that of the Mexican Republic in 1821. The following year Francisco Ruiz arranged a truce with the Texas Comanche followed by a treaty of friendship signed in Mexico City in December. However, Mexico did not have the means to provide the gifts it had promised, and raiding resumed within two years. The Comanche peace with New Mexico disintegrated, and by 1825 there was war along the entire length of the Rio Grande. Chihuahua was hit particularly hard. Treaties signed at Chihuahua and El Paso (1826 and 1834) with the Comanches did not halt the raids. In 1831, New Mexico temporarily suspended Comanchero trading and stopped the cibolero (New Mexico buffalo hunters), but this also had little effect. After the end of Spanish rule of Mexico in 1821, Anglo-Americans began to settle in Texas, increasing contact with the Comanches and other tribes. The Santa Fe Trail opened that year, between Missouri and Santa Fe. Contact between the anglos and Comanches was almost always friendly. There were exceptions, and as the most powerful tribe in the area, the Comanche were sometimes blamed for the actions of other tribes, such as the Wichitas, Pawnee and Osage. During the 1830s, the major trading center on the southern Plains was Bent's Fort, an American trading post on the Arkansas River in southeast Colorado. Although married to a Cheyenne woman, William Bent also traded with Kiowa and Yamparika, and became tired of the aggravation of keeping them apart when they came to trade. At his suggestion, the Cheyenne and Arapaho decided to meet with their adversaries, and a lasting peace was arranged between them. The \\"Great Peace of 1840\\", a landmark of southern Plains diplomacy, was cemented by the gift of large numbers of Yamparika and Kiowa horses to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. In 1835 Sonora re-established its bounties for scalps. Chihuahua and Durango followed, but by the 1840s, Comanche war parties were ranging all over northern Mexico, some staying for as long as three months. Comanche war parties usually found easy victims in Texas, and when Americans began to settle there after 1821, Comanches did not distinguish between Anglo and Hispanic settlers. In 1833, Sam Houston arrived in Texas as a United States representative to arrange a treaty with the Texas Comanches. There were some meetings, but Mexican officials began to wonder what he was doing in their country arranging a treaty with their Comanches, and he was asked to leave. Soon after Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836, Houston became president of the new republic. In May 1836 (less than three months after the Battle of the Alamo), over 500 Comanche and Kiowa warriors approached Fort Parker located 100 miles south of Dallas. Feigning a desire for peaceful trade, the Comanche initiated hostilities and killed five men and captured two women and three children in what became known as the Fort Parker massacre. A 9-year-old girl, Cynthia Ann Parker, was captured and spent most of the rest of her life with the Comanche, marrying a Chief, Peta Nocona, and giving birth to a son, Quanah Parker, who would become the last Chief of the Comanches. The remainder of the Fort Parker residents made a long trek to Fort Houston, ninety miles to the south. In May 1838, Texas signed a treaty of peace and friendship with the Comanches, but the treat did not address the Comanches' main concern, a line between Comancheria and the white settlements. In the absence of an agreement on this, the whites steadily encroached, and the Comanches continued to raid. Houston wanted to set a line but was replaced in December by Mirabeau B. Lamar, a man determined to deal with problems with Indians by war. In March 1840, a meeting between Texan officials and Comanche chiefs was held in San Antonio, under a flag of truce, to negotiate the release of thirteen known kidnap victims, mainly women and children, taken by Comanches during the previous ten years of Mexican rule. The chiefs met with the commissioners in the council house, while the accompanying Comanches waited under guard in the Court House yard. The Comanches brought a single captive to the meeting, claiming that the others had been sold on to other tribes. This was disputed by the captive, Matilda Lockhart, who said that other prisoners were being held for later ransoms. The commissioners were outraged, and the negotiations collapsed. Soldiers surrounded the council house to take the Comanche leaders hostage for exchange with the white captives still held. The Comanche chiefs tried to escape, and the Texans killed them. Fierce fighting between the Texans and the Comanches outside soon spread, leading to the deaths of thirty-three Comanches and six Texans. The Comanches were outraged by the killing of their chiefs under a flag of truce. Hundreds of warriors approached San Antonio screaming their rage, but remained just beyond rifle-range. Then, suddenly, they were gone, and the Texans thought the crisis had passed. The Comanches had left to plan retaliation. When they got back to their camps, they killed many of the white prisoners they were planning to exchange. Thirty-two Comanches, mostly women, had been taken prisoner. Negotiations led to the release of five white children in exchange for five Comanches. The remaining prisoners were strictly guarded for a time, but the guard was later relaxed, and all eventually escaped. In August, several hundred Comanche warriors raided the heart of eastern Texas. Homes were burned, hundreds were killed, and before they stopped, the Comanches had reached the Gulf of Mexico near Victoria. Then, loaded with loot, the war party began an atypical slow retreat to the north. Perhaps because of their numbers, the Comanches were overconfident, but this gave the Texans time to organize. With the help of Tonkawa scouts, Texas militia ambushed the main body in the Battle of Plum Creek at Lockhart, Texas. Abandoning most of their spoils, the surviving Comanches escaped north. Afterwards, they would never again give the Texans such an easy target. The Anglos in Texas were Americans, and the only reasons they had not been annexed by the United States in 1836 were northern Congressional resistance to another slave state and a dispute with Mexico over the southern boundary of Texas. While waiting for admission, the Texans in 1839 expelled the Cherokee, Shawnee, and most of the Delaware that the Mexican government had encouraged to settle in eastern Texas to keep Americans out in the first place. Houston was re-elected president and set about repairing the damage done by Lamar's administration. He not only had to deal with Comanches, but a second war with Mexico (1841–42). Without resources for a standing army, Texas created small ranger companies mounted on fast horses to pursue and fight Comanches on their own terms. Eventually armed with the first Colt revolvers, the Texas Rangers enjoyed considerable success against Comanches during the 1840s. However, Houston wanted peace, not war, and he was trusted by Comanches. A treaty between the Republic of Texas and Texas Comanches was signed October, 1845 and ratified in December. It established a line of trading houses which would later function as the line between Texas and Comancheria, but this deliberately vague definition would be the source of future troubles. Spain had been an ally of the Americans for much of the Revolutionary War, but after the rebel triumph in 1783, had become concerned about the territorial ambitions of the new United States. Its fears proved justified as American settlement swept across the Appalachians into the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. To supply horses and mules for these immigrants, American traders were soon looking to the southern plains and were dealing with Comanches and Wichita. Dr. John Sibley had the first official meeting with a Comanche \\"principal chief\\" in 1807 at Natchitoches. He gave presents, and later licensed an American trader for them. Other licenses followed. One of his successors, John Jamison, had other visits from Comanche chiefs in 1816 and 1817. These contacts and trading licenses were viewed with alarm in Spanish Texas. The traders not only sold firearms to Comanches and Wichitas, but provided a ready market for stolen horses and mules. American problems with Comanches began during the 1820s with the relocation of tribes from east of the Mississippi River to Kansas and Oklahoma. The problem at first was not much with Comanches, but with the Osage, whose territory was directly affected. To defend themselves against the Osage, the Delaware, Fox, Sauk, Cherokee and others began to consider alliances with Comanches and other Plains tribes. However, when the newcomers began hunting west of their new homes, they came into conflict with Comanches. To preclude the possibility widespread warfare, Colonel Henry Dodge led a large force of dragoons from Fort Gibson to western Oklahoma during the summer of 1835 as a show of force and to meet the Comanches. In August, the Hois (with the Wichita) signed the Camp Holmes Treaty with American representatives, pledging peace and friendship with the Osage, Quapaw, Seneca, Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek. The treaty also reflected another American concern and guaranteed safe passage on the Santa Fé trail. Within a year the Comanches regretted this agreement, and had destroyed their copy. When the United States annexed Texas in 1846, it inherited its problem with Comanche raiding and a boundary line between the settlements and Comancheria. An immediate step by the United States was to announce its authority and sign a treaty with the Comanches and other Texas tribes to replace the Texas treaty of the previous year. This was done in May 1846 on the upper Brazos River (Butler-Lewis Treaty). Signed by the Penateka/Hois Comanches (also Ioni, Anadarko, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Wichita, and Waco), the treaty promised, besides peace and friendship, trading posts, a visit by a Comanche delegation to Washington, D.C., and a one-time payment of $18,000 in goods. A boundary line was alluded to, but not defined. The Comanche delegation went east shortly afterwards and met President James K. Polk, but with the Mexican War just beginning, Congress had more important concerns, and the Senate adjourned without ratifying the treaty. By the time the treaty was amended and ratified in March 1847, the Comanches were certain they had been betrayed. War was averted only when traders and Indian agents advanced credit to send part of the promised gifts. When the amendments were read to the Comanches, the meeting almost ended, but eventually they agreed to the changes. Additional money was appropriated for more gifts, but once again, a boundary line was never established. Meanwhile, there was a serious question over whose responsibility it was to deal with the Texas tribes, the federal or the state government. The problem was not settled until after the Civil War. In the interim, policy was set by both, and this was confusing, so the 1846 peace treaty brought very little peace to Texas. In May 1847, Texas allowed the German settlers near Fredericksburg and New Braunfels to make their own treaty with the Texas Comanches. In exchange for land, the Germans promised a trading post and gifts. Unfortunately, the Germans not only encroached beyond the agreed boundary, but were slow to pay, and in response the Comanches made raids. A boundary line was eventually set by the Texas governor but was to be enforced by the American army which had taken over the line of Texas forts on the frontier. Army commanders felt they had no authority to enforce state laws, and meanwhile, Texas continued to operate its ranger companies, which were not under federal control, as military units. The Rangers did nothing to prevent encroachment on Comanche lands but would retaliate if the new settlements beyond the line were attacked. To make matters worse, only the Penateka had signed the 1846 treaty. The Nokoni, Tenawa, and other Comanches did not consider themselves bound by the agreement and continued to raid in Texas. On the other side of Comancheria, many things had changed with the beginning of the Mexican War in 1846. An American army under General Stephen W. Kearny seized Santa Fé and moved on to California. The Santa Fé Trail became a heavily-travelled military supply route, and forts were built to protect it. Five companies of Missouri volunteers were sent to garrison these posts during the summer of 1847 and quickly became engaged in fights with Plains Indians. At least one of these at Fort Mann involved the Pawnee. In the other cases, the fights were probably with Kiowa, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, and the amount of Comanche involvement is uncertain. The first part of 1848 was relatively calm, and during that year, Texas Comanches even provided guides for the survey of the route of the new Butterfield (California) trail across southern Texas to El Paso and California. The calm changed suddenly with the California Gold Rush. As thousands of gold-seekers raced west, they needed horses, and the Comanches moved to meet this new demand. Horse raids increased in Texas, but the major target was northern Mexico. Comanche raids struck deep into Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Durango, reaching their peak during 1852 when they struck Tepic in Jalisco, south of the border at El Paso. To protect the immigrant routes across the plains, the United States called the \\"Peace on the Plains\\" conference at Fort Laramie (Wyoming) in 1851. This was an attempt to end, or at least limit, intertribal warfare by defining boundaries between tribal territories. Almost every plains tribe attended and signed the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, and received gifts. The Comanches and Kiowa did not attend. A smallpox epidemic had broken out in their villages, and there was a deep distrust of the northern tribes. Since the Santa Fé Trail was a vital route, it was essential to reach an agreement with them. As the southern Plains tribes gathered around Fort Atkinson for the distribution of the annuities from the Fort Laramie treaty, large groups of Kiowa and Comanches also came, and they were not in a good mood. Eventually, 6,000 to 9,000 Indians were gathered in the vicinity, and the situation was becoming dangerous. The American agent took it upon himself to distribute $9,000 in gifts to the Comanches and Kiowa, and in 1853 the Kiowa and Yamparika signed their own treaty at Fort Atkinson. In return for safe passage and a promise to stop raiding in Mexico, the United States agreed to pay those tribes $18,000 per year for ten years. United States: 1850-1900 A Comanche camp in 1871. There were several reasons the Comanches and Kiowas had been angry in 1852. The first was they had recently been devastated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera. Their first experience with smallpox had been an epidemic (1780–81) so severe that it caused the disappearance of some Comanche divisions. The Comanche were hit again by smallpox during the winter of 1816–17. The wave of immigration from the California Gold Rush first brought smallpox (1848) and then cholera (1849) to the Great Plains. These were devastating to every plains tribe, but especially to the Comanches and Kiowa. The government census estimated a drop in the Comanches' 1849 population of 20,000 to 12,000 by 1851, and the Comanches never recovered from this loss. Smallpox struck again from New Mexico during 1862 and is believed to have been equally devastating. Cholera returned in 1867. By 1870, the Comanches numbered less than 8,000, and their numbers were still dropping rapidly. The Comanches kept their promise for safe passage on the Santa Fe Trail, but remained angry about events in Texas. White settlement was steadily taking more and more of Comancheria, and the Texas Rangers were still attacking them. As the frontier advanced, the American army had built a new line of forts, followed by a third line. At first these had been manned by infantry, and the Comanche simply by-passed them. Within a few years, the infantry was replaced by new light-cavalry regiments. In all, it took three lines of forts and most of the army's pre- Civil War strength to keep the Comanches out of Texas. Even more aggravating from the Comanches' point of view were posts like Fort Stockton at Comanche Springs, which were intended to block the \\"Great Comanche War Trail\\" leading to northern Mexico. The Americans were required by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to prevent raids into Mexico. Between 1848 and 1853, Mexico filed 366 separate claims for Comanche and Apache raids originating from north of the border. Not all efforts to deal with the Texas Comanches were limited to military force. In 1854 the Texas legislature provided 23,000 acres (93 km²) for the United States to established three reservations on the upper Brazos River for the Texas tribes. Besides Caddo, Delaware, Wichita, and Tonkawa, the United States Indian agent, Robert Neighbors, convinced some Penateka Comanche to move to these locations. Camp Cooper (commanded in 1856 by LTC Robert E. Lee) was built nearby. Almost immediately, local settlers began to accuse the reservation tribes of stealing horses and other depredations. Many of these accusations were either exaggerations, lies, or referred to raids by Comanches from the Staked Plains. The situation became dangerous in 1858 after the army abandoned Camp Cooper. During the spring of 1859, a mob of 250 settlers attacked the reservation, but were repulsed. As the United States Indian Agent, Robert Neighbors was hated by local Texans. Rather than fight them, he arranged to close the reservations and move the residents to Indian Territory. The peaceful Penateka were forced to leave Texas, along with tribes that had never fought Texans, including the Tonkawa, Caddo, and Delaware, who had served loyally as scouts for the Texas Rangers. After leaving his charges at the new Wichita agency at Anadarko, Neighbors started back to his home in Texas. He never made it. Near Belknap, Texas he was ambushed and shot in the back. After its victory against the Brazos reservation, Texas urged the army to make greater efforts against Comanches beyond its borders. Texas Rangers had discovered that Kiowa and Comanches were using the Indian Territory as a sanctuary from which to raid in Texas and then elude pursuit. Between 1858 and 1860, the army's new light-cavalry regiments were used for an offensive against Comanches in Oklahoma. In May, 1858 Colonel John Ford's Texas Rangers, ignoring the state-line, attacked a Comanche village on Little Robe Creek. Three months later his Caddo, Delaware, and Tonkawa scouts were expelled from Texas as undesirables. In October, 1858 Captain Earl Van Dorn attacked a Comanche village at Rush Springs killing 83. The following May, Van Dorn struck the Comanches at Crooked Creek in Kansas. The result of this offensive by the army and Rangers was to cause trouble elsewhere. Attacked from Texas, Comanches and Kiowa separated into small bands and moved north near the Santa Fé Trail. In response to increased Indian attacks on the trail during the summer of 1860, three columns of cavalry were sent into the area on a punitive expedition. In July, the command of Captain Samuel D. Sturgis made a major contact. After an eight-day chase, he fought a battle with Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and, presumably, some Comanches. When federal soldiers withdrew east at the beginning of the Civil War, Confederates replaced them. Albert Pike, the Confederate Indian agent, signed two treaties with Comanches in August, 1861; one with the Penateka, and a second with the Nokoni, Yamparika, Tenawa, and Kotsoteka. Besides the usual promises of peace and friendship, the Comanches were promised a large amount of goods and services. Because the Confederacy needed every cent it had to fight the war, the Comanches never received what was promised. When Texas sent its men east to fight for the Confederacy, most of the old federal army posts were abandoned. With the frontier defenseless and the Confederate treaty promises unfulfilled, Comanches began raids intended to drive settlement back. The Texas frontier retreated over during the Civil War, and northern Mexico was hit by a new wave of Comanche raids. The war also provided the Comanches with an opportunity to seek revenge against the Tonkawa. and not just for their service as scouts with the Texas Rangers; the Texas Comanches had a special hatred for the Tonkawa ever since they had killed and eaten the brother of one of their chiefs. The Comanches were not a gentle people, but they found cannibalism repulsive. After Texas Indian agents had taken over administration of the Wichita Agency in Oklahoma, Comanches participated in an attack on the agency (October, 1862) by pro-Union Delaware and Shawnee from Kansas. When it was over, 300 Tonkawa had been massacred. The survivors crossed the Red River and settled near Fort Griffin. In the years following, they would exact their revenge by serving as army scouts against the Comanches. After 1861 Comanches, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapaho almost succeeded in closing the Santa Fé Trail. When federal officials at Fort Wise learned the Comanches had signed treaties with the Confederacy, they were certain that they had become hostile. While the rest of the nation was bleeding itself to death on eastern battlefields, the ranks of the Union army on the frontier were filled with men who were unemployed, did not wish to fight in the war, and hated Indians. By the fall of 1863, the performance of these \\"soldiers\\" had provoked a general alliance between the Lakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanches, and Kiowa-Apache. In the autumn of 1864, Colonel Kit Carson was sent at the head of a column from Fort Bascom, New Mexico into the Staked Plains to chastise the Comanches and Kiowa. His Jicarilla and Ute scouts located their camps on November 24. Carson had found more Comanches and Kiowa than he could chastise, and the First Battle of Adobe Walls came very close to being \\"Carson's Last Stand.\\" Only the skillful use of artillery kept the Yamparika and Kiowa from massing and overrunning his position. Afterwards, Carson returned to New Mexico and left the chastising of Comanches to others. In the final days of the Civil War, the Confederacy made a final attempt to exploit the hostility of the plains tribes that had been provoked by the federal volunteers. In May, 1865 a council was held on the Washita River in western Oklahoma. It was well attended by the Comanches and other tribes, but Robert E. Lee had surrendered in Virginia two- weeks previously, and the Confederacy was finished. That summer, while the Union celebrated its victory, the plains were in turmoil. The Santa Fé and Overland trails were closed, and virtually every plains tribe was at war with the United States. As federal troops began to re-occupy their posts in Texas, the Great Plains and Indian Territory, government commissioners met with the plains tribes in October on the Little Arkansas River near Wichita to arrange a peace. The Little Arkansas Treaty gave the Comanches and Kiowa western Oklahoma, the entire Texas Panhandle, and promised annuities of $15 per person for forty years. Of the Comanche divisions, only the Yamparika, Nokoni, Penateka, and Tenewa had taken part in the agreement; the Kwahada and Kotsoteka had not. The Kiowa-Apache did not sign the Comanche-Kiowa version but asked to be included under the Cheyenne-Arapaho treaty. This served as an indication of how unstable the situation was. When the annuities arrived, there was widespread disappointment. The Comanches had expected guns, ammunition, and quality goods; what they got were rotten civil war rations and cheap blankets that fell apart in the rain. The peace was soon violated by both sides, and war resumed for another two years. It was a bitter struggle, and General William Sherman finally ordered the army not to pay ransom for white captives held by Indians to avoid giving them incentive for further kidnappings. While the army was making its own plans to deal with the hostiles by force, the federal government decided to make one final effort to resolve the conflict through treaty. The result was a milestone peace conference held at Medicine Lodge Creek in southern Kansas (October, 1867). In exchange for a wagon train of gifts brought by the commissioners and the payment of annual annuities, the Comanches and Kiowa signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty exchanging Comancheria for a 3 million acre (12,000 km²) reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. The arrangement did not work as intended. Because of an outbreak of cholera in their camps, the Kwahada neither attended the conference nor signed the treaty. Afterwards, they did not consider themselves bound by the Medicine Lodge Treaty, and chose to stay on the Staked Plains. Most of the other Comanches moved to the vicinity of Fort Cobb and remained on the reservation for the winter, but since the treaty was not yet ratified, there was no money to pay for rations. After a hungry winter, most of the Comanches and Kiowa left Fort Cobb, and returned to the plains during the summer of 1868. Once again raids were made into Texas and Kansas, and the new reservation was used as a sanctuary to prevent pursuit by the army. Even Fort Dodge was attacked, and its horses stolen. The frustrated Indian agent at Fort Cobb resigned and went east, leaving the mess in the hands of his assistant. The treaty was ratified in July, and funds were made available, but the responsibility for the administration of annuities was placed with the army. After all tribes were ordered to report to Fort Cobb or be considered hostile, General Philip Sheridan set plans in motion for the winter campaign of 1868–69 against the hostiles in western Oklahoma and the Staked Plains. LTC George Custer and the 7th Cavalry attacked a southern Cheyenne village on the Washita River in November, and Major Andrew Evans struck a Comanche village at Soldiers Spring on Christmas Day. Afterwards, most of the Comanches and other tribes still on the plains returned to the agencies. In March, 1869 the Comanche-Kiowa agency was relocated to Fort Sill and the Cheyenne-Arapaho agency to Darlington. Only the Kwahada were still on the Staked Plains. The Kiowa and other Comanches were on the reservation, but by the fall of 1869 small war parties were occasionally leaving to raid in Texas. During one of these raids near Jacksboro (May, 1871), the Kiowa almost killed William Sherman, commanding general of the American army. \\"Great Warrior\\" Sherman was conducting an inspection tour of western posts, when a Kiowa war party noticed his lone ambulance and small escort. They chose instead to attack a nearby supply train. When Sherman learned of his narrow escape, he was furious and proceeded directly to Fort Sill. When he discovered the Kiowa chiefs were openly bragging about the latest raid, he ordered their arrest and sent them to Texas for trial. After a Texas court sentenced them to life imprisonment, the Comanches and Kiowa launched a series of retaliatory raids that killed more than 20 Texans in 1872. At the same time, Texas civilians stole 1,900 horses from the tribes at Fort Sill. Meanwhile, the army in Texas was trying to deal with the raids from the reservation and massive thefts of Texas cattle by the Kwahada for sale to New Mexico Comancheros. In October, 1871 a raid led by Quanah Parker stole seventy horses from the army at Rock Station. The commanding officer, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, did not take this lightly. For the next two years, Mackenzie and his black cavalry troopers ranged the Staked Plains chasing the Kwahada. The campaign ended with an attack on a Comanche village at McClellan Creek (September, 1872). Mackenzie captured 130 women and children and held them hostage at Fort Concho. This slowed the raiding while the Comanches negotiated for their release. In April, 1873 they were released and sent under escort to Fort Sill. A detour had to be made around Jacksboro to prevent a riot. At the request of the Secretary of the Interior, Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis paroled the Kiowa chiefs in October after they had served only two years on the condition that the raiding stop. The Kiowa were grateful, but an occasional war party still slipped off the reservation, crossed the Red River, and headed south into Texas. =Buffalo hunting= Meanwhile, the great slaughter of the plains buffalo had begun. Between 1865 and 1875, the number of buffalo on the Great Plains fell from fifteen million to less than one million. Unofficially sanctioned by army commanders who issued free ammunition to hunters, it destroyed the basis for the plains tribes' way of life. During the winter of 1873–74, Cheyenne hunters returned to the Darlington agency to report that Kansas buffalo hunters were destroying the southern buffalo herds. As this news spread, violence erupted at the Darlington and Wichita agencies, which had to be put down by troops. Afterwards, large groups of Cheyenne left the reservation and headed for the plains. At first the Comanches and Kiowa thought the Cheyenne were mistaken, but their story of the plains littered with dead buffalo was eventually confirmed. =Second Battle of Adobe Walls= In December, the government decided to deal harshly with the Kiowa and Comanches to end the raids in Texas. The agent at Fort Sill was ordered to limit rations and suspend the distribution of ammunition. A sense of general panic set in, and by May several groups of Comanches and Kiowa had left the reservation. At first they were uncertain what to do. Several Comanches had recently been killed in Texas by Tonkawa scouts, and some of the first thoughts were of revenge. However, the agent had learned of their departure and purpose and had alerted the army. After some discussion, a decision was made to attack the buffalo hunters on the Staked Plains. In June, 1874 a large Comanche-Cheyenne war party attacked twenty-three buffalo hunters camped in the Texas Panhandle at the site of Carson's 1864 battle at Adobe Walls. The Second Battle of Adobe Walls marked the beginning of the Buffalo War (or Red River War) (1874–75), the last great Indian war on the southern plains. After the initial rush failed, the Comanches came under fire from the hunters' long-range buffalo guns and were forced to retire. The uprising spread rapidly as more warriors left the agencies and joined the hostiles on the Staked Plains. To halt this, soldiers began to disarm the Comanches and Kiowa who had remained on the agencies. In August, groups of Penateka were peacefully drawing rations at the Wichita agency when soldiers stationed at the agency demanded they surrender their weapons. When this was refused, a fight broke out and the Comanches fled, but the agency was under siege for the next two days until it was relieved by troops from Fort Sill. By September only 500 Kiowa and Comanche were still on the reservation; the others were out on the Staked Plains. That same month the army began to move. Three converging columns moved into the heart of the Staked Plains. Trapped between them, the Comanches, Kiowa, and Cheyenne had little rest. Colonel Nelson A. Miles' column made the first contact and defeated a group of Cheyenne near McClellan Creek. For the Comanches, Cheyenne, and Kiowa, the major blow occurred when Mackenzie located a mixed camp hidden in Palo Duro Canyon (September 26–27). After driving off the warriors during a short battle on September 28, he burned the camp and killed 2,000 captured horses. There were few other encounters, but the relentless pressure and pursuit throughout the fall and winter had its effect. Starving, the remaining Comanches, Kiowa, and Cheyenne began to return to the agencies, mostly on foot because they had been forced to eat their horses. By December there were 900 on the Fort Sill reservation. In April, 200 Kwahada, who had never submitted, surrendered at Fort Sill. In June the last 400 Kwahada, including Isatai'i and Quanah Parker, surrendered. The war was over. Mackenzie disposed of many of the Comanche and Kiowa horses. After giving 100 to his Tonkawa scouts, he sold 1,600 horses and mules for $22,000. The proceeds were used to buy sheep and goats for his former enemies. By 1879, the buffalo were gone. That year, the Kiowa-Comanche and Wichita agencies were merged into a single agency. Always pragmatic, the Comanches adjusted, but in typical Comanche style. Taking advantage of his Texas heritage, Quanah Parker emerged as an important Comanche leader. He collected tolls on cattle herds that used the Chisholm Trail to cross the reservation and sold grazing rights to nearby Texas ranchers. Few argued with him about price. With his five wives he moved into a large comfortable house, called the \\"Star House.\\" It had eight large stars painted on the roof to insure he had more stars than any U.S. army general. He was elected a sheriff and served as a tribal judge. By the time he rode in Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural parade in 1905, Quanah had amassed 100 horses, 1,000 cattle, and of cultivated farmland.

In 1905, the city held a contest for the design of a new town hall (see right), as the old one built in 1727 had become too small.

It was broadcast in syndication between 1986 and 1989.Terrace, Vincent (2009). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2007 (Volume 1). Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc. . The series combines sci-fi stories with traditional wild west themes. It is one of the first anime-style shows produced mainly in the United States, although the actual animation was done by the Japanese animation studio Tokyo Movie Shinsha. At the time it aired, The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers was considered a revolutionary children's show. Plot The show is set in the future, some time after the year 2086, when two aliens from the planets Andor and Kirwin travel to Earth to search for allies against the expansionist Crown Empire led by the Queen of the Crown. In return for the help, the two aliens gave mankind construction plans for a hyperdrive device. After this key event in human history, interstellar travel flourished and a huge number of colonies emerged in distant star- systems. Alongside the growth of human activities in space, criminal activities also grew, and the new colonies required defense against various threats, including the Crown Empire. A group known as \\"BETA\\" (Bureau for Extra-Terrestrial Affairs) was founded to cope with these tasks, with a \\"Ranger\\" division being a part of it. BETA is shown to be the major military and exploratory arm of Earth. The organization's headquarters are on Earth. BETA sustains several bases on and around Earth, such as the Longshot Research Facility in the Grand Canyon and the BETA space station in Earth's orbit. Most of the colonies portrayed in the show specialized in either agriculture or mining \\"star stones\\". Many of the planets on the show have names that evoke ideas of a Western setting, Nebraska, Mesa, Ozark, and Prairie being a few. After the catalyst first episode, \\"Phoenix\\", where one of the main characters, Zachary Foxx, loses his wife to the Queen of the Crown, he puts together a group called the Galaxy Rangers, dedicated to providing law and order across the new frontier, ultimately trying to get rid of the Crown Empire. Each ranger is equipped with an experimental piece of tech called the Series-5 to boost natural abilities. The Series-5 Brain Implant, or S5, is implied to be the closest mankind will ever get to merging with cybernetics. The S5 implant enables a dramatic boost of innate abilities due to its unique conversion of bio-electrical power generated by alpha radiation stored within the badges worn by the Galaxy Rangers. The Crown Empire, also known as the \\"Crown,\\" is ruled by the Queen of the Crown, whose intentions and motivations are described as being evil. She controls a large number of planets in a vast section of the galaxy, all of which she rules as a cruel tyrant. The Queen controls her empire using creatures called Slaver Lords with whom she has a psychic link. Slaver Lords derive their power from the psychic energy of other beings. After the Empire encountered humans, the Queen discovered that they were more suitable for energy extraction than any other previously encountered species. Characters = Zachary Foxx = Zachary Foxx is the captain of the Series-5 Rangers. He was seriously injured in a battle with a space Pirate named Captain Kidd and his entire left side was replaced with bionics, allowing him to fire blasts of energy with his left arm and giving him extraordinary strength. Within Captain Zachary Foxx, the implant's function is simply to act as a power conduit: triggering the badge activates a sequence of events that supercharges his left-side bionics and enables either a boosting of the myomer muscles and tendons, or a channeling of bio-electrical energy through the bionic amplifiers to produce an energy blast of up to 16 standard carbine shots, which makes him capable of blasting a wall apart, spot-welding circuitry, or possibly punching through a ship's hull. He is married and a father of two. His wife's mind was kidnapped by the Queen of the Crown and is contained in a \\"psychocrystal\\". Foxx was voiced by veteran actor Jerry Orbach. = Shane Gooseman = Shane \\"Goose\\" Gooseman was genetically produced in a test tube as part of a government genetic experiment to create a group of enhanced mutant soldiers known as \\"Supertroopers\\". A civilian adviser dosed the Supertroopers with a gas meant to speed up their mutation and make them more powerful, but it had the side effect of making the Supertroopers more aggressive and mentally unstable. Goose was at the firing range at the time, and thus avoided the gas, thereby becoming the only remaining unaffected trooper. The other troopers had to be cryogenically imprisoned, but some escaped. Goose was given the option to avoid cryogenic freezing on the condition that he join the Galaxy Rangers and hunt down the escaped Supertroopers. His Series-5 bionic implants allow him limited control over his body's molecules giving him the ability to heal, absorb energies, and adapt to various environmental conditions by temporary shape-shifting his body to adapt based on his situation or environment. Goose's implant supercharges his genetic bio-defenses, enabling them to react almost instantly, instead of minutes or hours, as would normally happen. This brings him close to the level of the rogue Supertroopers, and makes him the only one capable of going one- on-one with them in personal combat. His characterization is heavily inspired by Clint Eastwood. It is also noted during the show's credits that he is the only Supertrooper with compassion. = Niko = Niko is an archaeologist specializing in ancient cultures and has innate psychic abilities. She carries a large gun and knows martial arts. Her series 5 implant boosts her psychic abilities and she can create shields, lift objects, and has clairvoyance. Niko's implant acts as a psychic amplifier, boosting her innate psychic abilities by adding power from the converted radiation into a psionic boost which can increase her range from simple tactile up to light years distant. She can also generate a shield of ambient energy which will dramatically drain her implant, but can be augmented by touching the other rangers and drawing power from them. This shield can defend against all forms of attack, but cannot be held for long. Throughout the series a romantic tension exists between her and Goose. Born on the failed colony world of Alspeth, she was found after the destruction of her colony by Ariel from the haven world of Xanadu. Having been relocated to her new haven, Niko was raised and her psychic abilities were nurtured. At the age of 19, she left Xanadu to return to her people and joined the Galaxy Rangers. After the academy, she was accepted into the experimental Series-5 program. She was later assigned to the Series 5 Rangers as their mystic and archaeological expert, due to the number of missions they embarked on involving new cultures and varied belief systems. = Walter Hartford = Walter \\"Doc\\" Hartford is a swashbuckling character who fights with a sword, a gun, and his fists. He is a computer genius who, along with the BETA Scientist 'Q-Ball', is responsible for most of the automated systems that the Galaxy Rangers use daily. His Series-5 implants allow him to communicate with and control special programs called 'tweakers', which appear as flying holographic computer animated geometric shapes. Ranger Hartford's implant produces the oddest effects - and they still cannot properly be explained. Commander Walsh puts it best: \\"Doc Hartford, your implant makes you a computer wizard, able to conjure fantastic programs.\\" Doc carries a Computer Diagnostic Unit; a compact computer which has advanced diagnostics and maintenance functions, along with sensory and computer linkage capability. The CDU acts as a focus for Doc's implant power, and also as a storage facility for his \\"tweakers\\" (Pathfinder, Tripwire, Firefly, Searchlight, Lifeline, and Pixel). His \\"tweaker\\" computer programs are part of his personality and offer capabilities far beyond any normal computer program, virus, or worm. His implant gives him control over his \\"tweakers\\" via simple verbal communication, and his \\"tweakers\\" give Doc control over any computer system. Hartford, from the Island of Jamaica, was born to wealthy parents, and so he was educated in private school, topped off with Mrs. Abercrombies Charm and Finishing School. He left there to join the Ranger Corps after he signed up with some biochemical corporations to help them produce better computer programs, but found out that his skills were not being challenged.

Both songs were written and composed by brothers Steve and Chris Overland. DVD releases Entertainment One currently owns the DVD distributions rights to Galaxy Rangers through Koch Vision (and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in several non-US countries). Four Galaxy Rangers DVDs, each containing four episodes, were released in the United States. Koch has released the entire series which consists of two box sets. The first set was released on May 13, 2008 and the second set was released on August 19, 2008 KSM Film in Germany released the series on DVD in 5 episode volumes from May to November 2005, 25 episode volumes from April to August 2006, a complete set (65 episodes over 4 discs) in June 2008 with a Blu-ray (65 episodes on 1 disc) version released in November 2012. The Blu Ray version is presented in standard definition. Reception The show has become a cult favorite and been considered innovative and ahead of its time. It had a unique sense of humor, and each character was well defined, without the trait of clichés to sell toys which was common among shows at that time.

He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1932 in Zurich. He became a professor of philosophy at the Dominican school of theology, Le Saulchoir, in Belgium in 1933. In 1940, he received a doctorate in mathematics with thesis Sur les systèmes différentiels du second ordre qui admettent un groupe continu fini de transformations. Under Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), Fr. Guérard des Lauriers served as a professor at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome.Boersma, Hans. Nouvelle Théologie and Sacramental Ontology, OUP Oxford, 2009, p. 27 Some time prior to 1950, Guérard des Lauriers, O.P., was an advisor to the Pope on the dogma of the Assumption of Mary (proclaimed in Munificentissimus Deus). From 1954 until 1955 he served as personal Father Confessor to Pius XII, before being replaced by Fr. Augustin Bea, S.J. With the advent of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, Guérard des Lauriers became concerned with events taking place in the Church. In 1969 he co-authored the Ottaviani Intervention which was a critical study of the new Mass. In 1970 Pope Paul VI made public a document demanding the resignation of certain conservative professors at the pontifical universities of Rome, among them Guérard des Lauriers. In 1979, worried about Archbishop Lefebvre and a possible deal with Rome among other things, Fr. Lauriers wrote to Lefebvre warning him. Sedeprivationism Guérard des Lauriers then became a lecturer and professor at Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre's St. Pius X seminary in Écône, Switzerland. He then presented his thesis that the Chair of Peter might be vacant because Pope Paul VI was guilty of heresy (see sedevacantism and sedeprivationism). Because of this view, Lefebvre removed Guérard des Lauriers from his seminary teaching post in 1977. He further developed his beliefs on the current state of the papacy, relying on Cardinal Cajetan and St. Robert Bellarmine, arguing that Pope Paul VI, as a result of his heresy, was not a true pope, being only pope materially (papa materialiter) and not formally, known as the \\"Cassiciacum thesis\\". Guérard des Lauriers further believed that the new rites of ordination and episcopal consecration (newest Pontificale Romanum, new forms by promulgation of 18 June 1968) promulgated by Pope Paul VI were doubtfully valid (or even outrightly invalid) and therefore it was necessary to take action to secure a valid succession of bishops for the preservation of the (Latin Rite) Roman Catholic Church. He began discussions with Dr. Eberhard Heller and Dr. Hiller, German sedevacantist activists who were harboring Most. Rev. Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục (1897–1984), the former archbishop of Huế, Vietnam, and after des Lauriers agreed to abate his Sedeprivationism and adhere to the theoretical tenets of Sedevacantism, it was agreed that the Archbishop Emeritus would consecrate him as a bishop.Edward Jarvis, Sede Vacante: the Life and Legacy of Archbishop Thục, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp. 109-112 After long consideration, on 7 May 1981, des Lauriers was consecrated bishop by Ngo Dinh Thuc in Toulon, France. Shortly after, des Lauriers reiterated his Sedeprivationism and commenced a polemical war with the Sedevacantists, including Ngô Đình Thuc and Drs. Heller and Hiller.

Estilo Lowrider Bike Club A lowrider bicycle is a highly customized bicycle with styling inspired by lowrider cars. These bikes often feature a long, curved banana seat with a sissy bar and very tall upward-swept ape hanger handlebars. A lot of chrome, velvet, and overspoked wheels are common accessories to these custom bicycles. These bikes are typically a highly individualized creation. Despite the fact that these bikes originated within the poverty of the barrio, lowrider bikes can be expensive. http://thebi- cycle.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/lowrider-bikes-history.html Noted American bicycle mechanic, technical expert, and author Sheldon Brown wrote of lowrider bicycles,  History  Lowrider bikes first appeared in the 1960s in California. Children would emulate the craft of lowrider cars with their bicycles as a canvas for creativity, usually starting with common muscle bikes. This allowed those who were too young to drive a car to have a custom vehicle. In 1963, Schwinn was the first company to launch a muscle bike, in the form of the Schwinn Sting-Ray.Liz Fried (August 1997). Schwinn Sting-Ray. Motorbooks International. . Lowrider bicycles had a resurgence of popularity the 90s, as lowrider bicycle competition at lowrider shows started to become intense, as a result of the increased popularity, classic Schwinns became far more scarce as well as more expensive. Stemming from this new popularity a magazine titled 'Lowrider Bicycle Magazine' started publication in 1993. One of the first trendsettering bicycles was the infamous \\"Claim Jumper,\\" owned by Danny Galvez, Jr. of Los Angeles, California. As the first cover bike for LRB, it made history as it was on the debut Winter ’93 issue. A man by the name of Warren Wong has a rightful place as a pioneer in lowrider bicycle history. Warren worked with BMX and freestyle bikes, but his desire to be different revolutionized the industry, and he eventually became known as the \\"Wheel King.\\" with his \\"Body Count\\" clover-laced design. These were the first lowrider bicycle wheels, which would later evolve and be duplicated by many. Although California was the hub of lowriding with all the cover bicycles from the early editions of Lowrider Bicycle Magazine being from California, eventually the lowrider bike craze spread to other States of America as well as other countries such as Australia and the Philippines In 1996, Kodak launched a commercial campaign for their Advantage camera systems, which focused on lifestyle. Rene Vargas and his \\"Gangster Madness\\" bike from the November/December ’95 issue of Lowrider Bicycle Magazine was one of the first lowrider bikes to be featured in a nation-wide commercial, which debuted during the ’96 Summer Olympics. This was the beginning for more usage of lowrider bikes in commercials, as industry wanted to capitalize on the trend. Eddie Munster's custom bicycle, created by George Barris and Skip Barrett of Barris Kustom Industries, is sometimes credited with spreading the popularity of lowriders,  Popular source bicycles  Tomos Low-Rider Folding Bike. Some makes of bicycles are particularly popular among lowrider builders. -Schwinn Sting-Ray, one of the most sought after bases for a lowrider build.

Some top lowrider bicycles shops are Manny's (Compton), Fantasy Toys Lowrider & Hobby (Cleveland), Krazy Kutting (Yuma).  Modifications  Basic or classic characteristics of a lowrider bike (most accessories are highly polished chrome, though gold can also be used for added flare): * Baby Daytons — like the car rims, they are over-spoked — 144 chromed spokes per wheel is usual — and radially laced, with white-wall tyres * banana seats * custom upholstery * customized sissy bar * Ape hanger or Schwinn-type handlebars * \\"Springer forks\\" — \\"old school\\" spring-action suspension for the front forks * Fenders both front and back * Chain steering wheel Some custom modifications include twisted forks, spokes or handlebars, what are known as \\"bird cages\\" (twisted metal strips that resemble a bird cage) that are cut and welded onto handlebars, sissy bars or pedals. Many bikes also feature custom framework such as tanks and skirts which are the addition of sheets of metal, usually welded onto the frame to give it a \\"filled-in\\" look. Some lowrider bicycles even have air or hydraulic cylinders set-up to emulate the height adjustable suspension of lowrider motor cars. = Lowrider tricycles = Some lowrider bikes are modified into lowrider tricycles, for style. Converting a lowrider bicycle into a tricycle often allows the bike to sit closer to the ground while still being rideable, and even hop without falling over if they have airbag suspension or hydraulic suspension. Converting a bicycle into a tricycle often creates extra carry-space at the back of the bike. The space between the two rear wheels is sometimes used to mount either a two-seater \\"love seat\\", a \\"boombox,\\" or even pumps for hydraulic or air suspension.

In 1994, the AirWalk shoe company made a commercial featuring lowrider bikes. In 1996, Marianne Dissard and Robert Kramer made the documentary film Low y Cool with the South Tucson, Arizona, lowrider bicycle club Los Camaradas. Also in 1996, as part of Kodak's Advantage camera systems advertising campaigns, the company shot Rene Vargas and his \\"Gangster Madness\\" bike (featured on the Nov./Dec. '95 issue of LRB) for a nationwide commercial, which debuted during the 1996 Summer Olympics. This was the beginning for more usage of lowrider bikes in commercials, as the industry loved the lifestyle involved with the bikes and wanted to capitalize on the hot youth trend. In 2000, Sprite shot a television commercial focusing on the youth of lowriding, which featured four-time LRB Bike of the Year Champion Mike Lopez, Jr. and his club, Finest Kreations. (After \\"retiring,\\" Lopez, Jr. also traveled to Europe to display his bike in a cultural exhibition.) In 2001, PepsiCo made a commercial titled What's Your Thirst.

It was built by the city to compete with Casino Niagara and Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Formerly known as the Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center, it was taken over by the federally recognized Seneca Nation of New York. The casino floor has an area of with 99 gaming tables and 4,200 slot machines. It is the largest hotel in New York state outside of Manhattan. History The Seneca Niagara Casino opened in 2002, the result of an $80 million transformation of the Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center into a full-service casino. It features 82,000 square feet of gaming space with 2,595 slot machines and 91 table games.

Expansion In February 2008, the Seneca Gaming Corp. announced the expansion of the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel Property. It will add more hotel rooms, and other amenities. It acquired Fallsville Splash Park, located next to the Seneca Niagara Casino, which was condemned by the State of New York and transferred to the Seneca Gaming Corporation. It was demolished for Phase 2 of expansion of the Niagara Falls casino. Legal Issues =Adjacent properties owned by Seneca Gaming Corp.= Adjacent properties owned by the Seneca Gaming Corporation are not located on Seneca territory owned by the Nation, therefore it is technically illegal to put slot machines or provide for gambling. The Splash Park Property where Phase 2 of expansion is to take place is also located on non-sovereign land. The former Convention Center is located on sovereign land, and the casino is operated by Gaming Corporation. =Taxing of non-sovereign adjacent properties owned by the Gaming Corporation= Use of the surrounding area adjacent to the Seneca Niagara Casino by the Seneca Nation for gaming has been the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed by attorney John Bartolomei in October 2010 on behalf of Fallsite LLC and residents who are angry over a 4% tax hike to be passed in 2011. The Seneca Niagara Casino is located on sovereign land owned by the Seneca Nation of Indians. But, the land adjacent to the casino, including parking garages adjacent to Niagara St., the site of a former Pizza Hut on the corner of Niagara St. and John B. Daly Blvd., the Holiday Inn property on the corner of 3rd Street and Duggar Drive, the former Niagara Aerospace Museum in between 3rd and 4th Streets and Niagara Street and Wendel Way, the former E. Dent Lackey Plaza (now a parking lot) in between Wendel Way, Duggar Drive, 3rd Street and 4th Street, former private homes on 5th and 6th Streets, and the Splash Park Property on the corner of Falls Street and John B. Daly Blvd, are owned by the Seneca Gaming Corporation. The Seneca Gaming Corporation is non- sovereign and therefore taxable, but was left off the city tax rolls. If taxed, the corporation would be the largest payer of taxes in the City of Niagara Falls.  Other properties  The Seneca Nation operates other gaming casinos on its property in New York state: *Seneca Allegany Casino - This facility in Salamanca, New York, on the Allegany Indian Reservation, features a casino, spa, six restaurants and a new hotel completed in 2007. *Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino - Seneca Nation's newest casino is located in downtown Buffalo, New York.

It is situated on the river Mulde, here crossed by two bridges, 25 km east of Leipzig, by rail N.E. of Leipzig on the main line via Riesa to Dresden. It has a cathedral dating from the twelfth century, a castle, at one time a residence of the bishops of Meissen and later utilized as law courts, several schools, an agricultural college and as a police station including a prison. History Founded after 600 by Slavs, Wurzen is first mentioned in the act of donation from Otto I in 961 as a \\"Burgward\\" civitas vurcine. Situated in the \\"anderen Gau Neletici\\", it was a town early in the twelfth century when Herwig, bishop of Meissen, founded a Collegiate church here. In 1581 it passed to the elector of Saxony. During the Thirty Years' War (1637) it was sacked by the Swedish army and burned almost completely down. In 1768 Goethe travelled from Leipzig to Dresden and back through Wurzen. The long wait for the ferry later inspired a passage in his first edition of Faust. On 31 July 1838 Wurzen was connected through Wurzen railway station to the first German long-distance railway (Leipzig–Dresden, opened 7 April 1839). Therefore, the first German railway bridge was constructed to cross the Mulde. From 1935 to 1945 the city housed a military district command and several anti-aircraft units during the Second World War. From October 1943 to April 1945 Wurzen experienced several US air raids, with over 40 fatalities. The most severe occurred on October 7, 1944, when 13 \\"Flying Fortresses\\" B-17 dropped around 85 high-explosive explosive bombs on Wurzen, which were actually intended for the Brüx hydrogenation works in northern Bohemia. From July 1939 to May 1945, Armin Graebert (1898–1947) was mayor of the city; On April 24, 1945, together with members of the SPD, KPD and the pastors of the Protestant and Catholic churches, he achieved the surrender of the city to Major Victor G. Conley of the 273rd US Infantry Regiment and thus saved it from destruction. Like in comparable cities of the former GDR, the city saw right-wing influence and right-wing motivated violence in the 1990s. However, there has been an active network of antifascist groups, civil society groups for democracy and church-related groups working against this - also with the support of the city administration. Via regia and Central German St. James Way Wurzen is located on the central German route of the St. James pilgrims way to Santiago de Compostela, the so-called Camino de Santiago. It follows the old Via Regia street which was designated a Cultural Route of the Council of Europe in 2005. International relations Wurzen is twinned with: * Barsinghausen, Germany * Warstein, Germany * Tamási, Hungary Economy A main commercial focus is the production of pastries and candies. Furthermore, there are several high-performance medium-sized businesses in mechanical engineering and some specialty companies in town (conveying machinery, lighting design, production of felt). Transport Wurzen is connected to the Leipzig metropolitan area via national highway B6, the closest expressway (Autobahn) connector being situated about 15 km south of Wurzen. Wurzen railway station is linked to the central German commuter train network (S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland) and to the regional express train line between Leipzig and Dresden. There are two airports which can be reached within one hour's driving time, Halle-Leipzig airport and Dresden airport. Main sights * Collegiate church St. Marien (Cathedral, consecrated in 1114).

Profile Zarana is the sister of Zartan and fraternal twin of Zandar.Hasbro Heroes Sourcebook #3 (August, 2017) A professional assassin, she is an expert in small arms, explosives and edged weapons. Zarana is a master of disguise who can fool even the best military specialists. She relies on masks, wigs, makeup and costumes. She is also a world-class method actress, literally becoming the object of her impersonation, to the extent that she not only thinks but reacts as they would. She has short naturally auburn hair,G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #92 (November, 1989) which has been dyed pink (or sometimes red), and is usually depicted with a tattered hot pink T-shirt and blue pants. Her pink shirt resembles the torn scarf worn by her twin brother Zandar. She is the firstborn of the twins, and often the unequivocal leader of the two.G.I. Joe vol. 2 #9 (October 2013) She and Zandar speak between themselves in shared, poetical language, echoing each other's words and ideas.G.I. Joe: vol. 2 #8 (September 2013) Zarana is protective of Zandar.G.I. Joe Dreadnoks Declassified #2 She supposedly also has the same ability to change skin color as her brothers, but this was never portrayed in either her comic book or cartoon incarnations. According to former G.I. Joe product manager Kirk Bozigian at the 2013 Official G.I. Joe Convention, Zarana's original filecard art was inspired by 80's punk rock singer Wendy O. Williams. She and Zandar were born in London, England, into dire poverty and were given up for adoption as toddlers. From an early age, the twins displayed anti-social behavior and refused to speak to anyone but each other in their own twin idioglossia. As a result, they were moved from foster home to foster home, until they landed in an abusive orphanage. As teenagers, Zarana and Zandar were faced with the threat of separation, so they took to the streets to remain together, and from there, procured plane tickets to Australia, where they joined the Dreadnoks biker gang. =Phoenix Guard= The members of the Phoenix Guard were Cobra agents in disguise, but for Cobra Commander's elaborate ruse to succeed, each member of the team needed doctored military records and manufactured personal histories. Zarana's fabricated identity was Friday, real name Jennifer K. Larson, born in Hialeah, Florida. Friday's specialties were infantry, heavy weapons, tracking, unit supply specialist and mechanical technician. She received basic training at Fort Jackson, and advanced infantry training at Fort Lee. She also completed the Unit Armorer School at Fort Hood, the Marksman Instructor course and Airborne School at Fort Benning, and the Counter-Sniper course at Camp Robinson, Arkansas. She was the team's weapons specialist, and second-in-command to General Rey. Toys Along with her twin brother Zandar,Hasbro Heroes Sourcebook #3 (August, 2017)G.I. Joe: vol. 2 #8 (September 2013) Zarana was issued in a second wave of Dreadnok action figures from Hasbro in 1986. She carries a weapon that looked like a shotgun with a circular saw blade attached at the end. This weapon was never seen in the cartoon or comic book. She had several features in the comic, primarily in issues that introduced Dreadnok vehicles produced by Hasbro. Comics = Marvel Comics = In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe series, she first appeared in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #50 (August 1986). Zarana was featured in the Marvel G.I. Joe comics and in the beginning was depicted as being somewhat cheap when it came to money. After she leads a successful rescue of Zartan by impersonating Scarlett, she tells her brother that he owes her for a number of expenses related to the rescue operation including that of the red wig she used in her disguise. Pursued by a large team of G.I. Joes, she and the Dreadnoks escape. They are technically tracked down by Sgt. Slaughter but her disguise skills help fool the man into believing he had found a simple gas station. She was featured in issues #69 through #71. In order to escape the fictional war-torn country of Sierra Gordo, she and fellow Dreadnoks Monkeywrench and Thrasher hijack a G.I. Joe transport plane. This is accomplished by Zarana threatening to kill some of the civilians who are pleading with the Joes for a ride out. The Joes, Crazylegs, Wild-Bill and Maverick are forced to launch out with her, her allies and the refugee/hostages. The plane ends up shot down, though all survive. In an effort to escape the country, Zarana actually works with the Joe team, the Dreadnoks, and the refugees. In one instance, she punches Thrasher's broken arm in order to get him to be even more violent against a large group of adversaries. Zarana and the Dreadnoks would work with the Joes again, like much of Cobra, in the aftermath of the Cobra Civil War. The stress gets to her, leading to a memorable, vicious fist-fight with Lady Jaye, that ends in a draw. Zarana is a fearless fighter and risk taker. She took on a lot of responsibilities for Cobra after Destro, Zartan and the Baroness left, effectively becoming Cobra Commander's second in command. She was captured by Firefly, but was rescued by Slice and Dice who found her by accident. She is reunited with Cobra. As revealed in her complaints, she had spent months in a dungeon on Cobra Island, abandoned there with Road Pig and Cesspool.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #135 (April 1993) She was partly responsible for recruiting Scarlett (although Scarlett turned out to be a double agent). After Dr. Mindbender was revived by Cobra Commander, he \\"cut Zarana loose\\" and she returns to the Dreadnoks. = Devil's Due = Picture of Zarana from Devil's Due Publishing.

Zarana tries to interrogate Duke, but the Sky Patrol comes to his rescue. Zarana accompanies them, but she is discovered and has to retreat. Other works * Zarana's figure is briefly featured in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he described the Dreadnoks as \\"an elite team of maniacal mercenaries allied with Cobra for this battle\\", with the figures lying in the thick of the shag carpet, and to the left of Zandar and Monkeywrench was \\"the lovely Zarana, Zartan's sister, sharpening her knife and dreaming of warm flesh\\". * She is mentioned as a strong female character in the non-fiction novel 'Action chicks: new images of tough women in popular culture'.

Once the traffic capacity of Anhangüera Highway was exceeded in the 1960s, the state government decided to build another highway, with a much higher capacity and modern design, directly connecting São Paulo City to Jundiaí, Campinas and merging into the Anhangüera just after Campinas. Among the first six-lane highways in Brazil, it opened to traffic in 1978. It has always been a toll road, and since 1998, the highway is managed by a state contract with a private company, AutoBan. Subsequently, in 2001 it was extended to Santa Bárbara d'Oeste merging with the Washington Luis Highway, to Rio Claro, São Carlos, Araraquara and São José do Rio Preto. In 2006, it was widened to 4 lanes each way between São Paulo and Jundiaí. It is today the major thoroughfare between several mighty industrial cities around São Paulo and Campinas, and the Viracopos Airport, the second busiest cargo airport in the country. The highway is named after the bandeirantes, audacious explorers of the Brazilian hinterlands in the 16th and 17th centuries, whose treks through the rain forests become the templates for the major thoroughfares of the São Paulo highway system. History Rodovia dos Bandeirantes was inaugurated on October 28, 1978, by then President Ernesto Geisel and Governor Paulo Egídio Martins. Its name is a tribute to the bandeirantes who explored the interior of Brazil from the coast in the State of São Paulo, just in the same route that today is the route. When the maximum traffic capacity of Via Anhanguera was reached, around 1960, the state government decided to build another highway with much greater capacity. Built from a modern project (being one of the first highways in the country with three lanes in each direction, currently there are five from São Paulo to Jundiaí). The highway connects the municipality of São Paulo to the municipality of Cordeirópolis. In May 1998, the then governor of the state of São Paulo, Mario Covas, in a series of privatizations, transferred the administration of the highway to the company AutoBAn, of CCR. In the management of this company, the highway was modernized and extended to the municipality of Cordeirópolis, in an additional 78 km stretch, with access at km 168 to Washington Luís Highway to São Carlos and São José do Rio Preto, and with access at km 173 a Via Anhanguera to Araras and Ribeirão Preto.

It started on June 30, 1855 and on November 10, 1855 martial law was proclaimed which lasted until January 3, 1856 when martial law was suspended and the movement was brutally ended by troops loyal to the British. The rebellion was led by the four Murmu Brothers - Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand and Bhairav.https://web.archive.org/web/20111026053131/http://www.historytution.com/early- resistance-british_rule/santhal_rebellion_%281855-1856%29.html Background The uprising of the Santhals began as a reaction to end the despotic British revenue system, usury practices, and the zamindari system in India; in the tribal belt of what was then known as the Bengal Presidency. It was a revolt against the oppression of the colonial rule propagated through a distorted revenue system, enforced by the local zamindars, the police and the courts of the legal system set up by the British.India's Struggle for Independence - Bipan Chandra, Pg41 The Santhals lived in and depended on forests. In 1832, the British demarcated the Damin-i-koh region in present day Jharkhand and invited Santhals to settle in the region. Due to promises of land and economic amenities a large numbers of Santhals came to settle from Cuttack, Dhalbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh, Midnapore etc. Soon, mahajans and zamindars as tax- collecting intermediaries deployed by British dominated the economy. Many Santals became victims of corrupt money lending practices. They were lent money at exorbitant rates. When they were unable to repay the loan, their lands were forcibly taken and they were forced into bonded labour. This sparked the Santal rebellion by Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, two brothers who led the Santals against the Britishers but were defeated. Rebellion On 30 June 1855, two Santal rebel leaders, Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, mobilized ten thousand Santhals and declared a rebellion against British colonists. Sidhu Murmu had accumulated about ten thousand Santhals to run parallel government against the British rule. The basic purpose was to collect taxes by making his own laws. Soon after the declaration, the Santhals took to arms. In many villages, the Zamindars, money lenders, and their operatives were put to death. The open rebellion caught the British Government by surprise. Initially, a small contingent was sent to suppress the rebels but it could not succeed and this further fueled the spirit of the revolt. When the law and order situation was getting out of hand the British Government finally took a major step and sent in a large number of troops assisted by the local Zamindars and the Nawab of Murshidabad to quell the Rebellion. British Government had announced an award of Rs. 10,000 to arrest Sidhu and his brother Kanhu Murmu. A number of skirmishes occurred after this which resulted in a large number of casualties for the Santhals. The primitive weapons of the Santhals, weren't a match against the musket and cannon firepower of the British. Troop detachments from the 7th Native Infantry Regiment, 40th Native Infantry, and others were called into action. Major skirmishes occurred from July 1855 to January 1856, in places like Kahalgaon, Suri, Raghunathpur, and Munkatora. The revolt was brutally crushed, the two celebrated leaders Sidhu and Kanhu were killed. Elephants supplied by the Nawab of Murshidabad were used to demolish Santhal huts and likewise, atrocities were committed by the British army and its allies in suppressing the Rebellion. Of the 60,000-odd tribesmen who had been mobilized in the rebellion, over 15,000 were killed, and tens of villages were destroyed.India's Struggle for Independence - Bipan Chandra, Pg42-43 They did get the support of Gwalas (milkmen) and Lohars (blacksmiths). Although the Rebellion was crushed with a heavy hand, some British army officers like Major Jervis who observed- \\"It was not war; they did not understand yielding. As long as their national drum beat, the whole party would stand, and allow themselves to be shot down. Their arrows often killed our men, and so we had to fire on them as long as they stood. When their drum ceased, they would move off a quarter of a mile; then their drums beat again, and they calmly stood till we came up and poured a few volleys into them. There was not a sepoy in the war who did not feel ashamed of himself.\\"L.S.S O Malley, Bengal District Gazetteers Santal Parganas. Charles Dickens in Household Words wrote- \\"There seems also to be a sentiment of honor among them; for it is said that they use poisoned arrows in hunting, but never against their foes. If this be the case and we hear nothing of the poisoned arrows in the recent conflicts, they are infinitely more respectable than our civilized enemy, the Russians, who would most likely consider such forbearance as foolish, and declare that is not war.\\" Although its impact was largely overshadowed by that of the other rebellion, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the legend of the Santhal Rebellion lives on as a turning point in Santhal pride and identity. This was reaffirmed, over a century and a half later with the creation of the first tribal province in independent India, Jharkhand. Santhal Pargana was created by the Government and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was passed. Mrinal Sen's film Mrigayaa (1976) is set in this time.

The game appeared on the PC and was developed and published by Stormfront Studios. The game was based on the Tony La Russa Baseball engine, and was an extension of the baseball simulation methods Daglow evolved through the Baseball mainframe computer game (1971) (the first computer baseball game ever written), Intellivision World Series Baseball (1983) and Earl Weaver Baseball (1987). Old Time Baseball took the Tony La Russa Baseball engine (then the top baseball game in the market), removed the current 28 teams' players and ballparks, and substituted the complete lineups of every major league team from 1871 to 1981, 12,000 players in all. 16 old (often demolished) ballparks were also included in which games could be played with accurate dimensions. Leagues and Teams Users could replay historical seasons for any league during this period from every major league in baseball history: * National Association * National League * American Association * Union Association * Players' League * American League * Federal League In addition to playing with historical teams, users could build their own teams player by player, and play any team (custom or historical) against any other team. The Baseball Time Machine The most remarkable feature in the game was the patented Baseball Time Machine, which allowed users to play any game in any individual year from 1871 through the present. This allowed users to play games in unique times like 1930, when baseball sought to lure fans during the Depression and juiced the ball so much that the batting average for baseball overall surpassed .300. The following year the ball was returned to more typical physics. Other popular \\"let's see what happens\\" years for players were 1871, when the game visually looked more like softball, and 1942–45, when World War II stripped the major leagues of most of its established players. The Baseball Time Machine allowed players to try to resolve the most famous baseball arguments of all time, What would happen if Sandy Koufax pitched to Babe Ruth?, How would the 1927 Yankees do against the Big Red Machine?, etc. Daglow had written the basic mathematical models for the Baseball Time Machine in an unpublished 1980 game with the working title Apple Baseball, an extension of his Baseball game which he wrote on the then-new Apple II personal computer before joining the Intellivision game design team. The diversion to Mattel delayed the introduction of the Baseball Time Machine by 15 years. To create broad patterns of play that were easier to learn and less subject to extremes, the game also offered the chance to play games in any of six different major baseball eras: * 1871–1892 -- Early Baseball, when the field dimensions were different and pitchers threw the ball softball-style, underhanded. * 1893–1919 -- The Dead Ball Era, when the pitcher's mound location and pitching style matched modern baseball, but the ball was marginally softer and would not fly as far. During this era it was routine for 10 home runs to be the league leader's total, and a majority of those might be inside the park home runs that were the result of speed, not power. * 1920–1945 -- The Babe Ruth Era, when then-pitcher Ruth changed the game by his tremendous power, and the live ball replaced the dead ball as baseball sought to make fans forget the Black Sox Scandal. * 1946–1960 -- The Golden Age, when post-war optimism, television and the integration of baseball by Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby and Branch Rickey created a new level of success for the game. * 1961–1976 -- The Expansion Era, when baseball added many new teams, both increasing its influence and diluting its talent even as other sports like American football, basketball and ice hockey eroded its dominance of TV sports. * 1977–1995 -- Modern Baseball, when continued expansion and the Free Agency created by the growth of the players union continued to change the game. Ballparks Many of the historical ballparks were built based on actual old construction blueprints. Stadiums included: * Ebbets Field, former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, with the \\"hit this spot, win a suit\\" and the Schaefer's Beer sign on the outfield walls. * Old Comiskey Park, at that time scheduled for demolition by the Chicago White Sox. * Crosley Field, former home of the Cincinnati Reds. * Fenway Park, as it appeared in the heyday of Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr. * Polo Grounds, former home of the New York Giants, with its cavernous center field where Willie Mays caught the famous Vic Wertz drive in the 1954 World Series. * Shibe Park, former home of both the Philadelphia Phillies and the Philadelphia Athletics. * Sportsman's Park, former home of the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns where more games were played than any other park in history. * Wrigley Field, from the days of Ernie Banks and Ron Santo. * Yankee Stadium, in its pre-1970s form with the short right field porch and spacious left field, all designed to aid Babe Ruth and inspiring the nickname, The House that Ruth Built. Announcers Users could select between Play by play announcers Mel Allen of the New York Yankees and Curt Gowdy, who did network broadcasts for many years in addition to announcing for the Boston Red Sox. Legacy The game was a cult hit among serious baseball fans such as members of SABR and fans of sabermetrics, but entered the market during the baseball strike of 1994–1995 when many fans were angry at baseball in general. It never achieved mainstream success, and was sometimes criticized as being designed to please only hard- core baseball history \\"nuts\\". Since it was never updated or re-issued the game is one of the most expensive collectible PC games on eBay, since serious baseball fans will often bid up the price on good condition copies.

He played college football as a quarterback at the University of California, Berkeley. Kapp played professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Calgary Stampeders and the BC Lions and then in the National Football League (NFL) with the Minnesota Vikings and the Boston Patriots. Kapp returned to his alma mater as head coach of the Golden Bears from 1982 to 1986. He was the general manager and president of the BC Lions in 1990. Kapp is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame, the BC Lions Wall of Fame, the College Football Hall of Fame, and the University of California Athletic Hall of Fame. Kapp's #22 jersey is one of eight numbers retired by the Lions. In November 2006, Kapp was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL's top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Sports Illustrated once called him \\"The Toughest Chicano.\\" Kapp is the only player to play quarterback in the Super Bowl, Rose Bowl, and the Grey Cup. Early years Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Kapp's mother (Florence García) was of Mexican-American heritage, his father of German descent. Raised in California in the San Fernando Valley and Salinas, he played quarterback for Hart High School in Newhall. Kapp played college football at the University of California, Berkeley, where he led the Golden Bears to a Pacific Coast Conference championship in 1958 and the Rose Bowl, where they lost to Iowa. This remains California's most recent Rose Bowl appearance. Kapp was named an All-American, and was also awarded the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy in 1958 as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. A two-sport athlete and fraternity member of Kappa Alpha Order in college, he also played on the basketball team and was a member of the 1956–57 and 1957–58 squads that won the Pacific Coast championships. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education from the university in 1959. Professional career =Canadian Football League= Kapp was selected in the 18th round of the 1959 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, who owned his rights to play professional football in the United States. After the draft, Washington did not contact him, so his only choice was to accept the offer from Jim Finks, the general manager of the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Kapp joined the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL for his rookie season in 1959. The following year, Kapp led Calgary to their first playoff appearance in years. The season was a difficult one, because he injured his knee against the Toronto Argonauts early in the season, but did not miss any games, because he played heavily taped. In 1961, the BC Lions, then the CFL's newest franchise, traded four starting players to the Calgary Stampeders for Joe Kapp. The move paid off for the Lions when Kapp led the team to a Grey Cup appearance in 1963. The following season, Kapp led the Lions to their first Grey Cup victory in 1964. However, the Lions proved unable to defend their championship in 1965. By that time, Kapp had proven he was an elite quarterback, and also developed the reputation of being a tough player and a great leader. While most quarterbacks dislike being hit, Kapp was the opposite. He loved to hit and when he took off on a run he'd try to run over defenders. Before the 1967 CFL season, Kapp made the decision to return to the U.S. to play pro football. The AFL's Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers, and Houston Oilers were heavily pursuing him. Kapp ended up signing with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in a multi-player \\"trade\\" between the CFL and NFL teams, one of the very few transactions to ever occur between the two leagues. The Minnesota Vikings in 1965 had drafted running back Jim Young out of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He had spent the 1965 and 1966 seasons with the Vikings, but wanted to return to Canada. The BC Lions were very interested in acquiring Young, but the Toronto Argonauts had his CFL rights. The Minnesota Vikings general manager was Jim Finks, who had brought Kapp to Canada in 1959, and their head coach was Bud Grant, who had faced Kapp while coaching the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Both Finks and Grant thought Joe Kapp would be the best replacement for Fran Tarkenton, who had been traded to the New York Giants. To make this transaction possible, the BC Lions traded all-star defensive lineman Dick Fouts, and future Canadian Football Hall of Fame running back Bill Symons to Toronto for the CFL rights to future Canadian Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Jim Young. They then managed to get Kapp waived out of the CFL. The Vikings managed to get Jim Young waived out of the NFL, which allowed the BC Lions to sign him. The expansion New Orleans Saints wanted Young and it took some work from Finks to keep them from claiming Young. Kapp, now waived from the CFL, was free to sign with the Vikings, who had previously claimed his NFL playing rights from Washington. =National Football League= In 1967, Kapp's first season in the NFL, he started 11 of 14 games for the Vikings, compiling an unusual record of 3 wins, 5 losses and 3 ties. Kapp completed only 47 percent of his pass attempts with 8 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Kapp also scored two rushing touchdowns. Of note, the team was winless without Kapp starting at quarterback. The Green Bay Packers won the division (and the Super Bowl). In 1968, Kapp led Minnesota to their first ever playoff appearance, losing to the favored Baltimore Colts, 24–14. The Colts were upset a few weeks later by the New York Jets in Super Bowl III. Early in the 1969 season, Kapp tied an all-time record when he threw for seven touchdown passes against the defending NFL champion Colts on September 28. He is tied with seven other players (Sid Luckman, Adrian Burk, George Blanda, Y. A. Tittle, Nick Foles, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees). Kapp led the Vikings to a 12–2 record, and a berth in Super Bowl IV after defeating the Los Angeles Rams 23–20 in the Western Conference championship game, and the Cleveland Browns 27–7 in the last NFL Championship game ever played. However, he was unable to lead the team to victory in the Super Bowl, as the Vikings lost 23–7 to the Kansas City Chiefs. In , the NFL and AFL consummated the merger that had been agreed to in , and the NFL Championship game was retired after 37 editions and 50 years of NFL competition. On July 20, 1970, Sports Illustrated dubbed Kapp \\"The Toughest Chicano\\" on the cover of its weekly magazine. He received the team MVP, but refused the team MVP award, saying, \\"There is no one most valuable Viking. There are 40 most valuable Vikings.\\" Prior to the 1969 season, the Vikings had exercised the option clause of his contract, so Kapp had played the entire season without a new contract. It was unusual for teams to use the team's option and not to offer a new contract prior to a season. This dispute made him a free agent for the season, by the NFL's own rules. Despite Kapp being a Super Bowl quarterback, no team in the NFL made contact with him until after the start of the 1970 regular season, when the Boston Patriots (1–1) signed him on October 2 to a four-year contract, making him the highest paid player in the league. Pete Rozelle stepped in and forced the Patriots to give up two number-one draft picks as compensation to the Vikings. His first appearance for Boston was on October 11 at Kansas City, relieving starter Mike Taliaferro in the third quarter of a 23–10 loss. The Patriots of 1970 were a poor-performing team and the late-arriving Kapp played poorly himself that season, leading the team to the 26-team league's worst record at 2–12. When the year ended, Rozelle demanded that Kapp sign a standard player contract. After conferring with his lawyer and the NFL Players Association, Kapp refused to sign. With the top pick in the 1971 NFL Draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Jim Plunkett of Stanford, the winner of the Heisman Trophy. Kapp reported to the newly-renamed New England Patriots' training camp in 1971, refused to sign a standard contract, and departed. The headlines in the Boston papers read \\"KAPP QUITS!\\". After this incident Kapp never played again; his 12-year career as a professional football player was over. Kapp started an anti-trust lawsuit vs. the NFL, claiming the standard NFL contract was unconstitutional and a restraint of trade. He won the summary judgment after four years. The court had ruled that Kapp's trade was indeed restrained. It was two years later (April 1, 1976) in the trial for damages, that the jury decided that Kapp was not damaged. Although Kapp was not awarded any damages, in 1977 the rules at issue in the Kapp case were later revised, a new system was instituted, and a multimillion-dollar settlement was made between the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Post-football playing career =Acting career= In the 1970s and early 1980s, Kapp appeared in several television programs as well as theatrical film titles. In most cases, the character roles were minor. Programs included Ironside, The Six Million Dollar Man, Adam-12, Emergency!, Police Woman, Captains and the Kings, and Medical Center. Movies included \\"Climb An Angry Mountain (1972)\\", 'The World's Greatest Athlete (1973), The Longest Yard (1974), Breakheart Pass (1975), Two- Minute Warning (1976), Smash-Up on Interstate 5 (1976), Semi-Tough (1977), The Frisco Kid (1979), and Off Sides (Pigs vs. Freaks) (1984). =California head coach= In 1982, Kapp was hired as the head football coach at his alma mater, the University of California, Berkeley. He had never coached before. In his first year as head coach, he was voted the Pacific-10 Conference Coach of the Year. In December 1981, Kapp made a promise to the football team that he would not consume any of his favorite alcoholic beverage, tequila, until the Golden Bears reached the Rose Bowl, which they did not under Kapp; indeed, as of 2020, the Golden Bears have yet to return to the Rose Bowl -- they were Pac-10 co-champions in 2006 but a loss to USC sent them to the Holiday Bowl instead. (In a 1994 interview, Kapp stated that he had resorted to drinking rum instead. Kapp had several philosophies while coaching at Cal. He called his special teams the \\"special forces.\\" He told his players to play \\"One hundred percent for 60 minutes.\\" He also wanted the players to have fun. On Sundays, he would have his players play a game of \\"garbazz\\", described as a mix of basketball and football where the only objective is to pass the ball downfield. There are no football rules such as offsides or forward passes. Kapp's first season as head coach in 1982 concluded with The Play, the famous five-lateral kickoff return by Cal to score the winning touchdown on the final play of the Big Game against archrival Stanford. During the 1986 season, the Bears lost to Boston College, defeated Washington State, then lost to San Jose State. Following an embarrassing 50–18 loss at Washington on October 4, Kapp expressed frustration unzipping his pants in front of the Seattle media. He was notified that he would be released after the Big Game, played in Berkeley. The Bears responded to the student section's pre-game chants of \\"Win one for the zipper\\" by beating the Gator Bowl-bound #16 Cardinal 17–11, which gave Kapp a 3–2 record in the Big Game. He was carried off the field by his players, amid chanting from the student section, \\"We want Kapp!\\" echoing a cheer from his playing days with the Boston Patriots. =General manager of the BC Lions= In an effort to recapture their past glory, the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) hired Kapp as the team's new general manager in 1990. Kapp's tenure was marked by his tendency to recruit ex-NFL players such as Mark Gastineau whose best football days had passed. Kapp was fired eleven games into the Lions' schedule, his most valuable legacy was the signing of quarterback Doug Flutie, who would blossom into a star in the CFL during the 1990s. =Sacramento Attack head coach= In 1992, Kapp was named the head coach of the Arena Football League's Los Angeles Wings, but the franchise never came into existence in Los Angeles, and moved to Sacramento as the Attack. The franchise went 4–6 under Kapp, losing in the first round of the playoffs to the Detroit Drive. After the season, the franchise moved to Miami, Florida. =Personal life= Kapp lives in Los Gatos, California, and makes himself available as a guest speaker. He has a wife and four children and four grandchildren. He was one of the owners of Kapp's Pizza Bar & Grill in Mountain View, California, which contained memorabilia from his career and closed in 2015. His son, Will, followed in his footsteps as a fullback at UC Berkeley.Cal Bears In 2015, grandson Frank Kapp, continued the Cal football tradition as a freshman tight end with the Golden Bears. Kapp and fellow Canadian Football Hall of Fame player Angelo Mosca came to blows at a 2011 Canadian Football League Alumni luncheon. The source of the bad blood between Kapp and Mosca is a hit Mosca made on Kapp's teammate Willie Fleming in the 1963 Grey Cup game. The hit, which Kapp and many others considered dirty, forced Fleming out of the game. Mosca's Tiger-Cats defeated Kapp's Lions 21-10 for the 1963 championship. In February 2016, the San Jose Mercury News reported that Kapp was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

The teniae coli run the length of the colon. Because the taenia coli are shorter than the colon, the colon becomes sacculated between the teniae coli, forming the haustra. Haustral contractions are slow segmenting, uncoordinated movements that occur approximately every 25 minutes. One haustrum distends as it fills with chyme, which stimulates muscles to contract, pushing the contents to the next haustrum. Also see peristalsis. There is a wider distance between haustra than between the circular folds of the small intestine, and the haustra don't reach around the entire circumference of the intestine, in contrast to circular folds of the small intestine that do. These differences can assist in distinguishing the small intestine from the colon on an abdominal x-ray.  Clinical significance  Widespread loss of haustra is a sign of chronic ulcerative colitis. Localized ahaustral distended colon can be seen on abdominal x-ray during obstruction or volvulus.

She became the object of much scrutiny after the release of the Reynolds Pamphlet and central in America's first political sex scandal.  Early life  Maria Lewis was born in New York City on March 30, 1768, the daughter of Susanna Van Der Burgh and her second husband, Richard Lewis. She had one half- brother, Col. Lewis DuBois, and five full siblings, at least two of whom (older sisters named Susanna and Sara) lived to adulthood. The Lewises do not appear to have been well-off: Richard Lewis was a merchant and/or laborer, and couldn't sign his name. Susanna Van Der Burgh Lewis, however, could write at least her name, and Maria Lewis grew up literate though largely uneducated. On July 28, 1783, when she was 15, Maria Lewis married James Reynolds. Reynolds had served in the Revolutionary War in the commissary department, and was older than Maria by at least several years. After the war, he tried frequently to claim damages and get reimbursed for them by the government. Maria had one child with Reynolds, a daughter named Susan, born August 18, 1785.  Hamilton affair  At some point before 1791, James Reynolds moved with Maria and their daughter from New York to Philadelphia. It was there in the summer of 1791 that 23-year-old Maria visited 34-year-old Hamilton at his Philadelphia residence and asked for help, claiming her abusive husband had abandoned her. Due to Hamilton's political office, he could very easily help her move back to New York City. Hamilton organized a meeting for later that evening to give Maria the money. Once Hamilton arrived at the boarding house where Maria was lodging, she brought him upstairs and led him into her bedroom, where he recounts that \\"Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable”. Thus beginning the infamous Reynolds Affair. During the summer and fall of 1791, Maria and Hamilton continued the affair while Hamilton's wife, Eliza, and their children were in Albany, visiting her parents. A short time into the affair, Maria informed Hamilton that her husband had sought a reconciliation with her, to which she agreed without ending the affair with Hamilton. She then obtained an interview for James Reynolds, who applied to Hamilton for a position in the Treasury Office, which Hamilton refused. After Hamilton had shown unequivocal signs that he wanted to end the affair on 15 December 1791, Maria sent him a letter warning of Reynolds's anger over the supposed discovery of the affair : > I have not time to tell you the cause of my present troubles only that Mr. > Reynolds has wrote you this morning and I know not whether you have got the > letter or not and he has swore that if you do not answer it or if he does > not see or hear from you today he will write Mrs. Hamilton he has just gone > out and I am alone I think you had better come here one moment that you may > know the cause then you will the better know how to act Oh my God I feel > more for you than myself and wish I had never been born to give you so much > unhappiness do not write to him no not a line but come here soon do not send > or leave any thing in his power. From 15 to 19 December 1791, Reynolds sent threatening letters to Hamilton, and after a personal meeting instead of seeking redress from dueling, he asked for financial compensation. Hamilton complied, paying to Reynolds the requested $1,000 and discontinuing the affair, as he had wished to do for some time. However, on 17 January 1792, Reynolds wrote to Hamilton inviting him to renew his visits to his wife. Maria, most likely manipulated into the scheme, also began to write to Hamilton whenever her husband was out of the house and seduced him anew. After each of these exchanges, Reynolds would write to Hamilton under the guise of being friends, and Hamilton would in return send $30. Hamilton's last \\"loan\\" of $50 to James Reynolds and possibly the end of the affair dates June 1792. In November 1792, James Reynolds, after illegally purchasing Revolutionary War soldiers' pensions and back-pay claims, was imprisoned for forgery with Virginian Jacob Clingman, his partner in crime. Reynolds wrote to Hamilton, who refused to help and likewise rejected Maria's letters and requests for further money. Clingman then informed Hamilton's Democratic-Republican rivals that Reynolds had information against the Treasury Secretary. James Monroe, Frederick Muhlenberg, and Abraham Venable visited Reynolds in jail, where Reynolds hinted at some unspecified public misconduct on Hamilton's part whose details he promised to expose after coming out of prison, only to disappear immediately after his release on 12 December 1792. The congressmen also personally interviewed Maria who corroborated her husband's accusations of speculation against Hamilton by producing the notes in Hamilton's disguised hand that had accompanied his payments to Reynolds. On 15 December 1792, Monroe, Venable, and Muhlenberg went to Hamilton with the evidence they had gathered and confronted him on the possible charge of speculation. Fearful of what a scandal could do to his career, Hamilton admitted to the affair with Maria, proved with the letters from both Maria and James Reynolds that his payments to Reynolds related to the blackmail over his adultery and not to treasury misconduct and asked them to keep the information private as he was innocent of any public wrongdoing. They agreed, although Monroe created copies of the letters and sent them to Thomas Jefferson. John Beckley also created copies of the correspondence. Clingman, on 1 January 1793, declared to Monroe that Maria claimed that the affair had been invented as a cover for the speculation scheme., chapter \\"Too near the sun\\" However, the letter from Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth to Hamilton dated 2 August 1797 relates how during Reynolds's detention in November–December 1792 Maria had applied to both Wadsworth and Governor General Thomas Mifflin. In the attempt to convince them to help her obtain her husband's release from prison, Maria spontaneously told both of them the story of her first acquaintance and following \\"amour\\" with Hamilton in words that match Hamilton's description of their first encounter as reported in both the first draft of the Reynolds Pamphlet of July 1797 (before Wadsworth's letter) and the printed version, also dated July 1797, as well as James Reynolds's first letter to Hamilton. Historian Tilar J. Mazzeo has advanced a theory that the affair never happened. Outside of the Reynolds Pamphlet, there is no evidence that the affair occurred; others connected with the scandal, from James Monroe, who held the papers relating to James Reynolds, to Maria Reynolds herself, said that it was a cover-up for a financial scandal. Hamilton never produced the manuscript copies of Maria's letters, though the newspapers and Maria both suggested obtaining a handwriting sample. Hamilton said that they had been placed with a friend of his, who claimed that he had never seen them, suggesting that the letters could have been forged. The newspaper writers also pointed out that Maria's letters correctly spell long, complex words and yet sometimes misspelled simple words in a way that makes no phonetic sense; as Thomas Jefferson biographer Julian P. Boyd stated, the letters could resemble what an educated man believed an uneducated woman's love letters to look like.  Divorce and second marriage  In 1793, Maria enlisted the aid of Aaron Burr and successfully petitioned for a divorce from Reynolds. Before obtaining the divorce she had gone to live with Virginian Jacob Clingman (whom she later married) who had been partner in crime in Reynolds's speculations and had been arrested with him in November 1792. She took up residence in Alexandria, Virginia.  The \\"Reynolds Pamphlet\\" and aftermath  In the summer of 1797, journalist James T. Callender published a collection of pamphlets entitled The History of the United States for 1796, in which he promised to uncover public wrongdoing on Hamilton's part. On 25 August 1797, unwilling to let the charges of public misconduct lie, Hamilton published what is known as The Reynolds Pamphlet, a nearly 100-page-long account of Hamilton's affair with Maria and the blackmail scheme set up by her husband. Maria Reynolds was the victim of manipulation by her husband, James, and public humiliation after Alexander Hamilton painted himself as the victim via 'The Reynolds Pamphlet'. After the Pamphlet was released, Maria was publicly scorned and she and her second husband decided to move to Britain. Having returned to Philadelphia without Clingman some years later, she went by the name of Maria Clement. No record of her divorce from Clingman has been found. Soon thereafter, she became the housekeeper of a Dr. Mathew. A merchant by the name of Peter Grotjan in 1842 reported that he had met Maria many years earlier. She had apparently told him that she had written a pamphlet of her own, giving her side of the story that Hamilton had told in his Reynolds Pamphlet. If Maria's pamphlet existed, it was never published. In 1800, her daughter Susan was sent to a Boston boarding school with the help of Congressman William Eustis, who had been petitioned by Aaron Burr to help the girl.  Later life  In 1806, Maria married Dr. Mathew, for whom she had worked as a housekeeper. In 1808, Susan Reynolds came to live with her mother, and spent several years with her in Philadelphia. Susan was married several times, but never happily. Described by her acquaintance Peter Grotjan as \\"highly amiable and handsome,\\" Maria Reynolds, now Mathew, became highly respected with her marriage to the doctor. She became religious, joining the Methodist Church, and put her past behind her. \\"She enjoyed...the love and good will of all who knew her\\". She died on March 25, 1828.  In popular culture  Maria was originally portrayed by actress June Collyer in the 1931 biographical film Alexander Hamilton. Mrs. Reynolds's character also appeared in the 1986 TV series George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation where she was portrayed by Lise Hilboldt. Jasmine Cephas Jones played the role of Maria in Hamilton, the 2015 Broadway theatre musical about the life of Alexander Hamilton. Jones originated the roles of Maria Reynolds and Margarita \\"Peggy\\" Schuyler Van Rensselaer on Off-Broadway in Hamilton, and reprised her roles when the show made its transfer to Broadway.

It serves as part of the primary route from the Monterey Peninsula to either the San Francisco Bay Area or the California Central Valley. Route description State Route 156 west of San Juan Bautista SR 156 concurrent with US 101 west of San Juan Bautista The western terminus is at State Route 1 in Castroville. The eastern terminus is at State Route 152 near Hollister. It overlaps U.S. Route 101 for between Prunedale, and San Juan Bautista. Route 156 passes through Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Clara Counties. Along with US 101, it is the quickest route from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Monterey Peninsula. In addition, SR 156's connection with SR 152 allows direct access to the California Central Valley. For its westernmost two miles (3 km), Route 156 is a freeway through Castroville, terminating at a Y-interchange with the Route 1 freeway. There is no direct access from Route 156 West to Route 1 North or Route 1 South to Route 156 East. Motorists who want to go from Route 1 South to Route 156 East can do so by using Route 183 South through Castroville. Traffic heading west on Route 156 can access Route 1 North by exiting at the Route 183 interchange and heading north. The route then truncates into a two-lane road between Castroville and Prunedale. Route 156 joins U.S. 101 for the next 8 miles (13 km) before splitting off as an expressway east to San Juan Bautista. Just after the intersection with The Alameda, Route 156 returns to a 2-lane road, then curves north by northeast, with several at-grade signal intersections, including one with State Route 25. Route 156 then crosses into Santa Clara County approximately 1/4 mile (300 meters) before a divided road and terminating at State Route 152 as a partial interchange. However, motorists wishing to use westbound SR 152 must exit at Casa de Fruita as there is no direct interchange between eastbound SR 156 and westbound SR 152. SR 156 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and from east of Castroville to US 101 is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. History The original portion of the route was defined in 1909 and ran from U.S. Route 101 to Hollister. In 1933, the remainder of the route (between Castroville and US 101 and between Hollister and Route 152) was added. It was signed as Route 156 by 1963, but was not part of the original 1934 state signage of routes. Route 156 was originally routed through Hollister on 4th street and turned left on San Benito Street where it shared a route with Route 25 for 1 mile (as of 2009, SR 25 was rerouted onto a bypass.) before splitting with SR 25, and meeting its current alignment at the current SR 156/ San Benito Road intersection. In 1998, Route 156 was rerouted onto a new bypass of Hollister. A stub of the original route can be seen southeast of this intersection. Route 156 east originally came to an intersection with US 101. This intersection became dangerous because U.S. 101 traffic didn't stop. This intersection was replaced with an interchange since then. A stub of the intersection can still be seen between the southbound on ramp and the bridge crossing U.S. 101. Future Highway 156 experiences heavy truck traffic as it serves as a primary route for moving people and goods between the Monterey Peninsula and the rest of the state. It directly links with Highway 152, one of a small number of passable routes across the Coast Ranges between Monterey Bay and the Central Valley. =Monterey County= The westernmost segment from Highway 1 to Highway 101 in Prunedale is a heavily traveled 2-lane section that has experienced numerous fatal crashes in recent years. Environmental studies are underway to upgrade this 5-mile (8 km) section to either a 4-lane highway or fully controlled access expressway. The Transportation Agency for Monterey County and Caltrans have narrowed the list of upgrade alternatives to one freeway and one expressway option. Alternative 11 -- the expressway option -- will add a second carriageway to the existing road. Interchanges will be constructed at Castroville Boulevard and Cathedral Oaks Road, while Oak Hills Drive will be an at-grade intersection. Alternative 12 -- the freeway option -- will build a new freeway to the south of the existing roadway with an interchange at Castroville Boulevard. Under this alternative, there will be no interchange with Cathedral Oaks Road or Oak Hills Drive. The existing Route 156 would be converted to a frontage road providing access to Cathedral Oaks Road and Oak Hills Drive. The environmental studies are expected to be complete in 2009, with the project slated for completion in 2015. =San Benito County= San Benito County and Caltrans are conducting environmental studies for widening Highway 156 from two to four lanes between Highway 101 near San Juan Bautista and the Santa Clara County line. Interchanges are proposed with Highway 25 northwest of Hollister, Business Route 156 both north and southwest of Hollister, and Highway 101. The entire segment may be upgraded to freeway status to eliminate delays caused by numerous traffic lights currently present in the Hollister area.

Samuel Bell, a brother, was the Governor of New Hampshire from 1819 to 1823. John Bell was born on July 20, 1765, in Londonderry in the Province of New Hampshire, the son of John and Mary Ann (née Gilmore) Bell. John Bell, Jr. (1730–1825) served in the New Hampshire Senate from 1786 to 1790 representing Rockingham County.Proceedings of the New Hampshire Historical Society, 1895, page 210 He received a limited education by several New Hampshire common schools, and became a merchant, attaining success by trading and selling New Hampshire products in Canada and Canadian products in New Hampshire. He was later involved in other ventures, including farming and land speculation. Initially a Federalist, according to the New Hampshire Division of Historical Records, he entered state politics when he became a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from Londonderry in 1799. He later moved to Chester, and he married Persis Thom on December 25, 1803. They had 10 children; the youngest, Charles Henry Bell, served as governor from 1881 to 1883. From 1803 to 1804 Bell was a member of the New Hampshire State Senate, representing the 3rd District. He was also a member of the Executive Council of New Hampshire from 1817 to 1823, as a Democratic-Republican and the sheriff of Rockingham County from 1823 to 1828. In 1828 Bell was a National Republican and a supporter of President John Quincy Adams. Adams lost to Andrew Jackson in that year's presidential election,John Norris McClintock (1888), Colony, Province, State, 1623–1888: History of New Hampshire, published by B. B. Russell, page 553 but Bell defeated Jackson supporter Benjamin Pierce 21,149 to 18,672 votes in the election for governor. While he was governor, the Exeter Savings Bank was chartered; several state manufacturing companies were incorporated; a number of schools were founded; and manufacturing within the state increased. Bell also promoted state support for formal agricultural education, and experimentation in farming and agriculture. In 1829, Bell was defeated for re- election by Benjamin Pierce. He then retired from public service, and pursued actively his farming interests. He died in Chester on March 22, 1836, and was buried in the Village Cemetery in Chester.

The phenomenon glow brightly enough at night to be seen by satellites orbiting Earth. Effect This long-exposure photo shows the bioluminescence of Noctiluca scintillans in the yacht port of Zeebrugge, Belgium Between 1915 and 1993, 235 sightings of milky seas were documented, most of which are concentrated in the northwestern Indian Ocean and near Indonesia. The luminescent glow is concentrated on the surface of the ocean and does not mix evenly throughout the water column. In 1985, a research vessel in the Arabian Sea took water samples during milky seas. Their conclusions were that the effect was caused by the bacteria Vibrio harveyi. Mareel is typically caused by Noctiluca scintillans (popularly known as \\"sea sparkle\\"), a dinoflagellate that glows when disturbed and is found in oceans throughout much of the world.Tada; Pithakpol; and Montami (2004). Seasonal variation in the abundance of Noctiluca scintillans in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Plankton Biol. Ecol. 51(1): 7-14.Buskey (1994). Growth and bioluminescence of Noctiluca scintillans on varying algal diets. Journal of Plankton Research 17(1): 29-40.Oceana: Noctiluca scintillans. Marine Animal Encyclopedia. Retrieved 27 December 2014. In July 2015, at Alleppey, Kerala, India, the phenomenon occurred and the National Institute of Oceanography and Kerala Fisheries Department researched it, finding that the glittering waves were the result of Noctiluca scintillans. In 2005, Steven Miller of the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, was able to match 1995 satellite images with a first- hand account of a merchant ship. U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program showed the milky area to be approximately (roughly the size of Connecticut). The luminescent field was observed to glow over three consecutive nights. While monochromatic photos make this effect appear white, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute scientist Steven Haddock (an author of a milky seas effect study) has commented, \\"the light produced by the bacteria is actually blue, not white. It is white in the graphic because of the monochromatic sensor we used, and it can appear white to the eye because the rods in our eye (used for night vision) don't discriminate color.\\" In Shetland (where generally caused by Noctiluca scintillans), mareel has sometimes been described as being green, rather than the traditional blue or white milky seas effect seen by the rest of the world. It is not known whether this difference depends on the area, or simply a perception of a cyanic colour as being green. Etymology The phenomenon is known as mareel in Shetland. This term is derived from the Norn word *mareld, which is itself derived from the Old Norse word mǫrueldr, which is a compound of marr (mere, sea) and eldr (fire).

It forms the most pointed portion of the elbow and is opposite to the cubital fossa or elbow pit. The olecranon serves as a lever for the extensor muscles that straighten the elbow joint. Structure It is situated at the upper (proximal) end of the ulna, one of the two bones in the forearm. When the hand faces forward (supination) the olecranon faces towards the back (posteriorly). It is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. Its base is contracted where it joins the body and the narrowest part of the upper end of the ulna. Its posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular, smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. Its superior surface is of quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of the Triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. Its anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the semilunar notch. Its borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments, viz., the back part of the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally. From the medial border a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to the lateral border the anconeus muscle is attached. Clinical significance Fractures of the olecranon are common injuries. An olecranon fracture with anterior displacement of the radial head is called a Hume fracture. Additional images File:En-elbow joint.svgUpper extremity of left ulna.

Clarence James \\"Peck\\" Griffin (January 19, 1888 - March 28, 1973) was an American tennis player. His best major performance in singles was reaching the semi-finals of the 1916 U.S. National Championships (where he beat Wallace F. Johnson before losing to R. Norris Williams). He also reached the quarter-finals in 1914, 1915, 1917 and 1920. Biography He was born on January 19, 1888 in San Francisco, California. Griffin ranked in singles in the U.S. Top Ten three times: he was No. 7 in 1915 and No. 6 in both 1916 and 1920. In addition to his singles success, Griffin also made a mark in doubles with fellow Californian Bill Johnston. In 1913 he won the singles title at the Niagara International Tennis Tournament defeating Edward H. Whitney in four sets.

In addition to his work in leading and developing educational and natural history organizations, including the Field Museum in Chicago and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, he has had a long career as a professor and researcher in both the U.K. and the United States. He is best known for his work on the origin and early evolution of flowering plants (angiosperms) based on studies of the plant fossil record. His popular writing includes Ginkgo: The Tree That Time Forgot, a book that traces the evolution and cultural history of Ginkgo biloba to the present day.  Personal life and education  Peter Crane was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire in the United Kingdom. He attended Kettering Grammar School where he developed a strong interest in local history and archaeology as well as plants, and the University of Reading, where he received his B.Sc. in Botany, with honors, in 1975. He received his Ph.D. in Botany from Reading in 1981, having also served on the faculty there from 1978 with his thesis, \\"Studies on the Flora of the Reading Beds (Upper Palaeocene).\\" Crane is married with two children, a daughter and son.  Career  Peter Crane has held positions at the University of Reading (1978-1981), the Field Museum (1982-1999), the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1999-2006), the University of Chicago (2006-2009), Yale University (2009-2016) and the Oak Spring Garden Foundation (2016–present), among others. He has also held visiting or part- time positions at universities and museums around the world. The following section discusses some of his professional accomplishments in more detail. = The Field Museum of Natural History = Crane spent about 17 years working at the Field Museum of Natural History. Following a postdoctoral research position at Indiana University, Bloomington, Crane began in the Field Museum's Geology department as assistant curator of paleobotany. From 1982 to 1992, he held a variety of curatorial positions in the Department of Geology. Following a brief period as a Vice-President of the museum, Crane became Director of the Field Museum in 1995. His tenure as Director of the Field Museum saw strengthening of the museum's programs in collections and research as well as the creation of two cross departmental units, the Center for Cultural Understanding and Change, and the Office of Environmental and Conservation Programs. His time as Director also included the acquisition of \\"Sue,\\" a well- preserved and almost complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton. Sue has since become an iconic fixture at the Field Museum. = The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew = In 1999, Crane left the Field Museum to become Director and Chief Executive of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Crane sought to better connect the conservation and botanical work at Kew with the public side of the institution. Crane's time at Kew included the initial development of the Millennium Seed Bank, the attainment of UNESCO World Heritage site status, an embrace of digital technology, as well as an increase in the presence of seasonal themes and festivals that helped increase visitor attendance. His tenure at Kew saw increased visitation, both at Kew and also at Wakehurst Place, and a strengthening emphasis on the importance of biodiversity and the world of plants for the future of people. = The University of Chicago = Upon taking the position at Kew, Crane had said that he would not spend the rest of his career there. True to his word, Crane left Kew in 2006 to return to the United States, taking a University Professorship at the University of Chicago. Crane spent three years at the University of Chicago. = Yale University = Crane became the Dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies (FES) in 2009 (succeeding James Speth).Yale Daily News: \\"F&ES; unearths new dean\\" His arrival coincided with the rippling effects of the late 2008 Great Recession, and Crane played an important role in stabilizing the school's finances. Among his many other duties, he was involved in a variety of projects to provide student financial support and to increase student involvement in research. He also forged connections with other graduate programs (including the Yale School of Management). Crane also recruited several new scholars to the school and sought to strengthen programs supporting diversity and inclusion. In regards to research, Crane worked to increase research collaboration within the school. = Oak Spring Garden Foundation = In June 2016, Crane moved to northern Virginia to lead The Oak Spring Garden Foundation, a nascent nonprofit founded by the landscape designer and fashion icon Rachel \\"Bunny\\" Lambert Mellon. Located on part of the Mellons' former Virginia estate, called Oak Spring, the Foundation's mission is to \\"support and inspire fresh thinking and bold action on the history and future of plants, including the art and culture of plants, gardens and landscapes.\\" Containing Bunny Mellon's gardens and rare book library, the Oak Spring Garden Foundation supports research and scholarship relating to the diversity and future of plants; the art of plants, gardens, and landscapes. Crane is the inaugural president of the Foundation.  Research and publications  Peter Crane's research interests include: # Large-scale patterns and processes of plant evolution, plant paleontology. # Integrated paleobotanical and neobotanical studies of plant diversity and evolution. # Conservation of plant diversity, including crop diversity. # Strategic planning for collections-based not-for-profit organizations, especially museums and botanical gardens. As well as numerous scientific and popular articles, Crane has written Ginkgo: The Tree That Time Forgot, been an editor for peer-reviewed journals such as Paleobiology and The Botanical Review of the Linnaean Society, and contributed as editor to multiple volumes on the evolution and conservation of plants. He also co-wrote two major books on plant evolution. The first, written with Paul Kenrick, is titled: The Origin and Diversification of Land Plants. The second, written with Else Marie Friis and Kaj Pedersen in 2011, is titled Early Flowers and Angiosperm Evolution.  Honors and awards  He is a fellow of the Royal Society (1998), a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences (2001), a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2002), and a Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (German National Academy of Sciences, 2004). He was awarded a knighthood on 12 June 2004 for services to horticulture and conservation. In 2014 he was awarded the International Prize for Biology. He is the recipient of several honorary degrees including from Sewanee: The University of the South and the University of Connecticut in the United States, and the University of Kingston, the University of Portsmouth and Cambridge University in the UK.

At that time, India operated a small military hospital in the Farkhor region. The hospital at Farkhor was used to treat Afghan Northern Alliance members injured in fighting with the Taliban, including military leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was rushed there after a suicide attack against him. In 2002, India acknowledged that it was setting up an air base in Farkhor. It was secured with assistance from Russia. The airbase was in a dilapidated condition and was not used since the 1980s. The Indian Government awarded a $10 million tender to a private builder in 2003 to restore the airbase by 2005. After the builder defaulted, the Border Roads Organisation stepped in to complete the work. In 2006, India was considering deploying a squadron of MiG 29 aircraft at the base.

Casoy's journalism career started when he worked as a reporter for the now defunct television network TV Tupi in 1961. During the 1960s, in the early phases of the military dictatorship in Brazil, he was charged by the press with belonging to a paramilitary right-wing organization, Commando for Communist Hunting (Comando de Caça aos Comunistas, CCC) which was aimed at harassing and bullying leftist students.O Cruzeiro, November 9, 1968, available with comment at From 1974 to 1984, Casoy worked in the Paulista newspaper, Folha de S.Paulo - firstly as chief editor, a position in which he had to share power with the redaction director, the Trotskyist sympathizer Cláudio Abramo. In 1976, Casoy left this position and began editing a column on political faits divers, while Abramo took over the paper's chief editorship.Cf. However, in September 1977, Casoy resumed his earlier position, after the military threatened to intervene in the paper, holding Abramo responsible for the publication in the paper of a chronicle, by Lourenço Diaféria, deemed as demeaning to the historical figure of the Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias, the civic patron of the Brazilian Army.Cf.

As anchor, Casoy became famous for his rhetorical outbursts, as he acquired the habit of expressing disagreement with unpleasant facts (mainly corruption scandals) he had described by uttering repeatedly: \\"For Shame!\\" (\\"isto é uma vergonha!\\") - a stock-phrase that gave him the reputation of a vigilante who would speak truth to power.Cf.

However, he had speculated that there was pressure from the Worker's Party, since he and his crew were unrelenting in investigating and exposing supposed scandals and corruption cases in the left-wing government. After being fired from Rede Record, Casoy returned to television, but this time on a small regional television network in Rio de Janeiro, TV JB. He was the main anchor to the main newscast, Telejornal do Brasil. On April 14, 2008, Boris Casoy returned to national television on Rede Bandeirantes as the main anchor for its nightly newscast, Jornal da Noite. Casoy also presents the news in Rede Bandeirantes' radio news network, BandNews FM. In 2010, Casoy was involved in a scandal: after a TV news broadcast in which two street sweepers appeared offering season's greetings, he offered a private comment during commercials, without noticing that the audio channel was inadvertently open: \\"Shit, two garbage men offering greetings from atop their brooms... the lowest rung of the working ladder.\\" – a comment for which he had to apologize in public.Folha de S.Paulo, 1 January 2010, available at On September 30, 2016, Casoy left Band's nightly news program Jornal da Noite. On October 17, he became anchor of RedeTV!'s national news, RedeTV! News, replacing Sérgio Cursino.

Second on the left: Juan's father Juan de Tassis Villamediana was born at Lisbon towards the end of 1582. His father, Juan de Tassis y Acuña, 1st Count of Villamediana, upon whom the title of count was conferred by King Philip III of Spain in 1603, was a diplomat heading the Spanish legation who signed the Treaty of London, May 1604. On leaving Salamanca he married in 1601, and succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1607; he was prominent in the life of the capital, was forbidden to attend court, and resided in Italy from 1611 to 1617. On Villmediana's return to Spain, he was soon noted as a satirist. Prominent men such as the Duke of Lerma, Rodrigo Calderón, Count of Oliva and Jorge de Tobar were frequent targets. Villamediana was once more ordered to withdraw from court in 1618. He returned on the death of Philip III and was appointed gentleman-in-waiting to Philip IV's young wife, Elisabeth of France, daughter of Henri IV. According to legend, a fire broke out while Villamediana's masque, La gloria de Niquea, was being acted before the court on the May 14, 1622, and he carried the queen to a place of safety. Suspicion deepened; Peralta neglected a significant warning that his life was in peril, and \\"he was murdered as he stepped out of his coach. The responsibility for his death was divided between Philip IV and Olivares (the King's chief minister and favourite)\\".Fitzmaurice-Kelly1911) In addition, Narciso Alonso Cortés discovered documents in Simancas that implicated Villamediana in a trial on sodomy which concluded with the burning of five young men on December 5, 1622.

Biography Born to an upper-middle class Indianapolis family, Major developed an interest in both law and English history at an early age and attended the University of Michigan from 1872 through 1875, being admitted to the Indiana bar association in 1877. Shortly thereafter he opened his own law practice, which launched a short political career, culminating in a year- long term in the Indiana state legislature. Writing remained an interest of Major, and in 1898, he published his first novel, When Knighthood Was in Flower under the pseudonym Edwin Caskoden. The novel about England during the reign of King Henry VIII was an exhaustively researched historical romance, and became enormously popular, holding a place on bestselling book lists for nearly three years. The novel was adapted into a popular Broadway play by Paul Kester in 1901, premiering at the Criterion Theatre that year. The novel also launched relatively successful film adaptations in 1908 and 1922. With a successful writing career, Major gradually lessened his legal obligations, closing his law practice over a year after his first novel, in 1899. Published in 1902, his third novel, Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall, another historical romance, this time set in Elizabethan times, rivaled the success of his first. Once again, the novel was adapted for the theater by Paul Kester, and saw a film release in 1924 starring Mary Pickford. Major continued to write and publish several additional novels, to varying degrees of success, as well as a number of children's adventure stories, most set in and around his native state of Indiana. Charles Major died of liver cancer on February 13, 1913, at his home in Shelbyville, Indiana. In 2006, Shelbyville, Indiana native Eric Linne wrote and copyrighted a motion picture screenplay adaptation of Major's novel The Bears of Blue River.

Life =Voltaire's protégé= Charles was born in Paris as the heir of a financier who left him a large fortune and the nobility title of Marquis. After taking part in the Seven Years' War, Villette returned in 1763 to his native city, where he owned an estate in Clermont. The Marquis made many enemies by his perceived lack of manners. Nonetheless, he succeeded in gaining the intimacy of Voltaire, who had known his mother and who wished to turn him into a poet - the aging philosophe is even recorded to have viewed his protégé Villette as \\"the French Tibullus\\". In 1765, Voltaire invited the Marquis to his estate at Ferney. Although Voltaire joked quite freely about the Marquis' illegal attractions to men, he convinced the Marquis to marry Reine Philiberte de Varicourt in 1777. The marriage was unhappy, and his wife was subsequently adopted by Voltaire's niece, Marie Louise Mignot. Both Charles and Philiberte remained devoted to Voltaire, however, and it was at their home in Paris that Voltaire died in 1778. Villette kept Voltaire's heart in an urn.Crompton, Louis. Homosexuality and Civilization. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003. =Revolution= During the French Revolution, Villette publicly burned his lettres de noblesse, wrote revolutionary articles in the Chronique de Paris, and put forth the proposal that Louis XVI of France should be stripped of most power but maintained as head of state. In the rain of pamphlets which followed this advice, much was made of Villette's attraction to men. One pamphleteer vulgarized him as a man \\"unnatural\\" in all things. Another claimed that his own pamphlet, Les Enfants de Sodome à l'Assemblée Nationale, ou Députation de l'Ordre de la Manchette aux représentants de tous les ordres, actually came from the house of Villette, who was named as Grand Commander of an order of male lovers in this mocking call for gay rights. The attacks were answered on Villette's behalf by his illustrious friend, Anacharsis Cloots, a Dutchman hailed as \\"the Spokesman for the Human Race\\". Villette was elected deputy to the National Convention by the départment of Seine-et-Oise in 1792. He had the courage to condemn the September Massacres and to vote for the imprisonment only, and not for the death penalty, of Louis XVI (December 1792). He died in Paris the next year, and his seat in the Convention was taken by Antoine-Augustin Auger. Works In 1784 he published his Œuvres, and in 1792 his articles in the Chronique de Paris appeared in book form under the title Lettres choisies sur les principaux événements de la Révolution.

His architectural work, compressed into a single decade (1923–33), placed Melnikov on the front end of 1920s avant-garde architecture. Although associated with the Constructivists, Melnikov was an independent artist,\\"...Melnikov [was] not interested in theory and did not have a craving for getting a following. His view about architecture as an individual artistic expression...\\" p 39 from: \\"Melnikov and Soviet Architecture\\", an essay by Otakar MÁČEL in: Melnikov, the muscles of invention, publishedby van Hezik -Fonds 90 Rotterdam., not bound by the rules of a particular style or artistic group. In 1930s, Melnikov refused to conform with the rising Stalinist architecture, withdrew from practice and worked as a portraitist and teacher until the end of his life. Biography =Childhood= Konstantin Melnikov was born and died in Moscow. He was the fourth child of the family. His father, Stepan Illarionovich Melnikov, originally from Nizhny Novgorod region, was a road maintenance foreman, employed by the Moscow Agricultural Academy. Mother, Yelena Grigorievna (née Repkina), came from the peasants of Zvenigorod district. The whole family occupied a single room of a state-managed working class barrack in Hay Lodge (Соломенная Сторожка),Common English translation of Hay Lodge is incorrect; actually, it is Straw, not hay. The name refers to cob or adobe walls of those workers' barracks. then a quiet northern suburb of Moscow. Melnikovs tried hard to rise above bitter poverty, to return to farming and eventually relocated to their own small house and set their own dairy farm. Konstantin Melnikov later praised his father, who noticed the little boy's addiction to drawing and regularly brought him scrap paper for drawing from the Academy. However, all the education they could afford was a two-year parish school (completed in 1903).Khan-Magomedov, p.29-30 =Education= Professor Vladimir Mikhailovich Chaplin (second from left) with his family and his pupil Kostya Melnikov (second from the right). Moscow, 1904. Konstantin met his \\"golden day in life\\" (\\"это был золотой день в моей жизни\\")Khan- Magomedov, p.32, quotes Melnikov's own writing through a milk delivery woman, who happened to serve the family of Vladimir Chaplin, a wealthy engineer. She recommended Konstantin's drawings to Chaplin, who was so impressed that he hired the teenager to his firm and paid for his art studies. Chaplin overestimated Melnikov's basic education, and Konstantin failed his grammar test at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1904. One year later, he passed the admissions that selected a class of 11 out of 270 applicants. Melnikov studied at the School for 12 years, first completing General Education (1910), then graduating in Arts (1914) and Architecture (1917).Khan-Magomedov, p.32-34 Despite Chaplin's calls to concentrate on architecture, Melnikov leaned to painting; by the time he joined the Architecture classes, he already was a well-recognized portrait painter. Later, he recalled Konstantin Korovin, Sergey Malyutin and Abram Arkhipov as his mentors in art; as for architecture, he gave his regards only to Ivan Zholtovsky, his professor in 1917–1918.Khan-Magomedov, p.44 Melnikov married Anna Yablokova in 1912; they had two children, born in 1913 and 1915. =Early career= During World War I and the first years after Russian Revolution of 1917, Melnikov worked within the Neoclassical tradition. Before the Revolution, he was involved in AMO Truck Plant project. In 1918–1920, he was employed by the New Moscow planning workshop headed by Zholtovsky and Alexey Shchusev, designing Khodynka and Butyrsky District sectors of the city. Meanwhile, the Russian educational system collapsed; the new art college, VKhUTEMAS, was formed in 1920. Its architectural faculty was split between three factions: An Academic Workshop (Ivan Zholtovsky), left-wing United Workshops (Nikolai Ladovsky), and a joint workshop of Melnikov and Ilya Golosov, known as New Academy and Workshop No.2. Melnikov and Golosov resisted both the academic and left-wing camps; in 1924, when the management merged New Academy with Academic Workshop, Melnikov quit VKhUTEMAS.Khan-Magomedov, p.52 In 1923–1924, Melnikov temporarily associated himself with the ASNOVA and LEF artistic groups, however, he was not involved in public disputes and made no public statements. In particular, he clearly distanced himself from the Constructivist group, led by Moisei Ginzburg and Alexander Vesnin. His first success in architecture was a 1922 entry to a workers' housing contest. Codenamed Atom, Melnikov's design employed the sawtooth arrangement of units that became his trademark in later works. Unlike other, \\"revolutionary\\" projects, Atom was based on traditional single-family townhouse and apartment units.Khan-Magomedov, p.58 Melnikov's first materialized works were short- lived, temporary buildings. The first, a 1923 pavilion for the All-Russian Agriculture and Handicraft Exhibition, featured more Melnikov trademarks: * Raised cubical shapes are offset from supporting columns * Combination of single-sloped roofs * Glazed cornersKhan-Magomedov, pp.59, 71 The latter feature is shared with the Constructivists; single-sloped, angled roof was against the constructivist canon but a good match to existing technologies: Soviet industry of 1920s did not have the technology for reliable flat roofing.Khan-Magomedov, p.71 =Melnikov Garage= Melnikov's concept floorplan, Bakhmetevsky Garage In 1925 Melnikov designed and built the Soviet pavilion at the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes. The wooden pavilion, employing a combination of single- sloped roofs of different sizes, was regarded as being one of the most progressive buildings at the fair. Unlike other Paris pavilions, it was completed in less than a month, employing not more than 10 workers.Khan- Magomedov, p.102 Still in Paris, Melnikov designed two privately commissioned versions of a ramped garage that never got past the conceptual drawing stage. In the second version of this project, Melnikov found a useful pattern of placing cars in a garage (again, a sawtooth pattern) where cars could park and leave without using reverse gear. The second In Moscow, Melnikov saw a new fleet of Leyland buses hoarded in a yard in Zamoskvorechye, and immediately proposed his concept to the city. The result, Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, housed 104 buses on 8500 square meters of an unconventional, parallelogram-shaped floorplan with Vladimir Shukhov's roof system.Khan-Magomedov, p.108 Intourist Garage, the only facade remaining to date Melnikov later called this project \\"the start of my Golden Season\\".Khan-Magomedov, p.106 Bakhmetevsky Garage, sometimes incorrectly called a constructivist landmark, was very modestly styled in an indefinite \\"industrial\\" red brick. Melnikov's later garage buildings, on the contrary, possessed a clear avant-garde external styling (which has become badly damaged over time): * 1926-1929: Horseshoe-shaped truck garage, Novo-Ryazanskaya Street (with Vladimir Shukhov) * 1933-1936: Intourist car garage, Suschevsky Val Street (with Andrey Kurochkin) * 1934-1936: Gosplan car garage, Aviamotornaya StreetKhan-Magomedov, p.110-119 =Melnikov Clubs= The \\"golden season\\" of 1927 continued with a chain of trade union commissions for workers' clubs. \\"Beginning in 1927, my influence developed into a monopoly takeover... that's how love will treat you if she really loves you\\" (\\"Начиная с 1927, мой авторитет вырос в монопольный захват... вот так поступит любовь и с Вами, если она Вас полюбит\\").Khan- Magomedov, p.124 Nationwide construction of new, dedicated buildings for workers' clubs (combining propaganda, educational and community center functions) was launched in 1926 and peaked in 1927, when trade unions commissioned 30 clubs in Moscow region (10 in the city of Moscow). Melnikov won five of these ten projects (his sixth club is located in Likino-Dulyovo). Absence of public contests for these buildings was favorable to Melnikov, who was promoted by enthusiastic trade union commissioners, regardless of design complexity or political and artistic affiliations. He had a chance to build practically exactly as planned, with very little changes by the client (notably, omission of swimming pools).Khan-Magomedov, p.118-121, 139 All six workers' clubs of this period differ in shape, size, and functional set. Melnikov's clients (the unions) were not competent in exact functions of these buildings, thus each Melnikov draft is also a functional program with different balance between main hall and other space. The club, according to Melnikov, is not a single fixed theater hall, but a flexible system of different halls that may be united into a single, large volume when necessary. His larger main halls can be divided into three (Rusakov Club) or two (Svoboda Club) independent halls. One common feature of his clubs – bold use of exterior stairs – is actually a consequence of 1920s building codes that required wide internal staircase for fire evacuation. Melnikov, in an attempt to save interior space, connected the main halls to exterior galleries, which was not regulated by the code.Khan-Magomedov, p.138 File:Melnikov Stairs Svoboda Club Moscow BW.jpgSvoboda Club in northern Moscow was Melnikov's tribute to the land of his childhood File:Melnikov Kauchuk club.jpg1920s photo: Konstantin Melnikov in front of his Kauchuk Club File:ref pfanner14.jpgRusakov Club, 1927-1929 =Melnikov House= The Melnikov House, as seen from Krivoarbatsky Street The finest existing specimen of Melnikov's work is his own Krivoarbatsky Lane residence in Moscow, completed in 1927–1929, which consists of two intersecting cylindrical towers decorated with a pattern of hexagonal windows. His flow of commissions in 1926-1927 provided enough money to finance a three-story house of his dreams. At this time, many well-to-do Russians were into building their own city houses; Melnikov was one of the few who managed to retain his property after the fall of New Economic Policy. His request for land (790 square meters) had few chances to pass the district commission; to his surprise, a working class commissioner supported him, saying that \\"we can build public buildings anytime and anywhere, but we may never see this unusual house completed if we reject Melnikov\\".Khan-Magomedov, p.181 The city endorsed Melnikov's draft as an experimental, one-of-a-kind project. Rear of the Melnikov House Melnikov preferred to work at home, and always wanted a spacious residence that could house his family, architectural and painting workshops. As the Russian idiom says, he designed the house starting \\"from the hearth\\"; existing white oven in his living room dates back to his 1920 drawings.Khan-Magomedov, p.162 Floorplan evolved from a plain square to a circle and an egg shape, without much attention to exterior finishes. Melnikov developed the concept of intersecting cylinders in 1925-1926 for his Zuev Workers' Club draft (he lost the contest to Ilya Golosov). Twin cylinder floorplan was approved by the city in June, 1927 and was revised during construction.Khan-Magomedov, p.177 The towers, top to bottom, are a honeycomb lattice made of brickwork. 60 of more than 200 cells were glazed with windows (of three different frame designs), the rest filled with clay and scrap. This unorthodox design was a direct consequence of material rationing by the state – Melnikov was limited to brick and wood, and even these were in short supply. The wooden ceilings have no supporting columns, nor horizontal girders. They were formed by a rectangular grid of flat planks, in a sort of orthotropic deck. The largest room, a 50 square meter workshop on the third floor, is lit with 38 hexagonal windows; equally large living room has a single wide window above the main entrance.Khan-Magomedov, p.191 Melnikov House video (2010) In 1929, Melnikov proposed the same system of intersecting cyliitecture – is a honeycomb lattice shell made of bricks with hexahedral cells. The similar lattice shells out of metal were patented and built by Vladimir Shukhov in 1896. Melnikov built his house in 1927–1929, and by that time in Russia there had been already built about 200 Shukhov's steel lattice shells as the overhead covers of buildings, hyperboloid water and other towers, including the famous 160 meter radio tower in Moscow (1922). Since Melnikov and Shukhov were well acquainted with each other and made joint projects (Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Garage), it is not surprising that the Melnikov's house in Krivoarbatsky pereulok was built in the form of an original lattice shell. The overhead covers of the own Мelnikov's house are the honeycomb lattice shells made of wooden boards placed edgewise.http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Perekrytiya.jpg =End of career= Throughout 1933–1937, as a leader of the Mossovet Seventh Planning Workshop, Melnikov was involved in city planning projects for the south-western sector of Moscow (Arbat Square and Khamovniki District). None of them materialized. These assignments looked like an appreciation of his talent, but in fact separated Melnikov from actual construction projects. His final public statement was a 1936 contest entry for the Soviet pavilion at 1937 World Expo in Paris. He lost the contest to Boris Iofan. By 1937, mounting criticism against \\"formalism\\" led to the virtual excommunication of Melnikov from practice. He was not exactly forgotten; on the contrary, his Rusakov Club and Arbat house were present in many Soviet textbooks as examples of Formalism. Despite the damning status of \\"alien artist\\", Melnikov retained his Arbat house and lived there, safely, with his family until his death. He returned to portrait painting and lectured at engineering colleges. Melnikov also designed privately commissioned, unimportant architectural jobs – summer houses, shop interiors – some of which materialized.Khan-Magomedov, p.248 Melnikov returned to the public contest stage four times: *1954 – for the Pantheon and 300 years of Russian-Ukrainian Unity monument *1958 –Palace of Soviets (post-World War II contest) *1962 – Soviet Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair *1967 – Cinema on Arbat Street (next to his own house) In the 1960s Melnikov enjoyed a brief revival of interest in his architecture. His 75th birthday (1965) was officially celebrated by the House of Architects in Moscow; in 1967 and 1972 he was awarded the honorary titles of Doctor of Architecture and Meritorious Architect. Melnikov died at the age of 84 and was interred in the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in the Lefortovo District of Moscow. His son, Viktor, also a painter, lived and worked at the Arbat house, and fought to have it preserved as a museum until his death in February 2006. The house contains a significant portion of Konstantin S. Melnikov's archive.

It usually had a closed body on four wheels, sat two to four persons, and was drawn by two or four horses. A postilion rode on the near-side (left, nearest the roadside) horse of a pair or of one of the pairs attached to the post-chaise\\"Re- enactment of Lapenotiere's Journey,\\" Exeter Memories, 15 August 2009 leaving passengers a clear view of the road ahead. Purpose Hired when long- distance travel at speed was very important, a post chaise would be taken with its own postilions and horses. At the next posting station the postilions would most likely return to their base with their own horses but might continue the journey with fresh horses. Private posting was expensive and passengers — particularly if the only passenger was a woman — would be accompanied by one or two of their own footmen riding above and behind the body of the post chaise. The footmen would be responsible for making all travel arrangements. Private individuals did own their own post chaises; some had their light chariots made with the coachman's seat removable. Designed to withstand rapid long-distance travel, the post chaise should have been utilitarian, but private vehicles might be extravagantly decorated and finished.Paul H. Downing. A History of Carriages, The Carriage Journal, Page 160, Vol 4, No 4, Spring 1967, Carriage Association of America Posting In a 1967 article in The Carriage Journal, published for the Carriage Association of America, Paul H Downing recounts that the word post is derived from the Latin postis which in turn derives from the word which means to place an upright timber (a post) as a convenient place to attach a public notice. Postal and postage follow from this. Medieval couriers were caballari postarus or riders of the posts. The riders mounted fresh horses at each post on their route and then rode on. Post came to be applied to the riders then to the mail they carried and eventually to the whole system. In England regular posts were set up in the 16th century. The riders of the posts carried government messages and letters. The local postmasters delivered the letters as well as providing horses to the royal couriers. They also provided horses to other travellers. =Post chaise= The system of ‘’posting’’ was common in France. An artillery officer, John Trull, entered business in England in 1743 hiring out travelling carriages. At first these carriages had two wheels but they were soon replaced by four wheel carriages given the same name, Post-chaise. The original French design was amended, a conventional pole was fitted, no driver was provided for — leaving a view through the front window for the passengers — and the horses were ridden by postilions or post-boys. The postilions went from post to post, stayed with their own horses and took them back home at the end of that stage. =America= At that time there was no perfected posting system in America. George Washington’s tour of the South in 1791 had a target (when there were no other commitments) of an average 35 miles a day whereas in England an average speed of 8 or 10 miles an hour might be achieved right round the clock. A true chaise is an open two wheeled carriage with a bench seat for two passengers drawn by one or two horses. Given two more wheels it would have been, if the name had been used then, a phaeton. A phaeton was for the owner to drive and generally drawn by one or two horses. A four-wheeled chaise would be drawn by at least four horses. Around the time Trull was introducing post-chaises to England Americans began to use the same name for what had been called a four-wheeled chaise.

Set on the streets of Bristol, England, it features two runaway teenagers who join a group of squatters, where they fall into heroin addiction and embrace anarchism. Both critically and commercially, it is the best received of Burgess' novels. Yet it was unusually controversial at first, criticized negatively for its 'how-to' aspect, or its dark realism, or its moral relativism. Burgess won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding children's book by a British author. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal, in 2007, Junk was named one of the Top 10 winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Junk also won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice; it is the latest of six books to win both awards. In the US, Henry Holt published the novel in 1997 as Smack — another slang term for heroin. Plot summary Junk is told in the first person, with each chapter having a different character narrating. At the beginning of the story, fourteen-year old Gemma Brogan is spending time with David 'Tar' Lawson, a boy of the same age. Tar is a victim of physical abuse at the hands of his father, and - as he later realises - emotional abuse from his mother. Both of his parents are alcoholics. After a particularly violent incident, he decides to run away to Bristol, even though he knows no-one there and has no money. Gemma, despite having loving (albeit strict) parents, also decides to leave home and join Tar in Bristol shortly afterwards. In Bristol, Tar sleeps rough, interacting regularly only with Skolly, a local newsagent who takes a shine to his naive, trusting attitude. Skolly eventually introduces Tar to Richard, an absent- minded, vegan anarchist, who opens up abandoned houses for use as squats. Tar joins Richard and his friends - Vonny, an eighteen-year old 'motherly' woman; and her boyfriend Jerry, who is described as a bit useless. Between them, the young adults support Tar financially in order to keep him safe and away from his father, even though it is illegal. Gemma comes 'to visit', intending to stay. Vonny is frustrated by this, as she does not see it as the same situation; they are protecting Tar, but Gemma has nothing to be afraid of and merely wants a more 'interesting' life. Vonny reluctantly allows Gemma to stay for a while, but insists that both teenagers ring their families from a telephone box to let them know that they are safe. Tar is happy with their situation, but Gemma gradually grows more restless, wanting to find some people their own age. The adults decide after a few weeks that Gemma must return home. Richard holds a 'farewell' party in the abandoned house and, to Vonny's chagrin, he invites Lily and Rob, a couple whom she suspects to be on hard drugs. Gemma is enamoured with Lily, from the moment she sees her. The two girls connect instantly, and Lily invites the pair to stay the night with them. Whilst they are there, Lily and Rob encourage Gemma and Tar to smoke heroin with them, and they do, believing that only smoking it will not get them addicted. The pair are subsequently invited to live with Lily and Rob, and they move out from Richard's squat into that of Lily. Tar and Gemma live with Lily and Rob for a long time, and in the early days, it is all fun - they have frequent parties, shoplift to feed themselves, and heat their house with fuel from skips. They know all the local squatters and drug-users, becoming particularly close to Sally, another girl their age. However, their heroin- smoking habit quickly turns into long-term addiction. As time goes on, the girls start prostituting themselves to fund their habit. After an event involving a friend overdosing at their house, the police arrest Tar. He is sent to a drug rehabilitation centre as an alternative to prison, and gets clean, whilst simultaneously facing some of the trauma he has endured through counselling. He leaves the centre clean, and determined to stay that way, but uses heroin almost immediately once he arrives back at the squat. Lily, who does not work in the massage parlours as Gemma and Sally do, and instead works on the street with the protection of Rob, discovers she is pregnant. She decides to keep the baby, and the five of them vow to get clean. They take a trip to Wales, with the aim of getting themselves away from heroin and detoxing in a safe environment. However, the trip quickly falls apart - Rob and Sally both smuggle some heroin along with them, Tar hitch-hikes back to Bristol on the second day, and Lily discovers Rob's heroin and injects some herself. Gemma is determined to make it through, but eventually caves in once she realises she is the only one holding out. They return to Bristol, scared by what they have realised about their addictions: that they truly cannot stop just because they want to. In time, Lily has the baby and continues to inject heroin whilst the baby is breastfeeding. Meanwhile, Rob starts cottaging himself in public toilets, to fund their habit. Tar has totally changed; the naive, joyful person he once was, has been replaced by someone who lies to and steals from his friends and even from Gemma. Both boys become dealers, and undergo a traumatic experience when they arrive at a friend's house, to find him and his girlfriend dead after overdosing. However, they do nothing to alert the authorities, instead just stealing their drug stash. The catalyst comes when Gemma realises that she, too, is pregnant. After a particularly vulnerable moment with Lily, who non-verbally admits she is completely out of her depth, Gemma realises that she cannot let the same thing happen to her own baby. She leaves the house in the middle of the night and phones the police, telling them the address of the house and that it is being used to deal drugs. Tar, Rob and Lily are arrested, and Tar takes the rap again, which means he is given a custodial sentence. Meanwhile, Gemma locates Vonny and asks for her help. She allows Vonny to get in touch with her parents, who come to the hospital where she has been admitted with severe withdrawal symptoms. For the first time in three-and-a-half years, the Brogans are reunited with their daughter, who asks to come home. Gemma ends up living back in her hometown drug-free, and gives birth to her daughter Oona, whilst waiting for Tar to come out of prison. However, once he is released, Gemma realises that she no longer feels the same way about Tar, and eventually they break up. The reader learns that Tar ends up forcing his way into Gemma's home and hits her at least once, in a bleak repetition of his own father's behaviour. Gemma has no problem staying off heroin, once she has gone through withdrawal, whereas Tar finds it much more difficult and slips several times, even though he is on methadone. The story ends with Tar having a new girlfriend and seeing Oona every so often, whilst lamenting the life he lost, still craving heroin and still holding onto the hope that Gemma will one day take him back.

It runs in the North-Northwest direction, departing as a branch from the Anhangüera Highway near the city of Limeira. It also crosses with the Rodovia dos Bandeirantes, nearby the city of Cordeirópolis. Main cities linked by the Washington Luís Highway are Rio Claro, São Carlos, Araraquara, Matão, Catanduva, São José do Rio Preto and Mirassol. It is named in honor of Washington Luís (1869–1957), one of the presidents of Brazil and a paulista, who famously declared in 1926 that \\"to govern is to build roads\\". The highway is managed and maintained through a state concession to the private companies Centrovias and Triângulo do Sol, and therefore is a toll road. From Mirassol to Ilha Solteira, the name is changed to \\"Feliciano Sales Cunha\\", keeping the SP-310 code.

In agricultural production, farmers as a relatively independent economic entity contract the collective land and other large-scale means of production and carry out production and management independently according to the contract. Except for a small part of its operating income, which is paid to the collective and state taxes following the contract, all income is attributed to farmers. History 1977 – 1978: The “Preparation Period” By the late 1970s, China's collectivization and centralization of agricultural production were encountered with several challenges, of which the shortage of agricultural products was the most urgent and serious. Droughts happened in rural areas and serious food supply crises occurred in urban regions. Many farmers and members of the People's Commune began thinking about new ways of agricultural production. In 1978, 18 households in Xiaogang Village, Fengyang County, Anhui Province came up with a new arrangement where each household was responsible for their profit and losses of production, which was known as the first trial of the household responsibility system. In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing. During the meeting, the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Accelerating Agricultural Development was passed, which proposed “devolving production responsibility to production units”(包产到组). However, the policy still prohibited delegating production responsibility to households (包产到户). 1979 – 1981: Struggling Back and Forth In early 1979, the National Agriculture Council was founded, which started a heated debate over whether China should adopt the household responsibility system within the Chinese central government. In March 1979, the National Agriculture Council held the Seven Provinces and Three Counties Meeting on Agriculture Development, during which the majority of representatives displayed a supportive attitude towards this proposal. However, the opposing voices were also strong. Wang Renchong, the Head of the National Agriculture Council, kept emphasizing the advantages of the collective economy and opposing the idea. In the end, Hua Guofeng, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China at the time, concluded that collective production did work, yet a certain amount of flexibility was also needed. Also, Hua Guofeng agreed that “for the impoverished households in remote regions, it is appropriate to delegate to them the responsibility and rights for their production.” Hua Guofeng's words were written into the official documents of the Central Committee of the CPC and it was the first time that the idea of household responsibility system appeared in the official document of the Central Committee of the CPC. In January 1980, The People's Communes Management Meeting was held in Beijing. In the meeting, Zhou Yueli, the Director of the Agricultural Committee of Anhui Province, introduced the status quo of agriculture development in Anhui. Zhou reported that by the end of 1979, 51% of production teams adopted the production unit responsibility system, and 10% adopted the household responsibility system; there were a significant production growth and 25% of the underdeveloped regions asked to adopt the household responsibility system. However, Zhou's idea received severe criticism from many representatives from other regions and provoked a huge debate over whether the household responsibility system was the right approach to take. In the end, Deng Xiaoping concluded that household responsibility was a highly complicated and critical issue, and it was unlikely to reach a simple conclusion. While the central government was still struggling with the idea back and forth, more and more villages already started adopting the household responsibility system. In 1979 the system was only adopted as a trial in a few regions, but in 1980, more and more places learned from these regions and developed their household responsibility system. The growing trend caught the attention of the central leadership of China and also led the decision-makers to a reconsideration of what the agricultural production system should be adopted. In April 1980, at the Long-term Planning Meeting of the Central Committee of CPC, Deng Xiaoping argued: “In underdeveloped and impoverished regions such as Northwestern China, Guizhou, and Yunnan province, approaches such as household responsibility system should be adopted”. During another speech in May, Deng Xiaoping supported the practice of Fengyang County and Feixi County of Anhui province and said that “Some colleagues worried that to practice this kind of system might hamper the development of the collective economy. I think these worries are unnecessary. Our overall direction is developing a collective economy. As long as the productivity increases and the division of labor and commodity economy develop, our collective economy will grow from a low level to a high level.” Besides the positive attitude towards the household responsibility system of Deng Xiaoping, the National Agriculture Council also conducted intense field research in Henan, Hebei, and other provinces to better understand the effectiveness and challenges of adopting the system. From 1980 to 1981, more and more collective agricultural production systems were transformed into household responsibility systems. By 1981, 51% of the households in Southeast provinces and Shandong province had already adopted the household responsibility system. 1982: Official Establishment In December 1981, the National Agricultural Work Meeting was held in Beijing, which emphasized the idea of letting people choose by themselves which systems to use. Soon later in 1982, the Central Committee of the CPC announced its “No.1 document” for the year, Minutes of The National Agricultural Work Meeting, which officially established the household responsibility system for China's agricultural production. The system was rapidly adopted nationwide and significant agricultural growth was witnessed. During the 20 years of collective agricultural production, the annual agricultural output was 30-50 billion kilograms, yet by the time of 1984, the number increased to 400 billion kilograms. At the same time, the overall agricultural GDP increased by 68% and the average income of farmers increased by 166%. The success of the household responsibility system signified a significant transition in China's economic model and opened a new era of China's agricultural economy and rural development.

Biography  Born in Syracuse, New York, Hamell spent years as a member of many bands before venturing into the realm of the solo singer-songwriter. He finally got his big break when he moved to Austin, Texas and earned a residency at first the Chicago House and then the Electric Lounge. Since then, he has released a number of albums on various labels, including Mercury Records, his own DiY label Such-A-Punch Media, and Righteous Babe Records, the label started by his longtime supporter and frequent touring companion, Ani Difranco. Ed has a son named Detroit, born in 2002. Detroit performed on Ed's album \\"The Happiest Man in the World\\". Hamell was seriously injured in a car accident in May 2000, but recovered from head and spinal injuries to release the album Ed's Not Dead: Hamell Comes Alive the following year. His touring covers the US, Europe, Scandinavia and Australia. In 2008, with the breakup of his 22-year marriage, Hamell wrote a song a day for a year and posted a video of it on his YouTube channel hamelltv. It is now over 450 songs. In 2014 Hamell signed to New West Records and released \\"The Happiest Man in the World\\". He began production on a one-man show with the same title based on the album and the demise of his marriage to be world premiered at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2014. In 2017, Hamell released his second album for New West Records, \\"Tackle Box.\\" In August of that year, Hamell streamed a selection of songs performed live at monuments around Washington, DC, in a series collectively called \\"Hamell Takes DC.\\" In 2018, Hamell composed the music and lyrics for the Columbus, Ohio based Shadowbox Live's play F#(K Cancer: The Musical.  Style  Hamell addresses poignant and controversial issues, but with a comic edge. Known for rapid and powerful strumming on his heavily amplified 1937 Gibson L-00 acoustic guitar, Hamell's musical styling is as far from traditional folk music as it is from the typical drum-heavy electric guitar ridden sounds of traditional punk music. \\"Hamell’s signature sound comes from his strumming with maximum aggression, tight to the bridge, which lends a metallic ring to a sustained and percussive low-end rumble,\\" writes Randal Doane, in a profile in Harper's. \\"Hamell also plays slide guitar lines sweetly drenched with the timbre and phrasing of his musical forebears of the Mississippi Delta. 'I’m a Libra,' he told me last fall, over coffee. 'I need the balance.'\\" His sound and composition is comparable to that of the Velvet Underground. Live performances also include extended jokes and comic anecdotes between songs, demonstrating Hamell's respect for the stand-up comedy of Bill Hicks, who is celebrated in the closing tracks of Hamell's album Choochtown.

A trigonon (trígōnon, from Greek \\"τρίγωνον\\", \\"triangle\\") is a small triangular harp occasionally used by the ancient Greeks and probably derived from Assyria or Egypt. The trigonon is thought to be either a variety of the sambuca or identical with it. A trigonon is represented on one of the Athenian red-figured vases from Cameiros in the island of Rhodes, dating from the 5th century BCE, which are preserved in the British Museum. The triangle is here an irregular one, consisting of a narrow base to which one end of the string was fixed, while the second side, forming a slightly obtuse angle with the base, consisted of a wide and slightly curved sound-board pierced with holes through which the other end of the strings passed, being either knotted or wound round pegs. The third side of the triangle was formed by the strings themselves, the front pillar, which in modern European harps plays such an important part, being always absent in these early Oriental instruments. A small harp of this kind having 20 strings was discovered at Thebes, Greece in 1823.

Separable pure states  For simplicity, the following assumes all relevant state spaces are finite-dimensional. First, consider separability for pure states. Let H_1 and H_2 be quantum mechanical state spaces, that is, finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with basis states {{a_i}rangle}_{i=1}^n and {{b_j}rangle}_{j=1}^m, respectively. By a postulate of quantum mechanics, the state space of the composite system is given by the tensor product :H_1 otimes H_2 with base states {{a_i}rangleotimes {b_j}rangle}, or in more compact notation {a_i b_j rangle}. From the very definition of the tensor product, any vector of norm 1, i.e. a pure state of the composite system, can be written as : psirangle = sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} ( a_i rangle otimes  b_j rangle) =sum_{i,j} c_{i,j}  a_i b_j rangle, where c_{i,j} is a constant. If a pure state psirangle in H_1 otimes H_2 can be written in the form psirangle = psi_1rangle otimes psi_2rangle where psi _i rangle is a pure state of the i-th subsystem, it is said to be separable. Otherwise it is called entangled. When a system is in an entangled pure state, it is not possible to assign states to its subsystems. This will be true, in the appropriate sense, for the mixed state case as well. Formally, the embedding of a product of states into the product space is given by the Segre embedding. That is, a quantum-mechanical pure state is separable if and only if it is in the image of the Segre embedding. The above discussion can be extended to the case of when the state space is infinite-dimensional with virtually nothing changed. Separability for mixed states Consider the mixed state case. A mixed state of the composite system is described by a density matrix rho acting on H_1 otimes H_2. ρ is separable if there exist p_kgeq 0, { rho_1^k } and { rho_2^k } which are mixed states of the respective subsystems such that : rho=sum_k p_k rho_1^k otimes rho_2^k where :; sum_k p_k = 1. Otherwise rho is called an entangled state. We can assume without loss of generality in the above expression that { rho_1^k } and { rho_2^k } are all rank-1 projections, that is, they represent pure ensembles of the appropriate subsystems. It is clear from the definition that the family of separable states is a convex set. Notice that, again from the definition of the tensor product, any density matrix, indeed any matrix acting on the composite state space, can be trivially written in the desired form, if we drop the requirement that { rho_1^k } and { rho_2^k } are themselves states and ; sum_k p_k = 1. If these requirements are satisfied, then we can interpret the total state as a probability distribution over uncorrelated product states. In terms of quantum channels, a separable state can be created from any other state using local actions and classical communication while an entangled state cannot. When the state spaces are infinite-dimensional, density matrices are replaced by positive trace class operators with trace 1, and a state is separable if it can be approximated, in trace norm, by states of the above form. If there is only a single non-zero p_k, then the state is called simply separable (or it is called a \\"product state\\").  Extending to the multipartite case  The above discussion generalizes easily to the case of a quantum system consisting of more than two subsystems. Let a system have n subsystems and have state space H = H_1 otimes cdots otimes H_n. A pure state  psi rangle in H is separable if it takes the form : psi rangle =  psi_1 rangle otimes cdots otimes  psi_n rangle . Similarly, a mixed state ρ acting on H is separable if it is a convex sum :rho = sum_k p_k rho_1 ^k otimes cdots otimes rho_n ^k. Or, in the infinite-dimensional case, ρ is separable if it can be approximated in the trace norm by states of the above form.  Separability criterion  The problem of deciding whether a state is separable in general is sometimes called the separability problem in quantum information theory. It is considered to be a difficult problem. It has been shown to be NP-hard.Gurvits, L., Classical deterministic complexity of Edmonds’ problem and quantum entanglement, in Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM Press, New York, 2003.Sevag Gharibian, Strong NP-Hardness of the Quantum Separability Problem, Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 10, No. 3&4, pp. 343-360, 2010. arXiv:0810.4507. Some appreciation for this difficulty can be obtained if one attempts to solve the problem by employing the direct brute force approach, for a fixed dimension. We see that the problem quickly becomes intractable, even for low dimensions. Thus more sophisticated formulations are required. The separability problem is a subject of current research. A separability criterion is a necessary condition a state must satisfy to be separable. In the low-dimensional (2 X 2 and 2 X 3) cases, the Peres-Horodecki criterion is actually a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Other separability criteria include (but not limited to) the range criterion, reduction criterion, and those based on uncertainty relations. See Ref. for a review of separability criteria in discrete variable systems. In continuous variable systems, the Peres-Horodecki criterion also applies. Specifically, Simon formulated a particular version of the Peres-Horodecki criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for 1oplus1 -mode Gaussian states (see Ref. for a seemingly different but essentially equivalent approach). It was later found that Simon's condition is also necessary and sufficient for 1oplus n -mode Gaussian states, but no longer sufficient for 2oplus2 -mode Gaussian states. Simon's condition can be generalized by taking into account the higher order moments of canonical operators or by using entropic measures.  Characterization via algebraic geometry  Quantum mechanics may be modelled on a projective Hilbert space, and the categorical product of two such spaces is the Segre embedding. In the bipartite case, a quantum state is separable if and only if it lies in the image of the Segre embedding. Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper \\"Geometrical aspects of entanglement\\"\\"Geometrical aspects of entanglement\\", Physical Review A 74, 012313 (2006) describe the problem and study the geometry of the separable states as a subset of the general state matrices. This subset have some intersection with the subset of states holding Peres-Horodecki criterion. In this paper, Leinaas et al. also give a numerical approach to test for separability in the general case.  Testing for separability  Testing for separability in the general case is an NP-hard problem. Leinaas et. al. formulated an iterative, probabilistic algorithm for testing if a given state is separable. When the algorithm is successful, it gives an explicit, random, representation of the given state as a separable state. Otherwise it gives the distance of the given state from the nearest separable state it can find.

Early life Bennett was born to a prosperous Roman Catholic family in Newmill, Banffshire, Scotland, Great Britain. At age 15, Bennett entered the Roman Catholic seminary in Aberdeen, where he remained for four years. After leaving the seminary, he read voraciously on his own and traveled throughout Scotland. In 1819, he joined a friend who was sailing to North America. After four weeks they landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Bennett briefly worked as a schoolmaster till he had enough money to sail south to Portland, Maine, where he again taught school in the village of Addison, moving on to Boston, Massachusetts by New Year's Day, 1820. He worked in New England as a proofreader and bookseller before the Charleston Courier in Charleston, South Carolina hired him to translate Spanish language news reports, so he briefly relocated to the South. He moved back north to New York City in 1823, where he worked first as a freelance paper writer and, then, assistant editor of the New York Courier and Enquirer, one of the oldest newspapers in the city. New York Herald In May 1835, Bennett began the New York Herald after years of failing to start a paper. After only a year of publication, in April 1836, it shocked readers with front-page coverage of the grisly murder of the prostitute Helen Jewett. Bennett got a scoop and conducted the first-ever newspaper interview for it. In business and circulation policy, The Herald initiated a cash-in-advance policy for advertisers, which later became the industry standard. Bennett was also at the forefront of using the latest technology to gather and report the news, and added pictorial illustrations produced from woodcuts. In 1839, Bennett was granted the first ever exclusive interview to a sitting President of the United States, the eighth occupant, Martin Van Buren (lived 1782–1862, served 1837–1841).Paletta, Lu Ann and Worth, Fred L. (1988). \\"The World Almanac of Presidential Facts\\". =Endorsements= The Herald was officially independent in its politics but endorsed for president William Henry Harrison (1840), James K. Polk (1844), Zachary Taylor (1848), Franklin Pierce (1852), and John C. Frémont (1856). The author Garry Boulard speculates that Bennett ultimately turned against Pierce for not appointing him to a much-coveted post as American minister plenipotentiary (later called ambassador) to France. From then on, Bennett consistently lambasted Pierce on both his front and editorial page and often called him \\"Poor Pierce.\\" Bennett supported Democrat and Secretary of State under Pierce, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania in the 1856 Election as tensions rose between the sections and states over slavery and states' rights and reached critical point during the 1850s, after the controversial Compromise of 1850. He later endorsed Southern Democrat and incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge (lived 1821–1875, served 1857–1861), of Kentucky under Buchanan for the 1860 presidential campaign and shifted to John Bell (1796–1869), of Tennessee running as a Constitutional Unionist among the four presidential candidates in the confused but pivotal general election in November 1860. In the midst of the following Civil War (1861–1865), he promoted former Union Army General-in-Chief George B. McClellan (1826–1885), nominated from the Democratic Party in the 1864 election, campaigning for a negotiated peace with the South against a second term for wartime 16th President Abraham Lincoln (lived 1809–1865, served 1861–1865), but the paper itself endorsed no candidate for the unusual war election of 1864. Although he generally opposed the Republican Lincoln, Bennett still backed the Northern cause for the Union and took the lead to turn the Republican war president into a martyr after his April 14, 1865 assassination at Ford's Theater in Washington. He favored most of successor 17th President Andrew Johnson (lived 1808–1875, served 1865–1869), former Vice President for one month in Lincoln's brief second term, a War Democrat, former U.S. Senator and loyal wartime Governor of Tennessee, and his following moderate Reconstruction Era policies and proposals towards the defeated South, following what was thought would have been Lincoln's gentle hand had he lived. =Later career= By the time that Bennett turned control of the New York Herald over to his son James Gordon Bennett Jr. (1841–1912), who was 25 in 1866, it had the highest circulation in America but would soon face increasing competition from Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and soon in the next decades, from Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, and Henry Jarvis Raymond's The New York Times. However, under the younger Bennett's stewardship, the paper slowly declined under the increasing stiff competition and changing technologies in the late 19th century and, after his 1912 death, it was merged a decade later with its former archrival, the New York Tribune in 1924, becoming the New York Herald Tribune for another 42 years. It met with considerable success and reputation in its last half-a-century until it finally closed in 1966–1967. Personal life On June 6, 1840 he married Henrietta Agnes Crean in New York. They had three children, including: * James Gordon Bennett, Jr. (1841–1918) * Jeanette Gordon Bennett (d. 1936), who married Isaac Bell Jr. (1846–1889) He died in Manhattan, New York City, on June 1, 1872. This was five months before his rival / competitor Horace Greeley also succumbed to illness in November 1872, after Greeley's disastrous presidential election campaign of 1872. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York City. =Legacy= James Gordon Bennett Sr. and the Herald used racist language, advocated for Southern secession, attacked Lincoln for trying to keep the Union together and generally opposed the American Civil War. In June 1863 the Herald supported a mass anti-war rally in New York City where the war was denounced as an unconstitutional crusade that would lead to freed Blacks flooding North and competing for white jobs. Bennett endowed New York City Fire Department's highest honor for bravery in 1869 after his home was saved from destruction by firefighters. It remained one of the department's highest honors for 150 years. The City renamed it on Sept. 7, 2020, after Chief Peter J. Ganci to honor him as the highest ranking member of the department killed during the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. According to the New York Times, Bennett's racism has been called out for years by the Vulcan Society, a fraternal order of Black firefighters. According to historian Robert C. Bannister, Bennett was : :A gifted and controversial editor. Bennett transformed the American newspaper. Expanding traditional coverage, the Harold provided sports reports, a society page, and advice to the lovelorn, soon permanent features of most metropolitan dailies. Bennett covered murders and sex scandals and delicious detail, faking materials when necessary.... His adroit use of telegraph, pony express, and even offshore ships to intercept European dispatches set high standards for rapid news gathering.Robert C. Bannister, \\"Bennett, James Gordon\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1975) pp. 80-81. Bannister also argues that he was a leading crusader in American election campaigns in the 19th century: :Combining opportunism and reform, Bennett exposed fraud on Wall Street, attacked the Bank of the United States, and generally joined the Jacksonian assault on privilege. Reflecting a growing nativism, he published excerpts from the anti-catholic disclosures of \\"Maria Monk,\\" and he greeted Know- Nothingism cordially. Defending labor unions in principle, he assailed much union activity. Unable to condemn slavery outright, he opposed abolitionism.Bannister, \\"Bennett, James Gordon\\" pp. 80-81. James Gordon Bennett reportedly had strabismus for most of his life; an acquaintance once said that he was \\"so terribly cross-eyed that when he looked at me with one eye, he looked out at the City Hall with the other.\\" He has a street named for him from West 181st Street to Hillside Avenue in the Washington Heights neighborhood of northern Manhattan, and a New York City park, Bennett Park named in his honor along Fort Washington Avenue. The Avenue Gordon Bennett in Paris, France with Stade de Roland Garros, site of the French Open, tennis tournament, is also named after James Gordon Bennett, Sr., possibly thanks to his son.Invisible Paris: see street sign Bennett's account of the infamous Helen Jewett murder in the Herald was selected by The Library of America for inclusion in the 2008 anthology True Crime.

Following the life and romances of Dorothy Vernon in Elizabethan England, the novel became the year's third most successful novel according to The Bookman annual list of bestselling novels. The novel was Charles Major's third, and his second bestseller, following When Knighthood Was in Flower. A 1903 play and a 1924 film are based on the novel. History Historically, Dorothy Vernon, the daughter of Sir George Vernon, the owner of Haddon Hall, married John Manners, the second son of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland (circa 1492 - 1543) in 1563.Trutt, David. \\"Haddon Hall's Dorothy Vernon\\". 2006, accessed September 6, 2011 Sir George supposedly disapproved of the union, possibly because the Manners were Protestants and the Vernons were Catholics. According to legend, 18-year-old Dorothy eloped with Manners. In the novel, neither Dorothy Vernon nor John Manners has any siblings. Also, John Manners' father is alive. In the novel, the elopement takes place in 1568 (an adjustment needed to make it line up with Queen Mary's flight to England, which is a plot point in the novel). Plot The story is narrated by Sir George Vernon's 35-year-old cousin, Malcolm François de Lorraine Vernon. Raised in France, he became enamored of Mary, Queen of Scots, when she was a youth there, and followed her to Scotland. Historically speaking, Mary was captured, imprisoned, and forced to abdicate the Scottish throne in July 1567, but in the novel, Malcolm receives word of Mary's capture in the Fall. He immediately flees to England, and heads to Haddon Hall to take refuge with Sir George. On the way, he meets and becomes friends with John Manners, son of Sir George's hated enemy Thomas Manners (Lord Rutland). Years earlier, Sir George had suggested that Malcolm marry George's daughter Dorothy as a way to keep the Vernon properties held by Vernons. Dorothy at the time had been an awkward adolescent; she now is a mature, strong-willed, red-headed beauty. On his way to Haddon Hall, Malcolm (still in the company of John Manners) encounters Dorothy, her aunt, and her friend Madge, all of whom live at Haddon Hall. Catching glimpses of each other, John Manners and Dorothy instantly begin to be attracted to each other. Malcolm, by contrast, sees his cousin as too beautiful and strong-willed to make a good wife. As the book progresses, Dorothy and John develop a secret romance, aided by Malcolm and hidden from her father, who first presses her to marry Malcolm, and then the son of the Earl of Derby. Various dramatic elements include a chapter in which Dorothy is imprisoned in her bedroom, but manages to disguise herself as Malcolm to escape and meet John; John fails to recognize her, thinking her a male stranger, and makes some embarrassing remarks about his previous love affairs, and then when he realizes she is a woman, fails to recognize her as Dorothy, but attempts to kiss her, causing her to reveal herself. Later, John disguises himself and takes a job as a household servant at Haddon Hall to be able to spend time with Dorothy; she fails to recognize him for days until he reveals himself. This ruse ends when Dorothy quarrels with her father, who attempts to strike her. John jumps in the way and is struck unconscious, and a distraught Dorothy reveals that this is the lover her father suspected her of having. Her father orders him imprisoned in the dungeon, to be hanged the next day if the blow to his head does not kill him, but Malcolm, aided by Dorothy's Aunt (also named Dorothy), arrange for his escape. Subsequently, Queen Mary escapes from Scotland and takes secret refuge at Lord Rutland's estate. Queen Elizabeth arrives to visit Haddon Hall. Sir George brings the Stanlys (the Earl of Derby and his oafish son) to ratify the marriage contract before the Queen, but Dorothy publicly humiliates the Stanlys, ruining the arrangements and amusing the Queen. Meanwhile, her father has already begun to nurse a hope she might marry the Queen's favorite, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Unable to see John for an extended period of time, and knowing that the seductive Queen Mary is staying at his home, Dorothy becomes crazed with jealousy and tells Queen Elizabeth of Queen Mary's location. Elizabeth rouses a troop of soldiers to arrest Mary. Remorse-stricken, Dorothy attempts to arrive at Lord Rutland's before the troops, but fails, and John, his father, and Queen Mary are all arrested, and Dorothy's father finds out John's identity. Malcolm shares a carriage with Queen Mary and a sleeping, exhausted, Dorothy for the return to Haddon Hall, and during the trip Mary manages to regain his allegiance and romantic interest (despite his being engaged to Madge) and he promises to help her escape to France. Mary also attempts to gain the allegiance of the Earl of Leicester, but he betrays her to Elizabeth, resulting in Malcolm's arrest. Queen Elizabeth tells Dorothy she will free John and Lord Rutland if Dorothy can prove that they planned only to get Mary out of Scotland, and had no part in any conspiracy to place Mary on the throne of England. By speaking with him in the dungeon, which is equipped with a speaking tube for eavesdropping, Dorothy exonerates John and his father, and they are set free. Elizabeth decides Malcolm may go free as well, provided he leaves England and returns to France. Sir George, furious at Malcolm's part in aiding Dorothy and John's romance, tells him to leave Haddon Hall, so Malcolm gathers his belongings and apologizes to Madge and prepares to head to Lord Rutland's estate, where he will await the passport allowing him to leave England. As he leaves, Madge joins him, forgiving him, and they plan that she will accompany him to France as his wife. In the final chapter of the novel, during a party in Queen Elizabeth's honor, Dorothy tricks her father into letting her steal away for a few crucial minutes, supposedly to court the Earl of Leicester's affections. Instead, she is met by John, who literally carries her off despite her last- minute uncertainty, and they elope to his father's hall where they bid farewell to Malcolm and Madge, who move to France and don't see them again (as of the close of the novel, forty years later).

Perry's expedition to Japan in 1855. He served with distinction in the American Civil War, capturing New Orleans and in the first attack on Vicksburg (April–June 1862). Lowry was laid down on 1 August 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Pedro, California and launched on 6 February 1944; sponsored by Miss Ann Lowry. The ship was commissioned on 23 July 1944, Commander L. H. Martin in command. Service history =World War II= Lowry cleared San Pedro 26 October 1944 for training at Pearl Harbor and arrived San Pedro Bay on 14 December. From 19 December to 29 December she escorted convoys between Leyte and the Mindoro Island beachhead, and was also part of a special striking force that helped protect Mindoro from enemy attack. From 2 January to 10 January 1945 she operated as an effective task force screen and gunfire support ship in the invasion of Luzon, then patrolled the approaches to Lingayen Gulf guarding the newly won beachhead until sailing for Ulithi on 22 January. The destroyer departed Ulithi on 10 February to screen fast carrier Task Force (TF) 58 for air strikes against Honshū in support of the Invasion of Iwo Jima. The force returned to Ulithi on 1 March, from which Lowry sailed on 21 March for Okinawa to screen the support carrier group for the invasion until 29 April. Lowry then served as a radar picket off Okinawa. During this assignment, the ship engaged in numerous actions with enemy aircraft. The heaviest of these occurred on 28 May, when accompanying picket destroyer was hit by two kamikazes and sank with heavy loss of life. Lowry, after fighting to prevent the loss of her companion, stood by to rescue survivors despite the continued presence of enemy aircraft in the area. From 29 June she covered minesweeping operations in the South China Sea, then arrived San Pedro Bay on 27 July. For her work as radar picket she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. Lowry joined fast carrier TF 38 off Tokyo 24 August for occupation duty during which she furnished food to Allied prisoners of war until 1 October, when she sailed for Okinawa to embark passengers for the United States. Arrived at San Diego on 21 October for overhaul and west coast training. Lowry left San Francisco 14 July 1946 for Kwajalein to patrol during Operation Crossroads, the Bikini atomic bomb tests. She was on station from 24 July to 10 August, when she sailed for San Diego, arriving 22 August. Training off the west coast and in the Hawaiian Islands was broken in May 1947 when she visited Sydney, Australia, for the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Returning to San Diego 14 June, she decommissioned 30 June 1947 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. =Korea= Lowry recommissioned on 27 December 1950, Comdr. C. H. Morrison, Jr., in command. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she arrived New York on 30 April 1951, was overhauled at Norfolk, and in August began training exercises in the Caribbean, returning to Norfolk 15 November. On 22 January 1952, Lowry sailed, via the Panama Canal, to join the 7th Fleet, arriving at Yokosuka on 27 February. With TF 77, Lowry served off the east coast of Korea on shore bombardment, plane guard, and screening duty until early April, then had similar duty off the west coast of Korea with TF 95, the United Nations Blockading and Escort Force, through May. On 8 June, she sailed to rejoin TF 77 for gunstrike missions. Sailing via the Suez Canal and the principal Mediterranean ports, Lowry arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 19 August. Between 19 August 1952 and 1 February 1954, Lowry made training cruises to the Caribbean and off Florida, engaging in intensive exercises to increase her combat efficiency. She departed Norfolk on 1 February for her second world cruise, arriving at Naval Base Yokosuka, Japan from the Panama Canal on 9 March. After a number of simulated combat exercises, including a full‑scale mock invasion of Iwo Jima, she left Yokosuka on 29 June for Suez, completing her second circumnavigation at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia on 25 August. Training along the coast and in the Caribbean prepared Lowry for her first deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, for which she left Norfolk 7 November 1956, returning to Norfolk 28 February 1957 for renewed training and overhaul. She again left Norfolk 3 September for NATO \\"Strikeback\\" exercises in the North Atlantic, continuing on to the Mediterranean from which she returned to Norfolk 22 December. Her third tour with the 6th Fleet, 7 August 1959 to 26 February 1960, was followed by a FRAM II overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, completed 14 January 1961. In June 1961, Lowry joined Antisubmarine Warfare Task Group Alpha, a special force engaged in research and development. She served in this force for the major part of the next 4 years, which included such operations as the recovery of NASA Astronaut Virgil Grissom successfully completing the second American manned space flight on 21 July 1961 (Mercury- Redstone 4 / Liberty Bell 7), and the Naval Quarantine of Cuba which played the major role in ending the Cuban Missile Crisis of October–November 1962. =Vietnam= After her fourth Mediterranean deployment, 18 February 1965 to 12 July, Lowry had the DASH system installed, then participated in a large Atlantic Fleet operational exercise. Her 1966 6th Fleet deployment, 4 March to 12 August, was followed by duty as schoolship for the Fleet Sonar School, Key West. Through most of January and February 1967, Lowry embarked several Peruvian midshipmen for training under the Midshipmen Exchange Program. From 8 May through 22 September she underwent regular overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, followed by refresher training out of the Fleet Training Center, Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Lowry departed Norfolk early in April 1968, passing thru the Panama Canal on Easter Sunday, then continuing for the Far East on her first 7th Fleet deployment of the Vietnam War. Serving off the coast, she performed plane guard, naval gunfire support, and other duties for which the versatile destroyer was well suited. Highlights of port visits were visits to: Bangkok, Thailand; Sasebo and Yokosuka Japan; Hong Kong; Pusan, Korea; and the Philippines. Lowlights included a collision at sea while highlining, and monsoon seas with one of two screws non-functional. She arrived back at Norfolk on 27 November, then continued Atlantic coast operations into 1969. On May 29, 1969 a forward gun turret exploded during regular sea operations near Puerto Rico. During gunnery practice, a shell detonated inside the barrel, blowing most of the barrel over the side and into the ocean. One man inside the gun mount was killed and several were injured. Lowry received four battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean service. Brazilian service Lowry was struck from the Naval Registry on 31 October 1973 and transferred to the Brazilian Navy on the same day. She was renamed Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) and remained in Brazilian service until she was struck from service on 2 February 1996, used as target practice, and ultimately sunk in 1998. Other sources indicate the ship was scrapped October 1996.Destroyer Photo Index DD-770 USS LOWRY References * External links * navsource.org: USS Lowry * hazegray.org: USS Lowry Allen M.

Kosmotropes cause water molecules to favorably interact, which also (in effect) stabilizes intramolecular interactions in macromolecules such as proteins. Chaotropic agents (disorder-makers) have the opposite effect, disrupting water structure, increasing the solubility of nonpolar solvent particles, and destabilizing solute aggregates. Ionic kosmotropes Ionic kosmotropes tend to be small or have high charge density. Some ionic kosmotropes are , , , , , and . Large ions or ions with low charge density (such as , , , ) instead act as chaotropes. Kosmotropic anions are more polarizable and hydrate more strongly than kosmotropic cations of the same charge density. A scale can be established if one refers to the Hofmeister series or looks up the free energy of hydrogen bonding (Delta G_{rm HB}) of the salts, which quantifies the extent of hydrogen bonding of an ion in water. For example, the kosmotropes and have Delta G_{rm HB} between 0.1 and 0.4 J/mol, whereas the chaotrope has a Delta G_{rm HB} between −1.1 and −0.9. Recent simulation studies have shown that the variation in solvation energy between the ions and the surrounding water molecules underlies the mechanism of the Hofmeister series. Thus, ionic kosmotropes are characterized by strong solvation energy leading to an increase of the overall cohesiveness of the solution, which is also reflected by the increase of the viscosity and density of the solution. Applications Ammonium sulfate is the traditional kosmotropic salt for the salting out of protein from an aqueous solution. Kosmotropes are used to induce protein aggregation in pharmaceutical preparation and at various stages of protein extraction and purification. Nonionic kosmotropes Nonionic kosmotropes have no net charge but are very soluble and become very hydrated. Carbohydrates such as trehalose and glucose, as well as proline and tert-butanol, are kosmotropes.

His brother, Philip Mangano, was his right-hand man and consigliere. He is also a distant paternal relative of former Genovese crime family underboss Venero Mangano and a suspected relative of Lawrence Mangano. Vince as head of the Gambino family Mangano was named head of what was then the Mineo family in 1931, following the Castellammarese War. He was one of the original bosses of the modern Five Families, the others being Joseph Bonanno, Lucky Luciano, Joe Profaci and Tommy Gagliano. Mangano made the waterfront his family's main income producer. He and his associates would threaten to prevent cargo from being loaded or unloaded if the shipping company refused to pay a tribute. This effort was helped by the family's control of Brooklyn Local 1814 of the International Longshoremen's Association; its president, Anthony Anastasio, was a member of the family. Feud with Anastasia Despite being a mob power in his own right, Albert Anastasia was nominally the underboss of the Mangano crime family, under Mangano. During his 20-year rule, Mangano had resented Anastasia's close ties to Luciano and Costello, particularly the fact that they had obtained Anastasia's services without first seeking Mangano's permission. This and other business disputes led to heated, almost physical fights between the two mobsters.Davis, pp. 62-64 Disappearance and death Mangano's brother was found dead near Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn on April 19, 1951.

Many of the features from Hans Christian Andersen's later work The Tinderbox and from the story of Aladdin and his magic lamp originate with this version. Synopsis A soldier has been discharged from the king's service because of his wounds. The soldier leaves the castle and, as night falls, he requires somewhere to stay. Encountering the home of a witch, he asks her for lodging. The witch agrees on condition that he spade her garden the next day. This takes so long that he must stay another night, and in return she asks him to chop her wood. Once again, he must stay another night. The soldier summons the Spirit in the Blue Light at the bottom of the well. Illustration by George Cruikshank for Grimm's Goblins, by Edgar Taylor (1823). The following day, she requests that he go into a well and retrieve her blue light for her. He is in the process of doing so, but realizes he is being tricked and will be trapped in the well as soon as he gives it to her. He keeps the light for himself, not knowing what it is, but she leaves him in the well. He decides to smoke one last time and lights his pipe with the blue light. A dwarf comes to grant him whatever he wishes. He first asks to be led out of the well, then for the witch to be taken to jail and hanged. The soldier is still upset about the king, so he asks that the dwarf bring the princess so he may sleep with her, just to anger the king. When she wakes up, the princess tells her mother of her strange \\"dream\\", which the queen believes could have actually happened. She has the princess fill her pocket with peas and put a little hole in it so that if she actually is carried away they will be able to follow the path. The dwarf, however, notices, and spreads peas all over the city so that the peas lead to everywhere and cannot pin it on the soldier. The next night, she plans on hiding her shoe in the home to which she is taken. The dwarf warns against this to the soldier, but he does not heed it. The next day, the princess's shoe is found in his quarters and he is taken to jail. He sends his friend to get the blue light and as his final request asks for a last smoke of his pipe. The dwarf appears and kills the henchmen; the soldier also demands the king's life, but spares him after he begs for mercy. The soldier marries the princess and takes the throne.

He sometimes worked under the name Frank Ray, and to a lesser extent Phil Zupa, and the single moniker Espoia, the latter used for collaborations with fellow inker Mike Esposito. Biography =Early life and career= Frank Giacoia studied at Manhattan's School of Industrial Art (later the High School of Art and Design) and the Art Students League of New York. He entered the comics industry by penciling the feature \\"Jack Frost\\" in U.S.A. Comics #1 (cover-dated Aug. 1941), inked by friend and high school classmate Carmine Infantino — the latter's first art for comics and published by Marvel Comics' 1940s precursor, Timely Comics. His friend and collaborator Carmine Infantino, a classmate at the Art Students League, recalled that Later in 1941, Giacoia joined the New York City comic-book packager Eisner & Iger, the studio of Golden Age greats Will Eisner and Jerry Iger. His early works include drawing crime comics for Ace Comics, horror for Avon Publishing, and a multitude of characters for National Comics Publications (the primary company that evolved into DC Comics) including the Flash and Batman. Other companies for which Giacoia did art during the 1940s and 1950s include Crestwood Publications, Dell Comics, Eastern Color Printing, Fawcett Comics, Harvey Comics, Lev Gleason Publications, and Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Giacoia and writer Otto Binder introduced the short-lived character Captain Wonder in Kid Komics #1 (Feb. 1943). =Later career= During the 1960s Silver Age of comic books, Giacoia became best known as a Marvel Comics inker, particularly on Captain America stories penciled by the character's co-creator Jack Kirby. One of the company's preeminent names, he worked on virtually every title at one time or another. Giacoia inked the first appearance of the Punisher in The Amazing Spider-Man #129 (Feb. 1974). Giacoia also worked on the newspaper comic strip The Amazing Spider-Man (based on the Marvel comic book series of the same name) from 1978–1981, as well as on the strips Flash Gordon, The Incredible Hulk, Johnny Reb and Billy Yank, Sherlock Holmes, and Thorne McBride. He was credited as the pseudonym \\"Frankie Ray\\" for some time. In Fantastic Four #53 (August 1966), his real name was announced in the \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\". Awards and honors Giacoia was nominated for the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) in 1974. The 1989 graphic novel The Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives, the back cover of which was inked by Giacoia, is dedicated to his memory. He posthumously won one of the two annual Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame Awards in 2016. The award was received by his great-nephew, Mike Giacoia.

It lies towards the cliffs looking west from Pendeen. It is a village consisting mostly of granite terraced cottages with a council house estate. Some of the cottages used to house tin mining families who would be working down the Geevor Tin Mine. The Atlantic Ocean is just beyond the cliffs. Higher Boscaswell is a hamlet south-east of Pendeen. Toponymy \\"Boscaswell\\" should not be confused with the present-day village of Boscastle, further east on the north Cornwall coast, and F. J. Horsefield posited that what is now Boscaswell was once the site of another Danish castle. This is not now thought to be true. Recent archaeological excavations at the lower end of Boscaswell have indicated that the land has been occupied for more than 10,000 years. There is an ancient pagan well in Boscaswell which is where the name is thought to have its origins. The name can be broken down to the place (bos) of Cas' (a person or entity or abbreviation thereof) and well (as in the English word). Another explanation is given by Craig Weatherhill in 'A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-Names', where he gives a 1310 version of the name, 'Boscaswal', and points out that 'bos' in Cornish means dwelling, esp. in place names, thus giving 'Cadwal's dwelling'. Mining The mining sett of East Boscaswell Mine was sold by tender, either as a going or dead concern, in October 1882. Included was a 30 inch cylinder pumping engine and a 24 inch cylinder winding and stamping engine.

Named for the Council of Chalcedon, it has also included theologians such as Gary North, who later founded his own organization, the Institute for Christian Economics. The Chalcedon Foundation provides educational material in the form of books, newsletter reports and various electronic media, toward advancing the theological teachings of Rushdoony's Christian Reconstructionism movement. It is notable for its role in the influence of Christianity on politics in the U.S. and has been described as \\"a think tank of the Religious Right.\\" Rushdoony's son Mark now heads the foundation. The Chalcedon Foundation has been listed as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for, among other reasons, supporting the death penalty for homosexuality. History The Chalcedon Foundation, which is named after a 451 A.D. council that proclaimed the state’s subservience to God, was officially founded by Rushdoony in summer 1965. In 1971, North was hired part-time, and two years later North was hired full-time while Greg Bahnsen was also hired. Rushdoony founded Ross House Books in 1976, the same year in which North and Bahnsen left the Foundation to pursue careers elsewhere. In 1977, the Foundation's first office building was built. A decade later, the organization's Newsletter became a magazine, the Chalcedon Report. In the 1970s multimillionaire Howard Ahmanson became a Calvinist and joined Rushdoony's Christian Reconstructionist movement. Ahmanson served as a board member of Rushdoony's Chalcedon Foundation for approximately 15 years before resigning in 1996. Ahmanson said he had left the Chalcedon board and \\"does not embrace all of Rushdoony's teachings.\\" Time magazine covered the Ahmansons in their 2005 profiles of the 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America, classifying them as \\"the financiers.\\" Former American oil billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt also made heavy contributions to the Chalcedon Foundation. Key members of the Chalcedon Foundation over the years have included Gary North, Greg Bahnsen, David Chilton, Gary DeMar, Kenneth Gentry, and Andrew Sandlin. North has defined his politics as Neo-Puritanism. On February 8, 2001, Rushdoony died. He was succeeded by his son Mark Rushdoony, who continues to run the organization. In 2004, Ross House Books merged with Chalcedon, and in 2005, the Chalcedon Report was renamed Faith for All of Life. Beliefs The Chalcedon Foundation describes itself as a Christian educational organization oriented toward promoting Christian reconstruction, emphasizing the Cultural or Dominion Mandate. The Foundation's founder, Rousas John Rushdoony, who is known as “father of Christian Reconstruction” theology, advocated the imposition of Old Testament laws. Newsweek magazine described the Chalcedon Foundation as \\"a think tank of the Religious Right, including the Moral Majority.\\" Rushdoony himself claimed that his movement had 20 million followers, although not all of them are members of an organization. Chalcedon Foundation roots in the late 1960s evolved from Rushdoony's career as an Orthodox Presbyterian pastor. Rushdoony, and a handful of Ph.D.s and ex-seminarians wrote books and articles that were not especially popular at the time. Forty years later, however, secular journalists characterize Rushdoony's movement as \\"the spark plug behind much of the battle over religion in politics today\\". Rushdoony's work via the Chalcedon Foundation challenged conservative Christians to \\"take the whole Bible seriously—including inconvenient verses in the Old Testament that most Christians, even biblical literalists, politely ignore.\\" =Reconstructionism= The Chalcedon Foundation advocates the Christian Reconstructionism movement which \\"believes Christians must take control of society for 1,000 years before the Second Coming of Christ can be achieved.\\" Rushdoony believed the Bible should be adopted as law, including Scriptures advocating the death penalty for homosexuality, striking or cursing a parent, adultery, and lying. Rushdoony developed and articulated Christian Reconstructionism in his book The Institutes of Biblical Law (1973), which is promoted by the Chalcedon Foundation. The book is a commentary on the Ten Commandments, and provides an outline of a program for establishing a Christian theocracy. According to American journalist Frederick Clarkson, reconstructionism has played an important role in shaping the contemporary Christian Right citing that Reconstructionists who have already moved into positions of significant power and influence are two directors of Chalcedon Foundation, philanthropist Howard Ahmanson and political consultant Wayne C. Johnson, epitomizing the political strategy of the new Christian Right. =Dominionism= Dominionism or Dominion Theology is a grouping of theological systems with the common belief that the law of God, as codified in the Bible, should exclusively govern society, to the exclusion of secular law, a view also known as theonomy. Reconstructionists themselves use the word dominionism to refer to their belief that Christians alone should control civil government, conducting it according to Biblical law. The central biblical text for Dominionists is Genesis 1: 26–28, in which God declares that man shall have dominion over all the earth. This is seen as a mandate for believers to create both a Christian government and a Christian culture. It has been primarily associated with Rushdoony's Reconstructionism movement, as espoused by the Chalcedon Foundation. Rushdoony himself supported the John Birch Society, while North wrote the epilogue to a conspiracist text by the John Birch Society author, Larry Abraham. North went as far as declaring that the enemies of the United States were “a conspiracy of super-rich and super- powerful insiders.” =Homeschooling= The Chalcedon Foundation advocates homeschooling, believing \\"that the right place for a child's education is his home, and the right teachers are his parents\\". Rushdoony, a staunch advocate of homeschooling, viewed it as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. public school system. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia (a general and concise study of education), The Messianic Character of American Education (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum (a parent- oriented pedagogical statement), each of which are still promoted by the Chalcedon Foundation. In Harsh Truth About Public Schools published by the Chalcedon Foundation, writer and attorney Bruce N. Shortt, who homeschooled his own children, writes of the \\"dishonorable conduct, degenerating academic standards, and defensive bureaucracy that are jeopardizing America's future, courtesy of teacher unions' self-interest and increasingly derelict parents\\". Hate group designation In 2005, the Chalcedon Foundation was designated an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The Chalcedon Foundation promotes Christian Reconstruction and calls for the \\"imposition of Old Testament law on America and the world.\\" According to the SPLC, this \\"embraces the most draconian of religious views\\", being \\"opposed to modern notions of equality, democracy or tolerance.\\" The SPLC also stated that Rushdoony supported the death penalty for homosexuals, opposed interracial marriage, denied the Holocaust, and included \\"incorrigible children\\" as a group of people deserving of the death penalty.

It is rarely found in US casinos,Harold L. Vogel, Travel industry economics: a guide for financial analysis pg. 206 Cambridge University Press (2001) but still very popular in Continental European casinos, especially in France, Italy, and Monaco. It is a simple game that usually gives the players a very good expected return of more than 98%.William Norman Thompson Gambling in America: an encyclopedia of history, issues, and society pg. 379 ABC-CLIO (2001) Gameplay Two croupiers sit on each side of the table, one of them being the dealer; behind the two on the side opposite to the dealer a supervisor of the game has his seat. Six packs of fifty-two cards each are used; these are well shuffled, and the croupier asks any of the players to cut, handing him a blank card with which to divide the mixed packs. The game consists of the dealer dealing two rows of cards face up, the first (upper) row called noir and the second (lower) row called rouge. There are only four bets in trente et quarante: rouge and noir, known as the grand tableau', and couleur and inverse, known as the petit tableau. Rouge and noir bets are concerned with which row wins, and the couleur and inverse bets with whether the first card in the winning row is the same (coleur) or opposite (inverse) to the color of the row. Aces are worth 1 point, court cards 10 and pip cards their face value.Gayle Mitchell Easy Casino Gambling: Winning Strategies for the Beginner pg. 213 Skyhorse Publishing (2007) A tie is a stand-off, and on a 31-point tie, players may double or quit on the next coup or immediately lose half their stake.David Parlett, The Oxford Dictionary of card games, pg. 311 Oxford University Press (1996) The winning total will range between 30 and 40 card points, which is from where the name of the game derives.Diagram Group The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card Games pg. 348 Sterling (1995) =Winning row= Cards for each row are dealt until its total exceeds thirty (trente). The row whose total is closest to thirty is the winning row. If, for example, the cards dealt in the first row were 8, 7, K, and 9 and those in the second row were A, 2, J, Q, and 10 the noir total would be 34 and the rouge total would be 33, so that rouge would win. If the color of the first card in the rouge row also were red (in this example an ace of diamonds or hearts), the coleur bet also would win and the dealer will announce \\"Rouge gagne et la couleur.\\" However, if the first card dealt were black (an ace of clubs or spades), the dealer announces \\"Rouge perd et la coleur.\\" It frequently happens that both rows of cards when added together give the same number. Should they both, for instance, add up to thirty-three, the dealer will announce \\"Trois après,\\" and the deal goes for nothing except in the event of their adding up to thirty-one.Jean Boussac. The Trente-et-Quarante or the Red and Black, Paris, 1896. Transl. from French, 2017. =Refait= Un apres (i.e. thirty- one) is known as a refait; the stakes are put in prison to be left for the decision of the next deal, or if the player prefers it he can withdraw half his stake, leaving the other half for the bank. Assurance against a refait can be made by paying 1% on the value of the stake with a minimum of five francs. When thus insured against a refait the player is at liberty to withdraw his whole stake. It has been calculated that on an average a refait occurs once in thirty-eight coups. Refaits are the source of the sole house advantage in the game. After each deal the cards are pushed into a metal bowl let into the table in front of the dealer. When he has not enough left to complete the two rows, he remarks \\"Les cartes passent\\" (The cards pass); they are taken from the bowl, reshuffled, and another deal begins.

The title is misleading as the game is not an operational-level treatment of the Battle of Anzio but is in fact a strategic level game covering the entire Italian theater of operations in World War II from the autumn of 1943 to the end of the war in Europe. Components =Map= The playing surface consists of two mounted mapboards placed end-to-end, with major terrain features including the mountains and rivers which in reality impeded the Allied advance. The heel and toe of Italy's southern regions are not shown. =Counters= Combat units are depicted in a wide variety of colours. Luftwaffe units are shown in a separate shade of blue, German Army in grey, and Waffen SS units in black. U.S. forces (including a Brazilian division) are shown in yellow, while the cosmopolitan 8th Army includes British, Canadian, Indian (red), Polish (pink), South African and New Zealand (pale blue) units, as well as a Greek and a Jewish brigade. There are also several Free French units (dark blue). Some U.S. and Free French forces are removed from the game in the summer of 1944 to take part in the Dragoon landings in the south of France. The counters represent divisions, but the game also contains numerous extra counters for divisions to reduce in strength as they take combat losses or else break down into their component regiments. The game The time frame of the game begins with amphibious landings of the U.S. 5th Army, which may take place at Salerno as in reality, or else at any of another set of initial landing areas (the permissible size of force which may be landed varies for each area), while the British 8th Army forces enter the map from southern Italy. The German player has a chance to build fortifications, which may well cause the line to solidify for some months across the narrowest part of Italy, i.e. the Gustav Line through Monte Cassino, which the Allies may eventually break with airstrikes. The Allied player also has the chance to conduct a second invasion (the Anzio landing in reality). Critical reception The original game was criticized for poor box art and research; later versions received higher praise.\\"Squad Leader 10 Years On\\" Fire & Movement Magazine, July 1987 Issue In a review in \\"The Best of Board Wargaming\\" (1981) Tom Oleson praised the game's \\"satisfying realism\\", while criticizing some points of obscurity on the map (e.g. roads which nick the corner of a hexagon), the crudeness with which the Allied \\"thermonuclear\\" airstrikes of May 1944 are simulated and an anomaly whereby weak enemy units left near the front line can be destroyed in combat, thus generating extra exploitation movement for the victorious attacker. Variants Although the published game can only be started in September 1943, alternative scenarios for the \\"Diadem\\" offensive (which broke through the Gustav Line in May 1944) and for the autumn 1944 assault on the Gothic Line (north of Florence) were published in the Avalon Hill \\"General\\" magazine.

DeBarge was the lead singer of the Motown R&B;/soul vocal group Switch and was noted for his impressive falsetto vocals. Later on, he served as both mentor and a co-producer of his siblings' band, DeBarge, eventually joining them to fill in for departing members El and Bunny. Personal problems, including substance abuse which eventually led to drug trafficking charges in 1988, plagued DeBarge in later years, taking focus away from his musical career. He contracted HIV in the 1980s, and died of AIDS complications in 1995, at age 39. Life and career =Early life= DeBarge was born to Etterlene (née Abney) and Army soldier Robert DeBarge, Sr. in Detroit. He blamed an unhappy childhood on his father's abusiveness. At 15, DeBarge was introduced to heroin, which would become his lifelong addiction. After his parents separated and divorced in the early 1970s, Bobby DeBarge and his family relocated to Grand Rapids. A talented instrumentalist and vocalist, he began playing in local bands, along with his younger brother Tommy. =Music career= In 1975, after teaming up with fellow Grand Rapids musician Gregory Williams, the duo began a group with several other Midwestern musicians and successfully auditioned for Barry White's background group, White Heat, helping to produce and release their debut album that year. The following year, White dropped all but one musician from the band due to tax issues. The group – which consisted of DeBarge, Williams, Phillip Ingram, Tommy DeBarge, TC Brown, Stanley Brown, Jody Sims, Arnett Hayes, Adam Frye, Darnell Wyrick, MC Clark and Stanley Hood – then recorded an album in 1976 under the name Hot Ice, entitled Pall Mall Groove, which included DeBarge's incredible singing and piano performance on his composition, \\"Please Don't Let Me Go,\\" released in 1977 on Polydor/Germany, in 1979 in the USA/Canada as SMASH on Source Records/MCA, and in 2005 on Burndsman Records worldwide. That year, DeBarge returned to Grand Rapids, despondent that his career hadn't progressed; he ventured deeper into a heroin addiction. After the break up of White Heat, Gregory Williams remained in Akron, and sought out new musicians [including Tommy DeBarge, Phillip Ingram, Jody Sims, Eddie Fluellen, MC Clark and Arnett Hayes] to start a new band. After completing a demo tape, he took it to Motown Records; the label wanted to sign the group, who were now calling themselves Switch, because of their ability to \\"switch\\" instruments. At Williams' invitation, DeBarge, seeking a chance to find musical stardom, vowed to get clean from his heroin addiction. Motown soon signed the act, which now included Bobby's brother Tommy. A year after their signing, the band released their debut album in 1978. The album, which featured production from Jermaine Jackson, reached gold status thanks to \\"There'll Never Be,\\" which was solely written by DeBarge, and also featured a favorite ballad of theirs, \\"I Want to Be Closer\\", on which Phillip Ingram and DeBarge shared lead. The following year, the group hit gold again with Switch II, another Jermaine Jackson- produced album, which included another DeBarge-penned hit, \\"I Call Your Name.\\" Switch became a recording and performing attraction, not only due to the band's overall musicianship but also due to DeBarge's multi-octave vocal range. In 1980, the group had their third gold-selling album, This Is My Dream, which was the group's first album to not include input from Jackson and which the band's founding members – DeBarge, Jody Sims and Gregory Williams – co-produced. The album included the hit \\"Love Over and Over Again.\\" By then, DeBarge had returned to using heroin after several years of cleanliness and also began using cocaine, which helped to cause tension between DeBarge and Switch group members. Things came to a head in 1981 when, following the release of Switch's fifth album Switch V, Bobby DeBarge suddenly left the group after Motown offered him a solo recording deal, later finalized in 1983. By then, DeBarge was overseeing the production of his siblings' albums. Bobby co-produced their debut album, and co-wrote with younger brother El the song, \\"Queen of My Heart\\", in which he performed falsetto ad-libs near the end of the recording. The track would later re-appear on DeBarge's third album, In A Special Way, on which El himself produced, creating a more polished version. By 1987, perhaps taking their cue from Bobby splitting from his own group, El and their sister Bunny had left DeBarge to pursue solo careers, with El finding the most success. Bobby had troubles producing his solo debut, and his solo career failed to pick up, so he curtailed his aspirations and joined his siblings' group, forming a revamped DeBarge quartet that recorded the album, Bad Boys. Bobby and younger brother James split vocal leads on the project. However, Bobby's career halted in 1988 after he was convicted on drug trafficking charges in Grand Rapids and was sentenced to five years in prison. Following his release, he returned to performing and recording, all the while struggling with AIDS, which he contracted sometime in the late 1980s prior to his prison sentence. He finished his last musical work, It's Not Over, but was not alive when the album was distributed independently. Personal life For several years, he pursued La Toya Jackson of the Jackson family. He mentioned Jackson's song \\"Night Time Lover\\" in the Switch ballad \\"You & I\\", a song he wrote in response to Jackson's single. By 1984, DeBarge had split from Jackson and later married Teri, with whom he would have two children, Christian and Bobby III. DeBarge's heroin addiction started in the early 1970s and, later, DeBarge developed addictions to cocaine and crack. In 1988, he was sentenced to five years in a Wisconsin prison for drug trafficking charges. Following his release in 1993, he vowed to stay clean, signing a management agreement with Bernd Lichters (for whom DeBarge, with Hot Ice, recorded the Pall Mall Groove album years earlier, as well as signing a management agreement as partnership with Ed Wright in 1985), who guided him during 1994 to record songs he wrote in prison. The resulting album, released in August 1995 on A&E; Records just before his death, was entitled It's Not Over. Throughout that year, he was lying low in Gregory Williams' California home, before he returned to Michigan for his final days. =Illness and death= While in prison, DeBarge confided to his family that he had contracted HIV. When he became gravely ill, his family sent him to a hospice in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He died of AIDS complications there on August 16, 1995 at age 39. He is buried in Garfield Park Cemetery in Grand Rapids. Popular Culture There was a biopic about Bobby DeBarge in June 2019. It aired on cable television network TVONE.

Originally called Colored Town during the Jim Crow era of the late 19th through the mid-20th century, the area was once the preeminent and is the historic center for commerce in the black community in Miami and South Florida. It is currently bound by NW 20th Street to the north, NW 5th Street to the south, the Miami River, Dolphin Expressway (SR 836), and I-95 (north of the Midtown Interchange) to the west, and the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) and NW 1st Avenue to the east. Local residents often go by the demonym \\"Towners.\\" History Overtown Folklife Village sign on the NW 2nd Avenue A part of the historic heart of Miami, it was designated as a \\"colored\\" neighborhood after the creation and incorporation of Miami in 1896. The incorporation of Miami as a city occurred at the insistence of Standard Oil and FEC railroad tycoon Henry Flagler, whose mostly black American railroad construction workers settled near what became Downtown Miami, just north of Flagler's Royal Palm Hotel on the Miami River. Owing to a substantive black population, 168 of the 362 men who voted for the creation of the city of Miami were counted as \\"colored,\\" but the separate but equal segregation laws of the Deep South dictated the city designate the portion of the city, in this case, north and west of FEC railroad tracks, as \\"Colored Town.\\" The second-oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of the Miami area after Coconut Grove, the area thrived as a center for commerce, primarily along Northwest Second Avenue. Home to the Lyric Theatre (completed in 1913) and other businesses, West Second Avenue served as the main street of the black community during an era which, up until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, barred black residents from entering middle and upper income white areas like Miami Beach and Coral Gables without \\"passes.\\"Mjagkij 2001 During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, Overtown was home to one of the first black millionaires in the American South, D. A. Dorsey (who once owned Fisher Island), and the original Booker T. Washington High School, then the first high school educating black students south of Palm Beach. Community organizing and mobilization during the era, as such in actions of Reverend John Culmer, who advocated for better living conditions for lower class blacks living in abject squalor during the 1920s, led to the completion of Liberty Square in 1937 in what is now-called Liberty City. Northwest Second Avenue and the surrounding neighborhood, once-called the \\"Little Broadway\\" of the South, by the 1940s hosted hundreds of mostly black-owned businesses, ranging from libraries and social organizations to a hospital and popular nightclubs. Popular with blacks and whites alike, Overtown was a center for nightly entertainment in Miami, comparable to Miami Beach, at its height post-World War II in the 1940s and 1950s. The area served as a place of rest and refuge for black mainstream entertainers such as Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, and Nat King Cole who were not allowed to lodge at prominent venues where they performed like the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc, where Overtown hotels like the Mary Elizabeth Hotel furnished to their needs. Further, many prominent black luminaries like W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson lodged and entertained in the neighborhood. The area experienced serious economic decline from the late 1950s. Issues ranging from urban renewal to the construction of interstate highways like I-95 (then, the North-South Expressway), the Dolphin Expressway and the Midtown Interchange in the 1960s, fragmented the-once thriving center with the resident population decimated by nearly 80 percent from roughly 50,000 to just over 10,000. The area became economically destitute and considered a \\"ghetto\\" as businesses closed and productivity stagnated in the neighborhood. Development was spurred in the area again in the late 1980s with the construction and completion of the Miami Arena and transit-oriented development surrounding the newly opened Overtown station. Since the 1990s and 2000s, community gardens have been created, in addition to renovations to the historic Lyric Theatre and revitalization and gentrification efforts spurred both by the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County. Dr. Marvin Dunn founded the original Roots in the City Overtown Community Garden, turning an \\"overgrown, littered lot into a flourishing garden\\" maintained by Overtown residents and volunteers.Food Events: Roots in the City Farmers Market Pilots this WeekRoots In The City Overtown Community GardenRoots In The City Presents: The Overtown Community Garden Roots in the City, a non-profit \\"dedicated to community development, jobs training, inner-city beautification, healthy eating initiatives, and community research\\" used the Community Gardens provide affordable fresh produce to low-income families, public school students, community agencies and homeless shelters.Piola Takes Inner City Produce To Its Restaurants On Miami Beach, Brickell And Hallandale Beach and is also organizes an urban farmer's market.Roots in the City Urban Farmers' Market These projects and other aspects of Overtown were featured in a short documentary The Ground under Overtown centered on a multi-issue multi-racial community organizing created around Florida protests against the FTAA with focused on environmental racism, critiques of so-called \\"Free trade\\" agreements like the FTAA, and positive community solutions such as permaculture. Anti-FTAA protesters at Dr. Dunn's invitation held a workshop on permaculture at the Overtown Community Garden and donated over 100 cherry trees to the Overtown community.The Ground Under Overtown In 2015, David Beckham announced that he had secured land in the neighborhood for a future, since named Major League Soccer expansion franchise in Miami, although the team has since proposed a stadium at a different site in the city. Demographics Overtown Music and Arts Festival As of 2000, Overtown had a population of 10,029 residents, with 3,646 households, and 2,128 families residing in the city. The median household income was $13,211.99. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 74.77% Black, 19.90% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 3.27% White (non-Hispanic), and 2.05% Other races (non-Hispanic).

It is a 4-6-2 Pacific locomotive built as part of the LMS Coronation Class for its express passenger services, including the Royal Scot service from London to Glasgow. Withdrawn by British Railways in 1964, the locomotive was originally sold to Butlins holiday camp in Scotland. In 1996, the locomotive was acquired by The Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust with the intention of restoration to mainline condition. In 2001, 46233 was restored to operating condition and since then has been a regular performer on the national network.  Service  6233 was outshopped in July 1938 from Crewe Works and was part of the third batch of her class. These were unstreamlined, painted in LMS standard crimson lake livery and had a single chimney and no smoke deflectors and an estimated cost of £13,800 each. 6233 Duchess of Sutherland running in 2010 with LMS lined black livery. 6233 was initially allocated to Camden, London. It acquired a double chimney in March 1941 and because of drifting smoke acquired smoke deflectors in September 1945 before being painted in postwar LMS black livery in September 1946. With the creation of British Railways on 1 January 1948 it was allocated to Crewe North depot. BR renumbered the locomotive to 46233 in October 1948 and repainted it in BR Brunswick green livery in 1952 or early 1953. In June 1958 it was allocated to Carlisle Upperby before eventually being withdrawn from Edge Hill depot in February 1964. During its 25 years service Duchess of Sutherland ran 1,650,000 miles - the second highest mileage by any member of the class.  Preservation  Following withdrawal from service, 46233 was acquired by Butlins Heads-of-Ayr holiday camp, Scotland, in October 1964. It was later purchased by Bressingham Steam Museum. In 1996, 6233 was acquired by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust (PRCLT) arriving at the PRCLT's West Shed, at Swanwick Junction on the Midland Railway - Butterley, on 3 February 1996. In 2001, No. 6233 returned to the national network after an overhaul assisted by the heritage lottery fund and match funded by the PRCLT. To allow it to run on the main line in preservation, 6233 was fitted with Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) and on-train monitoring recorder (OTMR) equipment, alongside the BR fitted Automatic Warning System (AWS). On 6 March 2010, 6233 was rolled out in LMS lined black livery, which was retained during 2010, before a major overhaul, taking 6233 out of service for the 2011 season. On 3 March 2012, now renumbered 46233 was rolled out in \\"authentic (Brunswick) green\\" livery, as used by British Railways during the early 1950s, at the Midland Railway - Butterley following a major overhaul. On 9 September 2018, the engine regained its original number \\"6233\\" and LMS \\"Crimson Lake\\" livery to mark its 80th birthday.

Accessed 2017-09-08. is a species in the genus Quassia, with some botanists treating it as the sole species in the genus. The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus who named it after the first botanist to describe it: the Surinamese freedman Graman Quassi. Q. amara is used as insecticide, in traditional medicine and as additive in the food industry.  Name, image, harvested organ  Quassia (genus) amara (species) is an attractive small evergreen shrub or tree from the tropics and belongs to the family Simaroubaceae. Q. amara was named after called Graman Quassi, and enslaved healer and botanist who showed Europeans the plant’s fever treating uses. The name “amara” means \\"bitter\\" in Spanish and describes its very bitter taste. Q. amara contents more than thirty phytochemicals with biological activities in its tissues including the very bitter compound quassin. Therefore, it is used as insecticide, in traditional medicine against lot of disease and as bitter tasting additive in the food industry. All plant parts are useful for medicinal properties and the bark extracts are mainly used as flavoring in drinks but also for insecticides. Q. amara grows wild, but can be cultivated. Trunk wood, roots, bark, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds are harvested to gain extracts of the plant. For its beauty, quassia is also grown as ornamental plant. Quassia amara is marketed and used interchangeably with another tree species Picrasma excelsa, sharing the common name of quassia (and many of Quassia amara's constituents and uses). P. excelsa is with up to 25 m in height much taller, and occurs farther north in the tropics of Jamaica, the Caribbean, the Lesser Antilles, and northern Venezuela than Quassia amara. Also in herbal medicine in the United States and Europe very little distinction is made between these two species of trees; they are used identically and just called quassia. = Synonyms = Quassia alatifolia, Q. officinalis, Q. amargo, Simaroube officinale = Common names = Amargo, Bitter ash, Bitterholz, Bitterwood, Bois amer, Bois de quassia, Crucete, Quassia, Cuassia, Fliegenholz, Guabo, Hombre grande, Jamaica bark, Kashshing, Marauba, Marupa, Palo muneco, Pau amarelo, Quassia amarga, Quassiawood, Ruda, Simaruba, Simarubabaum, Quassiaholz, Quassia de cayenne, Quassie, Quina, Simaba, Suriname wood  Morphology, life form and growth  242x242pxFlowers (open and close) A small, multistemmed and slow growing tree with a disorderly growth twiggy limbs. It is a shrub or rarely a small tree, reaching a height up to 6 metres. The pinnate with 3-5 leaflets, deeply veined, polished alternated dark green leaves are 15–25 cm long and distinctive for their broadly winged axis and reddish veins. Leaf rachis are winged. Terminal red- branched racemes of panicles, 10–30 cm long, produces narrow, vivid crimson flowers, 2.5-3.5 cm long, that decorate the tips of each little limb. The flower comprises 5 lanceolate petals, which remain mostly closed together forming a sharpening cylinder. The flowers are produced in a panicle 15–25 cm long, each flower 2.5-3.5 cm long, bright red on the outside, and white inside. They are generally open for two days during the flowering period and each inflorescence presents on to four open flowers at once. The flowers are fragile and sometimes fall from the rachis at the slightest touch. The fruits, five small eliptic, fleshy, purple black drupes, 0.8-1.5 cm long, replace the flower and turn red as they mature. Every fruit contains one small seedling. All parts of Q. amara contain the bitter Quassimarin. The tree is predominately pollinated by hummingbirds but also self-compatible. Besides hummingbirds, other birds and Trigona species from the Apidea family do pollination. 224x224px  Origin and regions of cultivation  Quassia amara is an understorey plant in neotropic rainforests and humid sites and mostly abundant in young forests. Therefore Q. amara is native in the tropicals of Southern America. More exactly in the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago), Central America (Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama), Northern South America (French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru) and in Western South America (Colombia, Argentina). It is found in the Amazon Rainforest at altitudes ranging from sea level to 900 m. Q. amara is traditionally harvested in natural forests. There are reports of cultivation in other countries of Central and South America. It inhabits zones of high precipitation (1500–4500 mm per year), and may appear in dry lands or in riparian lands where there is a high humidity permanent. Q. amara is widely planted outside its native range.  Soil, climate and light requirements  Q. amara is suitable for medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. It prefers rich soils, that are water retentive. The tree can adapt to different pH-values in soils. It is a frost sensitive plant. Its salt toleration and dry toleration is low. It is classified as a semi-sciophyte with high tolerance to shade conditions but with a requirement of direct exposure to sunlight in order to complete its life cycle, in particular due to its effect on ﬂower and fruit production. An increase in the light conditions increases ﬂower and fruit production although it does not inﬂuence seed fertility. Therefore, its natural regeneration appears to be limited by light and interspeciﬁc competition with upperstorey forest species. Chemical composition 170x170px In the wood a share of 0.09 to 0.17% of quassin and 0.05 to 0.11% of neoquassin was detected in Costa Rician plants. Quassin is one of the most bitter substances found in nature. Other identified components of bitterwood are: beta-carbolines, beta- sitostenone, beta-sitosterol, dehydroquassins, gallic acid, gentisic acid, hydroxyquassins, isoparain, isoparaines, isoquassins, malic acid, methylcanthins, methoxycanthins, methoxycantins, nigakilactone A, nor- neoquassin, parain, paraines, quassialactol, quassimarin, quassinol, quassol and simalikalactone D. Uses = Additive in food industry = The bitter principle found in the bark and wood is used as the basis of Angostura Bitters, which is used as a flavouring in longdrinks, soft drinks, digestive tonics and also in gin-based drinks. It can be used as a substitute for hops in beer manufacturing or can be added to baked goods. =Medicine= Traditionally, Q. amara is used as a digestive, to treat fever, and against hair parasites (lice, fleas) and mosquito larvae in ponds (which has not proven harmful to fish populations). The component Simalikalactone D was identified as an antimalarial. The preparation of a tea out of young leaves is used traditionally in French Guiana. Experiments showed a high inhibition of Plasmodium yoelii yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum. A 2012 study found a topical gel with 4% Quassia extract to be a safe and effective cure of rosacea. Quassia amara is part of the family of the Simaroubaceae, which contains quassinoids. Those are secondary metabolites that have a large range of biological activities. The plant is known for the active principles that can be found in its bark. They have several different effects like increasing appetite, tonic, diuretic, febrifugal, anthelmintic and anti-leukemic. It also leads to more activity from the gall bladder and has an effect against liver congestion. At external use, they act efficacy against parasites like pinworms. It is also a tribal remedy used in South America against debility, liver problems, malaria, snakebite, and back spasms. The Quassia amara is sold in the form of ground-up chips that are used to produce tonic or tinctures. Those are made by soaking the bark in the water for a long time. There are two varieties of Q. amara that can be used in medicine. It is the West Indian type and the South American variety. The West Indian is high, it can reach 30.5m, the South American is much smaller, with a heigh from 5.5m.  Diabetes  In 2011 Husein and Gulam Mohammed, found that Q. amara extract reduced the elevated fasting blood glucose in rats. It also shows that glucose tolerance is increased by the consumption of Q. amara. According to Ferreira and al. 2013, the wood powder of Q. amara shows an anti-hyperglycemic effect, similar to the one from metformin. It could be helpful as an alternative therapy to the existing drugs that cause adverse health effects.  Malaria  Tea made with the leaves of the Q. amara, is used against malaria in the traditional medicine of French Guiana. The leaves hexane from Q. amara was found to have high suppressive activity, at a concentration from 100 mg/kg body weight in mouse. In 2006, a study found that Simalikalactone D should be responsible for the antimalarial activity. In 2009, a new quassinoid was discovered, the simalikalactone E. This molecule inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in vitro by 50%. The effect was mostly found in the gametocyte, which is the stage that is fundamental for the transmission to mosquitoes. The tea from Quassia amara has also an effect on the red blood cells counts, the packed cell count, the packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration. It has an antianemic property.  Ulcers  Quassia amara is used in folk medicine from Costa Rica. Searchers from the University of Ibadan found a significant inhibition of the gastric ulceration induced by indomethacin. The amount of protection was between 77% and 85%. It also reduces the total gastric acidity. It was related to an increase in gastric barrier mucus and non-protein sulfhydryl groups.  Anti-leukemic  The sap of Q. amara shows in vivo significant activity against lymphocytic leukemia in mice.  Scalp problems  The bitter substances from the Q. amara attack the chitin from the lice larvae and prevent the pupping of new larvae. It also reduce dandruff when used as a hair rinse  Sedative properties  The Quassia amara bark extract has been shown to have a sedative and muscle relaxant effects.  Parallel medicines  Quassia amara is also used it this traditional Indian medicine, the Ayurvedic medicine to treat rheumatism, alcoholism, dandruff, stomach problems, and worms. It is also used in the homeopatic medicine.  Contraindication  Excessive use of this plant can cause vomiting. It is also to avoid to use in the long term, because it can lead to a weakness of the vision, going to total blindness. It should also be avoided during pregnancy and menstruation, because it may cause uterine colic. It has also shown to have negative effects on the fertility of rats, both male and females. It has been proven to reduce the weight of testis, epididymis and seminal vesicle by the rats. They also found a reduction of the epididymal sperm count, the level of testosterone, LH and FSH. These changes disappeared after some time. By the female rats, a decrease of the weight from the ovary and uterus was seen. There was also a decrease in the estrogen level. The litter number and weight were also reduced. =Insecticide= Insecticidal extracts of the bark were first used in the USA 1850 and 1880 in Europe. Extracts of Quassia wood or bark act as a natural insecticide. For organic farming this is of particular interest. A good protection was shown against different insect pests (e.g. aphids, Colorado potato beetle, Anthonomus pomorum, Rhagoletis cerasi, Caterpillars of Tortricidae). Quassin extract works as a contact insecticide. Adverse effects on beneficial organisms were not found. Quassia amara extract can be obtained by boiling Q.amara chips in water and removing the wood chips afterwards. The extract contains quassin and neoquassin, which have insecticidal properties. The extract can be used to spray fruitlets, shortly after cease blooming. Insecticidal effects are comparable to the insecticide diazinon. If the extract is sprayed before apple sawfly larvae hatched, Hoplocampa infestation can be reduced with an efficacy of 50%. Q.amara extract in the dosage corresponding to 3-4.5 kg of Q. amara wood chips for 1/ha is optimal. The bitter wood can be dried after boiling and be reused 2 to 3 times.KREUTER, M.-L.

For Switzerland, a licensed formulation is available for organic farming. Potential effects on human health Like any poorly studied alternative chemical applied to food crops, Quassia extract may have unknown health consequences. A study on rats in 1997 found that Quassia extract significantly reduced their fertility, reducing testes size, sperm quality and serum testosterone. Formulation Around of Quassia wood chips are put together with of water. It is allowed to stand for 24 hours and then it is cooked for 30 min. It is then diluted with of water and used as a spray The use of approximately wood extract per hectare seems to be optimal to minimize the damage of Hoplocampa testudinea on apple trees. Cultivation Seeds and cuttings can be used for propagation of Q. amara. Frost is not tolerated, but the plant is partially drought tolerant. A large amount of indirect light is recommended. As a tropical tree, Q. amara prefers a fertile, moist but well- drained soil in a partially shaded position. Although younger trees may tolerate greater or more direct light intensities, it is recommended for the agroecological cultivation of the plant’s wood, to plant Q. amara in settings that offer large amounts of indirect light. = Cultivation management = The older the plant, the greater the accumulation of quassinoids in the xylem. Cultivation conditions, in the shade or in the sun, inﬂuences notably the amount of quassine accumulated by the plants. This factor will have to be taken into account to achieve a good harvest. Controlled luminosity conditions favor plant growth and the concentration of quassinoids in the tissues, which increases the quality of the raw material. Organic fertilizer such as deep or organic mulch can be used as nutritional compounds. = Reproduction = In Costa Rica the flowering period of Q.amara arises between October and April, whereas in central Panama the flowering period occurs from October to January. The fruits ripen after two months. In February and early March, there is a peak of fruit ripening. The drupes show different colors during the ripening process. They turn from reddish to green until the reach a black color. The best germination results were obtained with seeds from drupes that are just before becoming totally black. Not only the color but also the size of the fruits are indicators for the viability of a seed. Fruits with a size between 1 and 1.5 cm are suitable for reproduction and they can be easily detached from the receptacle. The treelet can be propagated sexual by seeds or asexual by vegetative cuttings of half-ripe wood. The trees can be cultivated in tree nurseries. Therefore seeds can be sowed of substrat such as sawdust, sand or soil. The seedlings are grown up for eight months until they reach a height around 40 cm. The germination occurs within 10 weeks. During the germination period daily watering is important. A distance of 10 x 15 cm at a density of 35 plants per m is recommended in tree nurseries. = Pests and diseases = Cutting insects were found in seedlings, but no critical damage was observed. The fungus Colletotrichum sp. caused anthracnosis in young plants, what leads to brown leaf changes surrounded by a yellowish halo, defoliation and suspension of plant growth. High soil moisture, inadequate soil drainage, high sowing density and bad weed control management are factors that enhances this fungal disease. It can be controlled with specific funigcides. Bacteria infection is scarce, but has to be taken into account during the transplantation.

The west of the kingdom went to Ceolwulf II, whilst in the east the Five Boroughs began as the fortified burhs of five Danish armies who settled the area and introduced Danelaw, their native law and customs. Each of the Five Boroughs was ruled as a Danish Jarldom, controlling lands around a fortified burh, which served as the centre of political power. These rulers were probably initially subject to their overlords in the Viking Kingdom of Jorvik (or York)Walker, Ian W (2000). Mercia and the Making of England Sutton and operated their armies sometimes independently but often in alliance with rulers of their neighbours. In addition to the Five Boroughs there were also a number of very large Danish settlements to the south, including Northampton and Bedford which existed in a similar fashion.

Although the area was settled by Danes from 877, it was not under English threat until 913 when Lady Aethelflaed of Mercia campaigned deep into Danish territory and established a burh at nearby Tamworth. In 917 Aethelflaed launched her first offensive foray and selected the fortress at Derby as her target. At that time the local ruler had probably joined with the armies from Northampton and Leicester in a number of raids to attack Mercia. Aethelflaed took advantage of the weakened burh, and successfully assaulted the town in July 917; the whole region subsequently being annexed into English Mercia. The Danes might well have established their military headquarters on the former Roman fort of Derventio.Fellows-Jensen, Gillian (1994) The Vikings and their Victims: The Verdict of the Names\\" Viking Society p19 This British History Online: Antiquities, Derbyshire.

The Vikings had camped at nearby Repton in 874, and had abandoned it a year later after suffering significantly from disease during their stay (leading to the discovery of a grave containing 245 bodies). =Leicester= One of the more formidable Danish burhs, the local ruler combined his army with that of Northampton and raided the West Saxon territories of Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire in 913, and defied King Edward the Elder to besiege the West Saxon burh of Hertford. This provoked Aethelflaed to move her armies up to the fringes of Danish occupied territory around Leicester in 914 and to construct a burh at Warwick. In July 917, as part of a three-pronged assault, the combined forces of Leicester and Northampton, and possibly Derby, laid siege to the Mercian burh at Towcester. Isolated by the loss of Derby and Northampton later that year, the Mercian army returned in early 918 to ravage the local countryside, and as a result the fortress surrendered peacefully to Aethelflaed's troops. Relieved of English rule by King Olaf of York in 941, King Edmund I besieged the Viking army at Leicester the same year. Olaf and his advisor Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York, both escaped and the siege was lifted after a peace negotiation ceded the Five Boroughs to the Kingdom of York. Jarl Orm, the likely ruler of Leicester at the time (and who attested charters between 930 and 958 Retrieved on 15 January 2008.) married his daughter to King Olaf later that year to cement the alliance.

(c. 1900 hides). =Lincoln= The burh at Lincoln guarded the route between Wessex and York, and was protected from much of the Anglo-Danish fighting due to its isolated location. The Lincoln Danes settled the area formerly occupied by the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Lindsey, where the Vikings had previously overwintered in the nearby fortress of Torksey in Lindsey from 873 to 874. Lincoln probably surrendered in 918 following the capitulation of all the Danish territories on the border of Mercia and Wessex. As a former Roman legionary town, the burh probably based its walls on the old fortress of 41 acresRoman-Britain.org: Lindum. Retrieved on 15 January 2008.

Burgred and his West Saxon allies laid siege, but made peace and allowed the Vikings to retreat after little serious fighting in 869. Danish reoccupation and settlement began in 877, and lasted until the assault by Edward of Wessex in the summer of 918. Edward constructed a second burh on the opposite side of the Trent in 920 to further fortify the area from Danish attack. Saxon Nottingham was known to have covered about 39 acres,Nottingham Churches: City History. Retrieved on 15 January 2008. which may have put the burh at c. 1300 hides. =Stamford= The area around Stamford was invaded by West Saxon Ealdorman Aethelnoth in the summer of 894, but the town was not besieged and Danish rule was unaffected. The end came when King Edward assaulted Stamford in late May 918 which soon fell to the army of Wessex. Later that year Edward built a second burh on the south side of the River Welland. From Roffe, the ramparts of the northern burh might have been of approx 3100 ft (c. 750 hides), and the Edwardian burh of around 2700 ft (c. 650 hides).Roffe: Stamford Origins. Retrieved on 15 January 2008. The Danish burhs to the south The following burhs were not part of the Five Boroughs, but were Danish settled towns with large armies and ruled in a similar manner. These Danes often acted in alliance with those of the Five Boroughs and the Danish King of East Anglia. =Northampton= First recorded invading newly ceded Mercian territories with their allies in 913, the Northampton Danes were initially very successful. However, on their return they were defeated by local Mercian forces near Luton, losing many horses and weapons. In December 914, their strength was further depleted when a number of Northampton Danes submitted to Edward at Bedford. With the loss of Derby and East Anglia and the advance of King Edward, their ruler, Jarl Thurferth, and the men of Northampton and Cambridge submitted to the West Saxons in 917. Thurferth remained the client ruler, and attested four charters of King Æthelstan dated between 930 and 934. Northampton was later incorporated in the enlarged Earldom of East Anglia under Æthelstan Half-King in the 930s. In 941, then in the hands of the Mercians, Northampton faced an unsuccessful siege by King Olaf of York. The 'army' of Northampton was still in existence in 984 when they were recorded witnessing the sale of land. The size of the Anglo- Danish burh at Northampton has been estimated to have ramparts in lengthBlanchard, Ian (2007). The Twelfth-Century: A Neglected Epoch in British Economic and Social History, Chapter 8 Burhs and Borough Newlees p165 (equivalent to c. 700 hides), making it one of the smaller Danish burhs. =Bedford= The Danish burh was first under threat from the advance of the West Saxon army in 914. In November that year Bedford was surrounded in a pincer movement by Edward, and the ruling Jarl Thurketel submitted with all of his followers. Edward returned in November 915 to the Danish-held fortress, this time taking direct control of it and building a second burh on the south bank of the River Ouse. Thurketel then became Edward's client, until he permitted the Danish ruler to leave with his followers for France in the summer of 916. In July 917 the Danish East Anglian army advanced to Tempsford and launched an attack to recover Bedford. The Danish army was defeated and put to flight. It was later incorporated into the enlarged Earldom of East Anglia in the early 10th century. =Huntingdon= The Danes of Huntingdon were allies with the East Anglian Danes when they advanced to Tempsford and built a new fortress in July 917. From here, the joint army attempted to recover the recently fallen burh at Bedford, but were severely defeated and put to flight by the English garrison. The burh was occupied by the Edward's West Saxon army shortly afterwards. =Cambridge= Cambridge was first occupied by the Danes under kings Guthrum, Osketel and Anwend in 875, whose armies took up quarters there over the winter. In 911 it was first threatened by Edward, who built an opposing burh at Hertford. With the fall of Huntingdon, it left Cambridge the last independent host on which Danish East Anglia could rely, however the tide had turned and the Danes of Cambridge submitted to Edward in late 917. Anglo-Saxon and Danish reconquest Danish rule of the Five Boroughs was lost following the English reconquests under Aethelflaed of Mercia and Edward the Elder of Wessex during 916 and 917. The area was subsequently ruled by the Earls of Mercia until King Olaf of York reoccupied the five former Danish burhs following a major offensive in 941, perhaps assisted by local Danish leaders. Danish rule was not restored for long before King Edmund recovered the Five Boroughs in 942. It is at this time the Five Boroughs are first recorded in an English poem known as the Capture of the Five Boroughs.Stenton, F. M. (1971). Anglo-Saxon England Third Edition Oxford: Oxford University Press For many years afterwards the Five Boroughs were a separate and well defined area of the country where rulers sought support from its leaders, including Swein Forkbeard who gained the submission of the Five Boroughs in 1013, before going on to attack London. In 1015 there is a unique reference to the 'Seven Boroughs', which might have been included Torksey and York. Earldom of the Five Boroughs Following Danish conquest in 1016, Earl Sired succeeded to the newly created Earldom of the Five Boroughs under King Canute in 1019.Falkus, Malcolm & Gillingham, John (1989).

It is different from tree nut allergies, with peanuts being legumes and not true nuts. Physical symptoms of allergic reaction can include itchiness, hives, swelling, eczema, sneezing, asthma attack, abdominal pain, drop in blood pressure, diarrhea, and cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis may occur. Those with a history of asthma are more likely to be severely affected. It is due to a type I hypersensitivity reaction of the immune system in susceptible individuals. The allergy is recognized \\"as one of the most severe food allergies due to its prevalence, persistency, and potential severity of allergic reaction.\\" Prevention may be partly achieved through early introduction of peanuts to the diets of pregnant women and babies. It is recommended that babies at high risk be given peanut products in areas where medical care is available as early as 4 months of age. The principal treatment for anaphylaxis is the injection of epinephrine. In the United States, peanut allergy is present in 0.6% of the population. Among children in the Western world, rates are between 1.5% and 3% and have increased over time. It is a common cause of food-related fatal and near-fatal allergic reactions. Signs and symptoms Most symptoms of peanut allergy are related to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and other anaphylatoxins which act to release histamine and other mediator substances from mast cells (degranulation). In addition to other effects, histamine induces vasodilation of arterioles and constriction of bronchioles in the lungs, also known as bronchospasm. Symptoms can also include mild itchiness, hives, angioedema, facial swelling, rhinitis, vomiting, diarrhea, acute abdominal pain, exacerbation of atopic eczema, asthma, and cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis may occur. =Tree nuts and soy= People with confirmed peanut allergy may have cross-reactivity to tree nut, soy, and other legumes, such as peas and lentils and lupinus. The cause of cross-reactivity results from similarity in the structures of storage proteins between the food sources. Allergenic proteins are grouped by protein families: cupins, prolamins, profilin and others. Peanuts and soybeans have proteins in the cupin, prolamin, and profilin families, while lentils contain cupin proteins. Reviews of human clinical trials report that 6–40% of people with a confirmed peanut allergy will have allergic symptoms when challenged with tree nuts or legumes. Cause The cause of peanut allergy is unclear and at least 11 peanut allergens have been described. The condition is associated with several specific proteins categorized according to four common food allergy superfamilies: Cupin (Ara h 1), Prolamin (Ara h 2, 6, 7, 9), Profilin (Ara h 5), and Bet v-1-related proteins (Ara h 8). Among these peanut allergens, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are considered to be major allergens which means that they trigger an immunological response in more than 50% of the allergic population. These peanut allergens mediate an immune response via release of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody as part of the allergic reaction. Some of the peanut allergens can undergo enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications which makes them more likely to bind to ligands on antigen-presenting cells. Ara h 1 can undergo glycosylation modifications which have been shown to induce immunomodulatory responses; it stimulates lectin receptors MR and DC-SIGN on dendritic cells which further propagate cytokines and bias the immune system towards a Th2 type response. Peanut proteins that undergo non-enzymatic changes through Maillard reactions when cooked or exposed to room temperature have an increase in AGE modifications on their structure. These changes have been shown to stimulate RAGE receptors and SR-AI/II on dendritic cells and thus lead to an increase in IL-4 and IL-5-releasing Th2 cells. Peanut allergies are uncommon in children of undeveloped countries where peanut products have been used to relieve malnutrition. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the relatively low incidence of childhood peanut allergies in undeveloped countries is a result of exposure to diverse food sources early in life, increasing immune capability, whereas food selection by children in developed countries is more limited, reducing immune capability. A possibility of cross-reaction to soy was dismissed by an analysis finding no linkage to consumption of soy protein, and indicated that appearance of any linkage is likely due to preference to using soy milk among families with known milk allergies. =Timing of exposure= In infants with a family history of peanut allergy, consuming peanut proteins at 4 to 11 months old has been shown to reduce the risk of developing an allergic response by 11-25% From these results, the American Academy of Pediatrics rescinded their recommendation to delay exposure to peanuts in children, also stating there is no reason to avoid peanuts during pregnancy or breastfeeding. =Diet during pregnancy= There is conflicting evidence on whether maternal diet during pregnancy has any effect on development of allergies due to a lack of good studies. A 2010 systematic review of clinical research indicated that there is insufficient evidence for whether maternal peanut exposure, or early consumption of peanuts by children, affects sensitivity for peanut allergy. =Routes of exposure= Peanuts While the most obvious route for an allergic exposure is unintentional ingestion, some reactions are possible through external exposure. Peanut allergies are much more common in infants who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants. Sensitive children may react via ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact to peanut allergens which have persistence in the environment, possibly lasting over months. Airborne particles in a farm- or factory-scale shelling or crushing environment, or from cooking, can produce respiratory effects in exposed allergic individuals. Empirical testing has discredited some reports of this type and shown some to be exaggerated. Residue on surfaces has been known to cause minor skin rashes, though not anaphylaxis. In The Peanut Allergy Answer Book, Harvard pediatrician Michael Young characterized this secondary contact risk to allergic individuals as rare and limited to minor symptoms. Some reactions have been noted to be psychosomatic in nature, the result of conditioning, and belief rather than a true chemical reaction. Blinded, placebo-controlled studies were unable to produce any reactions using the odor of peanut butter or its mere proximity. Pathophysiology The allergy arises due to dendritic cells recognizing peanut allergens as foreign pathogens. They present the antigens on MHC class II receptors and these antigens are recognized by cell receptors on T cells. The contact along with the release of the cytokine IL-4 induces their differentiation into CD4+ Th2 cells. The Th2 cells proliferate and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which can be bound to receptors on undifferentiated B cells or B cells of the IgM subtype. The receptor-cytokine binding causes their differentiation into IgE which can then be bound onto FcεRI on mast cells, eosinophils and basophils. This elicits degranulation of the aforementioned cells which release potent cytokines and chemokines, thus triggering inflammation and causing the symptoms characteristic of allergy. Diagnosis Diagnosis of food allergies, including peanut allergy, begins with a medical history and physical examination. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guidelines recommend that parent and patient reports of food allergy be confirmed by a doctor because \\"multiple studies demonstrate 50% to 90% of presumed food allergies are not allergies.\\" =Skin prick testing= Skin prick tests can be used to confirm specific food allergies. Skin prick tests are designed to identify specific IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells. During the test, a glycerinated allergen extract drop is placed on the patient's skin. The patient's skin is then pricked through the drop. This procedure is repeated with two controls: a histamine drop designed to elicit an allergic response, and a saline drop designed to elicit no allergic response. The wheal that develops from the glycerinated extract drop is compared against the saline control. A positive allergic test is one in which the extract wheal is 3mm larger than the saline wheal. A positive skin prick test is about 50% accurate, so a positive skin prick test alone is not diagnostic of food allergies. =Oral food challenge= The \\"gold standard\\" of diagnostic tests is a double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge. At least two weeks prior to an oral food challenge, the person is placed on an elimination diet where the suspected allergen is avoided. During the oral food challenge, they are administered a full age-appropriate serving of a suspected allergen in escalating size increments. They are continuously monitored for allergic reaction during the test, and the challenge is stopped and treatment administered at the first objective sign of allergic reaction. Oral food challenges pose risks. In a study of 584 oral food challenges administered to 382 patients, 48% (253) of challenges resulted in allergic reactions. 28% (72) of these challenges resulted in \\"severe\\" reactions, which were defined by the study as a patient having: lower respiratory symptoms; cardiovascular symptoms; or any four other, more minor, symptoms. Double-blind placebo- controlled oral food challenges are also time-consuming and require close medical supervision. Because of these drawbacks to the double-blind placebo- controlled oral food challenge, open food challenges are the most commonly used form of food challenge. Open food challenges are those in which a patient is fed an age-appropriate serving of a suspected food allergen in its natural form. The observation of objective symptoms resulting from ingestion of the food, such as vomiting or wheezing, is considered diagnostic of food allergy if the symptoms correlate with findings from the patient's medical history and laboratory testing such as the skin prick test. Prevention In 2017, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) published revised guidelines for lowering the risk or preventing peanut allergies by creating separate ways to assess childhood allergies and guide parents with infants at high, moderate or low risk. The guidelines discussed how to introduce peanut foods to infants as early as 4 to 6 months of age, with the goal of preventing peanut allergy. For high-risk children, the guide recommended that an allergy specialist assess a child's susceptibility, possibly involving peanut allergy testing, followed by gradual introduction of peanut foods under the supervision of an allergy specialist. Peanut allergy is confirmed only if there is a history of reactions to peanut consumption and by a positive allergy test. Moderate-risk children – who display an allergic reaction to peanut products with mild to moderate eczema – are typically not assessed in a clinic, but rather have peanut foods gradually provided to them at home by their parents, beginning at around age 6 months. The Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study supported by NIAID established that early introduction of peanut products into a child's diet can prevent – rather than only delay – the development of childhood peanut allergies, and that the effect is beneficial and lifelong. Treatment As of 2020, there is no cure for peanut allergy other than strict avoidance of peanuts and peanut- containing foods. Extra care is needed for food consumed at or purchased from restaurants. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling). =Immunotherapy= Immunotherapy involves attempts to reduce allergic sensitivity by repeated exposure to small amounts of peanut products. Evidence as of 2019, however, has found that it increases rather than decreases the risk of serious allergies. None of these are considered ready for use in people outside of carefully conducted trials. A 2012 Cochrane Review concluded that more research was needed. Sublingual immunotherapy involves putting gradually increasing doses of an allergy extract under a person's tongue. The extract is then either spat or swallowed. As of 2014, the evidence did not show that this was safe or effective. Epicutaneous immunotherapy involves giving the allergen through a patch and has also been researched. In September 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation, and in June 2015, granted breakthrough therapy designation to AR101 for peanut allergy in ages 4–17. AR101 was studied in the PALISADE international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study. In September 2019, the Allergenic Products Advisory Committee (APAC) of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) voted to support the use of peanut allergen powder (Palforzia) for peanut allergy. The price has not been set as of September 2019, but is proposed to be between and per year. In January 2020, peanut allergen powder was approved in the United States to mitigate allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanuts. Treatment with peanut allergen powder may be initiated in individuals ages four through 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy and may be continued in individuals four years of age and older. Those who take peanut allergen powder must continue to avoid peanuts in their diets.  Prognosis  Peanut allergies tend to resolve in childhood less often than allergies to soy, milk, egg, and wheat. Accordingly, re-evaluation of peanut allergy is recommended on a yearly basis for young children with favorable previous test results, and every few years or longer for older children and adults. A 2001 study showed that peanut allergy is outgrown in 22% of cases for people aged 4 to 20 years. Epidemiology The percentage of people with peanut allergies is 0.6% in the United States. In a 2008 study, self-reported incidence of peanut allergy was estimated to affect 1.4% of children the United States, triple the 0.4% rate found in a 1997 study. In England, an estimated 4,000 people are newly diagnosed with peanut allergy every year, 25,700 having been diagnosed with peanut allergy at some point in their lives. Peanut allergy is one of the most dangerous food allergies, and one of the least likely to be outgrown. In Western countries, the incidence of peanut allergy is between 1-3%. There has been a sudden increase in number of cases in the early 21st century. It is one of the most common causes of food-related deaths. A meta-analysis found that death due to overall food-induced anaphylaxis was 1.8 per million person-years in people having food allergies, with peanut as the most common allergen. However, there are opinions that the measures taken in response to the threat may be an over-reaction out of proportion to the level of danger. Media sensationalism has been blamed for anxiety outweighing reality. Frequency among adults and children is similar—around 1%—but one study showed self- reports of peanut allergy are on the rise in children in the United States. The number of young children self-reporting the allergy doubled between 1997 and 2002. Studies have found that self-reported rates of food allergies is higher than clinically-observed rates of food allergies. The rates in self- reported incidence of the allergy, previously thought to be rare, may not be correlated with medical data confirming the self-reported incidence. Society and culture The high severity of peanut allergy reactions, as well as the increasing prevalence of peanut allergy in the Western world have led to widespread public attention. However, the perceived prevalence of food allergies in the public view is substantially higher than the actual prevalence of food allergies. Because peanut allergy awareness has increased, there are impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their immediate caregivers. In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.Culinary Institute of America Allergen-free oasis comes to the CIA (2017) School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can still easily occur at other people's houses, at school or in restaurants. Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life. Finally, for children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by actions of their peers. There is an increased occurrence of bullying, which can include threats or acts of deliberately being touched with foods they need to avoid, also having their allergen-free food deliberately contaminated. =Labeling= An example of a list of allergens in a food item In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods. Nevertheless, there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.\\"Food allergen labelling and information requirements under the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation No. 1169/2011: Technical Guidance\\" (April 2015). Ingredients intentionally added In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. This list originated in 1999, from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. To meet FALCPA labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \\"food sourced name\\" in parentheses, for example \\"Casein (milk),\\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \\"Contains milk\\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites. FALCPA applies to packaged foods regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \\"Contains: milk\\", are mandatory according to FSIS. FALCPA also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants. The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 – requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars. In the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products. FALCPA does not apply to medicines nor to cosmetics. Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross- contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.). Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated. Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as \\"may contain\\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production. PAL labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning. PAL is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of PAL, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice. In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that PAL be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified \\"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\\" as ED01. This threshold reference dose for foods (such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) will provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of might be accidentally in a food product beyond \\"may contain.\\" VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.The VITAL Program Allergen Bureau, Australia and New Zealand. The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024. In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistaches, pine nuts, and chestnuts.

He was the original drummer of rock band Dire Straits and played on their first four albums, which included hit singles such as \\"Sultans of Swing\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Private Investigations\\". Withers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.  Biography  Taught by childhood friend Richard Storer, Withers first played a drum in the Boys' Brigade in his home city of Leicester. He became a professional musician at the age of 17, in a band called the Primitives. This was followed by a band called Spring who had a record contract but little success; they released one album on the RCA label. In the mid-1970s Withers was a house drummer at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth, Wales. He played on records by Dave Edmunds, Hobo, the John Dummer Band and the Gary Fletcher Band, amongst others. His nickname has been subject to some variations in spelling. During his time with Spring, he was billed as Pique Withers. He is billed as Pic Withers on his appearance on the second Brewers Droop album. Withers has also studied at Drumtech drum school in London.  Dire Straits  Mark Knopfler met Withers in 1973 in London when he joined blues band Brewers Droop, with whom Withers was already playing; his style, like Knopfler's on guitar, was blues-based. The drummer worked regularly with Knopfler during the mid-1970s, although Withers maintained his Rockfield affiliations and was briefly a member of folk-rock outfit Magna Carta in 1977. Once Dire Straits gained a recording contract, he turned to drumming for that band full-time. His style with Dire Straits is distinctive for being restrained, favouring sparse snare drum and hi-hat combinations rather than heavy beats, speed and pyrotechnic flourishes. He played on the Dire Straits albums Dire Straits (1978), Communiqué (1979), Making Movies (1980) and Love Over Gold (1982). Withers left the band in the summer of 1982, soon after completing the Love Over Gold sessions, to spend more time with his family and to pursue jazz music. He reportedly told an interviewer that he had succumbed to a growing feeling that there was nothing left in the music for him and that he was in danger of \\"becoming a rock drummer\\". His replacement in Dire Straits was Terry Williams, also a Dave Edmunds sideman.

It was operational between 1911 and 1990 during which time it produced about 50,000 tons of black tin. It is now a museum and heritage centre left as a living history of a working tin mine. The museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. Since 2006, the mine has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape.  History  Tin and copper have been mined from the general area of Geevor since the late 18th century. It was originally a small enterprise known as Wheal an Giver, \\"a piece of ground occupied by goats\\". The area was worked under the name of East Levant Mine until 1840 and then as North Levant from 1851 to 1891 when it closed.Stanier, 1998 p.53 During the 1880s as many as 176 workers were employed at the mine, but in the ten years after North Levant's closure the site saw only intermittent activity by a few miners. At the turn of the 20th century a group of St. Just miners who had emigrated to South Africa were forced to return by the outbreak of the Second Boer War. They leased the area and conducted more thorough prospecting, being encouraged enough to set up a company called Levant North (Wheal Geevor) in 1901. This was acquired by the West Australian Gold Field Company Ltd. in 1904 which brought together various mines under the name of Geevor Tin Mines Ltd. in 1911, not long after the price of tin had rapidly risen to £181 a ton in 1906 from a low of £64 in 1896.Buckley, 2002 p.41 The Wethered shaft (named after Oliver Wethered, one of the founders of the mine) was begun in 1909 and initial development occurred around it. By 1919, the works were moving west toward the coastline and the Victory shaft (named to celebrate the end of the First World War)Stanier, 1998 p.54 was sunk about 540 metres to the north- west. The mine suspended operations in 1921Stanier, 1998 p.54 and again for 12 months during the tin crisis in 1930 that permanently closed many other Cornish mines.Buckley, 2002 p.44 In 1944 working through Wethered shaft was discontinued, but the Victory shaft continued in use. Geevor seen from the air From the end of World War II until the early 1960s both Geevor and South Crofty found it hard to raise capital and to recruit skilled miners. Both mines took on Polish and Italian miners at this time. New investment, forward- looking management and rising tin prices in the 1960s improved mattersBuckley, 2002 p.45 and at this time around 270 staff were employed by the mine. During the 1960s there was much underground exploration; this included extending into the undersea workings of the Levant mine that had closed in 1930, work that was complicated by a hole in the seabed that first had to be plugged before the workings could be drained.\\"Levant Mine - sealing the breach 1\\" (and subsequent pages). St. Just Mines Research Group. Retrieved on 2009-03-04. By the 1970s Geevor's sett covered an area of about three square miles and included Boscaswell Downs mine, Pendeen Consols and Levant mine. In 1985 the International Tin Council failed and there was a dramatic fall in the price of the metal. The mine struggled on for a few years, but closed in 1990,Buckley et al., 1996 p.3 and the pumps were switched off in May 1991 allowing the workings to flood. The mine is not geologically exhausted of tin, but it is exhausted of tin that is recoverable economically. During the 20th century Geevor drove over of tunnels from which it produced around 50,000 tons of black tin and made a profit of over £7 million. On average over a million gallons of water, a quarter of which was sea-water, was pumped from the mine daily.Buckley et al., 1996 p.6 Geology The mine's lodes were located in an outer zone of coarse-grained biotite granite of Carboniferous age, intruded into surrounding Devonian age \\"killas\\" - a series of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks, visible to the north west of the mine around the cliffs. As the influence of the granitic emplacement increases toward the contact zone, the killas becomes spotted with cordierite, then mica-rich phyllites and finally at the contact, banded hornfels and tourmaline schist. The tin appears as cassiterite (with around 65-70% tin), within veins associated with quartz, tourmaline, metal sulphides and fluorite. The veins are predominantly in a north west - south east orientation and the cassiterite itself forms around 1% of the vein material. Tourist attraction A 19th century waterwheel and set of Cornish stamps at the museum Through the commitment of the local community and local bodies, notably Cornwall County Council and Pendeen Community Heritage, the site has remained accessible to the public. Geevor Tin Mine is now a museum and heritage centre, covering an area of which makes it the largest preserved tin mining site in Great Britain. It is an important part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape and was recognised by UNESCO in 2006. It has been the subject of a £3.8 million improvement programme funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Objective One, Cornwall County Council and Penwith District Council. Part of the interior of the ore processing mill, open to visitors Geevor's new Hard Rock museum is part of the final stage of this improvement programme. The museum tells the story of tin mining in Cornwall and Geevor in particular, showing what happened on the surface and underground and what life was like for those who worked there, including oral history recordings. Visitors can also walk through the mine buildings to see the original machinery and there is a guided underground tour into Wheal Mexico, an 18th-century mine. The site has a souvenir shop and a cafe that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. There are interactive activities e.g. panning for gold and gemstones.

Millennium People is a novel by British writer J. G. Ballard, published in 2003. The novel is the story of a rebellion in the middle classes in an enclave of Greater London. Plot summary When a bomb explodes on a baggage carousel at Heathrow Airport, killing his ex-wife, psychologist David Markham tries to unravel the mystery surrounding her seemingly pointless death. But with unresolved questions about himself, his job, and his loving but adulterous wife, Sally, he soon finds himself immersed in the deeper waters of middle-class revolution originating from the gated community of Chelsea Marina, an upper middle-class enclave of salaried professionals. When a protest at a cat show turns ugly and he is beaten up by angry cat lovers, then arrested and tried, Markham enlists in the cause of the rebellious Chelseans – imagining he will uncover the persons and causes responsible for his ex-wife's murder. Slowly, he succumbs to the call of subversion and gradually finds himself a terrorist functionary, planting smoke bombs, participating in firebombing and clashing with police at protests. Other characters include Markham's wife, who continues to use her arm canes though her leg injuries from an accident with a tram have completely healed; Kay Churchill, a sociopathic college film studies lecturer who has become a terrorist cell leader (she takes Markham for a lover and he lives in her home); a troubled priest and his Chinese girlfriend; a former MI5 bombmaker and scientist turned revolutionary, and Richard Gould, a seemingly kindly pediatrician who is the terrorist mastermind behind the whole revolution. Ultimately, as Markham gets closer to the pediatrician, Markham uncovers clues explaining his former wife's murder. While Markham had previously thought the bombing to be a random attack, he finds that the Heathrow bomb did have an intended target. As police and security forces close in on Chelsea Marina, Markham joins the other protesters on the barricades and he crosses over from infiltrator to member of the revolution.

He was born in New York City to Silas Tilton and Eusebia Tilton (same surname). On his twentieth birthday, October 2, 1855, he married Elizabeth Richards. Tilton's newspaper work was fully supportive of abolitionism and the Northern cause in the American Civil War. Theodore Tilton was present at The Southern Loyalist Convention held in Philadelphia in September 1866. Frederick Douglass writes of him in his autobiography: “There was one man present who was brave enough to meet the duty of the hour; one who was neither afraid nor ashamed to own me as a man and a brother; one man of the purest Caucasian type, a poet and a scholar, brilliant as a writer, eloquent as a speaker, and holding a high influential position-the editor of a weekly journal having the largest circulation of any weekly paper in the city or State of New York- and the man was MR. Theodore Tilton. He came to me by the hand in a most brotherly way, and proposed to walk with me in the procession.” From 1860 to 1871, Tilton was the assistant of Henry Ward Beecher. He gave the 1869 commencement speech for the Irving Literary Society. In 1874 Tilton filed a complaint against Beecher for \\"criminal conversation\\" (adultery) with Elizabeth Richards Tilton and sued for a $100,000 judgment. The Beecher-Tilton trial ended in a deadlocked jury. Afterwards, Tilton moved to Paris, where he lived for the rest of his life. In the 1880s, Tilton frequently played chess with fellow American exile (but ex- Confederate) Judah Benjamin, until the latter died in 1884. As a poet, Tilton is famous mainly for his masterpiece 'Even This Shall Pass Away', a poem that talks about how everything in life is limited and will end.

Inspired by the conference Higher Education for Peace on 4–6 May 2000, dreams, ambitions and hopes for such a project saw results when in November 2001 The Norwegian Parliament awarded the funds needed to establish a national and international centre for Peace Studies. The assignment letter states that “the Centre is to establish new competence within the field of peace- and conflict-studies, and within such areas as ethnicity and democracy-building. The centre is to have a co- ordinating role for the field, both nationally and internationally.” The Centre is also in charge of a two-year Master's Programme in Peace and Conflict Transformation at the University of Tromsø, which has been taught since August 2002. In the field of Peace Research, the centre's main position is to focus on non-violent forms of conflict resolution, emphasizing the task of building a positive, sustainable peace. In other words, the centre's task is not primarily to analyze wars or keep an account of wars, armament or civil wars, but rather to focus how – and on what basis – a civil and transnational, sustainable peace can be built. In November 2002 this work started with a symposium on non-violence, where leading experts on Peace Research from all continents met in Tromsø to establish the current status of the field and point the way ahead.

Hadley (DD-774) was an which served in the United States Navy during World War II. It is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Hugh William Hadley, who lost his life during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Hugh W. Hadley (DD-774) was launched by Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding Co., San Pedro, California, 16 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Hadley, widow of the namesake; and commissioned on 25 November 1944, with Commander L. C. Chamberlin in command. It played a significant role in the Battle of Okinawa as part of the Northern Attack Force Screen (Task Group 53.6) in the Okinawa naval order of battle. History After shakedown training off the coast of California, Hugh W. Hadley sailed 21 February 1945 in company with for Pearl Harbor. The ships arrived 27 February, but Hugh W. Hadley was soon underway again, sailing eight days later for Ulithi and the great Okinawa invasion. The ship departed in company with a large group of LST's and their escorts on 25 March bound for the Japanese island stronghold, and arrived off the Okinawa group on 31 March. As the night approach was made, Hugh W. Hadley led a group of LST's toward the beach, shooting down an attacking Japanese plane en route. The destroyer escorted her charges safely to the beach, watched them unload their troops and equipment the morning of 1 April, and then took up antisubmarine patrol station outside the transport area. As the bitter fighting ashore continued, Hugh W. Hadley helped protect against submarines and aircraft as the Japanese made a final effort to stop the invasion. The ship remained on patrol until 4 April, when she sailed with a group of transports to Saipan, arriving on 14 April. Hugh W. Hadley was soon on her way back to Okinawa, however, and arrived from Saipan on 27 April to resume her outer patrol. For the next few days the destroyer fought off numerous air raids, picked up a downed fighter pilot, and carried out antisubmarine patrol. She went alongside the destroyer on 1 May for transfer of communication equipment, and then took up additional duties as a fighter direction ship for the Combat Air Patrols, so vital to the invasion's air cover. As radar picket ships were scarce, Hugh W. Hadley was assigned this duty on the afternoon of 10 May. Joining destroyer and four smaller craft, she took station 15 west of Okinawa and early the next morning began vectoring aircraft to meet the oncoming Japanese. For nearly two hours the morning of 11 May, Hugh W. Hadley and Evans came under severe attack, as the Japanese mounted their sixth attack against American forces at Okinawa. Both ships maneuvered at high speed, downing many kamikazes and directing air attacks on formations of Japanese. The attackers numbered some 150 planes. After Evans took several serious hits and went dead in the water about 0900, Hugh W. Hadley fought on alone. At 0920, she was attacked by 10 planes simultaneously, from both ahead and astern. The ship destroyed all 10, but not without damage to herself. One bomb hit aft, a Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka hit, and two kamikaze crashes were inflicted on the ship as her gunners ran low on ammunition. Finally, as the attack ended, all but 50 of the crew were ordered over the side in life rafts, the remaining men fighting fires and working to control the damage. Though her engineering spaces were flooded and she was badly holed, Hugh W. Hadley was kept afloat by her damage control parties and eventually arrived at Ie Shima. The attack took the lives of 30 crew members. During this battle. Hugh W. Hadley had succeeded in downing some 23 enemy aircraft and aided in destroying several others. After temporary repairs, the ship was taken to Kerama Retto on 14 May, where men from repair ship Zaniah worked on her battered hull. Hugh W. Hadley subsequently was taken to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, in a floating drydock towed by on 15 July 1945, and after 20 days there began the long voyage under tow of the US Navy tug ATA 199 to the United States. After encountering heavy weather during the passage the ship arrived at Hunter's Point, California, via Pearl Harbor, 26 September 1945. She was deemed as being too damaged to be repaired and was decommissioned on 15 December 1945. She was sold 2 September 1947 to Walter W. Johnson Co., San Francisco, and scrapped. Awards In addition to one battle star for her World War II Service, Hugh W. Hadley received the Presidential Unit Citation for her performance in the action off Okinawa 11 May 1945. Also, several of her crew were decorated for their actions during the war. =Presidential Unit Citation= The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION to the UNITED STATES SHIP USS HUGH W. HADLEY (DD-774) for service as set forth in the following CITATION: For extraordinary heroism in action as Fighter Direction Ship on Radar Picket Station Number 15 during an attack by approximately 100 enemy Japanese planes, forty miles northwest of the Okinawa Transport Area, May 11, 1945. Fighting valiantly against waves of hostile suicide and dive-bombing planes plunging toward her from all directions, the U.S.S. HUGH HADLEY sent up relentless barrages of antiaircraft fire during one of the most furious air-sea battles of the war. Repeatedly finding her targets, she destroyed twenty enemy planes, skillfully directed her Combat Air Patrol in shooting down at least forty others and, by her vigilance and superb battle readiness, avoided damage to herself until subjected to a coordinated attack by ten Japanese planes. Assisting in the destruction of all ten of these, she was crashed by one bomb and three suicide planes with devastating effect. With all engineering spaces flooded and with a fire raging amidships, the gallant officers and men of the HUGH W. HADLEY fought desperately against almost insurmountable odds and, by their indomitable determination, fortitude and skill, brought the damage under control, enabling their ship to be towed to port and saved. Her brilliant performance in this action reflects the highest credit upon the HUGH W. HADLEY and the United States Naval Service.  References  *  External links  * USS Hugh W.

Morvah lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south west England from Somerset to Dorset passes by on the cliffs to the north of Morvah churchtown. History =Antiquities= Evidence of a settlement at Morvah in the early Middle Ages is in the form of an inscribed stone known as the Mên Scryfa; it is a memorial to one 'Rialobranus son of Cunovalus', located in a field on a moor about three kilometres from the village. It was first described in a letter written by the antiquary Edward Lhwyd. The inscription has been dated from the fifth to the eighth century.,See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 174–177 but more firmly and authoritatively dated to the middle third of the 6th century by Professor Charles Thomas (And Shall these Mute Stones Speak, University of Wales Press 1994). In fact, this inscribed stone stands in the parish of Madron, a good mile east of Morvah parish. The finest antiquities of Morvah parish are the Neolithic dolmen of Chûn Quoit (c. 3500 BC) and the nearby Iron Age hillfort (c. 300 BC) of Chûn Castle (half of which is also in Madron parish), as well as the Late Iron Age settlement of four distinctively local courtyard houses at Croftoe. These include a rare \\"semi-detached\\" dwelling. =Morvah Gold Hoard= In 1884 during quarrying for building materials at Morvah, on the coast at Carne Farm, (which lies about half a mile north of Chûn Castle and quoit), a hoard of gold ornaments was found dating from the late Bronze Age. The hoard of gold bracelets discovered here consisted of six large bracelets, three with distinctive trumpet-like ends. One also has engraved geometric designs on it. These bracelets were almost certainly either made in Ireland or made from Irish gold, and made their way, probably through trade in exchange for tin, to Cornwall. They now reside in the British Museum but are a vivid reminder of how relatively well- off Cornwall was in prehistoric times.The Morvah Hoard at the British Museum In 2007 there have been calls in the local Cornish press for the gold hoard to be returned to Cornwall from the British Museum. =Mining= Morvah Consols was probably first opened in the 1820s and in 1851 was reported in the Cornish Telegraph newspaper as a new copper mine, with funding by the Levant adventurers. The remains that can be seen today were buillt from 1871 and was worked by a steam engine with a 30-inch cylinder. A second engine was bought from the Balleswidden Mine for pumping and stamping and was put up for auction in February 1884. In 1875 the Stanneries Court closed the mine after it only produced 5 tons 18 cwt of tin concentrate and wages had not been paid. An attempt to sell the mine by auction was abandoned following intimidation of the auctioneers by the mine's workers. Morvah Consols was agan put up for auction on 16 February 1884, initially in one lot. Items included a 24-inch cylinder engine, a 10 ton boiler, 20 fathoms of iron pumps, 16-head stamps, horse whim, wire rope, iron chains, carpenter's shop, iron, timber, etc. There was an attempt to reopen the mine in 1929. Local government For the purposes of local government Morvah is a civil parish. Morvah does not hold elections to a parish council but instead, holds a statutory meeting of electors of the parish every 12 months known as a parish meeting. The principal local authority in this area is Cornwall Council. Morvah Fair Morvah was prior to the 20th century the home of the Morvah Fair (held on 1 August every year) which has been described as the biggest Lughnasadh celebrations outside Ireland. The fair was attended by a large number from across West Cornwall. The fair was also associated with the legend of \\"Jack the Tinkard\\". In the late 19th century the then priest of Morvah lead a successful campaign to ban the celebrations due to the excess of drunken and promiscuous behaviour. In a proclamation he stated > \\"The Church-Town of Morvah has for many years past been much resorted to on > the First Sunday in August by disorderly persons of every description, much > to the annoyance of the parishioners, he hereby cautions all such persons > from assembling on that day for idle and profane amusement, so revolting to > that great command of the Law of God – \\"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it > holy\\" Strict orders have been given to the Constable and Officers of the > Parish to take into custody any person who shall be found desecrating the > Lord's Day.\\" Morvah.com website; History; retrieved April 2010 Morvah now celebrates 'pasty day' instead, on the first Tuesday of every August.

Overview  The simplest case to study is that of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, in which one does not encounter complications like phase transitions or spontaneous symmetry breaking. The density matrix of a thermal state is given by :rho_{beta,mu}=frac{e^{-beta left(H - mu Nright)}}{mathrm{Tr}left[ e^{-beta left(H - mu Nright)} right]}=frac{e^{-beta left(H - mu Nright)}}{Z(beta,mu)} where H is the Hamiltonian operator and N is the particle number operator (or charge operator, if we wish to be more general) and :Z(beta,mu) stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} mathrm{Tr}left[ e^{-beta left(H-mu Nright)} right] is the partition function. We assume that N commutes with H, or in other words, that particle number is conserved. In the Heisenberg picture, the density matrix does not change with time, but the operators are time-dependent. In particular, translating an operator A by τ into the future gives the operator :alpha_tau(A) stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} e^{iHtau}A e^{-iHtau}. A combination of time translation with an internal symmetry \\"rotation\\" gives the more general :alpha^{mu}_{tau}(A) stackrel{mathrm{def}}{=} e^{ileft(H-mu Nright)tau} A e^{-ileft(H - mu Nright)tau} A bit of algebraic manipulation shows that the expected values :leftlanglealpha^mu_tau(A)Brightrangle_{beta,mu} = mathrm{Tr}left[rho alpha^mu_tau(A)Bright] = mathrm{Tr}left[rho B alpha^mu_{tau+ibeta}(A)right] = leftlangle Balpha^mu_{tau+ibeta}(A)rightrangle_{beta,mu} for any two operators A and B and any real τ (we are working with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces after all). We used the fact that the density matrix commutes with any function of (H − μN) and that the trace is cyclic. As hinted at earlier, with infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, we run into a lot of problems like phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking, operators that are not trace class, divergent partition functions, etc.. The complex functions of z, leftlanglealpha^mu_z(A)Brightrangle converges in the complex strip -beta < Im{z} < 0 whereas leftlangle Balpha^mu_z(A)rightrangle converges in the complex strip 0 < Im{z} < beta if we make certain technical assumptions like the spectrum of H − μN is bounded from below and its density does not increase exponentially (see Hagedorn temperature). If the functions converge, then they have to be analytic within the strip they are defined over as their derivatives, :frac{d}{dz}leftlanglealpha^mu_z(A)Brightrangle = ileftlanglealpha^mu_zleft(left[H - mu N, Aright]right)Brightrangle and :frac{d}{dz}leftlangle Balpha^mu_z(A)rightrangle = ileftlangle Balpha^mu_zleft(left[H - mu N, Aright]right)rightrangle exist. However, we can still define a KMS state as any state satisfying :leftlangle alpha^mu_tau(A)Brightrangle = leftlangle Balpha^mu_{tau+ibeta}(A)rightrangle with leftlanglealpha^mu_z(A)Brightrangle and leftlangle Balpha^mu_z(A)rightrangle being analytic functions of z within their domain strips. leftlanglealpha^mu_tau(A)Brightrangle and leftlangle Balpha^mu_{tau+ibeta}(A)rightrangle are the boundary distribution values of the analytic functions in question. This gives the right large volume, large particle number thermodynamic limit. If there is a phase transition or spontaneous symmetry breaking, the KMS state is not unique. The density matrix of a KMS state is related to unitary transformations involving time translations (or time translations and an internal symmetry transformation for nonzero chemical potentials) via the Tomita–Takesaki theory.

Zelazny's originally intended title for it was The Ides of Octember.The Lesser Spotted Science Fiction Writer - Part 7: Roger Zelazny The novella won a Nebula Award in 1966. Plot summary The Dream Master is set in a future where the forces of overpopulation and technology have created a world where humanity suffocates psychologically beneath its own mass while abiding in relative physical comfort. This is a world ripe for psychotherapeutic innovations, such as the \\"neuroparticipant therapy\\" in which the protagonist, Charles Render, specializes. In neuroparticipation, the patient is hooked into a gigantic simulation controlled directly by the analyst's mind; the analyst then works with the patient to construct dreams—nightmares, wish-fulfillment, etc.--that afford insight into the underlying neuroses of the patient, and in some cases the possibility of direct intervention. (For example, a man submerging himself in a fantasy world sees it utterly destroyed at Render's hands, and is thus \\"cured\\" of his obsession with it.) Render, the leader in his field, takes on a patient with an unusual problem. Eileen Shallot aspires to become a neuroparticipant therapist herself, but is somewhat hampered by congenital blindness. Not having experienced visual sensation in the same way as her patients, she would be unable to convincingly construct visual dreams for them; indeed, in a case of eye-envy, her own neurotic desire to see through the eyes of her patients might prevent her from treating them effectively. However, she explains to Render, if a practicing neuroparticipant therapist is willing to work with her, he can expose her to the full range of visual stimuli in a controlled environment, free of her own attachments to the issue, and enable her to pursue her career. Despite his better sense and the advice of colleagues, Render agrees to go along with the treatment. But as they progress, Eileen's hunger for visual stimulation continues to grow, and she begins to assert her will against Render's, subsuming him into her own dreams. Other media In 1981 Zelazny wrote a film outline based on The Dream Master, which was purchased by 20th Century Fox and later developed into the film Dreamscape. Because he wrote the outline but neither the treatment or script, his name did not appear in the credits.

The \\"Rocket Racers\\" were slated to compete in the air and on a virtual racetrack easily viewed by a live audience as well as projected on large screen and handheld electronic displays. Three prototype canard-style Rocket Racer aircraft were built between 2006 and 2010. The league had planned to hold its inaugural race season in 2008 with four races, but encountered financial difficulties that delayed fielding of Rocket Racers by the six teams that had been previously announced. With the addition of venture capital funding in mid-2009, technology development continued and one exhibition occurred in 2010, with another round of plans for an inaugural season of races in 2011. The 2011 races were, in the end, never scheduled, and by 2014, the league was defunct. Background Projected to be an hour and one half in length, the races were intended to be between Rocket Racer planes that used liquid oxygen and either kerosene or ethanol fuelRocket Racer fact sheet from League website with a burn time of four minutes. The rocketplanes were expected to cost less than US$1 million each. The planes were based on the fixed-gear Velocity SE modified by XCOR Aerospace and the retractible gear Velocity XL modified by Armadillo Aerospace for the purpose of rocket racing. The Velocity airframe was derived from a commercially available kit plane that traced its design heritage to the Rutan Long-EZ, which had been modified to accept rocket power and custom avionics. In order to provide the airframes, RRL purchased the aircraft's manufacturer, Velocity Aircraft, in April 2008.RRL press release announcing acquisition of Velocity.

The RRL had been called \\"NASCAR with rockets\\", XCOR Aerospace flew the Rocket Racer for a public audience at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Airshow at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. If league competition were to begin, Whitelaw indicated tournament semifinals would be held each September in Nevada, with finals each October in New Mexico at the X Prize Cup competing for a $2 million championship purse. Races were to have taken place on a race course two miles (3 km) long, one mile (1.6 km) wide, and in the air. A typical race would take about one hour, and fans would be able to see multiple camera views, including cockpit, \\"on-track,\\" \\"side-by-side\\" and wing-angle views. Additionally, a computer game had been planned which was to have interfaced with racer positional data in real time over the internet, allowing players to virtually compete with the rocket pilots. Aft view of the Rocket Racer on landing roll-out at Mojave. =The Track= The proposed \\"track\\" for a typical Rocket Race was to have begun with a staggered start. Pilots were to take off in pairs a few minutes apart, they would be competing against the clock but would maneuver around each other much like NASCAR. The pilots would be guided by a virtual three-dimensional \\"track\\" projected in their head-up display. Each racer was to have a separate track to follow but the courses were planned to be close together to build excitement. =Teams= , there were six teams registered to compete in the inaugural 2008 race season, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing, Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing and Thunderhawk Rocket Racing. , RRL claimed that \\"official team recruitment will commence as the production-level Rocket Racers near completion.\\" listing five \\"candidate teams of the RRL franchise\\": Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, and Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing.Rocket Racing League Teams, Rocket Racing League website, 2012, accessed 2012-12-15. \\"Official team recruitment will commence as the production-level Rocket Racers near completion.

According to Diamandis, the purpose of the league was to \\"inspire people of all ages to once again look up into the sky and find inspiration and excitement.\\" Initial plans called for a four-team league finals in 2006, to be followed by 10 teams competing in 2007, with video games based on the competition also out in 2007. In 2006, analysts identified doubts about the economics of the venture, and especially of the ability of RRL to attract a large fanbase similar to IndyCar and NASCAR X-Racers, Start Your Rockets! : The creators of the X prize offer a sensational vision of rocket-powered airplanes speeding through the sky. But can their new racing league steal a bit of Nascar's thunder?, Michael Belfiore, Popular Science (feature cover story), 2006-02-15, accessed 2010-09-02. In the event, no races occurred in either 2006 or 2007. In April 2008, the league stated that it was \\"ready for competition [announcing] four exhibition races will be held later [in the] year, one in Las Cruces.\\" On April 14, 2008, the Racing Rocket Racing Composite Corporation, a subsidiary of the Rocket Racing League, acquired Velocity Aircraft.

Scott and Duane Swing\\" =League financial difficulties = None of the four planned 2008 races were actually run. The Rocket Racing League had difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient financial backing, from both investors and sponsors, in order to get an initial racing season firmly scheduled in 2008, 2009, or 2010. Some progress with the rocket and aircraft technology continued however, but by 2014, the league had gone defunct. The league twice failed to complete construction of six hangars contracted to be built on land adjacent to Spaceport America near Las Cruces, New Mexico. As of January 2009, the league was at risk of having their leases with the City of Las Cruces terminated. In July 2009, the league announced the closing of a venture capital financing round of US$5.5 million. The funds were to be used for ongoing operations and for the development of a next-generation Rocket Racer. Rocket Racer at Tulsa International Airport, April 2010 , Peter Diamandis suggested that 2010 could be the year that we see \\"more than one racer in the air and possibly in exhibition races.\\" Non- exhibition \\"live\\" races were to occur as early as 2011.Aero-TV: Rocket Racing League -- Diamandis Plans 2010 Exhibition Racing, Aero-News Network, 2010-02-15, retrieved 2010-02-15. Also in February, the Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium (TASM) announced that it would partner with the Rocket Racing League to host an exhibition flight of a Rocket Racer at the QuikTrip Air and Rocket Show at Tulsa International Airport in April 2010. TULSA AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP WITH ROCKET RACING LEAGUE AND INAUGURAL QUICKTRIP AIR & ROCKET RACING SHOW, 2010-02-16, accessed 2010--4-01. The Rocket Racing League announced a \\"2010 World Exhibition Tour\\" on April 24, 2010, when they unveiled their Mark-III X-racer rocket plane at the QuikTrip Air & Rocket Racing Show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The RRL exhibition flights at Tulsa were the first simultaneous flights of two rocket-powered airplanes in the history of peacetime aviation. RRL duplicated this historic feat later that day. The league's intent in such exhibitions was to \\"build up the league's fan base, in addition to perfecting operations and technologies, before the league's official launch in 2012.\\" Rocket Racing League Unveils New Flying Hot Rod, by Denise Chow, Space.com, 2010-04-26, accessed 2010-04-27. The April event in Tulsa was the only RRL exhibition of 2010. The league's financial difficulties continued in 2011 and no races were organized. By 2014, persons formerly involved with the league had made public statements that the league had failed and was now defunct. Rocket Racers The Rocket Racing League had been developing prototype Rocket Racers since 2006, working with one airframe manufacturer and two rocket engine producers on three prototype aircraft to date. All three of the airframes have been of the canard configuration to more easily accommodate the rocket propulsion technology. A fifth model was proposed, but not built, in 2011: the Mark-V X-Racer. =Predecessor aircraft= XCOR Aerospace developed the XCOR EZ-Rocket, later flown under Rocket Racing League sponsorship as an X-Racer prototype rocketplane. First flight was July 21, 2001 at Mojave Airport in Mojave, California. First Flights - XCOR Aerospace , Mojave Transportation Museum, accessdate=2006-11-13 This XCOR technology demonstrator was a converted Rutan Long-EZ and, in its final version, utilized two 400 lbf (1.8 kN) thrust XCOR Aerospace isopropyl-alcohol-powered rocket engines of engine type XR-4A3. XCOR flew the EZ-Rocket for several years in development and demonstration flights, including, in collaboration with the RRL, at the 2005 X-Prize Cup in New Mexico. By 2006, the design-point for the RRL racer had become a single rocket engine utilizing kerosene as the rocket fuel, carrying of liquid oxygen in its flight oxidizer tank. The first RRL prototype built, known as the Mark-I X-Racer, was built on a Velocity SE airframe and was also powered by XCOR Aerospace rocket technology, a regeneratively-cooled and pump-fed XR-4K14 rocket engine. Products Overview , XCOR Aerospace, undated, accessed 2010-12-27. \\"Twin 400 lb-thrust XR-4A3 engines aboard the EZ-Rocket\\" (with in- flight photograph) ... \\"Another engine that we have developed in parallel is the XR-4K14, ... a 1,500 lb thrust regeneratively cooled LOX and pump-fed kerosene system ... used as the Rocket Racer aircraft's main engine.\\" This rocket-powered aircraft flew several demonstration flights at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show. XCOR X-Racer, by Nancy Atkinson, Universe Today, 2009-08-06, accessed 2010-04-26. The total thrust for the single-engine Mark-I X-Racer was , approximately twice that of the EZ-Rocket. =Mark-II and Mark- III X-Racers= , the Rocket Racing League was utilizing a highly modified Velocity XL fixed-gear airframe and an Armadillo Aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol rocket engine in both its Mark-II X-Racer and Mark-III X-Racer demonstration vehicles. Rocket Racing League Announces Milestone Development in X-Racer , press release, 2010-03-10, accessed 2010-05-03.

The brink of take-off for the RRL, Aerospace Testing International, June 2010, pp. 50-54, accessed 2010-09-06. The rocket engine was a LOX-Ethanol, film-cooled, pressure-fed, blow-down design with a 10 to -long exhaust plume. Plume-seeding technology allowed the plume color to vary from red to green to yellow to better facilitate race spectators in keeping track of specific racers while in the air. The Mark-II (N205MB) racer utilized a standard fixed-gear XL airframe, modified for the addition of the Armadillo rocket propulsion. The Mark-III (N133XP) airframe was modified during manufacturing at Velocity Aircraft explicitly for use as a Rocket Racer, with canopy top, center seat and control stick, and other enhancements. =Mark V X-Racer= The Mark-V proposed design resembles \\"a sleek, rocket-powered sailplane\\" and may be built at Velocity Aircraft, although no firm contracts are in place to do so .

In an internal combustion engine those are usually poppet valves and in a steam engine they are usually slide valves or piston valves.  Internal combustion engines  = Camshaft = In four-stroke cycle engines and some two-stroke cycle engines, the valve timing is controlled by the camshaft. It can be varied by modifying the camshaft, or it can be varied during engine operation by variable valve timing. It is also affected by the adjustment of the valve mechanism, and particularly by the tappet clearance. However, this variation is normally unwanted. = Valve overlap = Valve timing diagram for a 4-stroke engine With traditional fixed valve timing, an engine will have a period of \\"valve overlap\\" at the end of the exhaust stroke, when both the intake and exhaust valves are open. The intake valve is opened before the exhaust gases have completely left the cylinder, and their considerable velocity assists in drawing in the fresh charge. Engine designers aim to close the exhaust valve just as the fresh charge from the intake valve reaches it, to prevent either loss of fresh charge or unscavenged exhaust gas. In the diagram, the valve overlap periods are indicated by the overlap of the red and blue arcs. Key: * TDC = Top dead centre * BDC = Bottom dead centre * IO = Inlet valve opens * IC = Inlet valve closes * EO = Exhaust valve opens * EC = Exhaust valve closes Either valve opens before the piston head reaches top dead centre or bottom dead centre. The amount in crankshaft degrees by which the valves open before top dead centre or bottom dead centre is reached is known as valve lead. The amount in crankshaft by which the valves close after top dead centre or bottom dead centre is reached is known as valve lag. Valve overlap is a secondary means to cool exhaust valves with intake air during valve overlap. Primary cooling is accomplished by dissipating heat to the valve seats. = Variable valve timing = Engines that always run at a relatively high speed, such as race car engines, will have considerable overlap in their valve timings for maximum volumetric efficiency. Road car engines are different because they are required to idle at less than 1000rpm, and excessive valve overlap would make smooth idling impossible because of the mixing of fresh and exhaust gases. Variable valve timing can give both maximum power at high rpm and smooth idling at low rpm by making small changes to the relative angular position of the camshafts and thereby varying the valve overlap. = Ported engines = Two-Stroke engine showing ports in the cylinder walls. The timing cannot be varied Many two-stroke cycle and all wankel engines do not have a camshaft or valves, and the port timing can only be varied by machining the ports, and/or modifying the piston skirt (two-stroke applications). However, some supercharged two-stroke diesel engines (such as the Wilksch aero-engine) do have a cylinder head and poppet valves, similar to a four-stroke cycle engine. Tappet clearance The valve timing of a diesel engine also depends on tappet clearance of the inlet and exhaust valves. If tappet clearance is less, then valve will open early and close late.https://marinerspoint.in/what-is- tappet-clearance-how-to-check-and-adjust-tappet-clearance/2020/05/ If tappet clearance is more, then valve will open late and close early. Tappet clearance is measured by an instrument called feeler gauge.  External combustion engines  In an external combustion engine, such as a steam engine, the control of the valve timing is by the valve gear. In a typical piston valve arrangement, the timing of the intake and exhaust events for each cylinder are inextricably related as they are governed by the movement of a single piston uncovering two ports. However, the duration of the intake event can be controlled (the \\"cut-off\\") using the reversing gear and this reduces steam usage under cruising conditions. Caprotti valve gear is more closely related to that of an internal combustion engine, uses poppet valves, and was developed to allow independent timing of the intake and exhaust events. It was never used as widely as piston valves or the earlier slide valves.

Life and career Wood, the son of Benjamin and Rebecca (Lehman) Wood, was born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, on October 13, 1820, and was the brother of US congressional representative and New York City Mayor Fernando Wood. The Wood family moved from Kentucky to New York City, and Benjamin Wood was educated in New York City. He entered the mercantile and shipping business, and in 1860, he purchased the New York Daily News (not to be confused with the current New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919), of which he was the editor and publisher until he died in 1900.Congressional bio In 1861 the federal government effectively shut down the paper (by suspending its delivery via the postal service) as being sympathetic with the Confederacy during the Civil War. During the interval, he wrote a novel: Fort Lafayette or, Love and Secession. Wood was able to re-open the paper 18 months later. In the period 1863 to 1865 the paper printed letters from the readers (southern spies) with coded messages for readers in the south, the editor was arrested in 1865. After that Benjamin Wood was regarded as a traitor by many northern citizens. Wood was elected as a Democrat to the 37th and 38th United States Congresses (March 4, 1861 – March 3, 1865) He was a member of the New York State Senate (4th D.) in 1866 and 1867 and elected to the 47th United States Congress (March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1883). Death and personal life He died in New York City on February 21, 1900 and was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Queens. His wife, Ida Mayfield Wood, became a recluse and miser, who resided at the Herald Square Hotel for 24 years, refusing contact with the outside world, and was the subject of a famous court case after her death in 1932, when her true identity of Ellen Walsh came to light.

The South West Coast Path passes to the south. Layout Attached to the tower itself, there is an 'E' shaped building split into a terrace of four cottages. Three of the cottages were originally used to house the three resident keepers, their wives and families, with the fourth used as an office area and sleeping accommodation for the supernumerary keepers. They are now let as holiday cottages. Water was originally collected off the flat roof of the accommodation block and stored in an underground tank. Behind the cottages are three kitchen gardens (which soon fell into disuse as nothing would grow in such an exposed position). On the seaward side of the complex, the fog siren and its accompanying machinery is housed in a separate building. =Significance= The lighthouse, together with the attached keepers' cottages, are Grade II listed, as is the separate engine house (with its fog horn equipment), along with other associated buildings and the boundary walls. Pendeen's engine house is 'the only example in the country to have retained its 12\\" siren with associated machinery'. Construction Trinity House decided to build a lighthouse and foghorn here in 1891 and the building was designed by their engineer Sir Thomas Matthews. The tower, buildings and surrounding wall were constructed by Arthur Carkeek of Redruth who had to flatten the headland before building could commence. The light was put into commission on 26 September 1900. =Lamp and optic= A five–wick Argand lamp was initially provided, by Messrs Chance of Smethwick, near Birmingham; it was replaced not long afterwards, however, by a Matthews 3-50mm dia. mantle lamp. (The original Argand oil lamp was on display at the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum, Penzance, until 2005 when the museum closed.) Chance Brothers also manufactured the lens system: a large (first- order) rotating optic made up of two sets of four panels (eight panels in all), which displayed a group of four flashes every fifteen seconds,Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911 edition, vol. 16, p. 650. (and which as of 2019 is still in use); it had a range of . =Fog siren= The fog signal was sounded from a detached engine house a little to the north-west. In 1900 it contained a pair of Hornsby oil engines providing compressed air for the twin 5-inch sirens, which sounded a seven-second blast every one-and-a-half minutes, through vertical curved trumpets (still in place) on the engine room roof. Electrification In 1926 Pendeen was the first Trinity House station to be fitted with a new, more powerful 12-inch siren. This was part of a general upgrade to the lighthouse, which saw new Gardner semi-diesel engines installed in the engine house and an electric filament lamp replacing the petroleum vapour light in the lantern. Pendeen was one of the first Trinity House lighthouses to be equipped with an incandescent light bulb: 'in order to obviate a watch being kept during fog both in the engine room and the lantern, electric light has been introduced in place of the petroleum-vapour lamps and the apparatus in the lantern made automatic'. The electric current was generated by dynamos directly coupled to another set of semi-diesel engines. The lamp used was an Osram gas-filled bulb, specially designed for Trinity House by the General Electric Company. The automated equipment included a turntable lamp changer:Photograph, 1980s in the event of a lamp failure, a reserve bulb was brought into position and lit (and an alarm notified the keeper), and if the reserve bulb then failed, it was replaced by a self- lighting acetylene lamp; the system remained in use until the mid-1990s. In the engine house, the Gardners were replaced by a pair of Ruston & Hornsby diesels in 1963. Automation Pendeen Lighthouse was automated in 1995 with the keepers leaving the station on 3 May. While a new electric lamp and automatic lamp changer were provided at this time, the original optic was retained and it remains in use. As part of the preparation for automation the fog siren was decommissioned and replaced with an electric fog signal, sounding once every 20 seconds; (The fog signal was decommissioned in April 2014).

It is of Aarne- Thompson type 533. The story was first translated into English by Edgar Taylor in 1826, then by many others, e.g. by an anonymous community of translators in 1865, by Lucy Crane in 1881, by LucMargaret Hunt in 1884, etc. Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book in 1889.  Origin  The tale was first published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen, vol. 2, in 1815, as number 3. It appears as no. 89 since the second edition (1819). Grimm's source for the story is the German storyteller Dorothea Viehmann (1755–1815). Synopsis A widowed queen sends her daughter to a faraway land, to marry. Accompanying the princess are her magical horse Falada, who can speak, and a waiting maid. The queen gives the princess a special charm that will protect her as long as she wears it. The princess and her servant travel for a time, and eventually the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the maid simply says: \\"If you want water, get it for yourself. I do not want to be your servant any longer.\\" So the princess has to fetch herself water from the nearby stream. She wails softly: \\"What will become of me?\\" The charm answers: \\"Alas, alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\\" After a while, the princess gets thirsty again. So she asks her maid once more to get her some water. But again the evil servant says, \\"I will not serve you any longer, no matter what you or your mother say.\\" The servant leaves the poor princess to drink from the river by her dainty little hands. When she bends to the water her charm falls out of her bosom and floats away. The maid takes advantage of the princess's vulnerability. She orders the princess to change clothes with her and the horses as well. She threatens to kill the princess if she doesn't swear never to say a word about this reversal of roles to any living being. Sadly, the princess takes the oath. The maid servant then rides off on Falada, while the princess has to mount the maid's nag. At the palace, the maid poses as princess and the \\"princess servant\\" is ordered to guard the geese with a little boy called Conrad. The false bride orders Falada to be killed, as she fears he might talk. The real princess hears of this and begs the slaughterer to nail Falada's head above the doorway where she passes with her geese every morning. The next morning the goose girl addresses Falada's head over the doorway: \\"Falada, Falada, thou art dead, and all the joy in my life has fled\\", and Falada answers \\" Alas, Alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\\" On the goose meadow, Conrad watches the princess comb her beautiful hair and he becomes greedy to pluck one or two of her golden locks. But the goose girl sees this and says a charm: \\"Blow wind, blow, I say, take Conrad's hat away. Do not let him come back today until my hair is combed today.\\" And so the wind takes his hat away, and he cannot return before the goose girl has finished brushing and plaiting her hair. Conrad angrily goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with this girl any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time, and the next morning hides and watches. He finds everything as Conrad has told. That evening, he asks the princess to tell him her story. But she refuses to say anything because of her oath. The king suggests that she might tell everything to the iron stove. She agrees, climbs into the stove and tells her story while the king listens from outside. As the king is convinced she has told the truth, he has the goose girl clad in royal clothes. He then tricks the false princess into \\"choosing her own punishment\\". While each choice is different in each version of the story, in the classic version, she tells the king that a false servant should be dragged through town naked in a barrel with internal spikes. As a result, she is punished that way until she dies. After that, the prince and the true princess are married and reign over their kingdom for many years. Variants The story uses the false bride plot with a good-hearted princess being seized by her maid and turned into a common goose girl.

Tolkien, \\"On Fairy-Stories\\", Essays Presented to Charles William edited by C. S. Lewis p 53 Adaptations Despite the story being viewed as obscure, there have been many film versions, from countries ranging from Germany to even America. Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include: * Harold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose- girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost. ** The plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale. * The fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett. * In 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \\"From the Brothers Grimm\\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death. * Titled \\"The GooseMaiden\\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl. Literature: * The Goose Girl by Shannon Hale is an adaptation of the tale in the form of a novel. * Bloodleaf, the first of a young adult fantasy trilogy by Crystal Smith, is a gothic retelling of \\"The Goose Girl.\\" It was published by HMHTeen in 2019. * \\"The Goose Girl\\" was one of the many folktales used in Emma Donoghue's novel Kissing The Witch. The tale was titled \\"The Tale of The Handkerchief\\". * Author Alethea Kontis adapted this tale together with The Wild Swans in the form of a novel titled Dearest. * Adrienne Rich's 1974 poem \\"The Fact of a Doorframe\\" references the Goose Girl.The Fact of a Doorframe: Poems Selected and New 1950-1984. (London & New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1984) * The tale was retold into a short children's book by Eric A. Kimmel. * In the shōjo manga Ludwig Revolution (ルードヴィッヒ革命 Rūdovihhi Kakumei) the story tells about Prince Ludwig who is ordered by his father to find himself a wife more suitable than the women he often brings into the castle. Along with his servant Wilhelm, they travel across the land in search of fair maidens from classic stories in hopes of finding Ludwig a wife. It includes the tale of \\"The Goose Girl\\" among other tales from the Brothers Grimm. * \\"Falada: the Goose Girl's Horse\\" is a short story adaption by author Nancy Farmer. This version tells the classic tale from Falada's point of view. * The Canadian poet Jay Macpherson references the story of the Goose Girl in her poems \\"Poor Child\\" and \\"What Falada Said,\\" both reprinted in Poems Twice Told: The Boatman and Welcoming Disaster. * The Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison references the story in Doom Patrol issue 31, \\"The Word Made Flesh,\\" when Baphomet takes the form of Falada's head. Other: * Although an original story, the German opera Königskinder by Engelbert Humperdinck was inspired by Brothers Grimm fairy tales, particularly \\"The Goose Girl.\\" * In the Doom Patrol comics and live-action series, Baphomet, a magical oracle able to appear in any guise she chooses, in the Unwritten Book storyline, chose to appear in the guise of Falada the magic horse, from The Goose Girl.

Germantown is also a general term for an area of Louisville from the Original Highlands to St Joseph and Bradley neighborhoods that were predominantly settled by Germans. The actual neighborhood is bounded by Barrett Ave, Eastern Parkway, and the South Fork of Beargrass Creek.  History  The area was settled as small farms and butcher shops by German immigrants in the 1870s. At this time the area was nicknamed 'Frogtown' because the adjacent Beargrass Creek frequently flooded the area, causing numerous epidemics of malaria. The flooding problem was solved when Beargrass Creek was routed into a much deeper concrete canal. The area was subdivided and developed heavily during the 1890s, when the largest collection of shotgun houses in the city of Louisville was built. In 1907, a bridge was built across the South Fork of Beargrass Creek which allowed French settlers north of the creek, in an area called Paristown, to attend the one Catholic church in the area. The German-Paristown Neighborhood Association was founded in 1973, making it one of Louisville's very first neighborhood associations. Today the area is undergoing a transition to a younger, more educated demographic. Many homes in the neighborhood are being renovated and urban homesteading (complete with gardens, bee hives, and backyard chickens) is common. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Germantown was 3,867, of which 93.9% are white, 4.2% are black, 1.6% are listed as other, and 0.7% are Hispanic. College graduates are of the 17.9% population, people without a high school degree are 29.3%. Females outnumber males 52.9% to 47.1%.

The game is a spiritual successor to Green Beret (also known as Rush'n Attack). The game is influenced by popular action movies of the time such as Commando, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and Missing in Action. Gameplay Player 1 take on the roles of a US Army special operations Green beret and player 2 takes the role of a soldier of the United Nations in cooperative mode. Players must infiltrating enemy POW camps in Vietnam to find prisoners of wars and lead them to freedom. Like its predecessor, there are a total of six levels in the game: war-torn field, jungle, airstrip, rail-yard, POW camp, and escaping POW camp. M.I.A. can be played by up to two players, with player 1 in green and player 2 in blue. Throughout most of the game, the player's main weapon is a knife, which is capable of destroying any enemy in the game. By killing the red enemy soldiers, the player can acquire additional weapons. The available weapons consist of an assault rifle (12 rounds), a flamethrower (2 rounds), a bazooka (3 rounds), and grenades (3 rounds). Unlike Green Beret, the player can carry more than one weapon and switch between them at will. If the player loses a life, then only their currently equipped weapon will be lost. At the end of each level, an assorted number of troops on fixed machine gun positions (usually four) that must be eliminated.

After spending much of its life as a paper producer known as Bowater, it diversified and became a leading manufacturer of beverage cans. It had 55 plants in over 20 countries across Asia, Europe, North America and South America. In June 2016, Rexam was acquired by Ball Corporation for $8.4 billion. History =Foundation= Manchester-born William Vansittart Bowater trained as a manager with James Wrigley and Sons, a paper making business based in Manchester. Having been dismissed in 1881 at age 43, Bowater decided to establish himself as a paper agent in London. In a quickly expanding market, Bowater later secured contracts to supply newsprint to two of the leading publishing entrepreneurs: Alfred Harmsworth, then publisher of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror; and Edward Lloyd, publisher of the Daily Chronicle. The company was subsequently renamed W.V. Bowater and Sons after three of Bowater's sons joined the business, but as an agent the business had few staff: Bowater and his three sons as partner; six clerks; two typists; and an office boy. After Bowater's death in 1907, in 1910, the company became a private limited liability company, led by Thomas Vansittart Bowater. It expanded into large-scale dealing in waste paper, including the export of surplus newspapers to the Far East to enable their protection during shipping of tea plants. But after Thomas became Lord Mayor of London in 1913, the company was left to be run by his younger brothers, who expanded the business internationally. They established an office in Sydney to export newsprint to Australia, and the Hudson Packaging and Paper Company to market UK newsprint in the United States. =1920s= The start of the First World War brought about huge growth in the paper market, and the company was prepared for this having purchased a site for development as a pulp and paper making mill in Northfleet, on the south side of the Thames estuary near Gravesend. However, with restrictions on both raw materials and production imposed by the Ministry of War, construction was not started by contractor Armstrong Whitworth until post the end of the war. After the need to redesign the plant proposed by Armstrong Whitworth, eldest grandson Eric Bowater was put in charge of the project to select new secondary contractors. After he established full production from the plant in July 1925, in 1927 at the age of 32, he became chairman and managing director of W.V. Bowater and Sons. In 1928, Eric sold stakes in the business to both Lord Rothermere and other investors, reducing the families stake to 40%. The resulting cash injection allowed a doubling of expansion at Northfleet through additional investment. In 1929, he agreed a deal with both Lord Rothermere and Beaverbrook Newspapers to establish a new pulp and paper mill beside the Manchester Ship Canal in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, the product from which would be consumed under long term supply deals to the newspapers of the two investors. Resultantly, by the end of 1930 with both plants online at full production, Bowater's mills output was 175,000 tons of newsprint per annum, 22% of the UK's total newsprint output. =1930s= However, the great depression cut badly into both investors businesses, resulting in a desperate need for cash injections. After Rothermere sold his stakes in both the main company and the Mersey mill, Beaverbrook took the same action, resulting the company being again completely in family control. As newspaper circulation rose again, Eric invested to double the capacity of the Mersey mills. After the death of Edward Lloyd, in 1936 the company bought both the Sittingbourne and relatively new Kemsley Paper Mill. This brought the company's output to 500,000 tons per annum across four plants, producing 60% of British newsprint and the largest newsprint maker in Europe. After a Scandinavian-cartel engineered a large rise in pulp prices, Eric started to buy into raw pulp production. After buying forest interests in both Sweden and Norway, he bought a large pulp and paper mill at Corner Brook, Newfoundland in 1938, which owned of timber and produced 200,000 tons per year of paper. This brought the companies newsprint output up to 800,000 tons per annum. =Second World War= At the outbreak of the Second World War, the British government restricted the import and consumption of wood and other products used to create pulp, resulting in an 80% reducing in the companies pre-War UK output. Resultantly, the Northfleet plant which was closest to occupied Europe was closed down. From 1940, Eric Bowater himself was seconded by William Morris to join his team at Ministry of Aircraft Production, for which he was knighted in 1944. =Post War= After he returned to the business in 1945, Sir Eric Bowater focused the business on packaging in the UK, and international expansion. After buying Acme Corrugated Cases Ltd in 1944, Bowater began to organise the companies interests into a series of wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, by the mid-1950s, Bowater was the largest producer of newsprint in the world. The Company diversified into tissue manufacturing in 1956 forming Bowater-Scott, a joint venture with the Scott Corporation; Scott Corporation bought out the Bowater interest in the joint venture in 1986. By 1962, company assets totalled close to £200 million.Robert Knight, 'Bowater, Sir Eric Vansittart (1895–1962)’, rev. Anita McConnell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 Aug 2014 Consuming huge amounts of capital, the company had failed to invest in its newsprint production, leaving it with a high cost base which was added to by the opening of Bowater House, a new head office in Knightsbridge. After the death of Sir Eric in 1962, the company began to consolidate. The money-losing European assets were slowly sold off, until the last French plant was sold in the early 1970s. UK and North American newsprint was unwound, with the loss of 300,000 tons of annual production and the closure of the Northfleet mill. The company demerged its existing United States subsidiary, Bowater Inc., in 1984. However three years later, in 1987, the company acquired Rexham Corporation, a manufacturer of plastic, paper and foil, based in North Carolina. In 1992, the company acquired Dickinson Robinson Group Packaging. In 1995, the name was changed to Rexam,Bowater to change name to Rexam Plasteurope, 31 May 1995 an abbreviation of the name of one of the Company's subsidiaries, Regal Paper America, and the business was refocused again – this time into consumer packaging.

The Synchronistic Kinglist gives his name, but the Babylonian counterpart is illegible, possibly having been Simbar-Šipak based on the sequence of kings before and after. This chronicle seems quite fanciful in its chronology during the Assyrian dark-age. In any case, the king Adad-apla-iddina would have been his contemporary, sheltering his uncle, Šamši-Adad IV in political exile while he regrouped and planned his putsch. Although Aššur-bēl-kala had married Adad- apla-iddina’s daughter, it seems unlikely that Adad-apla-iddina would have then participated in an effort to depose his own grandson, so it seems likely that Erība-Adad was the issue of another queen and the Babylonian king’s change of attitude due to earlier political events in Assyria.

He was the last king of the Middle Assyrian Empire, and his later reign was preoccupied with a revolution against his rule led by one Tukulti-Mer, which, by the end of his reign, allowed hordes of Arameans to press in on Assyria's western borders. He is perhaps best known for his zoological collection. Biography His reign marks the point at which the tide turned against the middle Assyrian empire, and substantial Levantine territory to the west was captured by the invading Arameans. Aššūr-bēl-kala was the last of the monarchs of the second millennium for whom there are any significant surviving inscriptions. His annals are recorded on numerous fragments from Aššur and Nineveh. =The Broken Obelisk= The Broken Obelisk,Broken Obelisk, . an unfinished part of a monumental inscription, is usually attributed to him following the arguments made by Weidner, Jaritz and Borger, despite its apparent imitation of the campaigns of Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I and his hunting of a nāḫiru (a “sea-horse”) in the Mediterranean (the “upper sea of the land of Amurru”). These arguments include the introduction of Babylonian month names, its discovery with a limestone statue of a naked Ištar inscribed with his name, the designation of the Arameans as living in KUR a-re-me, and their evident progress into traditionally Assyrian ruled lands. It was discovered by the ethnic Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in mid-August 1853 at a \\"locality about half-way between Sennacherib's palace and that of Assurbanipal\\" and depicts the (enlarged) king towering over bound, supplicant prisoners under five symbols of the gods. Any reconstruction of the events of his reign consequently depends heavily on whether this object is correctly assigned. In his first year, he campaigned in the north against Urarṭu, delaying his adoption of the eponym office until the following year. In his second, he turned his attention to the countries Himme, Ḫabḫu, and Mari, the latter of which was under the authority of Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the Assyrian throne. Thereafter his attention was largely absorbed with endless counterattacks against the hordes of Arameans pressing on his borders, whom he even pursued: “[...in] rafts (of inflated) goatskins I crossed the Euphrates.”Annals, VAT 9539, . He fought them as far as Carchemish, which he plundered, and in the Ḫārbūr valley, the Broken Obelisk referencing at least 15 campaigns. Texts recovered from Giricano, ancient Dunnu-ša-Uzibi, mostly dated to the eponym year of Ili- iddina (1069/68) his 5th or 6th year, include one that recalls the fighting the preceding year, the eponymy of Aššur-rem-nišešu, in Dunnu-ša-Liṣur-ṣala- Aššur in the district of Šinamu, when territory was lost. Sometime later the entire region fell to the invaders. =Building works and zoo= The only known Assyrian statue of a naked woman, erected at the temple of Ishtar in Nineveh, during the reign of Ashur-bel-kala, 1073–1056 BC.

Aššūr-bēl-kala’s interests were not solely zoological as he enjoyed hunting and boasts killing wild bulls and cows “at the city of Araziqu which is before the land of Ḫatti and at the foot of Mount Lebanon.” He “rebuilt from top to bottom the storehouses of my lordly palace, which are at the fore part of the enclosure,” and Aššur-nādin-aḫḫē's terrace of the New Palace at Nineveh, placed gate guardians inspired by the nāḫiru he had supposedly hunted. He also repaired a quay wall originally built by Adad- nārārī I (c. 1307–1275 BC). =Relations with Babylonia= After his inauguration, he was apparently visited by the reigning Babylonian king, Marduk-šāpik-zēri, who “established friendly relations with Aššūr-bēl-kala,” and then returned to Sippar.Eclectic Chronicle (ABC 24), tablet , obv. 4–7. This treaty followed the earlier poor relations of their predecessors, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra and Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, who had sparred and was probably motivated by their need to unite to fight their common enemy the Arameans. Marduk-šāpik-zēri died around five years later and this seems to have galvanized Aššūr-bēl-kala into intervening militarily to install a successor of his choice: The Synchronistic HistorySynchronistic History (ABC 21), ii 25-37. relates that the next king, Adad-apla-iddina, “son of Esagil-šaduni, son of a nobody,” was appointed by Aššūr-bēl-kala, who married his daughter and “took her with a vast dowry to Assyria,” while the Eclectic Chronicle gives his father as Itti-Marduk-balāṭu. The Synchronistic History concludes with noting that “the people of Assyria and Babylonia mingled (peacefully) with one another.” His tomb was one of the five found on the lower reaches of the palace at Assur. He was briefly succeeded by his son, Erība-Adad II, whose short reign was followed by that of his brother Šamši-Adad IV.

The parish includes the hamlets of Christmas Common, Greenfield and Howe Hill, all of which are in the Chiltern Hills. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 2,727. History The Watlington area is likely to have been settled at an early date, encouraged by the proximity of the Icknield Way. The toponym means \\"settlement of Waecel's people\\" and indicates occupation from around the 6th century. A 9th-century charter by Æthelred of Mercia records eight 'manses' or major dwellings in Watlington. The Domesday Book of 1086 referred to the town as Watelintone or Watelintune, and identified the area as an agricultural community valued at £610. Medieval documents indicate that the modern street plan was in existence in the 14th century, as Cochynes-lane (Couching Street), and Brook Street are recorded. There are records of inns in Watlington since the 15th century. In 1722 the town's market was listed as being held on a Saturday. By the end of the 18th century the town had six inns, all of which were bought up in the next few years by a local brewing family, the Haywards. The number of licensed premises increased until late in the 19th century when George Wilkinson, a Methodist bought six of them and closed them down. Today Watlington has three public houses remaining: The Spire & Spoke (ex-Carriers Arms), The ChequersThe Chequers and The Fat Fox Inn.The Fat Fox Inn Parliamentarian troops were billeted at Watlington during the English Civil War. It is thought that John Hampden stayed in the town the night before the Battle of Chalgrove Field. In 1664–65 the Town Hall was built at the expense of Thomas Stonor. Its upper room was endowed by Stonor as a grammar school for boys, and in 1731 Dame Alice Tipping of Ewelme gave a further endowment to increase the number of pupils. In 1842 the town Vestry established a National School, which shared the same rooms in the Town Hall. In 1843 a National School for girls was built next to St Leonard's church. In 1872 the boys' and girls' schools were absorbed into a new Board school, which like its predecessors was affiliated to the National Society for Promoting Religious Education. In 1927 the school was divided into separate junior and senior schools. In 1956 a new secondary school – the Icknield School – opened for senior pupils and the primary school took over the old premises.Watlington Primary School The Icknield School is now Icknield Community College.Icknield Community College By 1895 the Town Hall, no longer used as a school, was in disrepair. In 1907 it was restored by public subscription. It is a landmark at the meeting point of three roads in the centre of the town. Since 1990 Watlington has been twinned with the town of Mansle in the Poitou-Charentes region of France. The Watlington Hoard, a collection of silver items dating back to the time of Alfred the Great in the 9th century, was rediscovered in Watlington by James Mather, an amateur metal- detectorist, in 2015. The hoard was subsequently excavated, and eventually purchased by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford for £1.35m. Watlington Hill View from Watlington towards the White Mark on Watlington Hill The town of Watlington lies at the foot of Watlington Hill, a 240-metre peak on the western edge of the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Ridgeway National Trail walking route, which is part of the longer Icknield Way, passes nearby between the town and the hill. Due to its close proximity and easy access to the Chilterns, Watlington is a popular gateway to the many outdoor activities in the area, including hill walking, cycling and birdwatching, especially of the red kite, which is well established in the vicinity. Watlington Hill is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) as part of Watlington and Pyrton Hills. It is managed by the National Trust. The nearby Shirburn Hill is another SSSI in the area. The Watlington White Mark, a spire mark, is cut into the chalk soil of Watlington Hill. This was designed by local squire Edward Horne, who felt that the parish church of St Leonard, when viewed from his home, would be more impressive if it appeared to have a spire. He therefore had this unusual folly cut into the chalk soil in 1764, and it continues to this day to be maintained by the local residents. The mark is wide at its base and long. Churches =Church of England= St Leonard's parish church The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Leonard are Norman, including a diapered tympanum that was over the north door until this was dismantled for the building of the north aisle. The church was extensively rebuilt in the 14th century, and the arcade of the south aisle survives from this period. The south chapel is 15th century, built for Maud Warner as a memorial for her husband Richard, a woolman. The tower is also Mediaeval. A few Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic windows survive, but in the 1870s some were moved to different positions within the church. In 1763 Edward Horne, a local landowner, obtained permission to build a burial vault east of the Warner chapel and south of the chancel. In 1877 the architects H.J. Tollit and Edwin Dolby restored St Leonard's. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The west tower had a ring of six bells until 1909, when two recently cast ones were hung and increased it to eight. Henry I Knight of Reading, Berkshire cast the fourth bell in 1587. Ellis I Knight cast the sixth bell in 1635. Henry II Knight cast the third and fifth bells in 1663. Charles and John Rudhall of Gloucester cast the seventh bell in 1785. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1869 and the treble and second bells in 1905. St Leonard's parish is now part of the Benefice of Icknield, along with the parishes of Britwell Salome, Pyrton and Swyncombe. St Edmund Campion Roman Catholic church =Roman Catholic= During the English Reformation Oxfordshire had numerous recusant Roman Catholics. In 1549 William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton was sent to Oxfordshire with 1,500 troops to enforce the Reformation. Grey ordered William Boolar, a Catholic of Watlington, to be hanged as an example. Despite persecution, a number of local landowning families including the Stonors remained Catholic, and they and their chaplains supported small numbers of other Catholics in the area. In 1930 Fr. William Brown, the chaplain at Stonor Park, brought about the building of the Roman Catholic church of the Sacred Heart in Watlington. The present Roman Catholic church in Watlington is dedicated to St Edmund Campion, a Jesuit priest who was executed at Tyburn in 1581. Watlington Methodist church =Non-conformist= During the 17th and 18th centuries several nonconformist denominations existed in Watlington, with Quakers, Baptists and Seventh Day Baptists most prominent in different periods. Methodist preachers visited Watlington by invitation from 1764, with John Wesley himself preaching in the town in 1766, 1774 and 1775. The current Wesleyan chapel was built in 1812, and now forms part of the Oxford Methodist Circuit. Education Watlington Primary School Icknield Community College Early years and primary education in Watlington is provided by Watlington Primary School. Lower secondary education for students up to the age 16 from Watlington and many of the surrounding villages is provided by Icknield Community College, a mixed-sex comprehensive school. Icknield Community College does not provide sixth form education, and instead works with three partnership schools in the area, Henley College in Henley-on-Thames, Lord Williams's School in Thame, and Wallingford School in Wallingford, as well as sending students to many other sixth forms and colleges in the area.

Transport The M40 motorway is about from Watlington, with access at junctions 5 and 6. There are frequent coach services to Oxford and London, and to London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, from M40 junction 6 at nearby Lewknor. A bus on route T1 arrives in Oxford from Watlington Bus routes serving Watlington have been reduced in the 2010s because of funding cuts by Oxfordshire County Council. Earlier services to Thame, Wallingford and Reading have been discontinued. The only remaining service is the Thames Travel route T1 between Chinnor and Oxford, calling at Watlington, although services only extend to Oxford city centre at peak times, otherwise terminating at Cowley. There are no evening or Sunday bus services. In 1872 the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway was opened. Its Watlington terminus is in fact in Pyrton parish, from Watlington. In 1883 the Great Western Railway took over control of the line. In 1957 British Railways closed Watlington station and withdrew all passenger services between Watlington and , which was still being used by the local Chinnor Cement Works. In 1961 BR withdrew all services from the line, the track was lifted and the line left abandoned. Watlington railway station site remains, as does the station building, the corrugated iron carriage shed, and the brickwork of the goods shed.

The Synchronistic HistorySynchronistic History, ii 1–13. has a lengthy passage concerning his conflicts with Nebuchadnezzar I. Initially they established an amicable relationship. However the Babylonian king subsequently besieged the Assyrian fortress of Zanqi and when Aššur-rēša-iši approached with his relief force, Nebuchadnezzar I torched his siege engines (nēpešū) to prevent their capture and withdrew. On a second campaign, he laid siege to the fortress of Idi and the arrival of the Assyrian army resulted in a pitched battle in which he “brought about his total defeat, slaughtered his troops and carried off his camp. Forty of his chariots with harness were taken away and Karaštu, Nebuchadnezzar I's field-marshal, was captured.” The later king Šulmānu- ašarēdu III credited him with rebuilding the city wall of Assur in his own rededication. His own brick inscriptions from the same city identify him as builder of the temple of the gods Adad and An, Ištar of Assyria and Aššur. He built a palace in Bumariyah, ancient Apqu ša Adad, as witnessed by a baked brick inscription. n. 120 His most significant construction efforts were witnessed at his capital, Nineveh, the location of his palace, the Egalšaḫulla (“The Palace of Joyfulness”), where he rebuilt the tower-gates of the temple of Ishtar which had been damaged by earthquakes during the earlier reigns of Šulmānu-ašarēdu I (c. 1274–1245 BC) and Aššur-dān I (c. 1179 to 1134 BC), the latter being his grandfather. These were flanked by monumental statues of lions. His palace edict concerning men fraternizing with palace women gives the penalty of execution, with silent witnesses considered a party to the event and punished by being thrown into an oven. The sequence of limmu officials in the eponym dating system is not known, as column 2 of the only extant list is damaged at this point. He was succeeded by his son, Tukultī- apil-Ešarra I.

His flute solo on the band's 1967 hit single \\"Nights in White Satin\\" is regarded as one of progressive rock's defining moments. In 2018, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Moody Blues. Career =Early years= Thomas was born at an emergency maternity unit set up during World War II in Lickhill Manor, Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, England. His father's family was from the southwest corner of Wales. His grandfather was a Welsh miner and went on to become a carpenter and a wood-carver, later working on the church where Thomas would get married. At the age of 9 his father taught him to play harmonica, and this sparked his interest in music. He joined the school choir a year later. He quit schooling at the age of 14, and briefly left music to work as a toolmaking trainee at Lemarks. By the age of 16 he had embarked on a search for a music band, and within two years had left his trade to pursue a career in music. In the 1960s, Thomas joined the Birmingham Youth Choir then began singing with various Birmingham blues and soul groups including The Saints and Sinners and The Ramblers. He was inspired to learn the flute from a grandfather who played the instrument. Taking up the harmonica he started a band, El Riot and the Rebels, with bassist John Lodge. After a couple of years their friend Mike Pinder joined as keyboardist. On Easter Monday 1963 the band opened for The Beatles at the Bridge Hotel, Tenbury Wells.Brian Viner,. Independent.co.uk. 2 May 2003 Thomas and Pinder were later in a band called Krew Cats, formed in 1963, who played in Hamburg and at other music venues in northern Germany. =The Moody Blues= Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas rehearsing (1969) Thomas and Pinder then recruited guitarist Denny Laine, drummer Graeme Edge, and bassist Clint Warwick to form a new, blues-based band, The Moody Blues. Signed to Decca Records, their first album, The Magnificent Moodies, yielded a No. 1 UK hit (No. 10 in the US) with \\"Go Now\\". Thomas sang lead vocals on George and Ira Gershwin's \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" from the musical Porgy and Bess. He shared lead vocals with Laine on \\"23rd Psalm\\" which was recorded in 1964Booklet with The Magnificent Moodies (2014 re-release), page 4 but remained unreleased until 2014. His flute featured on three songs on the album—\\"Something You Got\\", \\"I've Got a Dream\\", and \\"Let Me Go\\"—as well as the single \\"From the Bottom of My Heart\\", after he had more or less pushed himself to learn playing.

We're waiting to see Brian Epstein to talk things over with him.\\" Ray Thomas, as quoted by Record Mirror, 8 October 1966: he was briefly replaced by Rod Clark. Thomas then suggested his and Pinder's old bandmate John Lodge as a permanent replacement and also recruited Justin Hayward to replace Laine. With this line-up the band released seven successful albums between 1967 and 1972, and became known for their pioneering orchestral sound. Although they initially tried to continue singing R&B; covers and novelty tunes, they were confronted over this by an audience member, and with their finances deteriorating they made a conscious decision to focus only on their own original material. Following the lead of Pinder, Hayward, and Lodge, Thomas also started writing songs. The first he contributed to the group's repertoire were \\"Another Morning\\" and \\"Twilight Time\\" on the 1967 Days of Future Passed. The album is regarded as a prog rock landmark, and Thomas's flute solo on the single \\"Nights in White Satin\\" one of its defining moments. His flute would become an integral part of the band's music, even as Pinder started to use the mellotron keyboard. Thomas has stated that a number of his compositions on the band's earlier albums were made in a studio broom closet, with himself writing songs on a glockenspiel. Hayward has spoken of Thomas's learning transcendental meditation in 1967, along with other members of the group. In a 2015 interview Thomas said that he and Pinder had contributed backing vocals to the song \\"I Am the Walrus\\" by the Beatles, as well as providing harmonicas for \\"The Fool on the Hill\\". Thomas and Pinder both acted as the band's onstage MCs, as heard on the live album Caught Live + 5 and seen in the Live at the Isle of Wight Festival DVD. Thomas started to become a more prolific writer for the group, penning songs such as \\"Legend of a Mind\\"—an ode to LSD guru and friend of the band, Timothy Leary, and a popular live favourite—and \\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume\\" for In Search of the Lost Chord, \\"Dear Diary\\" and \\"Lazy Day\\" for On the Threshold of a Dream as well as co-writing \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\\" with Hayward. The Moody Blues formed their own record label Threshold Records, distributed by Decca in the UK and London in the US, and their first album on the Threshold imprint was To Our Children's Children's Children, a 1969 concept album about eternal life. Thomas wrote and sang lead vocal on \\"Floating\\" and \\"Eternity Road\\". When the band began to realize that their method of heavy overdubbing in the studio made most of the songs very difficult to reproduce in concert, they decided to use a more stripped-down sound on their next album A Question of Balance, to be able to play as many songs live as possible. It was their second UK No. 1 album. Thomas wrote and sang \\"And the Tide Rushes In\\", reportedly written after having a row with his wife, and was credited with co-writing the album's final track \\"The Balance\\" with Edge, while Pinder recited the story. The Moodies went back to their symphonic sound and heavy overdubbing with Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, their third UK No. 1 album, and Thomas wrote and sang \\"Our Guessing Game\\" and \\"Nice to Be Here\\", also singing a co-lead vocal with Pinder, Hayward and Lodge on Edge's \\"After You Came\\". All five members wrote \\"Procession\\". The final album of the 'core seven' was Seventh Sojourn, their first album to reach No. 1 in the USA. By this time, Pinder had replaced his mellotron with the chamberlin, which produced orchestral sounds more realistically and easily than the mellotron. Thomas wrote and sang \\"For My Lady\\". =Band hiatus and reformation= Thomas released the albums From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976) after the band temporarily broke up in 1974. During this period he earned his nickname 'The Flute'. Within the band he was also known as 'Tomo' (pronounced tOm-O). The band reformed in 1977 for Octave, which was released in 1978. Thomas provided the songs \\"Under Moonshine\\" and \\"I'm Your Man\\", and the group continued to release albums throughout the 1980s, with Thomas's \\"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\\" and \\"Painted Smile\\" being featured on the album Long Distance Voyager. The former song has often been regarded as a theme song for the band itself as a whole and for Thomas in particular, and it again features his use of the harmonica. After contributing \\"Sorry\\" and \\"I Am\\" (both on the 1983 album The Present) Thomas temporarily stopped writing new songs for the band, for reasons unknown. He took featured lead vocal on Graeme Edge's song \\"Going Nowhere\\" (on The Present). =Diminishing role and declining health= During the group's synth-pop era, Thomas's role in the recording studio diminished, partially due to the synth-pop music being unsuitable for his flute and partially because he was unwell. Despite contributing backing vocals on The Other Side of Life and Sur la Mer, he took no lead vocal role and it is unclear how much, if any, instrumentation he recorded for these two albums; but in any case, none of his instrumentation or vocals ended up on Sur la Mer. Although he is included in the childhood photos depicted on the album's inner sleeve and is given an overall 'group credit', he is not given a performing band credit. Patrick Moraz, who had replaced Pinder as the band's keyboardist, objected to Thomas's exclusion from the album and pushed for the band to return to the deeper sound that they had achieved with Pinder. Thomas is credited with tambourine, harmonica or saxophone on The Other Side of Life, but it is unknown how many, if any, instrumental contributions of his ended up on the released version of the album, and at this point he was largely relegated to the role of a backup singer. =Resilience and final years in the band= On The Moody Blues' 1991 release Keys of the Kingdom, Thomas played a substantial role in the studio for the first time since 1983, writing \\"Celtic Sonant\\" and co-writing \\"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\\" with Justin Hayward. He contributed his first ambient flute piece in eight years; however, his health declined and his last album with the group was Strange Times to which he contributed his final composition for the group \\"My Little Lovely\\". He also provided a co-lead vocal with Hayward and Lodge on their song \\"Sooner or Later (Walking On Air)\\". Thomas permanently retired at the end of 2002. In a 2014 interview with Pollstar.com, drummer Graeme Edge stated that Thomas had retired due to illness. He had been suffering from cerebellar ataxia, which affected his balance and made performing impossible. The Moody Blues – consisting only of Hayward, Lodge and Edge (Edge being the only remaining original member) plus four long-serving touring band members, including Gordon Marshall on percussion and Norda Mullen who took over Thomas's flute parts – have released one studio album, December, since his departure from the band. =Final years and prostate cancer diagnosis= In July 2009 it became known that Thomas had written at least two of his songs– \\"Adam and I\\" and \\"My Little Lovely\\"– for his son and his grandson Robert, respectively. It was also revealed that he had married again, to his longtime girlfriend Lee Lightle, in a ceremony at the Church of the Holy Cross in Mwnt, Ceredigion Wales, on 9 July 2009. Thomas released his two solo albums, remastered, in a boxset on 24 September 2010. The set includes, with the two albums, a remastered quad version of \\"From Mighty Oaks\\", a new song \\"The Trouble With Memories\\", a previously unseen promo video of \\"High Above My Head\\" and an interview conducted by fellow Moody Blues founder Mike Pinder. The boxset was released through Esoteric Recordings/Cherry Red Records. In October 2014, Thomas posted this statement on his website: > After the tragic death of Alvin Stardust and the brave response to Prostate > Awareness by his widow, Julie, in following up on what Alvin had intended to > say about the disease, I have decided to help in some small way.

In later years Thomas resumed flute playing with other musicians, one instance of which was for the song \\"L´urlo nelle ossa\\", on the 2016 album Eros & Thanatos by Italian band Syndone. He also played flute on the track \\"Simply Magic\\" on John Lodge's 2015 album 10,000 Light Years Ago and recorded with Moody Bluegrass. Death Thomas died on 4 January 2018, six days after his 76th birthday, at his home in Surrey. The official announcement, made by his record company, did not give any cause. Fellow band member Lodge said, \\"Ray was my best pal. I met Ray when I was 14. We were two young kids from Birmingham who were reaching for the stars — and I think we got there. I'm really pleased that Ray was around to know we'd be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I spoke to Ray just before Christmas — because his birthday was after Christmas, on the 29th — and we had a long conversation. We're very close friends — or were very close friends. Very sad. Very, very sad.\\" Thomas was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Moody Blues, in April 2018. Instruments Although he most commonly played flute, Thomas was a multi-instrumentalist, who also played piccolo, oboe, harmonica, saxophone, and, on the album In Search of the Lost Chord, the French horn. He frequently played tambourine and also shook maracas during the group's R&B; phase. The 1972 video for \\"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\\" features Thomas playing the baritone saxophone, although Pinder says on his website that this was just for effect in the video and that Thomas did not play saxophone on the recording.Pinder, as stated on his website Compositions =The Moody Blues= * 1967: \\"Another Morning\\" from Days of Future Passed * 1967: \\"Twilight Time\\" from Days of Future Passed * 1968: \\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume\\" from In Search of the Lost Chord * 1968: \\"Legend of a Mind\\" from In Search of the Lost Chord * 1968: \\"Visions of Paradise\\" (with Justin Hayward) from In Search of the Lost Chord * 1969: \\"Dear Diary\\" from On the Threshold of a Dream * 1969: \\"Lazy Day\\" from On the Threshold of a Dream * 1969: \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\\" (with Justin Hayward) from On the Threshold of a Dream * 1969: \\"Floating\\" from To Our Children's Children's Children * 1969: \\"Eternity Road\\" from To Our Children's Children's Children * 1969: \\"Watching and Waiting\\" (with Justin Hayward) from To Our Children's Children's Children * 1970: \\"And the Tide Rushes In\\" from A Question of Balance * 1970: \\"The Balance\\" (with Graeme Edge) from A Question of Balance * 1971: \\"Procession\\" (with Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Mike Pinder, and Graeme Edge) from Every Good Boy Deserves Favour * 1971: \\"Our Guessing Game\\" from Every Good Boy Deserves Favour * 1971: \\"Nice to Be Here\\" from Every Good Boy Deserves Favour * 1971: \\"The Dreamer\\" (with Justin Hayward): an out-take now added to the Every Good Boy Deserves Favour CD * 1972: \\"For My Lady\\" from Seventh Sojourn * 1978: \\"Under Moonshine\\" from Octave * 1978: \\"I'm Your Man\\" from Octave * 1981: \\"Painted Smile\\" from Long Distance Voyager * 1981: \\"Reflective Smile\\" from Long Distance Voyager * 1981: \\"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\\" from Long Distance Voyager * 1983: \\"I Am\\" from The Present * 1983: \\"Sorry\\" from The Present * 1983: \\"Burning Gas, Smoking Grass\\" unfinished song from \\"The Present\\" sessions * 1991: \\"Celtic Sonant\\" from Keys of the Kingdom * 1991: \\"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\\" (with Justin Hayward) from Keys of the Kingdom * 1999: \\"My Little Lovely\\" from Strange Times =Solo= * 1975: \\"From Mighty Oaks\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"Hey Mama Life\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"Play It Again\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"Rock A Bye Baby Blues\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"High Above My Head\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"Love Is The Key\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"You Make Me Feel Alright\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"Adam And I\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1975: \\"I Wish We Could Fly\\" from From Mighty Oaks * 1976: \\"In Your Song\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Friends\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"We Need Love\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Within Your Eyes\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"One Night Stand\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Keep On Searching\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Didn't I\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Migration\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"Carousel\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 1976: \\"The Last Dream\\" from Hopes, Wishes and Dreams * 2010: \\"The Trouble With Memories\\" (with Bias Boshell) from From Mighty Oaks/Hopes, Wishes and Dreams box set References External links *Official Ray Thomas website *Ray Thomas – The Moody Blues 2015 interview with thestrangebrew.co.uk *Exclusive Interview with Moody Blues Legend Ray Thomas 2015 interview with classicrockhereandnow.com *Ray Thomas topic channel at YouTube 1941 births 2018 deaths British harmonica players British rhythm and blues boom musicians English baritones English flautists English male singers English multi-instrumentalists English rock flautists English rock saxophonists British male saxophonists English singer- songwriters Maracas players Musicians from Worcestershire People from Stourport-on-Severn Tambourine players The Moody Blues members Transcendental Meditation practitioners English rhythm and blues musicians English rhythm and blues singers English people of Welsh descent Rock oboists English oboists ","title":"Ray Thomas"},{"id":"2834359","text":"Mutakkil-Nusku, inscribed mmu-ta/tak-kil-dPA.KU, \\"he whom Nusku endows with confidence,\\" was king of Assyria briefly c. 1133 BC, during a period of political decline. He reigned sufficiently long to be the recipient of a letter or letters from the Babylonian king, presumed to be Ninurta-nādin-šumi, in which he was lambasted and derided. Biography He was a younger son of the long-reigning king, Aššur-dān I (c. 1179 to 1134 BC) and succeeded his brother Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur, whom he ousted in a coup and subsequently went on to fight in a civil war that seems to have pitched the Assyrian heartland against its provinces. He appears on the Khorsabad KinglistKhorsabad Kinglist, iii 35–36. which relates that “Mutakkil-Nusku, his (Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur’s) brother, fought against him. He drove him to Karduniaš (Babylonia).” Contemporary evidence suggests that Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur sought sanctuary in the border town of Sišil, where Mutakkil-Nusku’s forces engaged him in battle, the outcome of which is lost. The fragments of one or perhaps two Middle Assyrian letters exist,Tablet fragments BM 55498 and 55499, K 212+4448 (+) Sm 2116+BM 104727. from an unnamed Babylonian king, possibly Ninurta-nādin-šumi, to Mutakkil-Nusku, where he is told that \\"You should act according to your heart (ki libbika).” The text lambastes him for failing to keep an appointment, or a challenge, in Zaqqa and seems to confirm that Ninurta- tukultī-Aššur had reached exile in Babylonia. His victory was short-lived as ṭuppišu Mutakkil-Nusku kussâ ukta'il KUR-a e-mid, “(he) held the throne for ṭuppišu (his tablet), then died,” perhaps his inaugural year and part way into his first year only. One interpretation suggests this was while his father still nominally ruled. Apart from a brief economic text concerning 100 sheep of Mutakkil-Nusku, without a royal title, and his appearance in the genealogies of his descendants such as one of his sons, Aššur-rēša-iši I, there are no other extant inscriptions.

Life Born in Melle, Belgium, Guddorf completed studies in philology. In 1922, he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and from 1923 worked for several of the party's newspapers. After the Nazi party seized power in 1933, he began distributing articles against the régime under his alias. He was arrested in April 1934 and later sentenced to hard labour at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was held until 1939. After he was released from Sachsenhausen, Guddorf developed contacts with the Red Orchestra and introduced Eva-Maria Buch to the group.Cook, Bernard A. (2006).

He succeeded his father, the long- reigning Aššur-dān I, but the throne was very quickly usurped by his brother, Mutakkil-Nusku, and he was driven from Assur and sought refuge in the city of Sišil, on the Babylonian border, the scene of the final dénouement. Biography There is some conjecture that he may have ruled jointly with Aššur-dan I during Aššur-dan's declining years or perhaps shared some regnal duties as there is a significant archive of administrative textsSuch as tablet KAJ 188. concerning agricultural products, (from cities such as Arrapha), food distribution, and ritual offerings in the royal palace referencing him and his wife Rimeni on seals, one of which provides an early Assyrian chariot scene, but only three of these texts call him king. Among these there is a reference to the partial demolition of a number of buildings in Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, during his reign, and also a harem list. The Chronicle PChronicle P (ABC 22), iv 12–13 which names him mTukul-ti-Aššur, relates that during his reign, the statue of Marduk was returned to Babylon having languished in Assyria for sixty (?)-six years, something of an underestimate if the reading of this number is correct and a reconciliatory move likely to test his subjects' loyalty. The Assyrian King ListAssyrian Kinglist copies: Nassouhi, iii 43f, Khorsabad, iii 32f and SDAS iii 19f. relates that \\"Mutakkil-Nusku, his brother, fought with him (and) carried him off to Karduniaš. Mutakkil-Nusku held the throne for 'his tablet' (and then) passed away.\\"Khorsabad kinglist iii 34–36: mMu-tak-kil-dNusku aḫu-šú itti-šú i-duk a-na kurKar-du-ni-áš, e-bu- uk-šú ṭup-pi-šú mMu-tak-kil-dNusku giškussȗ, uk-ta-il šadâ e-mid. A fairly recently recovered sourceMs. A2. provides additional insight into these events. From it we learn Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur seems to have kept the loyalty of provincial regions, while the heartland of Assyria sided with Mutakkil- Nusku, fueling a civil war. Into this milieu comes fragmentsTablets BM 104727 (1913-5-12, 2) + Sm. 2116 and K. 212 + K. 4448. of one, or perhaps two letters, from a Babylonian king, tentatively identified as Ninurta-nādin-šumi, although his predecessor Itti-Marduk-balāṭu or his successor Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur I could also conceivably be the author, addressed to and lambasting Mutakkil- Nusku and threatening to reinstate Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur. His Babylonian contemporary is not certain and the Synchronistic KinglistSynchronistic King List ii 12 KAV 216 (tablet Ass 14616c). gives a counterpart whose name begins with, or contains, the theophoric element Marduk-, with other fragmentary copiesSynchronistic King List fragment KAV 10, 3 (tablet VAT 11261).Synchronistic King List fragment KAV 12, 1 (tablet VAT 11338). providing no further insight. The text of the letter(s) is poorly preserved, and difficult to interpret, but the Babylonian quotes the Assyrian in his description of his brother as ku-lu-'-ú la zi-ka-ru šu-ú, \\"a kulu'u, not a man,\\" where the term may mean a 'feminized castrato cultic performer'. The deadlock was apparently broken by the attack by Mutakkil-Nusku's forces on Ninurta-tukultī-Aššur's border stronghold of Sišil, after which both brothers disappeared from history, perhaps falling in their fratricidal battle - and Mutakkil-Nusku's son Aššur-reš-iši I assumed the throne.

Nephthytis Schott (Araceae) in Borneo: a new species and a new generic record for Malesia. Novon 4:365-368. They are herbaceous plants growing from a rhizome. The leaves are evergreen, light and dark green, 15–35 cm long, and are usually arrowhead-shaped, with three lobes. The leaf shape can vary depending on the age of the plant.  Cultivation  Some species are popular houseplants. If so, they must be kept away from any pets, as they are poisonous. When grown indoors as a decorative houseplant, it needs frequent watering to keep the soil moist. It prefers temperatures that are comfortable to humans, as with most plants. It functions well as a hanging or terrarium plant. The most common of its problems is root rot and can be avoided by providing adequate drainage. This can also be caused by allowing the plant to sit in water. As for other problems, scale insects can also affect it. If this happens, scrape them off and isolate the plant. For this kind of problem, pesticides and sprays do not always work as the shell of the insect protects it. If this becomes a severe problem, you will have to get rid of the plant. Also if this happens, make sure it is moved away from any other surrounding plants because the bugs could infect them as well. Other than that, this plant is very easy to take care of and thus, it is good for beginners. Propagation of Nephthytis is fairly easy as well. It can be propagated by layering and from cuttings. Certain Nephthytis species are poisonous to cats and dogs. Symptoms are oral irritation and vomiting. = Syngonium podophyllum = An unrelated American species, Syngonium podophyllum, commonly grown as a houseplant, was originally confused with the similar-looking Nephthytis. It still retains Nephthytis as a common name, though it was given its own genus in 1879.

Profile Zandar is the brother of Zartan and fraternal twin of Zarana.Hasbro Heroes Sourcebook #3 (August, 2017) Zandar excels at his specialty as a master of camouflage and covert movement as an infiltrator and assassin. Zandar has also used disguise in his repertoire and can disguise himself as anyone. He is a master of silent weapons, including harpoons, crossbows, Bowie knives and silenced handguns, and is capable of remaining motionless for long periods.

Like his sister, Zandar has naturally auburn hair. Zandar speaks between himself and his sister privately with shared, poetical language, echoing each other's words and ideas.G.I. Joe: vol. 2 #8 (September 2013) Zandar is deeply psychologically and emotionally attached to and dependent upon his twin, refusing to be separated from and loyal to her above all else. Zandar and his siblings grew up in a Catholic orphanage. He was small for his age and was bullied by other children. His older brother accidentally killed a boy for bullying young Zandar. As teenagers, the twins grew up on the streets of London rather than be separated to different foster homes. He and his sister searched out their brother and found themselves in the outback of Australia as members of the Dreadnok biker gang.

Cricket career A burly and upright right-handed opening batsman with little or no backlift, Scott started his cricketing career by scoring a century on first-class debut for Auckland versus Canterbury in 1937–38. He made his Test debut against Australia in the match arranged after the Second World War in March 1946 and was top scorer in the first innings with 14 out of a total of just 42. New Zealand totalled just 96 runs in the two completed innings. He was one of the more reliable batsmen on the New Zealand tour of England in 1949, and played in all four Tests. Though his top score in these games was only 60, he and left-handed opening partner Bert Sutcliffe gave the touring team a solid start in three matches, with partnerships of 122, 89 and 121. He later played in home Tests against England and the West Indies, reserving his best Test performance for his last game, when he made 84 out of New Zealand total of 160 in reply to the West Indies 546 for six wickets, a four-hour innings that took up enough time for bad light and rain to come to his side's rescue. In all, he played ten Tests for New Zealand. Scott played for Auckland from 1937–38 to 1952–53. He was a prolific scorer in Plunket Shield cricket, and in all first-class cricket averaged only just under 50 runs per innings. His highest score was 204 against Otago in 1947–48.

It consists of a hugely interconnected network of municipal (11,600 km), state (22,000 km) and federal (1,050 km) roads. More than 90% of the population is within 5 km of a paved road. It has also the largest number of two-, four- and six-lane highways in Latin America. According to the National Confederation of Transports, it is the best highway grid in the country, with 59.4% classified as excellent. The term used in Portuguese language for highway is rodovia, and for road is estrada. Management systems The responsibility for building, maintaining, expanding, managing and exploiting the state roads fall into the following categories: * DERSA Desenvolvimento Rodoviário S.A. A state-owned company, responsible for some state-built roads and highways, such as Rodovias Dom Pedro I, Carvalho Pinto, Ayrton Senna, etc. (see below for the names and specific information about highways); * DER Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem. A state department belonging to the State Secretary of Transportation; * Ministry of Transportation, responsible for the federal highways and roads crossing the state, such as Rodovias Presidente Dutra, Régis Bittencourt, Fernão Dias, etc.; * Municipalities, responsible for vicinal roads and roads within counties. * State concessions to private companies. Rodovia Dom Pedro I near Campinas, shows the current engineering standard of highways in São Paulo state. Washington Luís Highway near São Carlos, km 236 South. By the law nº 9.361, of July 5, 1996, the state government implemented a comprehensive program of privatization and public concession of highway infrastructure management and economic exploitation (Programa Estadual de Desestatização - State Program of Desestatization), whereby most of the highways under the tutelage and built by the state began to be managed by private companies. In order to implement the Program, the highway grid was subdivided into 12 sections, with a total of 3,500 km, interconnecting 198 counties with a population of approximately 20 million inhabitants (54% of the state's population). The following 12 companies were contracted under a public bidding system: * AutoBan * Autovias * Centrovias * Colinas * Ecovias * Intervias * Renovias * SPVias * Tebe * Triângulo do Sol * Viaoeste Until August 2005, these companies had invested R$ 6 billion (approximately US$ 2,5 billion) and generated a revenue of R$ 2 billion for the state. The concessions led also to the duplication (double laning) of more than 480 km and the construction of 110 new roads. All conceded highways are equipped with fixed emergency phones every 1 km, horizontal and vertical signalling equipment, surveillance cameras, and round-the-clock, free-of- charge mechanical and emergency relief vehicles. which make São Paulo highways the most sophisticated and with the highest safety and service standards of Latin America. Typical DERSA toll gates at the Rodovia Dom Pedro I All conceded roads, including those managed by DERSA, are toll roads, in order to pay for the services and investments. Roads managed by the state (DER) are generally not tolled. Toll collection is made in toll gates spaced along the road. Sometimes tolling occur only in one direction of the road, in other cases, in both directions. Toll pricing is set by the State Secretary of Transportation and vary from US$ 1 to US$ 4. The entire São Paulo system of highways (16 in the total) use a unified non-stop electronic toll collection named \\"Sem Parar\\", based on RFID tags glued to the vehicle windshield, which comprises about 34% of the traffic through these roads. The system has 560,000 of these tags installed and generates 11 million of electronic transactions and revenues of ca. R$ 120 million (approximately US$ 52 million) per month. Naming and numbering system Within São Paulo, numbering of highways works as follows, starting with letters SP: *even numbers - indicates that the highway is radial, that is, connects the state capital to the interior. The number of the highway gives the clockwise angle that it makes with an imaginary line stemming from the state capital and extending northward. Thus SP-270 (Rodovia Raposo Tavares) starts in São Paulo and extends westward (thus a 270-degree clockwise angle with the imaginary north-extending line). Example: Rodovia Anhangüera, SP-330. *odd numbers - indicates that the highway connects two or more places away from the capital. The number gives the distance, in km, between the capital and the nearest point of the highway. Thus, SP-425 (Rodovia Assis Chateubriand) connects two cities away from the capital, and its nearest point is distant 425 km from the state capital. It is customary in Brazil, and particularly in São Paulo, to give also official names to the highways and roads, usually to pay homage to some politician, significant personality, national hero, etc., or to some symbolic or collective concept.

His reign is immensely significant to the Chronology of the ancient Near East as it overlaps the reigns of his Babylonian contemporaries Adad-šuma-uṣur and Meli-Šipak. Biography There is some dispute as to how long he reigned, based on discrepancies among various copies of the Assyrian King List. The Nassouhi King List,Nassouhi King List = Assyrian King List A sometimes considered to be older than the other versions of the King List we have, gives him 13 years of reign, but the other king lists give him only three. More recent scholarship has tended to support the shorter reign, in which case he reigned from 1182 to 1180 BC (alternately, he reigned from 1192 to 1180 BC). There are up to eleven possible limmu officials named for his regnal years and a recent publication proposes the following sequence: * Salmanu-zera-iqiša * Liptanu * Salmanu-šumu-lešir * Erib-Aššur * Marduk-aḫa- eriš * Pišqiya * Aššur-dan I * Atamar-den-Aššur * Aššur-bel-lite * Adad- mušabši As the seventh in the sequence is Ninurta-apal-Ekur's son and successor, Aššur-dan I, and the king was thought to occupy the limmu position in the first year of his ascendancy, it is suggested that the succession took place here. =His provenance= His father was Ilī-padâ,Assyrian King List, “Ninurta-apil-Ekur, son of Ila-Hadda, a descendant of Eriba-Adad, went to Karduniaš. He came up from Karduniaš, seized the throne and ruled for A13/B+C3 years.” who had followed his father, Aššur-iddin, and grandfather, Qibi-Aššur, as grand vizier, or sukkallu rabi’u, of Assyria and king of the dependant state of Ḫanigalbat. Qibi-Aššur may be one of three officials who are attested as limmu’s, the sons of Šamaš-aḫa-iddina, Ṣilli-Marduk, Ibašši-ili, respectively and it is this latter one, whose limmu year directly follows that of Tukulti-Ninurta I, that has led some to speculate that Ninurta-apal-Ekur was a descendant of Adad-nirari I, a genealogy that is unlikely as he claims descent only from Eriba-Adad I in his inscriptions. The earlier two have their limmu years during the reign of Shalmaneser I which better fits the chronology. =His ascendancy= The preceding Assyrian king, Enlil-kudurri- usur, a son of the earlier powerful king Tukulti-Ninurta I, was vanquished in battle against the Kassite monarch, Adad-šuma-uṣur, a defeat so ignoble that the Assyrian officers “seized [Enlil-kudu]r-usur their lord and gave (him) to Adad-šuma-uṣur.” Perhaps to secure their passage, the Assyrians also handed over renegade Babylonians who had fled to the Assyrian side. While these events were unfolding, “Ninurta-apal-Ekur went home. He mustered his numerous troops and marched to conquer Libbi-ali (the city of Aššur).”Synchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21), tablet B, column 2, lines 5 to 8. The Kings List tells us that he “came up from Karduniaš, seized the throne,” although it can only be speculated what he was doing in Karduniaš (Babylonia). The Synchronistic Chronicle continues “But [...] arrived unexpectedly, so he turned and went home” which suggests that the succession was not smooth. Ninurta-apil-Ekur is said to have \\"guarded all the people of Assyria, with wings like an eagle spread out over his country. He was the recipient of gifts from Meli-Šipak, who sent teams of horses and rugs, as a recently discovered text records, unearthed during excavations at Assur. =Palace decrees= He issued nine palace decrees relating to conduct of the court and the oppressive discipline of the royal harem, suggestive of insecurity in the succession, although he need not have worried as his descendants would continue to rule Assyria until at least the eighth century BC. The first relates to the conduct of a eunuch approaching the harem and that of the concubines. The second threatens the harem women with having their throats cut, if when quarreling they should blaspheme against a god. The third punished men guilty of lèse majesté and the remaining are too fragmentary to be certain of their contents, but regulate curses against, for example, the royal furniture, i.e. bed and stool. Minor infractions were dealt with severely, with the guilty woman having her nose pierced and being beaten with rods. A text records his gift of jewelry to his daughter Muballita[ṭ-...], the great high priestess.

He was brought up as a tenant farmer on Edgelaw Farm, a small community consisting of three families, and received early schooling at the local village school in Carrington, Midlothian, before going on to Melville College in Edinburgh. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in 1964 followed by a Doctor of Philosophy in 1967 from the University of Edinburgh the latter for research on natural gums in Acacias supervised by Edmund Langley Hirst and D M W Anderson. Career In 1967, he went to Queen's University (Canada) as a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow, and then, in 1970, to the University of Sheffield as an Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Research Fellow, before joining the academic staff as a lecturer in chemistry. In 1978, he was transferred to the ICI Corporate Laboratory where he first started investigating the mechanically interlocked molecules that would eventually become molecular machines. He was a Science Research Council Senior Visiting Fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1978. After spending a sabbatical (1978–81) at the ICI Corporate Laboratory in Runcorn, England, he returned to Sheffield where he was promoted to a Readership in 1982. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1980 for his research into stereochemistry beyond the molecule. In 1990, he moved to the Chair of Organic Chemistry at the University of Birmingham and was Head of the School of Chemistry there (1993–97) before moving to UCLA as the Saul Winstein Professor of Chemistry in 1997, succeeding Nobel laureate Donald Cram. In July 2002, he became the Acting Co-Director of the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI). In May 2003, he became the Fred Kavli Chair of NanoSystems Sciences and served from then through August 2007 as the Director of the CNSI. During 35 years, nearly 300 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers have been trained in his laboratories.

In 2017, Stoddart was appointed a part-time position at the University of New South Wales to establish his New Chemistry initiative at the UNSW School of Chemistry. In 2019, Sir Fraser Stoddart introduced a premium skin care brand called \\"Noble Panacea\\", which utilizes aspects of his work. Research Stoddart is one of only a few chemists of the past quarter century to pioneer a new field in organic chemistry. By establishing a new field where the main feature is mechanical bonds he has paved the way for molecular recognition, self-assembly processes for template-directed mechanically interlocked syntheses, molecular switches, and motor-molecules. These advances have formed the basis of the fields of nanoelectronic devices, nanoelectromechanical systems, and molecular machines. One of his major contributions to the development of mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures such as rotaxanes and catenanes has been the establishment of efficient synthetic protocols based on the binding of cyclobis(paraquat-p- phenylene) with electron-rich aromatic guests.J. F. Stoddart, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2009, 38, 1802–1820 His group reported the synthesis of an advanced mechanically interlocked molecular architecture called molecular Borromean rings through the use of dynamic covalent chemistry.K. S. Chichak, S. J. Cantrill, A. R. Pease, S.-H. Chiu, G. W. V. Cave, J. L. Atwood, J. F. Stoddart, Science, 2004, 304, 1308–1312 The efficient procedures developed to synthesize these molecular architectures has been applied to the construction of molecular switches that operate based on the movement of the various components with respect to one another. These interlocked molecules have potential uses as molecular sensors, actuators, amplifiers, and molecular switches, and can be controlled chemically, electrically, and optically. Stoddart has pioneered the use of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures to create nanomechanical systems. He has demonstrated that such devices can be fabricated using a combination of the bottom-up approach of molecular self-assembly and a top-down approach of lithography and microfabrication. =Presentation style= Stoddart's papers and other material are instantly recognizable due to a distinctive \\"cartoon\\"-style of representation he has developed since the late 1980s. A solid circle is often placed in the middle of the aromatic rings of the molecular structures he has reported, and different colors to highlight different parts of the molecules. Indeed, he was one of the first researchers to make extensive use of color in chemistry publications. The different colors usually correspond to the different parts of a cartoon representation of the molecule, but are also used to represent specific molecular properties (blue, for example, is used to represent electron-poor recognition units while red is used to represent the corresponding electron-rich recognition units). The distinctive coloring has led to coining the term 'little blue box' for cyclophane, an important π-acceptor used to synthesize mechanically bonded structures. Stoddart maintains this standardized color scheme across all of his publications and presentations, and his style has been adopted by other researchers reporting mechanically interlocked molecules based on his syntheses. =ISI ratings= Stoddart has an h-index of 130. He has published more than 1000 publications and holds at least ten patents. For the period from January 1997 to 31 August 2007, he was ranked by the Institute for Scientific Information as the third most cited chemist with a total of 14,038 citations from 304 papers at a frequency of 46.2 citations per paper. The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) predicted that Fraser Stoddart was a likely laureate of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with George M. Whitesides and Seiji Shinkai for their contributions to molecular self-assembly. However, the Prize eventually went to Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon. Awards and honors Stoddart was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the New Year's Honours December 2006, by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2007, he received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in recognition for his outstanding and pioneering work in molecular recognition and self-assembly, and the introduction of quick and efficient template-directed synthetic routes to mechanically interlocked molecular compounds, which have changed the way chemists think about molecular switches and machines. =Memberships= *2014 Membership, National Academy of Sciences, USA *2012 Fellowship, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, USA *2011 Honorary Fellowship, Royal Society of Chemistry, UK *2008 Honorary Fellowship, Royal Society of Edinburgh, UK *2006 Appointed Knight Bachelor by HM Queen Elizabeth II, UK *2006 Foreign membership, Science Division of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences *2005 Fellowship, American Association for the Advancement of Science, USA *1999 Fellowship, Academy of Natural Sciences (Leopoldina), Germany *1994 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, UK =Other awards and honours= *2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry *2016 Haworth Memorial Lectureship, Royal Society of Chemistry *2014 Centenary Prize Winner, Royal Society of Chemistry *2012 Distinguished Citizen Award, Illinois Saint Andrew Society, Chicago, USA *2010 Royal Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh presented by Duke of Edinburgh *2008 Davy Medal of the Royal Society of London *2008 American Chemical Society Arthur C.

Depending on the length of reign one gives to his successor, Ninurta-apal-Ekur, this would have been either from 1187 to 1183 BC or from 1197 to 1193 BC. The former dates are more common in recent studies. Biography Enlil-kudurri-usur was the son of Tukulti-Ninurta I. He succeeded his nephew, Ashur-nirari III’s brief reign and ruled for five years. Apart from king lists and chronicles, there are no other extant inscriptions of this king. The Synchronistic King ListSynchronistic King List, tablet excavation number Ass. 14616c (KAV 216), ii 6. identifies his Babylonian contemporary with Adad-šuma-uṣur, his eventual nemesis. In the Synchronistic History,Synchronistic History, ii 3–8. the battle between him and Adad-šuma-uṣur is given as a pretext for his Assyrian rival, Ninurta-apal- Ekur, a son of Ilī-padâ and descendant of Eriba-Adad I, to “come up from Karduniaš,” i.e. Babylonia, and make a play for the Assyrian throne. Grayson and others have speculated that this was with the tacit assistance of Adad- šuma-uṣur, but there is currently no published evidence to support this theory. Ninurta-apal-Ekur’s purpose for being in Babylonia is also unknown, whether a political refugee or an administrator of the Assyrian held portion. The Walker ChronicleWalker Chronicle, ABC 25, BM 27796, obverse lines 3 to 7. describes how following his abject defeat at Adad-šuma-uṣur’s hands, Enlil- kudurrī-uṣur was seized by his own officers and handed over to his opponent. Only after these events did Adad-šuma-uṣur go on to extend his territory to include the city of Babylon itself. Meanwhile, the Synchronistic History continues, Ninurta-apal-Ekur had “mustered his numerous troops and marched to conquer Libbi-ali (the city of Aššur). But [...] arrived unexpectedly, so he turned and went home.” As Grayson points out, this passage is open to various interpretations, only one of which is that the missing name could have been that of Enlil-kudurrī-uṣur, released by his captor to sow confusion amongst his northern foes.

She was also Duchess of Gandia, Montblanc, and Peñafiel, Countess of Foix, Bigorre, and Ribagorza, and Viscountess of Béarn.  Biography  Catherine was the younger daughter of Gaston of Foix, Prince of Viana, and Magdalena of Valois, the sister of Louis XI of France. She was born and raised during the reign of her paternal great-grandfather, King John II, who was succeeded by her grandmother Eleanor in 1479. Their father having already died, the crown of Navarre devolved upon Catherine's brother Francis Phoebus upon their grandmother's death the same year. =Reign= In 1483 the death of Francis made Catherine queen under the regency of their mother. Her uncle John of Foix, appealing to the Salic Law alien to the Kingdom of Navarre, claimed the throne and ignited a civil war (1483–1492) that reignited the old conflict of the Beaumont-Agramont parties. In 1484, hard pressed by ambitions over the throne of Navarre, Magdalena of Valois decided to marry 15-year-old Catherine to John of Albret, hailing from a noble family in western Gascony. This marriage was favored by many of Catherine's Iberian subjects and would have given Catherine much needed support in her fight against her uncle's claim. The wedding took place at the Notre Dâme Cathedral of Lescar in 1486, but the coronation of the young couple in Pamplona was deferred until 1494, after a fleeting peace treaty with Louis of Beaumont, Count of Lerín, and Catherine's granduncle, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, was signed. However, the marriage did not garner the sympathy of the Navarrese Beaumont party, always preferring Isabella I of Castile's and Ferdinand II of Aragon's offer to marry Catherine to their son John, Prince of Asturias, and even the Agramont party split. Catherine's mother Magdalena died in 1495. In 1504, she made her will, confirming her son Henry's right to succeed her and expressing her wish to be buried at the Cathedral of Pamplona--ultimately both she and John were interred in Lescar. The political alliance between the houses of Valois and Foix ahead of an impending Spanish invasion led to marriage negotiations between Catherine and Louis XII in 1512. It was suggested that Henry should marry a daughter of the French king. =1512 Castilian-Aragonese invasion= Orthez, a town where the Navarrese monarchs took shelter after 1512 Ferdinand, who had allied with the Pope against France, presented a set of claims to the legitimate royal family of Navarre. Catherine did not accept the demands, and Ferdinand sent Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, over to Pamplona, who occupied Pamplona on 25 July 1512. The Castilians went on to conquer St- Jean-Pied-de-Port (Donibane Garazi in Basque) after setting fire to Roncevaux, and wrought havoc across the merindad of Ultrapuertos (Lower Navarre). The Spanish troops would retain the southern half of that region intermittently for the next years. Catherine and John III, overwhelmed by the Castilian push, fled to Bearn, constituent part of their kingdom. They set their base in Pau, Orthez and Tarbes, where they alternately resided most of the time until their deaths. On 23 March 1513, the Cortes of Navarre reunited in Pamplona (Iruñea in Basque), greatly reduced to the pro-Spanish Beaumont party, and pledged allegiance to Ferdinand in exchange for his loyalty to the Navarrese laws. In 1515, Upper Navarre was annexed to the Crown of Castile as a different kingdom (aeque principalis), and it would be one constituent part of the Kingdom of the Spains, as Spain came to be known during the following period. =Later years= In 1516, two columns led by King John III and Pedro, Marshal of Navarre, crossed the Pyrenees south and attempted to reconquer Navarre but they failed to progress into the heartland of the kingdom. Devastated by the defeats undergone, John retreated to Monein, and died on 17 June 1516. Queen Catherine did not outlive her husband much longer, and died in her domain of Mont-de-Marsan on 12 February 1517, just a few months later. By then, she had given birth to 13 children (other sources point to 14). From 1512 to her death in 1517, Catherine was actual queen only in some areas of Basse-Navarre, or Lower Navarre, north of the Pyrenees, but her domains extended to the contiguous Principality of Bearn and other lands.

He served in both houses of the New Hampshire state legislature and was elected Governor of New Hampshire for two terms. Biography Badger was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. Educated at common school and at Gilmanton Academy, Badger worked after his school years to build a cotton cloth factory, a saw mill and a grist mill for his town. In 1804 Badger was made a trustee of Gilmanton Academy; he ultimately became president of the board for the school. Badger served as an aide to John Langdon (Governor four different times, including 1805 to 1809). In 1810, Badger was elected to the first of three consecutive terms as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives (1810–1812); then he served three terms in the New Hampshire Senate (1814–1817) where he served as President of the Senate in 1816–1817. Badger served as Associate Justice, Court of Common Pleas (1816–1820), and as High Sheriff of Strafford County, New Hampshire (1820–1830). He was a Presidential Elector in the national elections of 1824, 1836 and 1844. In 1834, Badger won the gubernatorial election, and he won the next term as well. As Governor, Badger called for eliminating capital punishment, a new idea for New Hampshire. He also had to deal with the breakaway Indian Stream Republic. Badger encouraged the legislature to support President Andrew Jackson's successful efforts to do away with the Second Bank of the United States (helping to bring on the Panic of 1837). Badger tried to inject new life into the state militia by statute; he also was interested in bringing smallpox prevention directly to the state's small farming towns.

Brief history The city was first noted in 1207. In November 1638 one side of the city was taken by Imperialist forces. The bridge across the Rhine was burned afterwards. Celebrations are planned for 2007 in cooperation with its Swiss counterpart. Laufenburg was one city until about 1800 when Napoleon divided the city, ordering that the Rhine should become the border. Ever since the two cities have been separated by nationality, but not in their minds. The city was well placed on major rapids of the Rhine, which allowed the town to collect taxes as well as catch salmon. In the early 20th century the rapids were demolished in order to build a hydroelectric power plant. The plant provided money, but the town lost a tourist attraction. In December 2004 a new bridge was opened to the east of the city. The old one had become too congested, because the roads connecting the bridge were single lane roads but were being used for two way traffic. This caused a fair amount of irritation among non-locals. With the opening of the new bridge a new shopping development was erected to the east of the town. The use of this development is questioned at times, because despite creating much needed jobs, the city lost some of its attractiveness and neighboring towns in Switzerland complained about some stores having to close down.

The history of the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century has classically been described as one of stagnation and reform. In analogy with 18th-century France, it is also known as the Ancien Régime or \\"Old Regime\\", contrasting with the \\"New Regime\\" of the Nizam-i Cedid and Tanzimat in the 19th century. The period characterized as one of decentralization in the Ottoman political system. Political and economic reforms enacted during the preceding War of the Holy League (1683-1699), particularly the sale of life-term tax farms () instituted in 1695, enabled provincial figures to achieve an unprecedented degree of influence in Ottoman politics. This decentralization had once led historians to believe that the Ottoman Empire was in decline during this period, part of the larger and now- debunked Ottoman Decline Thesis, but it is now recognized that the Ottomans were successfully able to tie emerging provincial elites politically and financially to the central government. The empire likewise experienced significant economic growth during much of the eighteenth century and was, until the disastrous war with Russia in 1768-74, also able to match its rivals in military strength. In light of this, the empire's history during this period is now generally viewed in more neutral terms, eschewing concepts such as 'decline' and 'stagnation'. The Old Regime was brought to an end not by a single dramatic event, but by the gradual process of reform begun by Sultan Selim III (r. 1789-1807), known as the Nizam-ı Cedid (New Order). Although Selim himself was deposed, his reforms were continued by his successors into the nineteenth century and utterly transformed the nature of the Ottoman Empire.  Malikāne  Of crucial importance for this period in Ottoman history was the institution of malikāne, or life-term tax farm. Tax farming had been used as a method of revenue-raising throughout the seventeenth century, but contracts only began to be sold on a life-term basis in 1695, as part of the empire's wartime fiscal reforms. According to the malikāne contract, individuals could compete in auction for the right of taxation over a given revenue source, the winner of which would agree to submit his promised amount to the government each year, as well as providing a lump sum up front equal to two to three times the annual amount. This system provided the Ottoman government with a much more stable source of revenue, and they enjoyed significant budget surpluses throughout much of the eighteenth century. However, the impact of malikāne extended far beyond its original economic and fiscal purpose. It facilitated a new style of government in the Ottoman Empire, which has been characterized as one of \\"decentralization\\". Malikāne contracts were split into shares and privately traded on an ever- expanding market, taking advantage of the growing economy of the early eighteenth century Ottoman Empire. These state assets were traded among numerous social groups, including but not limited to military and religious officials, rural gentry, urban notables, and janissaries. This provided provincial figures with new ways to interact with the Ottoman state. While in previous centuries a strict division between the military-administrative askeri class and the civilian reaya class had been at least theoretically enforced, the sale of malikāne enabled the latter group to take part in government administration. Provincial notables enjoyed the legitimacy they earned by tying themselves formally to the Ottoman state, while the Ottoman state benefited from its closer relationship with the notables, who were more effectively able to handle issues of local government and taxation. The institution of malikāne continued largely undisturbed until 1793, when Selim III began to phase it out as part of his general reform effort, known as the New Order (). As malikāne contracts expired they were transferred to the New Order treasury, and recontracted to individuals whom the state deemed reliable. This attempt at centralization was opposed by provincial figures who by then had a vested interest in the continuation of malikāne, and contributed to Selim III's overthrow in 1807. Malikāne contracts thus continued to be sold and traded until the 1840s, when they were finally eliminated as part of the empire's extensive reform effort, known as the Tanzimat.  Government  =Central administration= Over the course of the seventeenth century, the nature of the Ottoman Empire's government had transformed from a patrimonial system into one which was supported more by bureaucracy than by the personal authority of the sultan. The last effort of a militarily active sultan to personally control the entire government of the empire was undone in the 1703 rebellion known as the Edirne incident, in which Mustafa II was deposed. Major governmental offices were no longer located within the imperial palace, and exercised greater independent authority. By the 1790s the central bureaucracy had grown to number some 1,500-2,000 scribes, representing a significant increase over the 183 who were serving in 1593. High-ranking bureaucrats found their social mobility increased, and many of them went on to establish successful careers as provincial governors and even grand viziers, posts which in previous centuries were typically limited to men of military backgrounds. =Provincial administration= Ottoman rule in the provinces was predicated upon maintaining the loyalty of local interest groups. State authority was represented by the provincial governor (beylerbey) and the judge (kadı), the latter carrying out most of the day-to-day administration of the province. Representing local interests were figures known as \\"notables\\" (ayan). Ayan came from diverse backgrounds; what distinguished them was their entrenched local status. Unlike Ottoman state officials, they did not generally migrate from position to position across the empire, but established deep roots within a small geographical area. Ayan utilized patronage networks to wield significant influence within their local city or region, and their cooperation was essential in order for Ottoman provincial administration to function. During the eighteenth century, ayan were tied to the state through the aforementioned institution of malikāne. By purchasing malikāne, ayan were able to consolidate their control over their local region of influence, but were also linked to the state in a symbiotic relationship. Just as the Ottoman government relied on them to maintain order in the provinces, so too did they come to rely on the Ottoman government to provide them with legitimacy and continued access to malikāne revenues. Thus paradoxically, the Ottoman government both granted provincial figures a greater degree of autonomy than ever before, while also tying them more closely to the central state in a mutually beneficial relationship. The central government and provincial power- holders thus remained interdependent, and the latter did not seek independence from the Ottoman Empire. During the seventeenth century provincial governors had been appointed for unspecified periods of time, producing a significant degree of uncertainty among them with regard to security of office. By the eighteenth century, all governors were appointed for one-year tenures, at the end of which they were subject to review and potential re-appointment. Provincial government in the Ottoman Empire was reliant upon continued cooperation between the centrally-appointed governors and local ayan. The latter played a key role in tax collection, particularly during wartime, and met in regular councils with the provincial governors or their representatives (mütesellims). Frequently, mütesellims were chosen from among the local ayan, and some families acquired the office on a hereditary basis. Particularly powerful ayan families, such as the al-Azms of Damascus, were also able to acquire governorships. Particularly during the second half of the eighteenth century, the duties of provincial government were carried out in local councils. Although varying from region to region, major figures on such councils would include the local judge (kadı), the commander of the Janissaries, the commander of the fortress garrison (dizdar), and local ayan leaders. Meetings were held either in the residence of the kadı or the provincial governor's office. Military The Ottoman military was capable of matching those of its European rivals during the first half of the eighteenth century, * and there was no significant technological gap between them. However, following the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottomans remained at peace in Europe for nearly thirty years, missing out on the rapid improvements in military technology and organization associated with the Seven Years' War (1756-63), particularly the development of highly trained and disciplined regimental forces, innovations in the tactical deployment of small-caliber cannons, and the widespread use of socket bayonets as a counter to cavalry. Extended peace also resulted in a lack of practical experience among Ottoman commanders, in contrast with Russian generals such as Rumiantsev and Suvarov, whose abilities were honed during the Seven Years' War. Thus when war finally broke out with Russia in 1768 the Ottomans suffered devastating defeats, resulting in the loss of Crimea and the signing of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774.  Economy  The Ottoman economy experienced general expansion and growth during the first three quarters of the eighteenth century. The Ottoman budget grew dramatically, from 1 billion akçe in 1699 to 1.6 billion in 1748. In contrast with the previous century, the Ottomans enjoyed budget surpluses during most of these years. Istanbul's commercial infrastructure was significantly revamped and expanded during the eighteenth century, improvements which underpinned the empire's rapidly growing international trade. The Ottoman economy particularly benefited from the export of fine textiles, handmade yarns, and leather goods. Social and cultural life A coffeehouse in eighteenth-century Istanbul. The eighteenth century was a time of increasing consumption and sociability among the Ottoman elite. Dozens of palaces sprang up along the shores of the Bosphorus for the rich Ottoman grandees, who used their wealth to fund Istanbul's rapid expansion. Fountains were constructed across the city, providing fresh water for a growing urban population. In 1721 Sultan Ahmed III ordered the construction of a new summer palace near Kağıthane in Istanbul, to be named Saʾdabad (\\"Abode of Felicity\\"). Whereas Topkapı Palace enhanced the prestige of the Ottoman dynasty through seclusion, Saʾdabad was meant to serve as a stage for a much more visible and ostentatious sultanate, similar to the palace of Versailles in France. Coffeehouses played a major role in public life, not only by providing items of consumption for the common people, but also as places where people could come together on a relatively equal basis to discuss public affairs. While the seventeenth century had witnessed some degree of backlash against the spread of coffeehouses from the state, which was concerned with their socially subversive influence, and from the ultra- conservative religious movement of the Kadızadelis, during the eighteenth century there was no longer an effort to ban them entirely. Coffeehouse culture had become an established feature of the cities and towns of the Ottoman Empire, and now the state limited itself to surveillance measures in an effort to control the unruly groups which could gather in them. Socially, they became more stratified, with different venues emerging for those of varying social ranks. For Ottoman women, the most important venue for public sociability was the bathhouse (hamam). Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who visited an Edirne bathhouse in 1718, stated that the bathhouse played the same role for women that the coffeehouse played for men. Large numbers of women could meet on a regular basis, where they would have opportunities to discuss public affairs. In the early eighteenth century Istanbul's water supply was significantly upgraded, allowing the number of bathhouses to multiply across the city. Bathhouses were naturally segregated by gender, but also sometimes catered to particular social classes as well.  Intellectual life  The first Turkish-language printing press was established in Istanbul in 1727 by Ibrahim Müteferrika, a Hungarian convert to Islam. Both the imperial court and religious authorities recognized the value of the press, and thus approved of its use. Müteferrika's press was mainly used to disseminate historical, geographical, and linguistic works, but suffered due to low market demand for printed books in comparison with more prestigious manuscripts, eventually closing down in 1796-7.  Political history  = 1695–1703 Mustafa II = Although Mustafa II (1695–1703), last of campaigning sultans, won a few minor victories, he suffered a devastating loss in the Battle of Zenta by Prince Eugene of Savoy of Austria. By 1699, Ottoman Hungary had been conquered by the Austrians. The Treaty of Karlowitz was signed that year. By this treaty, Mustafa II ceded Hungary (see Ottoman Hungary) and Transylvania to Austria, Morea to the Venetian Republic and withdrew Ottoman forces from Polish Podolia. Also during this reign, Peter I of Russia (1682–1725) captured the Black Sea fortress of Azov from the Ottomans (1697). Mustafa was dethroned during the revolt named the Edirne event, which was preceded by a large-scale campaign in Georgia.Rifaat Ali Abou-El-Haj, \\"The Narcissism of Mustafa II (1695–1703): A Psychohistorical Study.\\" Studia Islamica (1974): 115–131. in JSTOR = 1703–1730 Ahmed III = Depiction of the festivities of 1720, celebrating the circumcision of the sons of Ahmed III. In 1710 Charles XII of Sweden convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under Baltacı Mehmet Pasha won a major victory at the Battle of Prut. In the subsequent treaty, Russia returned Azov to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering with the affairs of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth or Cossacks. Discontent at the leniency of these terms was so strong in Istanbul that it nearly brought on a renewal of the war. In 1715 Morea was taken from the Venetians. This led to hostilities with Austria, in which the Ottoman Empire had an unsuccessful outcome, and Belgrade fell into the hands of Austria in 1717. Through the mediation of England and the Netherlands the peace of Passarowitz was concluded in 1718, by which the Ottomans retained their conquests from the Venetians, but lost Banat. During the course of the Persian war the Ottomans made successive conquests with little resistance from Persian armies, though often impeded by the nature of the country and the fierce spirit of the native tribes. After a few years, however, the war became less favourable to Ottoman ambition. The celebrated Persian military leader Nadir Konli Khan (who afterwards reconquered and conquered states for himself), gained his first renown by exploits against the enemies of Shah Tahmasp. Most of Ahmet's reign was the sub period known as Tulip period. The period was marked by a high taste of architecture, literature and luxury as well as the first examples of industrial productions. But the social problems peaked and after the revolt of Patrona Halil Ahmet was dethroned. = 1730–1754 Mahmud I = The Ottoman Empire after concluding peace with Austria and Russia in 1739. The Ottomans successfully reconquered Belgrade, but ceded Azov to Russia. Although Mahmud was brought to the throne by the civil strife engendered by Patrona Halil, he did not espouse Halil's anti-reform agenda.Shaw, Stanford J. and Shaw, Ezel Kural (1976) History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, volume 1: Empire of the Gazis: the rise and decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1280–1808 Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, p. 240, In fact, much of his first year as sultan was spent in dealing with the reactionary forces unleashed by Halil. Eventually, on 24 November 1731, he was forced to execute Halil and his main followers, whereupon the rebellion ceased. The Nuruosmaniye Mosque in Istanbul, constructed between 1749 and 1755. Another war erupted between the Ottomans and Russia in May 1736. Russian forces captured Azov (1736) and Ochakov (1737), but failed to take Bender and suffered immense losses from disease and logistical challenges after unsuccessfully invading the Crimea in 1738. In 1737 Austria joined the war on the Russian side, but suffered disastrous defeats against the Ottomans, particularly in the Battle of Grocka. By 1739 the Ottomans had reconquered Belgrade, forcing the Austrians to make peace. Abandoned by their allies, Russia too sued for peace, abandoning all of their conquests except for Azov. The Persian wars saw Ottoman forces ranged against the military genius of Nadir Shah. The Ottomans managed to retain control of Baghdad, but Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia fell back within the Persian sphere of influence. = 1754–1757 Osman III = During Osman's reign there were several big fires in İstanbul, the capital. = 1757–1774 Mustafa III = Ever since the Patrona Halil rebellion had overthrown Ahmed III in 1730, the government had largely been dominated by the empire's Chief Black Eunuchs. Grand viziers served for very limited periods in office. This changed when Mustafa III came to the throne in 1757. The son of Ahmed III, Mustafa sought to revive his father's policy of close cooperation with the grand viziers. In November he appointed Koca Ragıp Pasha (1757-1763), one of the most capable statesmen of the century. = 1774–1789 Abdul Hamid I = In 1774 after a catastrophic war with Russia, the Ottomans were compelled to sign the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca.

Kaneko's technique involves the use of masking tape and colored slips, which he uses to cover free-standing ceramic forms and wall-hung pieces with graphic motifs and markings. He frequently favors the large oval plate as one of his sculptural formats, which serves as a canvas for arrangements of straight, curving, and spiraling lines, creating an interplay of abstract imagery on a three-dimensional surface. He also designed sets and costumes for opera performances: Opera Omaha's Madama Butterfly (2006) and a co production of the San Francisco Opera, Opera Omaha, Opera Carolina and the Washington National Opera, The Magic Flute (2012). His work is included in more than forty museum collections including the Hawaii State Art Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Arts and Design (New York City), the Museum of Nebraska Art, the Sheldon Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Scripps College, the Shigaraki Ceramics Museum (Shigaraki, Japan), and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.Chang, Gordon H., Mark Dean Johnson, Paul J.

Development The LS4, successor to the LS1 in the Standard Class, made its first flight in 1980. It is the fifth most produced non-military glider (after the Grunau Baby, Blaník, Schleicher K 8 trainers and Grob G102 Astir.) A total of 1,048 were built until Rolladen-Schneider entered receivership in 2003. Its long production run is comparable only to that of the Grob G102 Astir and the Schempp-Hirth Discus. The LS4 won the first two places in the Standard Class at the 1981 World Championships in Paderborn, West Germany, and the first six places (and twenty-one out of the first twenty-five) at the 1983 Worlds in Hobbs, New Mexico. It is still a favourite in handicapped competitions and as a club and recreational aircraft. This type consolidated Rolladen-Schneider's reputation for well rounded sailplanes that are both easy to fly and top performers. It is docile enough for beginners and its performance is only slightly below the latest standard class sailplanes. Given the continued interest in the type, the LS4 may be put back in production by the Slovenian manufacturer AMS-Flight. The LS4 was succeeded by the LS7. Design The design of the LS4 was influenced mainly by the experience Rolladen-Schneider had gained with the LS2 and LS3 flapped gliders. Wolf Lemke returned to a double-tapered wing planform, giving it a larger area comparatively to the LS1 and LS2, and enlarged all control surfaces: the ailerons were elongated and brought further inboard and the tailplane span was increased. The fuselage and vertical stabilizer were taken from the LS3 moulds. Other notable features of the design were the retractable landing gear, the centre of gravity tow release that retracts with landing gear, the heel-operated wheel brakes, the upper wing surface air brakes and the water ballast system with internal bags. =Structure= The structure is entirely glass-reinforced plastic mostly with synthetic foam cores. The exterior coating, as with most composite gliders, is gelcoat, which protects the load-bearing composite from humidity and UV- radiation, and is thick enough to allow wing profiling, which is done by hand during the finishing stages of manufacturing to achieve the smoothness required for extensive laminar flow. Variants ;LS4: The initial production version ;LS4-a:featured larger water ballast bags allowing for an additional of water to be carried in each wing.

He became an Australian citizen in 2005 and thus has dual nationality (his father was born in Australia in 1926). Biography Hough was born in Heswall (then in Cheshire) on the Wirral Peninsula, and grew up in Thelwall, where he began piano lessons at the age of five. His father, who was born in Australia, worked as a technical representative for British Steel before his death at the age of 54. At an early age, Hough was able to memorise about 100 nursery rhymes and, after much pleading, his parents agreed to buy a second-hand piano, for £5 from a local antique shop, for the home. At the age of 12 he suffered what he has described as a \\"mini-nervous breakdown\\", triggered by a mugging incident, which resulted in him taking almost a year off school. He studied at Chetham's School of Music, which he later described as \\"not a wonderful place while I was there\\", and at the Royal Northern College of Music. In 1978, he was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician of the Year Competition and won the piano section. In 1982, he won the Terence Judd Award in England. In 1983, he took first prize at the Naumburg International Piano Competition in New York City. Hough holds a master's degree from the Juilliard School where his studies were assisted by the receipt of the first ever Royal Philharmonic Society Julius Isserlis Scholarship for study abroad. He has studied with Heather Slade-Lipkin, Gordon Green, and Derrick Wyndham. A prominent soloist, he is also a composer and transcriber, and often includes his own works in his recitals. He has written over 30 published pieces. The premiere of his cello concerto, written for Steven Isserlis, took place in March 2007, and in the summer of the same year Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral performed masses he wrote for them. In 2009, his trio for piccolo, contrabassoon and piano ('Was mit den Traenen geschieht') was premiered at the Philharmonie in Berlin by members of the Berlin Philharmonic. His song cycles 'Herbstlieder' (2007) and 'Other Love Songs' (2010) and 'Dappled Things' (2016) were premiered by members of The Prince Consort. His 'Sonata for Piano (broken branches)' was premiered by himself at the Wigmore Hall in 2011. In 2012 the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and Symphonic Choir gave the world premiere of the orchestrated version of his Missa Mirabilis. This work was recorded in 2015 by the Colorado Symphony and Andrew Litton for Hyperion Records. He has written four sonatas for solo piano. He is an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he is a visiting Professor, a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, where he is the International Chair of piano studies, and an Honorary Fellow of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool in 2011. He became the first classical music performer to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2001, joining prominent writers and scientists who have made significant contributions in their fields. In 2009 he was named by The Economist and Intelligent Life magazines as one of twenty living polymaths. In 2010 he was named Instrumentalist of the Year at the prestigious Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards. He was a Governor of the Royal Ballet Companies (The Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Royal Ballet School). He is a patron of the charity The Nightingale Project, which takes music and art into hospitals and of Music in Prisons (Irene Taylor Trust). He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to music. He was made an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple in 2017. In 2018 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. From 2019 he will be a Visiting Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall at the University of Oxford for three years. He had a solo exhibition of his paintings at the Broadbent Gallery in London in October 2012. In October 2016 Hough was the guest for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His choices were Cortot's recording of Prélude No. 17 in A-flat by Chopin, Rachmaninoff's recording of \\"Liebesleid\\" by Kreisler, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin, \\"Kyrie eleison\\" from the Mass in B minor by Bach, \\"Lyric Suite for String Quartet\\" (3rd movement) by Berg, Sonata for cello and piano left hand (\\"Les adieux\\") by Stephen Hough, and \\"Bird Songs at Eventide\\" by Eric Coates. His favourite was \\"Proficiscere, anima Christiana (Go Forth)\\" from The Dream of Gerontius by Elgar. His book choice was a bilingual edition of Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu and his luxury item was a panama hat. He made a special request for a copy of the Tyndale Bible. Recordings He has recorded more than 60 CDs, one of his most notable being a set of the four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, recorded during live performances with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra under the baton of then music director Andrew Litton, which have been compared to the recordings by the composer himself. These recordings won him his seventh Gramophone Award as well as the Classical BRIT Critics Award. His recording of the five Saint- Saëns concertos won the Gramophone Record of the Year in 2001 and was later voted the Gold Disc, \\"winner of winners\\" in a poll commemorating 30 years of the award. His recording of the Complete Chopin Waltzes, won the Diapason d'Or de l'Année in 2011. He is also known for championing lesser-known composers generally considered to be outside the standard repertoire such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Xaver Scharwenka, York Bowen, and Federico Mompou. His own compositions can be heard on a CD called Broken Branches, from BIS Records and on the Prince Consort's CD Other Love Songs on Linn Records. His second Piano Sonata (notturno luminoso) appears on his CD In The Night, and his cello sonata on a recital disc with Steven Isserlis. The Colorado Symphony Orchestra recorded his Missa Mirablis with Andrew Litton conducting. His sequence 'Hallowed' for unaccompanied choir was recorded by Harry Christophers and The Sixteen on their CD 'Star of Heaven'. In July 2017 a CD was released on Pentatone-Oxingale Records for the inaugural opening of the Tippet Rise Festival, featuring a performance by Hough, Christopher O’Riley, and Matt Haimovitz, among others. Teaching and writing He is a visiting professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music in London and the International Chair of Piano Studies at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. He is also on the faculty of the Juilliard School in New York. Hough joined the Roman Catholic Church when he was 19. Twice in his life he considered becoming a priest, in particular joining the Franciscan Order. He has written about his homosexuality and its relationship with both his music-making and his religion. For some 15 years, following his Catholic vocation, he lived a life of celibacy. In 2007 he published The Bible as Prayer: a handbook for lectio divina. 'Nosing Around', his little book on perfume, was published in 2014 In 2018 Sylph Editions published his first novel 'The Final Retreat' which explores the inner world of a priest dealing with sex addiction and religious despair. His book ‘Rough Ideas: reflections on music and more’ is a collection of essays and short musings and was published by Faber & Faber in 2019, and by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2020. In 2008 he won the Sixth International Poetry Competition. Hough wrote a blog for five years (2010 to 2015) at the website of The Daily Telegraph. Australian connections Hough's father was born an only child at Mayfield, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1926. Before his first birthday his mother took him to England, settling in the North, and leaving her husband behind in Australia. The boy was always told his father had died, but in fact the father lived for a further 30 years, working in the steel industry at Newcastle. Hough's grandfather wrote Hough's father letters, none of which he ever received. Stephen Hough says his assumption of Australian citizenship was in part a tribute to his father, who wanted to return to the land of his birth but was never able to before his death in 1980 at the age of 54.Kathy Evans, \\"Ties that bind\\", The Age, 13 September 2014, Spectrum, p. 19 Selected discography *Hummel: Piano Concerto No. 3 in B minor, Op.89; Piano Concerto No. 2 in A minor, Op.85: English Chamber Orchestra (Chandos, 1987, CHAN 8507) *Stephen Hough: Liszt (Virgin Classics, 1988) *My Favorite Things: Virtuoso Encores (MusicMasters, 1988; re-released by Virgin Classics as The Piano Album 1, 1993, VC7595092) *Robert Schumann: Fantasie and Davidbündlertänze (Virgin Classics, 1989, VC90770-2) *The Piano Album 2 (Virgin Classics, 1993, VC7593042) *Benjamin Britten: Holiday Diary, the piano music, EMI *Xaver Scharwenka: Piano Concerto No. 4 in F minor and Emil von Sauer: Piano Concerto No.1 in E minor (City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster, Hyperion, 1994 CDA66790) *Piano Music by York Bowen (Hyperion, 1996) *Lowell Liebermann: Piano Concertos (Hyperion, 1997) *Piano Music by Federico Mompou (Hyperion, 1997) *Brahms: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, BBC Symphony Orchestra (Virgin Classics 1998) *New York Variations (Hyperion, 1998) *Stephen Hough's New Piano Album (Hyperion, 1999, CDA67043) *Saint-Saëns: The Complete Works for Piano and Orchestra, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (Hyperion, 2001) *Stephen Hough's English Piano Album (Hyperion, 2002) *Hummel: Piano Sonatas (Hyperion, 2003) *Rachmaninoff: Piano Concertos Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4; Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini; Andrew Litton/Dallas Symphony Orchestra (Hyperion CDA67501/2) *The Stephen Hough Piano Collection (Hyperion, 2005) *Liszt: Années de pèlerinage – \\"Première Année: Suisse\\", S. 160 (Hyperion, 2005) *Stephen Hough's Spanish Album, Hyperion CDA67565, 2005 *George Tsontakis: ''Man of Sorrows'' for piano & orchestra (Hyperion, 2007) Includes solo works by Schoenberg, Berg and Webern *Mozart Album (Hyperion, 2007) *Stephen Hough in Recital (2009) *Chopin: Late Masterpieces (Hyperion, 2010) *Tchaikovsky: Complete music for piano and orchestra (Hyperion, 2010) *Chopin: Complete Waltzes (Hyperion, 2011) *Franz Liszt & Edvard Grieg: Piano Concertos (Hyperion, 2011) *Stephen Hough: Broken Branches (BIS 2011) *Stephen Hough's French Album (Hyperion, CDA67890, 2012) *Brahms: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg (Hyperion, 2013 CDA67961) *Stephen Hough: In the Night – includes Robert Schumann's Carnaval and Hough's own Sonata No 2, 'Notturno luminoso' (Hyperion, CDA67996, 2014) *Edvard Grieg: Lyric Pieces (Hyperion, CDA68070, 2015) *Alexander Scriabin & Leoš Janáček: Sonatas & Poems (Hyperion, CDA67895, 2015) *Antonín Dvořák & Robert Schumann: Concertos City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra & Andris Nelsons *Stephen Hough's Dream Album (2018)(Hyperion, CDA68176, 2018) *Brahms: The Final Piano Pieces (2020)(Hyperion, CDA68116, 2020) References External links *Stephen Hough Official Website *Compositions at Official Website *Hyperion Website: includes audio samples *Interview with Stephen Hough, 3 July 1989 *Interview on The Next Track podcast British classical pianists Australian classical pianists Male classical pianists Naturalised citizens of Australia MacArthur Fellows Academics of the Royal Academy of Music Honorary Members of the Royal Academy of Music Commanders of the Order of the British Empire 1961 births British composers Converts to Roman Catholicism British Roman Catholics Living people LGBT musicians from England Juilliard School alumni People from Heswall Alumni of the Royal Northern College of Music Piano pedagogues LGBT composers LGBT classical musicians ","title":"Stephen Hough"},{"id":"2834593","text":"The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922) began with the Second Constitutional Era with the Young Turk Revolution. It restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and brought in multi-party politics with a two stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire's citizens to modernize the state's institutions and dissolve inter-communal tensions. Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire. Despite Ottoman military reforms, the Ottoman Army met with disastrous defeat in the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) and the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), resulting in the Ottomans being driven out of North Africa and nearly out of Europe. Continuous unrest was caused by the Ottoman counter-coup of 1909, which preceded the 31 March Incident (Restoration, 1909) and 1912 Ottoman coup d'état (Saviours) and the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état in the Empire up to World War I. The Ottoman entry into World War I in the Middle Eastern theatre ended with the partition of the Ottoman Empire's remaining territories under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, gave a nominal land and permitted the title Ottoman Caliphate (compared with Vatican; a sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Catholic Pope), not to be a further threat but just powerful enough to protect Britain from the Khilafat Movement. The occupation of Constantinople (Istanbul) along with the occupation of Smyrna (Izmir) mobilized the Turkish national movement which ultimately won the Turkish War of Independence. The formal abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate was performed by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 1 November 1922. The Sultan was declared persona non grata from the lands that the Ottoman Dynasty ruled since 1299.  Concepts  = Social conflicts = Europe became dominated by nation states with the rise of nationalism in Europe. The Ottoman Empire was a religious empire. The 19th century saw the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire which resulted in the establishment of an independent Greece in 1821, Serbia in 1835, and Bulgaria in 1877-1878. Many of the local Muslims in these countries died during the conflicts and massacres while others fled. Unlike the European nations, the Ottoman Empire made no attempt to integrate conquered peoples through cultural assimilation. The Porte had no official policy of converting the non-Muslims of the Balkans or Anatolia into Islam. Instead, Ottoman policy was to rule through the millet system, consisting of confessional communities for each religion. The Empire never integrated its conquests economically and therefore never established a binding link with its subjects. Between 1828 and 1908, the Empire tried to catch up with industrialization and a rapidly emerging world market by reforming state and society. Ottomanism, originating from Young Ottomans and inspired by Montesquieu, Rousseau and the French Revolution, promoted equality among the millets and stated that its subjects were equal before the law. Proponents of Ottomanism believed accepting all separate ethnicities and religions as Ottomans could solve social issues. Following the Tanzimat reforms, major changes were introduced into the structure of the Empire. The essence of the millet system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education and Ottoman conscription were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Michael Hechter argues that the rise of nationalism in the Ottomon Empire was the result of a backlash against Ottoman attempts to institute more direct and central forms of rule over populations which had previously had greater autonomy. = Economic issues = Ottoman Loan certificate, 1933; printed in French The Capitulations were the main discussion during the period. It was believed incoming foreign assistance with capitulation could benefit the Empire. Ottoman officials, representing different jurisdictions, sought bribes at every opportunity and withheld the proceeds of a vicious and discriminatory tax system, which ruined every struggling industry by the graft, and fought against every show of independence on the part of Empire's many subject peoples. The Ottoman public debt was part of a larger scheme of political control, through which the commercial interests of the world had sought to gain advantages that may not have been of the Empire's interest. The debt was administered by the Ottoman Public Debt Administration and its power was extended to the Imperial Ottoman Bank (or Central bank). The total pre-World War debt of Empire was $716,000,000. France had 60 percent of the total. Germany has 20 percent. The United Kingdom owned 15 percent. The Ottoman Debt Administration controlled many of the important revenues of the Empire. The Council had power over financial affairs; its control even extended to determine the tax on livestock in the districts.  The Second Constitutional Era 1908–1920  Public demonstration during Young Turk Revolution in the Sultanahmet district of Constantinople, 1908 =1908 Abdul Hamid= Sultan Abdul Hamid established the constitutional monarchy in 1876 during what is known as the First Constitutional Era. This system was abolished two years later in 1878.  Young Turk Revolution  In July 1908, the Young Turk Revolution changed the political structure of the Empire. The Young Turks rebelled against the absolute rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II to establish the Second Constitutional Era. On 24 July 1908, Sultan Abdul Hamid II capitulated from his post and restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876. The revolution created multi-party democracy. Once underground, the Young Turk movement declared its parties. Among them \\"Committee of Union and Progress\\" (CUP), and \\"Freedom and Accord Party\\" also known as the Liberal Union or Liberal Entente (LU). There were smaller parties such as Ottoman Socialist Party and ethnic parties which included People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section), Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs, Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party in Palestine (Poale Zion), Al-Fatat (also known as the Young Arab Society; Jam’iyat al-'Arabiya al-Fatat), Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization, and Armenians were organized under the Armenakan, Hunchakian and Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF/Dashnak). At the onset, there was a desire to remain unified, and the competing groups wished to maintain a common country. The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation collaborated with the members of the \\"CUP\\", and Greeks and Bulgarians joined under the second biggest party, the \\"LU\\". The Bulgarian federalist wing welcomed the revolution, and they later joined mainstream politics as the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). The former centralists of the IMRO formed the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs, and, like the PFP, they participated in 1908 Ottoman general election.  New Parliament  1908 Ottoman general election was preceded by political campaigns. In the summer of 1908, a variety of political proposals were put forward by the CUP. The CUP stated in its election manifesto that it sought to modernize the state by reforming finance and education, promoting public works and agriculture, and the principles of equality and justice. Regarding nationalism, (Armenian, Kurd, Turkic..) the CUP identified the Turks as the \\"dominant nation\\" around which the empire should be organized, not unlike the position of Germans in Austria-Hungary. According to Reynolds, only a small minority in the Empire occupied themselves with Pan-Turkism. 1908 Ottoman general election held in October and November 1908. CUP-sponsored candidates were opposed by the LU. The latter became a centre for those opposing the CUP. Sabaheddin Bey, who returned from his long exile, believed that in non-homogeneous provinces a decentralized government was best. LU was poorly organized in the provinces, and failed to convince minority candidates to contest the election under LU banner; it also failed to tap into the continuing support for the old regime in less developed areas. During September 1908, the important Hejaz Railway opened, construction of which had started in 1900. Ottoman rule was firmly re- established in Hejaz and Yemen with the railroad from Damascus to Medina. Historically, Arabia's interior was mostly controlled by playing one tribal group off against another. As the railroad finished, opposing Wahhabi Islamic fundamentalists reasserted themselves under the political leadership of Abdul al-Aziz Ibn Saud. Christian communities of the Balkans felt that the CUP no longer represented their aspirations. They had heard the CUP's arguments before, under the Tanzimat reforms: The system became multi-headed, with old and new structures coexisting, until the CUP took full control of the government in 1913 and, under the chaos of change, power was exercised without accountability.  Annexations  The de jure Bulgarian Declaration of Independence on from the Empire was proclaimed in the old capital of Tarnovo by Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria, who afterwards took the title \\"Tsar\\". The Bosnian crisis on 6 October 1908 erupted when Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, territories formally within the sovereignty of the Empire. This unilateral action was timed to coincide with Bulgaria's declaration of independence (5 October) from the Empire. The Ottoman Empire protested Bulgaria's declaration with more vigour than the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which it had no practical prospects of governing. A boycott of Austro-Hungarian goods and shops occurred, inflicting commercial losses of over 100,000,000 kronen on Austria-Hungary. Austria- Hungary agreed to pay the Ottomans ₤2.2 million for the public land in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Bulgarian independence could not be reversed. Just after the revolution in 1908, the Cretan deputies declared union with Greece, taking advantage of the revolution as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island. 1908 ended with the issue still unresolved between the Empire and the Cretans. In 1909, after the parliament elected its governing structure (first cabinet), the CUP majority decided that if order was maintained and the rights of Muslims were respected, the issue would be solved with negotiations.  CUP Government  The Senate of the Ottoman Empire was opened by the Sultan on 17 December 1908. The new year brought the results of 1908 elections. Chamber of Deputies gathered on 30 January 1909. CUP needed a strategy to realize their Ottomanist ideals. The task of stopping the collapse of the Empire became the majority seat holder CUP's burden. However, the new system may have arrived too late to have any impact. The Empire was already in constant conflict and only four years remained before the Great War ignited. In 1909, public order laws and police were unable to maintain order; protesters were prepared to risk reprisals to express their grievances. In the three months following the inauguration of the new regime there were more than 100 strikes, constituting three-quarters of the labor force of the Empire, mainly in Constantinople and Salonika (Thessaloniki). During previous strikes (Anatolian tax revolts in 1905-1907) the Sultan remained above criticism and bureaucrats and administrators were deemed corrupt; this time CUP took the blame. In the parliament LU accused the CUP of authoritarianism. Abdul Hamid's Grand Viziers Said and Kâmil Pasha and his Foreign Minister Tevfik Pasha continued in the office. They were now independent of the Sultan and were taking measures to strengthen the Porte against the encroachments of both the Palace and the CUP. Said and Kâmil were nevertheless men of the old regime. After nine months into the new government, discontent found expression in a fundamentalist movement which attempted to dismantle Constitution and revert it with a monarchy. The Ottoman counter-coup of 1909 gained traction when Sultan promised to restore the Caliphate, eliminate secular policies, and restore the rule of Islamic law, as the mutinous troops claimed. CUP also eliminated the time for religious observance. Unfortunately for the advocates of representative parliamentary government, mutinous demonstrations by disenfranchised regimental officers broke out on 13 April 1909, which led to the collapse of the government. On 27 April 1909 counter-coup put down by \\"31 March Incident\\" using the 11th Salonika Reserve Infantry Division of the Third Army. Some of the leaders of Bulgarian federalist wing like Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the march on Capital to depose the \\"attempt to dismantle constitution\\". Abdul Hamid II was removed from the throne, and Mehmed V became the Sultan. The Albanians of Tirana and Elbassan, where the Albanian National Awakening spread, were among the first groups to join the constitutional movement. Hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. However, due to shifting national borders in the Balkans, the Albanians had been marginalized as a nation-less people. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Under the new regime the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language lifted. The new regime also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet. The Albanians refused to submit to the campaign to \\"Ottomanize\\" them by force. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting, the Congress of Manastir on 22 November 1908, chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. =1909–1918 Mehmed V= After the 31 March Incident in 1909, the Sultan Abdul Hamid II was overthrown.  Constitutional revision  On 5 August 1909, the revised constitution was granted by the new Sultan Mehmed V. This revised constitution, as the one before, proclaimed the equality of all subjects in the matter of taxes, military service (allowing Christians into the military for the first time), and political rights. The new constitution was perceived as a big step for the establishment of a common law for all subjects. The position of Sultan was greatly reduced to a figurehead, while still retaining some constitutional powers, such as the ability to declare war. The new constitution, aimed to bring more sovereignty to the public, could not address certain public services, such as the Ottoman public debt, the Ottoman Bank or Ottoman Public Debt Administration because of their international character. The same held true of most of the companies which were formed to execute public works such as Baghdad Railway, tobacco and cigarette trades of two French companies the \\"Regie Company\\", and \\"Narquileh tobacco\\".  Italian War, 1911  Italian landings in Libya and Rhodes Italy declared war, the Italo-Turkish War, on the Empire on 29 September 1911, demanding the turnover of Tripoli and Cyrenaica. The empire's response was weak so Italian forces took those areas on 5 November of that year (this act was confirmed by an act of the Italian Parliament on 25 February 1912). Although minor, the war was an important precursor of World War I as it sparked nationalism in the Balkan states. Ottomans were losing their last directly ruled African territory. The Italians also sent weapons to Montenegro, encouraged Albanian dissidents, seized Rhodes and the other. Seeing how easily the Italians had defeated the disorganized Ottomans, the members of the Balkan League attacked the Empire before the war with Italy had ended. On 18 October 1912, Italy and the Empire signed a treaty in Ouchy near Lausanne. Often called Treaty of Ouchy, but also named as the First Treaty of Lausanne.  Elections, 1912  The Liberal Union was in power sharing when the First Balkan War broke out in October. The Committee of Union and Progress won landslide the 1912 Ottoman general election. In this election CUP proved/developed into a real political party. Decentralization (the Liberal Union's position) was rejected and all effort was directed toward streamline of the government, streamlining the administration (bureaucracy), and strengthening the armed forces. The CUP, which got the public mandate from the electrode, did not compromise with minority parties like their predecessors (that is being Sultan Abdul Hamid) had been. The first three years of relations between the new regime and the Great Powers were demoralizing and frustrating. The Powers refused to make any concessions over the Capitulations and loosen their grip over the Empire's internal affairs. The territorial gains of the Balkan states after the Balkan Wars When the Italian War and the counterinsurgency operations in Albania and Yemen began to fail, a number of high-ranking military officers, who were unhappy with the counterproductive political involvement in these wars, formed a political committee in the capital. Calling itself the Group of Liberating Officers or Savior Officers, its members were committed to reducing the autocratic control wielded by the CUP over military operations. Supported by the Liberal Union in parliament, these officers threatened violent action unless their demands were met. Said Pasha resigned as Grand Vizier on 17 July 1912, and the government collapsed. A new government, so called the \\"Great government\\", was formed by Ahmet Muhtar Pasha. The members of the government were prestigious statesmen, technocrat government, and they easily received the vote of confidence. This CUP excluded from cabinet posts. The 1912 Mürefte earthquake occurred causing 216 casualties on 9 August 1912. The Ottoman Aviation Squadrons established by largely under French guidance in 1912. Squadrons were established in a short time as Louis Blériot and the Belgian pilot Baron Pierre de Caters performed the first flight demonstration in the Empire on 2 December 1909. Balkan Wars, 1912–1913 The three new Balkan states formed at the end of the 19th century and Montenegro, sought additional territories from the Albania, Macedonia, and Thrace regions, behind their nationalistic arguments. The incomplete emergence of these nation-states on the fringes of the Empire during the nineteenth century set the stage for the Balkan Wars. On 10 October 1912 the collective note of the powers was handed. CUP responded to demands of European powers on reforms in Macedonia on 14 October. Before further action could be taken war broke out. While Powers were asking Empire to reform Macedonia, under the encouragement of Russia, a series of agreements were concluded: between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912, between Greece and Bulgaria in May 1912, and Montenegro subsequently concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria respectively in October 1912. The Serbian-Bulgarian agreement specifically called for the partition of Macedonia which resulted in the First Balkan War. A nationalist uprising broke out in Albania, and on 8 October, the Balkan League, consisting of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria, mounted a joint attack on the Empire, starting the First Balkan War. The strong march of the Bulgarian forces in Thrace pushed the Ottoman armies to the gates of Constantinople. The Second Balkan War soon followed. Albania declared independence on 28 November. The empire agreed to a ceasefire on 2 December, and its territory losses were finalized in 1913 in the treaties of London and Bucharest. Albania became independent, and the Empire lost almost all of its European territory (Kosovo, Sanjak of Novi Pazar, Macedonia and western Thrace) to the four allies. These treaties resulted in the loss of 83 percent of their European territory and almost 70 percent of their European population. =Inter-communal conflicts, 1911–1913= In the two-year period between September 1911 and September 1913 ethnic cleansing sent hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees, or muhacir, streaming into the Empire, adding yet another economic burden and straining the social fabric. During the wars, food shortages and hundreds of thousands of refugees haunted the empire. After the war there was a violent expel of the Muslim peasants of eastern Thrace.  Cession of Kuwait and Albania, 1913  The Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913 was a short-lived agreement signed in July 1913 between the Ottoman sultan Mehmed V and the British over several issues. However the status of Kuwait that came to be the only lasting result, as its outcome was formal independence for Kuwait. Albania had been under Ottoman rule since about 1478. When Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece laid claim to Albanian-populated lands during Balkan Wars, the Albanians declared independence. The European Great Powers endorsed an independent Albania in 1913, after the Second Balkan War leaving outside the Albanian border more than half of the Albanian population and their lands, that were partitioned between Montenegro, Serbia and Greece. They were assisted by Aubrey Herbert, a British MP who passionately advocated their cause in London. As a result, Herbert was offered the crown of Albania, but was dissuaded by the British prime minister, H. H. Asquith, from accepting. Instead the offer went to William of Wied, a German prince who accepted and became sovereign of the new Principality of Albania. Albania's neighbours still cast covetous eyes on this new and largely Islamic state. The young state, however, collapsed within weeks of the outbreak of World War I.  CUP takes control  At the turn of 1913, the Ottoman Modern Army failed at counterinsurgencies in the periphery of the empire, Libya was lost to Italy, and Balkan war erupted in the fall of 1912. LU flexed its muscles with the forced dissolution of the parliament in 1912. The signs of humiliation of the Balkan wars worked to the advantage of the CUP The cumulative defeats of 1912 enabled the CUP to seize control of the government. The Liberal Union Party presented the peace proposal to the Ottoman government as a collective démarche, which was almost immediately accepted by both the Ottoman cabinet and by an overwhelming majority of the parliament on 22 January 1913. The 1913 Ottoman coup d'état (23 January), was carried out by a number of CUP members led by Ismail Enver Bey and Mehmed Talaat Bey, in which the group made a surprise raid on the central Ottoman government buildings, the Sublime Porte (). During the coup, the Minister of the Navy Nazım Pasha was assassinated and the Grand Vizier, Kâmil Pasha, was forced to resign. The CUP established tighter control over the faltering Ottoman state. Mahmud Sevket Pasha was assassinated just in 5 months after the coup in June 1913. LU supporters had been involved in the assassination; their crush followed. Cemal Pasha was responsible for executing revenge. The execution of former officials had been an exception since the Tanzimat (1840s) period; the punishment was the exile. The public life could not be far more brutish 75 years after the Tanzimat. The Foreign Ministry was always occupied by someone from the inner circle of the CUP except for the interim appointment of Muhtar Bey. Said Halim Pasha who was already Foreign Minister, became Grand Vizier in June 1913 and remained in office until October 1915. He was succeeded in the Ministry by Halil. In May 1913 German military mission assigned Otto Liman von Sanders to help train and reorganize the Ottoman army. Otto Liman von Sanders was assigned to reorganize the First Army, his model to be replicated to other units; as an advisor [he took the command of this army in November 1914] and began working on its operational area which was the straits. This became a scandal and intolerable for St. Petersburg. The Russian Empire developed a plan for invading and occupying the Black Sea port of Trabzon or the Eastern Anatolian town of Bayezid in retaliation. To solve this issue Germany demoted Otto Liman von Sanders to a rank that he could barely command an army corps. If there was no solution through Naval occupation of Constantinople, the next Russian idea was to improve the Russian Caucasus Army.  Elections, 1914  The Empire lost territory in the Balkans, where many of its Christian voters were based before the 1914 elections. The CUP made efforts to win support in the Arab provinces by making conciliatory gestures to Arab leaders. Weakened Arab support for the LU and enabled the CUP to call elections with unionists holding the upper hand. After 1914 elections, the democratic structure had a better representation in the parliament; the parliament that emerged from the elections in 1914 reflected better ethnic composition of the Ottoman population There were more Arab deputies, which were under-represented in previous parliaments. The CUP had a majority government. The Ottoman imperial government was established in January 1914. Ismail Enver became a Pasha and was assigned as the Minister of War; Ahmet Cemal who was the military governor of Constantinople became Minister for the Navy; and once a postal official Talaat became the Minister of the Interior. These Three Pashas would maintain de facto control of the Empire as a military regime and almost as a personal dictatorship under Enver Pasha during the World War I. Until the 1919 Ottoman general election, any other input into the political process was restricted with the outbreak of the World War I. The 1914 Burdur earthquake occurred on 4 October 1914.  Local-Regional politics  = Arab politics= The Hauran Druze Rebellion was a violent Druze uprising in the Syrian province, which erupted in 1909. The rebellion was led by the al-Atrash family, in an aim to gain independence. A business dispute between Druze chief Yahia bey Atrash in the village of Basr al-Harir escalated into a clash of arms between the Druze and Ottoman-backed local villagers. Though it is the financial change during second constitutional area; the spread of taxation, elections and conscription, to areas already undergoing economic change caused by the construction of new railroads, provoked large revolts, particularly among the Druzes and the Hauran. Sami Pasha al-Farouqi arrived in Damascus in August 1910, leading an Ottoman expeditionary force of some 35 battalions. The resistance collapsed. In 1911, Muslim intellectuals and politicians formed \\"The Young Arab Society\\", a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was \\"raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\\" In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. They also requested that Arab conscripts to the Ottoman army not be required to serve in non-Arab regions except in time of war. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.Choueiri, pp.166–168. Nationalist movement become prominent during this Ottoman period, but it has to be mentionas that this was among Arab nobles and common Arabs considered themselves loyal subjects of the Caliph.Karsh, Islamic Imperialism Instead of Ottoman Caliph, the British, for their part, incited the Sharif of Mecca to launch the Arab Revolt during the First World War. = Armenian politics= In 1908, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) or Dashnak Party embraced a public position endorsing participation and reconciliation in the Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire and the abandonment of the idea of an independent Armenia. Stepan Zorian and Simon Zavarian managed the political campaign for the 1908 Ottoman Elections. ARF field workers were dispatched to the provinces containing significant Armenian populations; for example, Drastamat Kanayan (Dro), went to Diyarbakir as a political organizer. The Committee of Union and Progress could only able to bring 10 Armenian representatives to the 288 seats in the 1908 Ottoman general election. The other 4 Armenians represented parties with no ethnic affiliation. The ARF was aware that the elections were shaky ground and maintained its political direction and self-defence mechanism intact and continued to smuggle arms and ammunition. On 13 April 1909, while Constantinople was dealing with the consequences of Ottoman countercoup of 1909 an outbreak of violence, known today as the Adana Massacre shook in April the ARF-CUP relations to the core. On 24 April the 31 March Incident and suppression of the Adana violence followed each other. The Ottoman authorities in Adana brought in military forces and ruthlessly stamped out both real opponents, while at the same time massacring thousands of innocent people. In July 1909, the CUP government announced the trials of various local government and military officials, for \\"being implicated in the Armenian massacres.\\". On 15 January 1912, the Ottoman parliament dissolved and political campaigns began almost immediately. Andranik Ozanian participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 alongside general Garegin Nzhdeh as a commander of Armenian auxiliary troops. Andranik met revolutionist Boris Sarafov and the two pledged to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia. Andranik participated in the First Balkan War alongside Garegin Nzhdeh as a Chief Commander of 12th Battalion of Lozengrad Third Brigade of the Macedonian- Adrianopolitan militia under the command of Colonel Aleksandar Protogerov. His detachment consisted of 273 Armenian volunteers. On 5 May 1912, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation officially severed the relations with the Ottoman government; a public declaration of the Western Bureau printed in the official announcement was directed to \\"Ottoman Citizens.\\" The June issue of Droshak ran an editorial about it. Shortly after the war started, rumours surfaced that Armenians fighting together with the Bulgarians near Kavala had massacred Muslims. There were overwhelming numbers of Armenians who served the Empire units with distinction during Balkan wars. The ARF quickly disproved 273 Armenian volunteers of Macedonian-Adrianopolitan militia from killing Muslims by pointing out that there were no Armenian names in the list of those accused and published telegrams and testimonials from the Armenians in the Ottoman units. In October 1912, George V of Armenia engaged in negotiations with General Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov to discuss Armenian reforms inside the Russian Empire. In December 1912, Kevork V formed the Armenian National Delegation and appointed Boghos Nubar. The delegation established itself in Paris. Another member appointed to the delegation was James Malcolm who resided in London and became the delegation's point man in its dealings with the British. In early 1913, Armenian diplomacy shaped as Boghos Nubar was to be responsible for external negotiations with the European governments, while the Political Council \\"seconded by the Constantinople and Tblisi Commissions\\" were to negotiate the reform question internally with the Ottoman and Russian governments. The Armenian reform package was established in February 1914 based on the arrangements nominally made in the Treaty of Berlin (1878) and the Treaty of San Stefano. During the Spring of 1913, the provinces faced increasingly worse relations between Kurds and Armenians that created an urgent need for the ARF to revive its self-defence capability. In 1913, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (followed by other Ottoman political parties) changed its policy and stopped cooperating with the Committee of Union and Progress, moving out of the concept of Ottomanism and developing its own kind of nationalism.Dasnabedian, Hratch, \\"The ideological creed\\" and \\"The evolution of objectives\\" in \\"a balance sheet of the ninety years\\", Beirut, 1985, pp. 73–103 The plan called for the unification of the Six Vilayets and the nomination of a Christian governor and religiously balanced council over the unified provinces, the establishment of a second Gendarmerie over Ottoman Gendarmerie commanded by European officers, the legalization of the Armenian language and schools, and the establishment of a special commission to examine land confiscations empowered to expel Muslim refugees. The most important clause was obligating the European powers to enforce the reforms, by overriding the regional governments. From the end of July to 2 August 1914, the Armenian congress at Erzurum happened. There was a meeting between the Committee of Progress and Union and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Armenian liaisons Arshak Vramian, Zorian and Khatchatour Maloumian and Ottoman liaisons Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Omer Naji, and Hilmi Bey were accompanied by an international entourage of peoples from the Caucasus. The CUP requested to incite a rebellion of Russian Armenians against the Tsarist regime in Russian Armenia, in order to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia in the event of the opening up of the Caucasus Campaign. Around the same time, a representative meeting of Russian Armenians assembled in Tiflis, Russian Armenia. The Tsar asked Armenian's loyalty and support for Russia in the conflict. The proposal was agreed upon and nearly 20,000 Armenians who responded to the call of forming Armenian volunteer units inside the Russian Caucasus Army), of which only 7,000 were given arms. On 2 November, the first engagement of the Caucasus Campaign began (the Bergmann Offensive), and on 16 December 1914, the Ottoman Empire officially dismantled the Armenian reform package. The ARF was very effective at this junction but the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party had a problem: The Ottoman intelligence service had an agent operating under Hunchakian Party from as early as 1913. The Imperial Government knew about an alleged attempted assassination plan against Interior Minister Talaat Pasha; the Ottoman government captured the central Hunchakian operatives in a single operation in July 1914 using the comprehensive account of the decisions adopted by the Hunchakian Congress (1913) along the list of the participants. The trials took a year and the participants, named the 20 Hunchakian gallows were executed on 15 June 1915. = Kurdish politics = The first Kurds to challenge the authority of the Ottoman Empire did so primarily as Ottoman subjects, rather than national Kurds. They worked with other Ottoman subjects who were in opposition to the policies of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and in 1889 formed the CUP. Abdul Hamid responded with a policy of repression, but also of integration, co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents into the Ottoman power structure with prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish Hamidiye Cavalry. In 1908, after the overthrow of Sultan, the Hamidiye was disbanded as an organized force, but as they were \\"tribal forces\\" before official recognition by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1892, they stayed as \\"tribal forces\\" after dismemberment. The Hamidiye Cavalry is described as a military disappointment and a failure because of its contribution to tribal feuds. Shaykh Abd al Qadir in 1910 appealed to the CUP for an autonomous Kurdish state in the east. Operating within the autonomous framework. That same year, Said Nursi travelled through the Diyarbakir region and urged Kurds to unite and forget their differences, while still carefully claiming loyalty to the CUP. Other Kurdish Shaykhs in the region began leaning towards regional autonomy. During this time, the Badr Khans had been in contact with discontented Shaykhs and chieftains in the far east of Anatolia ranging to the Iranian border, more in the framework of secession, however. Shaykh Abd al Razzaq Badr Khan eventually formed an alliance with Shaykh Taha and Shaykh Abd al Salam Barzani, another powerful family. In 1914, because of this possible Kurdish threat as well as the alliance's dealings with Russia, Ottoman troops moved against this alliance. Two brief and minor rebellions, the rebellions of Barzan and Bitlis, were quickly suppressed. In 1914, General Muhammad Sharif Pasha offered his services to the British in Mesopotamia. Elsewhere, members of the Badr Khan family held close relations with Russian officials and discussed their intentions to form an independent Kurdistan. = Politics in Yemen = Yemen Vilayet was a first-level administrative division of the Empire. In the late 19th century, the Zaidis rebelled against the Empire, and Imam Mohammed ibn Yahya laid the foundation of a hereditary dynasty. When he died in 1904, his successor Imam Yahya ibn Mohammed led the revolt against the Empire in 1904–1905, and forced them to grant important concessions to the Zaidis. The Ottoman agreed to withdraw the civil code and restore sharia in Yemen. In 1906, the Idrisi leaders of Asir rebelled against the Ottomans. By 1910 they controlled most of Asir, but they were ultimately defeated by Ottoman Modern Army and Hejazi forces. Ahmed Izzet Pasha concluded a treaty with Imam Yahya in October 1911, by which he was recognized as temporal and spiritual head of the Zaidis, was given the right to appoint officials over them, and collect taxes from them. The Ottomans maintained their system of government in the Sunni-majority parts of Yemen. In March 1914, the Anglo- Turkish Treaty delimited the border between Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. This was the backdrop to the later division in two Yemeni states (up to 1990). Foreign policy The interstate system at the beginning of the twentieth century was a multipolar one, with no single or two states pre-eminent. Mukipolarity traditionally had afforded the Ottomans the ability to play-off one power against the other, which they did at times with consummate skill. Initially, CUP and LU turned to Britain. Germany had supported the Abdul Hamid II regime and acquired a strong foothold. By encouraging Britain to compete against Germany and France, Empire hoped to break France and Germany's hold and acquire greater autonomy for the Porte. Hostility to Germany increased when her ally Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The pro-Unionist Tanin went so far as to suggest that Vienna's motive in carrying out this act was to strike a blow against the constitutional regime and assist reaction in order to bring about its fall. Two prominent Unionists, Ahmed Riza Pasha and Dr. Nazim Pasha, were sent to London to discuss options of cooperation with Sir Edward Grey and Sir Charles Hardinge. Foreign Minister Tevfik's successor, Mehmed Rifat Pasha was a career diplomat from a merchant family. The CUP, who were predominantly civilian, resented the intrusion of the army into government. The CUP, who seized power from LU in January 1913, was more convinced than ever that only an alliance with Britain and the Entente could guarantee the survival of what remained of the Empire. In June, therefore, the subject of an Anglo-Turkish alliance was reopened by Tevfik Pasha, who simply restated his proposal of October 1911. Once again the offer was turned down. Sir Louis Mallet, who became Britain's Ambassador to the Porte in 1914, noted that The CUP could not possibly accept such proposals. They felt betrayed by what they considered was Europe's bias during the Balkan Wars, and therefore they had no faith in Great Power declarations regarding the Empire's independence and integrity; the termination of European financial control and administrative supervision was one of the principal aims of CUP's policies. Sir Louis Mallet, Ambassador, seemed totally oblivious to that. The response was not based on an ignorance. Though these imperial powers had experienced relatively few major conflicts between them over the previous hundred years, an underlying rivalry, otherwise known as \\"the Great Game\\", had exacerbated the situation to such an extent that resolution was sought. Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 brought shaky British-Russian relations to the forefront by solidifying boundaries that identified their respective control in Persia, Afghanistan. Overall, the Convention represented a carefully calculated move on each power's part in which they chose to value a powerful alliance over potential sole control over various parts of Central Asia. Ottoman Empire lied on the crossroads to Central Asia. The Convention served as the catalyst for creating a \\"Triple Entente\\", which was the basis of the alliance of countries opposing the Central Powers. Ottoman Empire's path in Ottoman entry into World War I was set with that agreement, which was part of the Great Game. One way to challenge and undermine the army's position was by attacking Germany in the press and supporting friendship with Germany's rival, Great Britain. But neither Britain nor France responded to CUP's advance of friendship. In fact France resented the government's (Porte) desire to acquire financial autonomy. In early 1914 the Ottoman Government was concerned with three main goals. The first was improving relations with Bulgaria; the second was to encourage support from the Germans, and the third was to settle negotiations with Europe about the Armenian reform. With regard to the first, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria showed sympathy to one another because they suffered as a result of the territories lost with the Balkan Wars (1912–1913). They also had bitter relations with Greece. It was natural and beneficial for them to work for the development of policies that enabled them to gain better positions in the region. With regard to the second, there were three military missions active at the turn of 1914. These were the British Naval Mission led by Admiral Limpus, the French Gendarme Mission led by General Moujen, and the German Military Mission led by Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz. The German Military Mission become the most important among these three. The history of German- Ottoman military relations went back to the 1880s. The Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha (12 June 1913 – 4 February 1917) and Ottoman Minister of War Ahmet Izzet Pasha (11 June 1913 – 3 January 1914) were instrumental in developing the initial relations. Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered General Goltz to establish the first German mission. General Goltz served two periods within two years. In the early 1914, the Ottoman Minister of War was a former military attaché to Berlin, Enver Pasha (who became a member of the Three Pashas). About the same time, General Otto Liman von Sanders, was nominated to the command of the German 1st Army. It was the biggest located in the European side. General Liman von Sanders and Enver Pasha practically shared the commander-in-chief position. With regard to the third, an Armenian reform package was negotiated with the Russian Empire. Russia, acting on behalf of the Great Powers, played a crucial role introducing reforms for the Armenian citizens of the Empire. The Armenian reform package, which was solidified in February 1914 and was based on the arrangements nominally made in the Treaty of Berlin (1878) and the Treaty of San Stefano. According to this arrangement the inspectors general, whose powers and duties constituted the key to the question, were to be named for a period of ten years, and their engagement was not to be revocable during that period.  World War I  The History of the Ottoman Empire during World War I began with the Ottoman attack on Russia's Black Sea coast on 29 October 1914. The attack prompted Russia and its allies, Britain and France, to declare war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire was active in the Balkans theatre and Middle Eastern theatre – the latter had five main campaigns: the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, the Mesopotamian Campaign, the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign, and the Gallipoli Campaign. There were also several minor campaigns: the North African Campaign, the Arab Campaign and the South Arabia Campaign. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 31 October 1918, ending the Ottoman participation in World War I. = 1918–1922 Mehmet VI = Just before the end of World War I, Sultan Mehmet V died and Mehmed VI became the new Sultan. The Occupation of Constantinople took place in accordance with the Armistice of Mudros, ending the Ottoman participation in World War I. The occupation had two stages: the initial occupation took place from 13 November 1918 to 16 March 1920; from 16 March 1920 – Treaty of Sèvres. The year 1918 saw the first time Constantinople had changed hands since the Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine capital in 1453. An Allied military administration was set up early in December 1918. Hagia Sophia was converted back into a cathedral by the Allied administration, and the building was returned temporarily to the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch. The CUP members were court-martialled during the Turkish courts-martial of 1919–1920 with charges of subversion of the constitution, wartime profiteering, and the massacres of both Greeks and Armenians. The courts-martial became a stage for political battles. The trials helped the LU root out the CUP from the political arena. The fall of the CUP allowed the Palace to regain the initiative once again, though only for less than a year. The British also rounded up a number of members of the Imperial Government and interned them in Malta, only for them to be exchanged in the future for British POWs without further trial. Sir Gough-Calthorpe included only members of the Government of Tevfik Pasha and the military/political personalities. Discredited members of the Ottoman regime were resurrected in order to form ephemeral governments and conduct personal diplomacy. Thus, Ahmet Tevfik Pasha formed two ministries between November 1918 and March 1919, to be followed by Abdul Hamid's brother- in-law Damat Ferid Pasha who led three cabinets in seven months. Damad Ferid, having served in diplomatic missions throughout Europe during the Hamidian era, and having been acquainted with European statesmen during his tenure as a Liberal politician, was considered an asset in the negotiations for the very survival of the Ottoman state and dynasty. In the end, military losses destroyed the empire. The end came just as Ottoman reforms were having their greatest success. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 had taken real power out of the hands of the Sultan (although the sultanate remained) and put it in the hands of the Committee of Union and Progress.  Partitioning  After the war, the doctrine of Ottomanism lost its credibility. As parts of the Empire were integrated into the world economy, certain regions (the Balkans, Egypt, Iraq, and Hijaz) established closer economic links with Paris and London, or even with British India, than with Constantinople, which became known in English as Istanbul around 1930. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire began with the Treaty of London (1915) and continued with mostly bilateral multiple agreements among the Allies. The initial peace agreement with the Ottoman Empire was the Armistice of Mudros. This was followed by the Occupation of Constantinople. The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire brought international conflicts which were discussed during the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. The peace agreement, the Treaty of Sèvres, was eventually signed by the Ottoman Empire (not ratified) and the Allied administration. The result of the Peace Settlement was that every indigenous group of the Empire would acquire its own state. = Treaty of Sèvres = Borders of Turkey according to the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) in the aftermath of the Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The text of the Treaty of Sèvres was not made public to the Ottomans until May 1920. The Allies decided that the Empire would be left only a small area in Northern and Central Anatolia to rule. Contrary to general expectations, the Sultanate along the Caliphate was not terminated, and it was allowed to retain capitol and a small strip of territory around the city, but not the straits. The shores of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles were planned to be internationalised, so that the gates of the Black Sea would be kept open. West Anatolia was to be offered to Greece, and East Anatolia was to be offered to Armenia. The Mediterranean coast, although still a part of the Empire, was partitioned between two zones of influence for France and Italy. The interior of Anatolia, the first seat of Ottoman power six centuries ago, would retain Ottoman sovereignty. The World Zionist Organization was established in Constantinople; Theodor Herzl had tried to set up debt relief for Sultan Abdul Hamid II in exchange for Palestinian lands. Until the First World War its activities focused on cultural matters, although political aims were never absent. Before the First World War, Herzl's attempts to reach a political agreement with the Ottoman rulers of Palestine were unsuccessful. But on 11 April 1909, Tel Aviv was founded on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa. The World Zionist Organization supported small-scale settlement in Palestine and focused on strengthening Jewish feeling and consciousness and on building a worldwide federation. At the start of World War I most Jews (and Zionists) supported the German Empire in its war against the Russian Empire. The Balfour Declaration (dated 2 November 1917) and Henry McMahon had exchanged letters with Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca in 1915, a shift to another concept (Jewish national home vs. Jewish state) which is explained under Homeland for the Jewish people The idea of an independent Armenian state among Russian Armenians survived the demise of Ottoman Empire through the Democratic Republic of Armenia, later to be taken by the Bolsheviks. In 1918, Kurdish tribal leader Sharif Pasha pressed the British to adopt a policy supporting autonomous Kurdish state. He suggested that British officials be charged with administering the region. During the Paris Peace Conference, a Kurdo-Armenian peace accord was reached between Sharif Pasha and Armenian representatives at the conference in 1919. The British thought that this agreement would increase the likelihood of independent Kurdish and Armenian states and therefore create a buffer between British Mesopotamia and the Turks. The Arab forces were promised a state that included much of the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent; however, the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France provided for the territorial division of much of that region between the two imperial powers. The Allies dictated the terms of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire with the Treaty of Sèvres. The Turkish nationalist Ottoman Parliament rejected these terms, as they did not conform to the Parliament's own conditions for partition, the Misak-ı Millî (, published in early 1920. No Ottoman assent was possible while Parliament remained intransigent. Following the Conference of London on 4 March 1920, the Allies decided to actively suppress Turkish nationalist opposition to the Treaty. On 14 March 1920, Allied troops moved to occupy key buildings and arrest nationalists in Constantinople. Parliament met a final time on 18 March 1920 before being dissolved by Sultan Mehmed VI on 11 April 1920. The nationalists relocated to Ankara and formed a new government. The Allies were freed to deal with the Sultan directly. Mehmed VI signed the Treaty on 10 August 1920. The Imperial Government in Constantinople attempted and failed to convene the Senate to ratify the treaty; its legitimacy was fatally undermined by the Turkish nationalists' refusal to cooperate. The resulting Turkish War of Independence and the subsequent nationalist victory permanently prevented the Treaty from being ratified. The Turkish War of Independence ended with the Turkish nationalists in control of much of Anatolia. On 1 November 1922 the Turkish provisional government formally declared the Ottoman Sultanate and, with it, the Ottoman Empire to be abolished. Mehmed VI departed Constantinople and into exile on 17 November 1922. The Allies and Turks met in Lausanne, Switzerland to discuss a replacement for the unratified Treaty of Sèvres. End of the Ottoman Empire The resulting Treaty of Lausanne secured international recognition for the new Turkish state and its borders. The Treaty was signed on 24 July 1923 and ratified in Turkey on 23 August 1923. The Republic of Turkey was formally declared on 29 October 1923. The following year on 23 April 1924, the republic declared 150 personae non gratae of Turkey, including the former Sultan, to be personae non-gratae. Most of these restrictions were lifted on 28 June 1938.

He attended St. Bede's College in Mentone, Victoria. He is a right-handed batsman who bats in the middle order, as well as a part-time right-arm off-spin bowler. Hodge was a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket, holding the records for the most runs (5,597) and most centuries (20) in Australian interstate one-day matches. He is also Victoria's highest ever run-scorer in the Sheffield Shield (10,474 runs). However, his opportunities to represent Australia were limited to six Tests and 25 one-day internationals (ODIs). First-class career Hodge debuted for the Victorian Bushrangers as a 19-year-old, and was nicknamed \\"Bunkie\\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3987aL9UQS42OMB6YZ957r?si=hH6IrOrfQHuWyP9Q2680Lg by Dean Jones for the fact that he shared a bunkbed with his brother at the time of his debut. He was also called \\"Hodgie\\" but never \\"Glovelick\\" as confirmed in an online interview. Hodge played Lancashire League Cricket for Ramsbottom in 2000 and 2001 scoring 1000 runs in each season, breaking the clubs batting record in 2001. His bowling also proved useful. Hodge has played with County Cricket teams Durham, Lancashire, and Leicestershire – where he made his highest first class score of 302*. During his time at Leicestershire, he was accused of cheating by then-Derbyshire captain, Dominic Cork, by claiming a catch when it appeared that he had stepped over the boundary rope in a Twenty20 match in June 2003. Hodge had actually completed the catch cleanly, before running over to the crowd to celebrate.Cricinfo – Cork slams 'cheat' Hodge and 'pathetic' Lamb Hodge denied the accusation and considered taking legal action. Cork was sanctioned by the ECB. Hodge scored many runs for Victoria, and his consistency came together by the 2000–01 season, where he was consistently overlooked for selection, despite being one of Australia's premier domestic batsmen. He has argued he was the victim of New South Wales selection bias.'Hodge lashes cricket's alleged NSW bias', Herald Sun 27 August 2009 On 21 November 2007, playing for Victoria against Queensland, Hodge made his highest Pura Cup score of 286*. He and Nick Jewell had batted undefeated for the entire third day of the game, only the fourth wicketless day's play in the history of the competition. During the match against Queensland at the MCG on 7 March 2009, he scored 261. During this innings, he became the 6th batsman to pass 10,000 Sheffield Shield runs. He also became the first to score a century in Australian domestic Twenty20, scoring 106 off 54 deliveries for Victoria against New South Wales at North Sydney, on 21 January 2006. In December 2009, Hodge announced his retirement from first-class cricket to focus on the one-day and Twenty20 versions of the game. Hodge finished his domestic first-class career as Victoria's all-time leading run scorer. In January 2012, he retired from one-day cricket to focus exclusively on the Twenty20 game. At the time, he was the leading run-scorer in the 2011–12 Ryobi One-Day Cup. Hodge captained the Adelaide Strikers in the 2016–17 Big Bash League and while the team struggled, he was a model of consistency and named in the team of the tournament at the age of 42. Australian career Bat used by Brad Hodge during his double century against South Africa-on display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hodge was called up as part of Australia's 2005 Ashes squad but was not used throughout the series. He did, however, make a number of catches in the third test as a substitute fielder to get out Kevin Pietersen and Michael Vaughan both off the bowling of Brett Lee. After a long time waiting for an international debut, he finally debuted for the Australian team against the West Indies in November 2005 at Bellerive Oval, Hobart, during the 2005–06 Test Series, becoming the 394th player to wear the baggy green for Australia. He had his baggy green presented to him by Bill Lawry. Hodge scored his maiden Test century for Australia against South Africa in Perth on 19 December 2005. After ending the third day on 91 not out, Hodge displayed some nervousness in media interviews about reaching his century, but by the end of the innings he managed to finish with an unbeaten score of 203, batting with fluency on day four. This innings was criticised by some Australian fans who felt that captain Ricky Ponting declared too late in allowing Hodge to chase his double century. This criticism came after Australia did not bowl out South Africa in the 4th innings (despite having 120 overs to do so), with the match ending in a draw. Australia were principally thwarted by a resolute Rudolph, who replaced the injured Jacques Kallis. Hodge later made his One-day International debut, and, after two initial modest scores, he scored a half-century. This earned him a recall for some games against South Africa in the VB Series, although he failed to capitalise and was dropped from the ODI side. Hodge was dropped after only five tests in the team, and only three tests after scoring his double century against South Africa. The selectors stated that the decision was made on the back of a poor Pura Cup season by Hodge, averaging around 25 for the summer when the team was selected (he finished the season with an average of 33.3).Cricket Australia, Aussie squad announced , 19 September 2008, retrieved 3 January 2011 The decision was unpopular amongst Victorian fans, particularly since his replacement, Damien Martyn, had averaged only 23.7 in the same Pura Cup season.ESPN Cricinfo, \\"Cricket Records, Pura Cup 2005/06, Western Australia\\", retrieved 3 January 2011 He did get back, however, albeit more than two years later, when included in Australia's squad that toured the West Indies in May/June 2008. On 22 May, in what proved to be his final test, he made 67 and 27 with the bat. Brad Hodge made 99 not out off 86 balls to steer Australia to victory against New Zealand on 4 February 2007, when he was called into the team because Andrew Symonds had pulled out with a torn bicep. On 18 February 2007, Brad Hodge scored 97 not out off 86 balls as he helped Australia to 4/336 off their 50 overs. On 18 March 2007, in the World Cup, Hodge scored his maiden one-day century against Holland. He scored 123 off just 89 balls, including 7 sixes and 8 fours and shared a record 4th-wicket partnership of 204 with Michael Clarke, the highest 4th wicket stand in World Cup history. On 24 March 2007, Hodge was dropped from the Australian ODI side starting 11 in the World Cup, after making a century and being named man of the match in the side's last outing against cricketing minnows, the Netherlands. Andrew Symonds, after recovering from a shoulder injury, was named as his replacement. Hodge later returned to the starting 11 when Shane Watson was injured. He played for Australia in a Twenty20 against India on 1 February 2008. In December 2010, Hodge was named in Australia's initial World Cup side for the following year. However, he was not named in the final squad. In 2012, reflecting on his lack of opportunities to play for Australia, Hodge said: \\"Selections have puzzled me for a number of years, and continue to puzzle me... I have played the best cricket I can in Test, four-day, one-day, and T20, but for some reason it has not been good enough. That's life.\\" On January 2012, Hodge announced his decision to retire from One-Day Cricket and also to retire from Victoria. He said in an interview: \\"I think it's just time to step aside and let some other guys come through; I'm obviously delighted to have played this long. I guess, like anyone in the world, once you've done something for so long, it's hard to let go\\" In 2012, Hodge played a local 20/20 for Mill Park Cricket Club in the Diamond Valley Cricket Association against Bundoora Park, the match being held at Redleap Reserve, where there was a big crowd of over 1,000 people. Bundoora Park made 6/142, with Hodge taking 1/17 off 4 overs. Hodge in return opened the batting with good friend Warren Stewert, and blasted 58, including 3 sixes off 39 balls, before club stalwarts Adam McLaughlin and Luke Peterson got the required runs off the final over. Hodge remained at the club for hours afterwards answering questions, which typifies him as a great cricketer on and off the field. In 2014, Hodge played for Australia in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition. Indian Premier League On 26 April 2008, it was confirmed that Hodge would represent the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League for five weeks. He played three matches in the first edition without any success. In the second edition, he was the highest scorer for his team. He was also the most consistent player of the team. But, in the fourth edition of the IPL, he was signed by the Kochi Tuskers Kerala. For the fifth edition of the Indian premier league, Rajasthan Royals bought him for $475,000. His base price was $200,000.2012 IPL player auction In the 2013 IPL season, Brad Hodge played a match-winning innings of 54 runs not out off just 29 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad, coming in after his team had lost 5 wickets for just 57 runs, chasing 133 runs to win, to take Rajasthan Royals into the second qualifier for the finals. For his performance, he was awarded the Man of the Match award. He also scored an unbeaten 39* against the Mumbai Indians at Wankhede, where his team lost by just 14 runs. He was the coach for Gujarat Lions in IPL 2016. For his performances in 2013, he was named in the Cricinfo CLT20 XI.http://www.espncricinfo.com/champions-league- twenty20-2013/content/story/677513.html He worked as the head coach of Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League for the 2018 edition but was removed later.

He says that he then resolved to discover the method for himself.(p. 17) Since he earlier mentioned that Sullivan had lived a hundred years before him it seems likely that he thought he had rediscovered Sullivan's method. Powell traveled from Louisiana to Mexico where he lived for about 12 years, and then to Cuba, Guatemala and California, taming horses. He apparently made a good living doing so. He also was a polyglot, speaking five languages: English, French, Greek, Latin and Spanish.Tachyhippodamia, Willis J. Powell, p. 22 This fascination with languages may account for the title of his book. The method Powell says that the way became clear before him when he first realized that horses only offer resistance to humans because of fear. In order to tame a horse one must first quell their fears. To communicate calm and safety to the horse, nothing is more powerful than soothing touch. Once the horse is feeling safe it can become accustomed to things that might otherwise cause it alarm. (p. 33f) Powell outlines steps by which an untamed horse may be approached without arousing alarm, how it may next be touched on larger and larger portions of its body. The same procedure of desensitization is to be followed in regard to all things in the horse-human environment that might cause unneeded fear.

Brigham Young University. Hypophora can consist of a single question answered in a single sentence, a single question answered in a paragraph or even a section, or a series of questions, each answered in subsequent paragraphs. Hypophora is used (1) as a transitional device, to take the discussion in a new direction, (2) a device to stimulate interest, since a reader's curiosity is stimulated by hearing a question, and (3) to suggest and answer questions the reader might not have thought of. History The word anthypophora is present in Ancient GreekWillamette University College of Law (2006). Anthypophora (and Relatives) and is mentioned by the Roman orator Quintilian in his book Institutio Oratoria. In Institutio Oratoria, Quintilian merely identifies anthypophora as a device used to verify the truth of something, and does not mention raising a hypothetical question or objection.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria IX.3.87 An earlier work by the Greek rhetorician Gorgias mentions anthypophora in its current definition, that is, presenting an opposing argument and then refuting it. The 16th-century English rhetorical handbook The Arte of English Poesie, reputedly by George Puttenham, gives the current definition of Anthypophora as well as numerous examples.The Shakespeare Authorship Page (2006). The Arte of English Poesie (From Book 3, Chapter 19) Hypophora vs. anthypophora In recent times, a division has arisen between the definitions of hypophora and anthypophora. The Century Dictionary identifies hypophora as the dissenting statement or question and anthypophora as the reply to the question.The Century Dictionary (2006). Hypophora; Anthypophora Thus the two terms have come to embrace both elements of hypophora, as well as dealing with the whole concept. Effect The rhetorical effectiveness lies in allowing the speaker to answer questions the listener may have. For instance, in Paul's Epistle to the Romans, Paul is explaining Jesus and he says \\"Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also\\" (Romans 3.29). In this manner, Paul confirms to the reader that God is god of both the Jews and Gentiles.VirtualSalt (2006).

Keppel is known for his contributions to the investigations of Ted Bundy and Gary Ridgway, and also assisted in the creation of HITS, the Homicide Investigation Tracking System. Early life Robert Keppel was raised in Spokane, Washington, where he attended Central Valley High School. After graduating, he went on to attend Washington State University, where he competed in the high jump. Keppel was inspired by his father to pursue criminal justice, in hopes to become a police chief. He went on to receive his master's degree in police science and administration.Meet the Author, Robert Keppel Following graduation, Keppel worked for the King County Sheriff's department before being drafted as an Army drill sergeant and a captain in the Vietnam War. Career The \\"Ted Murders\\" marked the beginning of Robert Keppel's career as a detective. Witnesses from Lake Sammamish State Park provided information regarding a man named \\"Ted\\" who had talked to two young women that were declared missing. During the investigation, Keppel narrowed down a large list of suspects until he was left with 25, including Ted Bundy. He confronted Bundy, but Bundy dismissed the conversation. Before Keppel could speak with him again, Bundy had already been arrested and fled custody. After moving on from the \\"Ted Murders,\\" Keppel decided to return to a doctorate program at University of Washington. While completing this 12-year program, he took the position as chief investigator for Washington State Attorney General's office. In this position, he investigated other crimes like the disappearance of Captain Rolf Neslund, and the death of Donna Howard. Keppel was asked to assist in the Green River Task Force for the investigation of a set of murders in Washington. By 1984, Ted Bundy began writing letters to Robert Keppel in hopes to help in the investigation of the Green River Killer. This correspondence led to interviews between the two, which resulted in Bundy confessing to his unidentified crimes days before his execution.

Plot In a slum area called Easy Street, the police are failing to maintain law and order. The Little Tramp is sleeping rough outside the Hope Mission near the streets of a lawless slum. He is inspired at the mission where there is singing and a sermon from the preacher. His religious \\"awakening\\" is inspired by a beautiful young woman who pleads for him to join the mission, holding his hand. Spotting a help wanted ad for a job at the police station, the Little Tramp accepts and is assigned the rough- and-tumble Easy Street as his beat. Upon entering the street he finds a bully roughing up the locals and pilfering their money. The Little Tramp gets on the wrong side of the bully and following a chase the two eventually come to blows culminating in the Little Tramp inventively using a gas lamp to render the bully unconscious. The bully is taken away by the police but manages to escape from the station and returns to Easy Street. After a long chase the Little Tramp manages to knock the bully unconscious by dropping a heavy stove on his head from an upstairs window. On returning to his beat on Easy Street the unruly mob knock the Little Tramp unconscious and drop him into a nearby cellar where he manages to save the aforementioned beautiful young woman from a nasty drug addict after accidentally sitting on the drug addict's needle. Supercharged by the effects of the drug he takes on the mob and heroically defeats them all and as a consequence restores peace and order to Easy Street. By the end of the film, a New Mission is built on Easy Street and the inhabitants flock to it, even including the former bully: now a well-dressed respectable, churchgoing citizen. Inspiration It could have been inspired by the similarly named East Street market in the Walworth district of London (where Chaplin is believed to have been born), a suggestion made as early as 1928 in the film 'The Life Story of Charlie Chaplin' by Harry B. Parkinsonhttps://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/charlie- chaplin-842389-details.aspx and reasserted in David Robinson's introduction to the most recent edition of My Autobiography, while the famous trousers and boots of Chaplin's trademark tramp costume may have been drawn from the everyday clothes Chaplin saw worn there. Review A reviewer from Variety wrote, \\"The resultant chaos and several new stunts will be bound to bring the laughter, and the star's display of agility and acrobatics approaches some of the Douglas Fairbanks pranks. Chaplin has always been throwing things in his films, but when he 'eases' a cook stove out of the window onto the head of his adversary on the street below, that pleasant little bouquet adds a new act to his repertoire. Easy Street certainly has some rough work in it--maybe a bit rougher than the others--but it is the kind of stuff that Chaplin fans love. In fact, few who see Easy Street will fail to be furnished with hearty laughter.\\" Cast *Charlie Chaplin ... The Derelict *Edna Purviance ... The Mission Worker *Eric Campbell ...

The LS2 was designed by Wolf Lemke and Walter Schneider in response to changes in the Standard Class rules. Only one example, an experimental prototype, was built. First flown in 1973, it won the German Championships that year. Helmut Reichmann competing in the LS2 won the 14th World championships in Waikerie, South Australia in 1974. Design The design was nevertheless unsatisfactory. The air brakes occupied most of the trailing edge of the wing, being intended also as a means to lower speeds and improve climb rates in thermals. Class rules did not allow these surfaces to be coupled to the ailerons. The resultant sluggish roll rate from the very short ailerons led to poor and unsafe flying characteristics. Thrice World Champion Helmut Reichmann reportedly said the performance advantages were not worth the extra pilot workload. The LS2 highlighted inconsistencies in the rules that promoted unwise design trends, with trade-offs having to be made by designers between competitiveness and safety. Many observers also felt that trailing edge air brakes were against the spirit of the Standard Class, an issue that affected other types such as the PIK-20, Libelle and Schreder HP-8. The International Gliding Commission voted a new set of rules in 1974, prohibiting any lift-enhancing devices in the Standard Class and creating the 15 metre Class where these were allowed without any restriction.

Design and development In designing the Mini-Nimbus, Klaus Holighaus incorporated the flapped wings from the Glasflügel 303 Mosquito, with the fuselage of the Standard Cirrus. The wings feature trailing edge terminal speed dive brakes-variable camber flaps that limit the vertical dive speed to a maximum of 70 knots when the dive brakes are fully deployed. The name \\"Mini Nimbus\\" was adopted to distinguish it from longer-wingspan Nimbus models. It first flew on 18 September 1976.Hardy 1982, p.86. The Mini Nimbus range all feature self-connecting controls, of Glasflügel design, for added safety and ease of rigging, and have been incorporated in all newer Schempp-Hirth models. The trim lever is connected to the flap operating rod and needs to be set only once per flight; thereafter changes in flap setting (-7 to +10 degrees) automatically provides trim compensation. =Variants= Based on the Standard Cirrus, the original Mini-Nimbus HS-7 design had an all-moving tailplane and fibre glass wing spars. A tailplane anti-balance tab was a required modification for certification in the United Kingdom after flight testing by Derek Piggott on behalf of the British Gliding Association revealed very low stick forces and marginal pitch stability of the HS-7 version. A conventional tail was added for the Mini-Nimbus B version. The conventional horizontal stabiliser/elevator configuration was less sensitive to inputs by the pilot making it easier to fly without constantly making small adjustments to the pitch attitude. This was due to the much larger control surface of the former compared to the later configuration. The Mini-Nimbus C version had an increased maximum takeoff weight. Additionally, lighter weight wings with spars and shells of carbon- fibre was available as an option for the C version (meaning that only some Mini Nimbus C has carbon fibre wings, the \\"C\\" is often thought to represent \\"Carbon\\" which is not correct). The Nimbus 2C and the Mini Nimbus C were the first two carbon-fibre aircraft to be built by Schempp-Hirth. The use of carbon-fibre significantly lightened the Mini Nimbus improving its climbing performance and increasing water ballast capacity while making assembly and disassembly much easier. =Performance= The Mini-Nimbus glide ratio was somewhat less competitive than its primary rival in sailplane race competitions, the Alexander Schleicher ASW 20. However its superior climbing performance (altitude gained over time while climbing in lifting air) over its rivals made it the choice of some successful international soaring competition pilots in the late 1970s. One capability of the Mini Nimbus is its powerful trailing-edge integrated air brake/flap system with a 70 kn terminal dive velocity which gives the aircraft strong short field and steep landing approach capabilities. =Production= 159 Mini-Nimbuses were built, many of which remain in use today. =Competition use= George Moffat won the 1977 European Gliding Championships flying a Mini Nimbus Soaring, September 1977 and flew a Mini Nimbus C in the US 15-Meter Gliding Championships.Soaring, October 1979 While no longer considered competitive in the 15-meter class, the Mini Nimbus still competes in the Sports Class of sailplane racing where handicaps are allowed in scoring.

Created by Chicago public relations and advertising man Louis G. Cowan, and originally sponsored by Alka-Seltzer, the series was first broadcast on NBC from Chicago, June 28, 1940, airing as a summer replacement show for Alec Templeton Time. It continued on radio for the next 13 years. On television, the show was seen on NBC and CBS from July 6, 1949 to July 5, 1953, with Joe Kelly as quizmaster, and again from January 12 to September 27, 1956, with Clifton Fadiman as host. The premise of the original show involved Kelly asking questions sent in by listeners and researched by Eliza Hickok and Rachel Stevenson. Kelly often said that he was not an intellectual, and that he could not have answered any of the questions without knowing the answer from his flash card. Yet he was remarkably kind and affable, and put even novice young contestants at ease immediately. The answers were supplied by a panel of five children, chosen for their high IQs, strong academic interests, and appealing personalities, as well as such qualities as poise, quickness, and sense of humor. One of the first Quiz Kids was seven-year-old nature expert Gerard Darrow. For the initial premiere panel he was joined by Mary Ann Anderson, Joan Bishop, George Van Dyke Tiers and Charles Schwartz. Other Quiz Kids of the 1940s, Joan Alizier, Lois Jean Ashbeck, Jack Beckman, Claude Brenner, Geraldine Hamburg, Mary Clare McHugh, David Nasatir, Sally Ann Wilhelm, Ruth Duskin, war refugee Gunther Hollander, Shel Talmy, and math experts Joel Kupperman and Richard Williams. Panelists rotated, with the three top scorers each week joined by two others the following week; they were no longer eligible to participate once they reached the age of 16. New York and Chicago 1940s postcard sent to listeners who submitted questions for the radio show. In 1949–50 the program was expanded to New York, where a series of competitions determined the panelists. Students from the New York City area were chosen from questionnaires distributed to elementary schools, and were \\"interviewed\\" in panels where questions simulating those sent in by listeners were used. Those chosen from the interviews competed weekly for Quiz Kid of the month, with the two weekly winners from each show going on to the monthly \\"finals\\". Monthly winners later competed against each other on another panel, from which the overall winner was chosen. There were also parallel shows hosted by Durward Kirby, involving some of the same panelists. The shows hosted by Durward Kirby were sponsored by The Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn, and were called The Savings Bank Quiz Kids. Norman Lane, age nine, was the winner of the monthly competitions and went on the air in Chicago in one show with the Chicago group. Malcolm Mitchell, age 12, won the three competitions on the parallel series of shows, with Lane second each time, and was selected by the producers to be on several shows with the Chicago Quiz Kid group at NBC Studios in New York. These notably included one where the Kids defeated a group of university professors from New York in \\"general knowledge\\" topics. Mitchell, later a medical professor at Yale, had the special talent of \\"perfect pitch\\" (able to identify musical notes and chords with certainty), which made for interesting radio moments aside from answering straight questions. A television program, now in The Paley Center for Media in New York and Los Angeles, was filmed in 1950 with Milton Berle as guest host and featured the Chicago Quiz Kids. The popularity of the television series never approached that of the radio programs, which first aired on Wednesday evenings and later on Sundays and had a devoted following of both adults and children. The Quiz Kids not only spawned a host of quiz shows starring both extraordinary and ordinary people, but also gave rise to the now more-popular term \\"Whiz Kids,\\" first applied to the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies \\"Whiz Kids\\", and later to several cabinet members in the Kennedy Administration. One of the notable ex-Quiz Kids is the Nobel Prize-winning biologist James D. Watson. Others included actor and dialect coach Robert Easton, legendary Hollywood acting coach Roy London, producer Harve Bennett, poet Marilyn Hacker, Mayo Clinic Chief of Staff Richard Sedlack, and actress Vanessa Brown. Later versions Quiz Kids has been revived six times since the original television series: * The New Quiz Kids aired in Canada from 1978 to 1979 on Global Television Network, hosted by Terry David Mulligan. * In 1980, Jim Mckrell hosted a weekly syndicated edition also titled The New Quiz Kids. * A later American revival aired from October 12, 1981 to December 15, 1982 on CBS Cable, hosted by Norman Lear. * The Quiz Kids Challenge, which featured a panel of three kids playing against three adults, aired in daily syndication from September 10 to December 28, 1990. Jonathan Prince hosted this version while Johnny Gilbert served as announcer. * Bay Area Quiz Kids is a San Francisco-area high school quiz bowl, aired on KRON-TV. *CBS owned-and-operated station KNXT/KCBS-TV in Los Angeles produced their own version, titled Kidquiz, hosted by station weathercaster Maclovio Perez. This version aired for eight years (1984–1992) on the station, usually prior to the start of CBS' Saturday morning programming. In Australia An Australian radio program, after the American model, was first aired on Australian commercial radio in 1938. In 1942 John Dease began hosting Quiz Kids on Radio 2GB, that ran every Sunday evening until 14 October 1962 (with an abortive attempt in 1956–57 to run concurrently on ATN-7 and GTV-9 weekly from 9 June 1957 to 10 November 1957) and transferred to ABC TV in March 1964.

He served as a Member of Parliament for Chester and later Beaumaris, and was appointed Speaker for two English Parliaments during the reign of Charles II. He later served as Solicitor General during the reign of James II. Williams had a bitter personal and professional rivalry with Judge Jeffreys (the hanging judge). Early life Williams was born in Anglesey, the eldest son of Hugh Williams and Emma Dolben. He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, followed by Gray's Inn, to which he was admitted in 1650.Welsh Biography Online Parliament After unsuccessfully standing for Chester in the 1673 by-election, Williams was elected Member of Parliament for the constituency in the 1675 by-election. His profile grew, and he was elected to become Speaker of the House of Commons, a post which he held during the 3rd (Exclusion Bill Parliament, 1680–1681) and 4th (1681; Oxford Parliament) parliaments of Charles II. He was the first Welsh Speaker. In June 1684, allegations were made against him that he had libelled the Duke of York (later James II & VII) for authorizing, as Speaker, the publication of Thomas Dangerfield's Information in 1680. Dangerfield, one of the most notorious of the Popish Plot informers, was by now utterly discredited (he was killed in a scuffle with a barrister the following year). To provide the protection of a seat in parliament, Williams stood and was elected for Montgomeryshire in 1685; however his return was cancelled on petition, on the grounds that the contributory boroughs had no opportunity of voting. The prosecution resumed, and he was fined £10,000. He was also fined £20,000 after similar action was instigated by the Earl of Peterborough. Supporters worked on his behalf, including the Earl of Rochester; subsequently, £8,000 was accepted as full payment for the former fine, and Peterborough accepted a token payment for the latter after persuasion from James, now king. Previously a critic of James II, Williams entered the king's service in 1687, being appointed Solicitor General. He had been knighted two days previously, and in June 1688 he was created a baronet, of Gray's Inn in Middlesex. He held an important role in the prosecution of the Seven Bishops, but the violent antipathy between himself and the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Wright, who accused him, with no relevance whatever to the issue before the Court, of taking bribes, probably contributed to the verdict of not guilty. Judge Jeffreys (the hanging judge) tried to ruin Williams with a fine for publishing a libel: this led to the pair engaging in a bitter personal and professional rivalry. He represented Beaumaris for the 1689 Convention Parliament, and turned against James after he fled England during the Glorious Revolution. He was placed on the committee appointed to draft the Bill of Rights. William III appointed Sir George Treby to succeed him as Solicitor General in the same year. Williams was made a King's Counsel and appointed Custos Rotulorum of Merionethshire and Denbighshire as consolation. The parliament declared the judgement against him for the publication of Dangerfield's Information illegal. He was not elected to Parliament in 1690, and prepared to stand again for Chester with Roger Whitley in 1695. Whitley was instead returned with Sir Thomas Grosvenor, and Williams was again returned for Beaumaris. He refused to take the new oath declaring William the rightful and lawful king, leading to his dismissal as King's Counsel. He left parliament in 1698.History of Parliament Online - Williams, WIlliam Personal life Williams married Margaret Kyffin on 14 April 1664, and they had four sons and one daughter. Williams died at his Gray's Inn chambers in 1700 and was buried at Llansilin in Wales. His baronetcy passed to his son William.

It remained headquartered there from its incorporation in 1990 until it was acquired in 2000 by Unigraphics Solutions, Inc., now a subsidiary of the German technology multinational Siemens AG. During its existence, EAI produced animations to support litigants in court, wrote and sold animation and visualization software, and developed a number of multimedia medical and computer game titles. Part of EAI's business now exists in a spin-off company, Demonstratives. History EAI was incorporated in 1990 by Martin Vanderploeg, Jay Shannan, Jim Bernard, and Jeff Trom, all Ames- based engineers closely involved with Iowa State University's Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) founded by Vanderpoeg and Bernard. Later that year they were joined by a former colleague of Vanderploeg's, Matthew Rizai, a mechanical engineer and software entrepreneur, who became CEO. EAI got its start by producing computer animations to help illustrate crime scenes and other technical courtroom testimony for lawyers and expert witnesses, eventually branching out in to visualization applications in medicine, product design, and a wide range of other applications. In 1994, EAI launched VisLab, an animation package initially written to leverage the graphics capabilities of the SGI UNIX computer platform. At the time, it was considered unusual in its ability to render complex animation in hardware rather than in software. Steve Ursenbach, general manager of SGI's Application Division commented, \\"VisLab is the first software program to take such advantage of our hardware rendering capabilities.\\" VisLab's UI was based on the widely used Motif software. EAI's computer-generated animations were used in reconstructing the TWA Flight 800 plane crash scenario and numerous crime scene investigations, including the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and the Oklahoma City bombing for NBC's Inside Edition. In 1997, EAI collaborated with the American Bar Association Judicial Division Lawyers Conference to produce \\"Computer Animation in the Courtroom – A Primer,\\" a CD-ROM introduction and guide to the use of computer animations in reconstructing crimes. EAI's manufacturing clients included Ford, Motorola, Lockheed Martin, and 3M. =Visualization and collaboration= Based on the initial success of VisLab with automotive companies, EAI developed and released the first commercially viable 3D interactive visualization software package, VisFly, first on the SGI and later the HP and Sun platforms in 1995 and 1996. VisFly was eventually ported to Microsoft Windows and IBM AIX and expanded into the VisView and VisMockup product lines. Networking capabilities were subsequently added to VisFly via NetFly and to VisView/VisMockup via VisNetwork. Providing the visualization software, tools, and network access methods to convert common CAD data into the JT visualization format were keys to this most successful of EAI's business ventures. Networking capabilities were eventually expanded further with e-Vis.com, which provided an internet-hosted environment and many of the features now seen in mainstream collaboration software. =EAI Interactive= By 1996, EAI began to broaden its scope of development. This led to EAI's purchase that year of a small video game developer in Salt Lake City, Utah, headed by Bryan Brandenburg. This new studio became the primary location of EAI Interactive's activities. The Salt Lake City office worked more or less independently, though from time to time it used the services of the main Ames office for overflow work. As an independent game developer, EAI Interactive produced a variety of titles, including Barbie Magic Hair Styler, Trophy Buck for Sierra On-Line, Championship Bass for Electronic Arts, A Bug's Life for Disney Interactive, Clue and Outburst for Hasbro Interactive, and Scooby Doo: Mystery of the Fun Park Phantom and Animaniacs: Titantic Adventure for SouthPeak Games. In addition to game development, EAI's medical and scientific illustration team developed a variety of 3D interactive educational products including The Dynamic Human for McGraw Hill and The Dissectible Human for Elsevier. = Recognition = In the September 1997 issue of Individual Investor magazine, EAI was named one of \\"America's Fastest Growing Companies.\\" In the January 12, 1998, issue of Businessweek, the magazine recognized company CEO Rizai as one of seven notable entrepreneurs of 1997. In 1999, Forbes ASAP magazine ranked the company as one of the 100 most dynamic technology companies in the US, placing it twenty-third overall. =An international company= In its heyday, EAI had offices located across the US and around the world. The company's primary financial success was its visualization software VisFly, later renamed VisView. This product line lives on today as part of Teamcenter from Siemens PLM Software after a series of acquisitions starting in 1999. The litigation supporting animation services portion of EAI continues as a spin-off company called Demonstratives, today a division of Engineering Systems Inc. (ESI), in Aurora, Illinois. Former EAI employees have gone on to work at Pixar, Disney, Zygote Media Group, Hasbro, MediaTech, Milkshake Media, DreamWorks, and Maxis, among others. In 2008, Vanderploeg, Rizai, and others in the EAI management team founded Webfilings (now known as Workiva), a SaaS company specializing in corporate compliance solutions software, also headquartered in Ames.

This present-day minority, the largest German-speaking minority in Hungary, primarily lives in the counties of Tolna (Tolnau), Baranya (Branau), and Somogy (Schomodei) and are regarded as Danube Swabians.  Background  After the Ottoman Empire was defeated in the Second Battle of Mohács in 1687, the Habsburg Monarchy forced the Ottoman Turks to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. Because much of the Pannonian Plain had been depopulated during the Ottoman wars in Europe, the Habsburgs began to resettle the land with various colonists, including Czechs, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats and Germans. = Settlement = German colonization in southeastern Transdanubia began in 1689. While many came from Swabia, the German settlers also came from the Rhenish Palatinate, Hesse, the Westerwald, Fulda, Bavaria, and throughout Franconia. Because of the many Swabian colonists settling on land previously controlled by the Turks, the region of Tolna and Baranya counties became known as Swabian Turkey. The settlers were often induced to immigrate to Hungary with the promise of three years without taxes. The vast majority of German settlement was organized by private ventures run by the nobility or the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the German settlement was in pre-existing Slav- or Magyar-inhabited villages, but some new villages were also founded by Germans. The only two German-founded villages remaining in Swabian Turkey that were established by state ventures were Dunakömlőd (Kimling) and Németkér (Deutsch-Ker). Germans also settled extensively in the major towns of Pécs (Fünfkirchen) and Mohács (Mohatsch).  Post-World War II  During the expulsion of Germans after World War II, many Germans from Swabian Turkey were expelled from their homes and replaced with Hungarians evicted from Czechoslovakia; the remaining Germans were often persecuted by the Communist government. After the fall of communism in 1989, the Transdanubian Germans received minority rights, organisations, schools, and local councils and maintained their own regional dialect of German. However, the Germans are gradually being assimilated.  See also  * Danube Swabians * Volksdeutsche  References  * Krallert, Wilfried. Atlas zur Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung.

Its fuselage is nearly identical to that of the ASW 19, mated to newly designed flapped wings for the 15 metre Class. The prototype first flew in 1977. It proved to be a highly successful glider, winning several World Championships, and was still being flown at this level up to 1995. Developments along its production life included winglets, pneumatic turbulators, and wingtip extensions. It remained in production until 1990, when it was superseded by the ASW 27. 765 were built by Schleicher and a further 140 were made under license by Centrair in France. The ASW 20 was successful in competition, winning numerous world and national championships. Dick Johnson reported that the ASW 20 was the first 15 m glider to demonstrate a measured L/D in excess of 40:1. Roy McMaster, Karl Striedieck and John Seymour won jointly, with others, the world triangle distance record of in 1994 in an ASW 20B. ASW 20s won second and third places in the 15 metre Class at the 1983 World Championships at Hobbs, NM. Construction The ASW 20 is constructed from glass-reinforced plastic. It features trailing edge flaps which interconnect with the ailerons and allow the entire trailing edge to operate as a flap between -9 and +5 degrees. The flaps also act as ailerons, but deflect only half of the aileron amount. Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are provided on the upper wing surface. The B model (introduced in 1983) differs from the A and C model in that it uses a reinforced wing spar, which provides an increased water ballast capacity at the expense of the flexible wing. The B and C model include several enhancements over the original A model, including a lifting panel, hydraulic disc brake, and automatic elevator hookup. The B and C wings also incorporate a pneumatic turbulator system, which draws high pressure air from pitot inlets on the wing and injects it through approximately 860 pinholes into the boundary layer to control underwing airflow separation. ASW 20s that include a L designation may be fitted with a 1.59 m wingtip extension. The F designation was assigned to A variants produced in France by Centrair. Centrair also produced an FL variant equivalent to the German ASW20L, most of these are only permitted to fly without the wingtip extensions due to a deficiency in the wing spar construction. At least three different winglet designs have been produced for the ASW 20, including a NASA winglet fitted to the Centrair gliders (FP), a design by Peter Masak, and a second generation winglet designed by Prof. Mark D. Maughmer of Penn State University (USA). Flight characteristics right The ASW-20 is known as a very pleasant handling glider in most respects. The wing structure composite layup was designed to twist slightly as the wings flexed upward, resulting in the ability to \\"store\\" some of the energy from atmospheric gusts, and then release that energy with a very slight forward thrust force as the wings flexed back downward to their normal position. This concept is known as the Katzmayr Effect, and somewhat mimics a bird's ability to use a flapping motion to propel itself forward in flight. This unique wing twisting movement gave the ASW-20 an ability to make very small but consistent performance gains (or reduced losses) in turbulent and gusty thermal conditions compared to other competition level sailplanes. The landing flaps (55° in early models, 38° in later models), in conjunction with very effective airbrakes, allow the pilot to make exceptionally steep approaches at slow speeds, permitting very short landings when required. Second generation winglets further improved the handling and reduced drag at low to mid speeds. These characteristics have made the ASW-20 a much beloved and desirable aircraft, even after it was no longer competitive in racing. One very common modification was the addition of another intermediate flap setting detent (between Zero and +1 position) which mitigated or softened any \\"tip- stall\\" and incipient spin risk while thermaling in tight, gusty thermals. The flexible wing of the A and C models is particularly favored for ridge running, where it absorbs some of the tremendous turbulence found at ridgetop.

It was intended to see whether a nuclear reactor could be used to power an aircraft, primarily testing airborne operation of a reactor and shielding for components and crew.  Design and development  During the Cold War the USSR had an experimental nuclear aircraft program. Without the need to refuel, a nuclear-powered aircraft would have greatly extended range compared to conventional designs. On 12 August 1955 the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued a directive ordering bomber-related design bureaus to join forces in researching nuclear aircraft. The design bureaus of Andrei Tupolev and Vladimir Myasishchev became the chief design teams, while N. D. Kuznetsov and A. M. Lyulka were assigned to develop the engines. They chose to focus on the direct-cycle system from the start, testing ramjets, jet engines and even turboprops. The Tupolev bureau, knowing the complexity of the task assigned to them, estimated that it would be two decades before the program could produce a working prototype. They assumed that the first operational nuclear-assisted airplane could take to the air in the late 1970s or early 1980s. In order to gain experience with operational problems, they proposed building a flying testbed as soon as possible, mounting a small reactor in a Tupolev Tu-95M to create the Tu-95LAL. The VVRL-lOO reactor was fitted in the bomb bay of the aircraft, requiring aerodynamic fairings over the top and bottom. From 1961 to 1969, the Tu-95LAL completed over 40 research flights.From the television/DVD documentary, Planes That Never Flew: The Atomic Plane, Discovery Channel Europe and Alba Communications Ltd. 2003] Most of these were made with the reactor shut down. The main purpose of the flight phase was examining the effectiveness of the radiation shielding, which was one of the main concerns for the engineers. Liquid sodium, beryllium oxide, cadmium, paraffin wax and steel plates were used for protection. The shielding efficiency is disputed: most sources say that it was at least efficient enough to warrant further work, and indeed, the design of the follow-up prototype, the Tu-119, was started.TestPilot.Ru As in the US, development was curtailed on grounds of cost and environmental concerns. The emerging potential of intercontinental ballistic missiles made the expensive nuclear aircraft program superfluous, and it was scaled back. Tu-119 The next stage in the development of a nuclear-powered bomber would have been the Tupolev Tu-119, a modified Tu-95, which would have been powered by both nuclear-fuelled and kerosene-fuelled turboprop engines: two Kuznetsov NK-14A nuclear-fuelled engines inboard, fed with heat from a fuselage-mounted reactor and two kerosene-fed Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops outboard. The Tu-119 was never completed due to the nuclear-powered bomber project being cancelled on grounds of cost and the dire environmental impact of possible mishaps and accidents.

Kelimutu (pronounced ) is a volcano, close to the small town of Moni in central Flores island in Indonesia. The volcano is around 50 km to the east of Ende, Indonesia, the capital of Ende regency in East Nusa Tenggara province. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that differ in color. The science of the Kelimutu lakes is relatively well-known. Lake colors periodically change due to adjustments in the oxidation-reduction status of the fluid of each lake, and also considering the abundance of different major elements, such as iron and manganese. Oxidation-reduction status depends on the balance of volcanic gas input and rainfall rate, and is thought to be mediated by the groundwater system in the volcano itself.Pasternack, G. B. 1993. Acid-brine crater lake systematics: a case study. Undergraduate High Honors thesis. Wesleyan University, 160 pp, 4 appendices. DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.3414.1040. The colors in the lakes change independently from each other, as each has its own unique connectivity to the underlying volcano's activity. Between January and November 2016, the colors of the craters changed six times. Although it is widely believed that the changes are unpredictable, it is more accurate to say that the lack of any regular monitoring of the volcanic system precludes scientists from having the data necessary to drive widely available predictive models. Geological details The volcano contains three striking summit crater lakes of varying colors. Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People) is usually blue and is the westernmost of the three lakes. The other two lakes, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) are separated by a shared crater wall and are typically green or red respectively. The lake colors vary on a periodic basis. Subaqueous fumaroles are the probable cause of active upwelling that occurs at the two eastern lakes. The lakes have been a source of minor phreatic eruptions in historical time. The summit of the compound 1639-m-high Kelimutu volcano is elongated two km in a WNW-ESE direction; the older cones of Kelido and Kelibara are located respectively three km to the north and two km to the south. The scenic lakes are a popular tourist destination.'Kelimutu: Adventure to the Three coloured lakes', Accessed 29 April 2012. Kelimutu is also of interest to geologists because the three lakes have different colors yet are at the crest of the same volcano. Here's a link to the abstract According to Kelimutu National Park officials, the colour changes as a result of chemical reactions resulting from the minerals contained in the lake perhaps triggered by volcano gas activity.Some details of the characteristics of volcanic soils in the area can be found at Hikmatullah, H. Subagyo, and B.H. Prasetyo, 'Soil properties of the eastern toposequence of Mount Kelimutu, Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara and their potential for agricultural use', Indonesian Jour. of Agricultural Science, 4(1), 2003, pp. 1-11. However, it is more accurate to refer to the color changes as being driven by oxidation-reduction chemical dynamics. Kawah Putih lake in West Java, south of Bandung, is another crater lake in Indonesia with some similarities to the lakes at Kelimutu. Tourism In the early days of developing the local national park in the Kelimutu area, there were some disputes with local communities over the use of the resources. More recently, forest rangers have worked to develop better relations with nearby village communities and overall management has improved.Tifa Asrianti, 'Locals help protect Kelimutu national park', The Jakarta Post, 4 January 2011. Kelimutu is one of the mountains listed as a ribu in Indonesia which are mountains in Indonesia which are more than 1,000 meters high.

Early life Nixon was born in Elk Township, Vinton County, Ohio, the son of Samuel Brady Nixon, who was from Smith Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, and Sarah Ann (née Wadsworth), a native of Hocking Township, Fairfield County, Ohio. Nixon's family ancestry included colonial Pennsylvania Quakers. He was raised Methodist, however, but converted to Quakerism when he married Hannah Milhous. Sarah Nixon died during January 1888, Francis being sent to live with an uncle during his father's struggle to avoid poverty and cope with the loss of Sarah. Samuel remarried, Aitken citing Francis' disliking of his stepmother as his motive for going away. Nixon proceeded to have multiple jobs during the next fourteen years. Throughout his youth, Nixon idealized U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Ambrose wrote that Nixon ceased favoring the Democratic Party by the age of 17. During the campaign for the 1896 United States presidential election, Nixon had an encounter with presidential candidate William McKinley, who asked him how he was going to vote, Nixon replying, \\"Republican, of course!\\" Ambrose cited the encounter as completing Nixon's switch to favoring the Republican Party. Career Nixon relocated to California at the end of the century after having been frostbitten working as a motorman in an open streetcar in Columbus, Ohio. After working as a farmhand and petroleum roustabout, he attempted to cultivate lemons outside Los Angeles. After his son Richard was born, Nixon abandoned the lemon grove, and the family relocated to the Quaker community of Whittier, California. Nixon worked the family business, a store that sold groceries and Atlantic Richfield gasoline, but the family remained impoverished. Nixon's life was marked by the deaths of his two sons, Arthur and Harold, from tuberculosis. He has been described as a \\"restless, frustrated, and angry man, a mean-spirited person who psychologically abused his five sons and sometimes beat them.\\" However, Richard always spoke well of his parents. He often spoke lovingly of his mother as a \\"Quaker saint\\", and began his memoirs with the words \\"I was born in a house my father built\\". Writer Jessamyn West, a cousin of the Nixons, was in Frank's Sunday school class for some time. She later described him as \\"a fiery persuasive teacher\\", and wrote that Frank Nixon's version of the social gospel made her favor socialism.West, Jessamyn. Double Discovery: A Journey New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980; p. 125. By the time of his later adulthood, Nixon often discussed his political opinions with strangers, his son Don remembering his father as being willing to debate anyone he encountered in the family market and having an intolerance of Democrats.Ambrose, pp. 34-36. Nixon voted for Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 United States presidential election, Warren G. Harding in the 1920 presidential election, Herbert Hoover in both the 1928 and 1932 presidential elections, and Franklin Roosevelt in the 1936 election. Aitken described these as erratic voting habits that displayed changing political loyalties in the early life of his son Richard.Aitken, pp. 44-45. After his son Arthur's death in 1925, Nixon frequently pondered and was haunted by the possibility of God allowing the death as a form of punishment directed toward him, his actions afterward being never again to open the family store on Sundays and having the family listen to sermons every evening. Nixon favored Robert P. Shuler, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson, taking his sons once a week to hear either Shuler or McPherson at Trinity Methodist Church.Aitken, pp. 49-56. In 1938, Francis' son Richard met Pat Ryan, who Frank reportedly developed a \\"playful relationship\\" with and spared the same criticisms he had given his children. During the controversy concerning Richard's alleged improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses, Frank was \\"reduced to sobs\\" in hearing of the story and angered by his son's taking of any funds. The elder Nixons cared for their granddaughters Julie and Patricia while Vice President Nixon was involved with activities relating to the 1956 Republican National Convention. Francis experienced a ruptured abdominal artery in the latter part of the month from which he was not expected to recover, resulting in the vice president curtailing his public appearances to tend to his father, who advocated that his son return to San Francisco and work with the convention; Vice President Nixon refused. On September 3, Nixon was visited by Richard, who he told upon the latter leaving, \\"Good night Dick, but I don't think I'll be here in the morning.\\"Aitken, p. 286 The next day, Francis Nixon died, his funeral being performed three days later at the East Whittier Friends Meeting House.Ambrose, pp. 407-408. Personal life On June 25, 1908, he married Hannah Milhous. Together, they had five sons: *Harold Samuel Nixon (June 1, 1909 – March 7, 1933) *Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) *Francis Donald Nixon (November 23, 1914 – June 27, 1987) *Arthur Burdg Nixon (May 26, 1918 – August 10, 1925) *Edward Calvert Nixon (May 3, 1930 - February 27, 2019) Nixon died on September 4, 1956 in La Habra, California, U.S. In popular culture He was played by actor Tom Bower in Oliver Stone's movie Nixon.

The concept had been developed at Canadair from the CL-85, a study for the carriage of dispatches. West Germany later joined the group,\\"Defence: Drones on Test\\". Flight International, 31 August 1967, Volume 92, Number 3051. p. 350. and although the United States was invited to join, they declined. The first, less than successful flight was made at Yuma, Arizona in March 1964. The British wanted changes in the system (consisting of the drone, the launcher, the retrieval equipment and the support) to be \\"Soldier Proof\\". They sent an army officer to Canadair and with his help set up a maintenance advisory group which had excellent results. CL-89 had a difficult development and was almost abandoned. The first complete CL-89 system was supplied to the West Germans in 1969. During the 1970s, Both France and Italy joined the British and West Germans in operating the CL-89. NATO gave the entire system the designation AN/USD-501 (Army Navy Unmanned Surveillance Drone type 501); in UK service it was known as the Midge (Military Intelligence & Data Gathering Equipment). The system was designed for information collecting at a divisional level. In Royal Artillery service Midge was operated by a troop in a divisional locating battery. This troop had two launchers, all the facilities for processing and analysing imagery and for repair and servicing of the aircraft. The troop comprised two officers and about 70 soldiers. Tasking was through the artillery intelligence cell at divisional HQ and the primary use was to confirm suspected enemy locations, particularly hostile artillery. In UK service Midge replaced the Northrop Radioplane SD-1, known in service as \\"Observer\\", and was replaced in turn by Phoenix. Midge was used operationally in Kuwait in 1991, with some effect especially when combined with artillery raids. In German Army service, CL-89 was operated by a battery in the divisional observation battalion. The organisation was similar to the British but had six officers and about 120 soldiers. Logistic support for CL-89 was provided to user nations through NAMSA. =CL-289= CL-289 NATO AN USD 502 In November 1987, an agreement was signed between Canada, West Germany and France for the production of the CL-289 system. The design of this was started in 1974. It was a larger drone with better range and payload than the CL-89. It was intended to obtain corps level intelligence for the armies of NATO. Although similar in appearance to the CL-89, many changes in design were necessary. The CL-289 entered service in November 1990, the entire system being designated AN/USD-502.  Description  The cylindrical body had four stub-wings at the rear of the fuselage, with aerodynamic trim provided by smaller canard foreplanes. Although the drone looked and flew like a missile and was launched from truck- mounted rails, it cruised under jet power. Takeoff was achieved by a booster rocket, which was jettisoned when flight speed was attained. A small turbojet then took over for the rest of the flight The flight pattern was programmed and allowed for the flight to the target areas, a run while the cameras or sensors recorded, and the return to the recovery site. On arrival at this calculated position, the motor cut and a drogue parachute was deployed. This slowed the drone down sufficiently to alter its attitude and allow a parachute to be released from the underside of the drone causing it to invert. Before reaching the ground a pair of pneumatic landing bags were released from the top of the drone (now facing the ground). The retrieval crew would then remove the cameras etc., and return the drone to be ready for its next flight. A camera or sensor, dependent on the mission, could be fitted to the CL-89, and multiple units to the CL-289. Being a drone meant that it flew a programmed course and was not under any form of external control. In the CL-89 the programmed flight path was constrained by the very limited number of 'events' that could be programmed. These events including turns, changes in altitude, sensor activations/de-activations and landing. The programmed flightpath had to be corrected for meteorological conditions. Data for this was provided by a standard artillery Target Acquisition meteor message. Two types of sensors were used with the CL-89, both using photographic film that was processed and analysed after the drone was recovered. Standard black and white film was normally used in daylight, with flares available for night use. Infrared linescan, an early form of thermal imaging was generally used at night. Three types of sensors were used with the British Drone Troops, Vinten (day sensor), Zeiss (day and night) and IRLS (day and night).

It was built, along with the Maverik Center (originally known as the E Center) in West Valley City, to serve as an ice hockey and figure skating practice venue for the 2002 Winter Olympics. It currently serves as the home of the BYU Cougars men's ice hockey team, Peaks Youth Hockey Association, several high school teams, the Peaks Figure Skating Club, as well as a Learn-to-Skate USA program for beginning skaters of all ages. History Provo was chosen as the site for an Olympic venue because the leaders of Utah County refused to support Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum unless they were promised at least one Olympic event would be held in the county. Originally county leaders wanted a speed skating oval built somewhere in Provo or on the campus of Utah Valley University; others suggested the game's Closing Ceremony could be held at Brigham Young University's football stadium. After the 1989 Olympic referendum passed, and Salt Lake City lost its 1991 bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics, the Utah Sports Authority and Provo City decided to wait until Salt Lake City bid again for the 2002 Winter Olympics before any venue planning would start. After Salt Lake City won the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995, planning began again for what venue Utah County could host. It was decided that the city of Provo would host the venue, but that it would only be a practice ice sheet, mostly like to be built in the planned Provo Towne Centre mall. Eventually plans changed and a larger, yet still only a practice ice facility, was planned to be constructed near Provo's East Bay Golf Course. Utah County, Provo, and SLOC all okayed the plans and committed to building the $7.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) facility. But in July 1996, before construction had started, the owners of Provo's Seven Peaks Waterpark approached the city and asked that the arena be built on the park's property, and Seven Peaks would pay for an additional ice sheet to be constructed in the same building. The plan was approved by county officials October 14, 1996, with Provo paying $2 million, Utah County $2 million, SLOC $3 million, and Seven Peaks donating land for the arena and parking spaces. Valentiner, Crane, Brunjes, Onyon Architecture was chosen to design the arena. The additional ice sheet at the Peaks Ice Arena, June 2017 On September 17, 1997 ground was broken for construction next to Seven Peaks Waterpark. It was to be in size, with two ice sheets side by side. One ice sheet would have seating for about 2,000 spectators while the other would seat 300. By the time ground was broken the price had increased to $8.5 million, $1.5 million more than originally planned; the extra cost would be paid for by Seven Peaks. Soon after construction had begun SLOC decided to host competitive hockey events in the new arena, versus the original plan to use the arena for practices, and using Utah Valley University's UCCU Center (then known as the McKay Events Center) for the competitions. SLOC would contribute $5.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) towards the project, the cost of which had just jumped to $10.75 million, with the addition of 12 locker rooms instead of four, extra seating, and other minor additions to the original plan. The arena opened November 20, 1998 in what was considered a \\"soft opening\\", and following the completion of minor work, the arena was supposed to have a grand opening in January or February 1999. But in December 1998 allegations of a scandal involving SLOC members, and members of the International Olympic Committee concerning the 2002 Olympic bid surfaced, pushing back the grand opening. As a result, the grand opening celebration was held September 29, 1999, and the venue hosted its first event, a hockey game between the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs and the University of Calgary Oval Extremes, two days later. The completed arena cost $12.4 million to build, included two ice sheets, had seating for over 2,000 spectators, and was in size. On November 20, 2008 Provo City took control of the arena from Seven Peaks owner Max Rabner, resolving a lawsuit that had been on going for years over the original construction and management agreements. The arena is now operated by the Parks and Recreation Department of Provo. 2002 Winter Olympics February 2002 Olympic ice hockey game between Austria and Lavia inside the arena During the 2002 games both men's and women's ice hockey games and practices were held in the arena. Because of its original size over 6,000 temporary seats had to be installed to boost the ice center's capacity to 8,400, including press members. 93 percent of tickets were sold, for a total 131,067 of spectators witnessing events in the arena. The arena today The arena is home to the Peaks Figure Skating Club. The arena also serves as home ice for the ACHA collegiate hockey team of Brigham Young University, and high school teams including Timpanogos, Utah County Independent, Lehi, Payson, Spanish Fork and Springville, as well as the Peaks Youth Hockey Association. The arena is open to the public for ice skating, skating lessons, and can even be used for indoor soccer games.

It is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. with the license held by Phoenix FCC License Sub, LLC. It airs an Alternative Rock radio format. Its studios are located in Phoenix, while its transmitter is in South Mountain Park. History The first radio station on 93.3 in Phoenix was short-lived KYEW, owned by Frank S. Barc, which went on the air May 9, 1960. KYEW's license was canceled and its call letters deleted as of April 18, 1962. On April 20, 1968, the current 93.3 license first signed on the air as the sister station to 1510 AM (now KFNN). Originally, the station was KMND, broadcasting an easy listening music format branded as \\"Command Radio\\". On August 23, 1971, the format was changed to Progressive Rock. In many respects, this format was a continuation of the freeform format of KCAC, a daytime-only station that was going bankrupt. According to KDKB co-owner Dwight Tindle, he and KCAC program director, William Edward \\"Bill\\" Compton, \\"invented KDKB\\" and its air sound. Moreover, Compton and several of KCAC's DJs were hired to staff KDKB. KDKB- FM's rock format was simulcast on 1510 KDKB (AM). In 1978, the AM simulcast was broken and 1510 changed formats to oldies. The AM call letters were changed to KDJQ (\\"The Golden Rock\\") with program director Robert M. Chenault and morning DJ Griffin Gary \\"Toad Hall\\" Kinsey, followed later by Bruce \\"Brother\\" Baumbush. In 1980, the format on KDJQ changed to new wave music for a brief time, with Jonathan \\"Johnny D.\\" Dixon as the program director and Jonathan L as assistant program director, music director, and evening personality. 1510 is now broadcasting a Financial/Business News format as KFNN. KDKB was the first Album Oriented Rock (AOR) station in the Phoenix media market, and one of the first AOR stations in America. Throughout the 1980s, KDKB evolved into more of an adult-leaning direction focusing on the classic rock artists. Starting in March 1989, KDKB was anchored in mornings by the \\"Tim & Mark\\" show. The show proved to be one of the most popular in Phoenix radio history, lasting through 2005. The show featured regular segments like \\"Helium Hilarity\\" and \\"Rump Ranger.\\" Tim & Mark would do night time anniversary shows every year at places like the Tempe Improv and the Celebrity Theater. Tim & Mark also contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to local charities through their self-formed \\"Tim & Mark Charities.\\" They would sell their annual \\"Best Of Tim & Mark\\" CDs throughout the Valley while doing autograph signings at Wherehouse Record stores. All of the profits were then given to charity. Tim & Mark left KDKB in early 2005. Their last show featured listeners calling in and thanking them for their show and also had Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano and Secretary of State Betsy Bayless call in to thank them and wish them well. On September 5, 2006, KDKB began playing full-length albums of classic rock artists without the use of any on- air personalities. On September 15, 2006, KDKB returned to its Mainstream Rock format with the new slogan, \\"Everything That Rocks\\", including a larger variety of Rock artists along with special programming features including '80s themed weekends. In mid 2010, the station initiated the slogan, \\"KDKB Rocks Arizona!\\", and retooled the entire on-air lineup. In the fall of 2013, the station changed its lineup and featuring Shmonty & Conklin in the mornings, Ruby Cheeks midday, KDKB's Program Director and DJ Paul \\"Neanderpaul\\" Marshall in afternoons, and Mike Gaube at night.

At the time he was appointed to the District Court, he was the youngest sitting judge in the country. His service was terminated on August 3, 1982, due to elevation to the Fifth Circuit. He was succeeded by Judge Joe Fish. = Appellate Court = Higginbotham was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on July 1, 1982, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Reynaldo Guerra Garza. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on July 27, 1982, and received commission on July 30, 1982. In 2005, he moved his chambers from Dallas, Texas to Austin, Texas. He assumed senior status on August 28, 2006. Supreme Court consideration In 1986, when the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States was flailing, Higginbotham was widely considered the leading replacement candidate. After Senators Lloyd Bentsen and Dennis DeConcini came out in support of his nomination, the Reagan administration, unwilling to allow the senators to both prevent the appointment of Bork and dictate the next nominee, declined to nominate Higginbotham.Newsweek, Vol. 116, p. 61 (1990).Jan Crawford Greenburg, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, p. 62 (2007). The nomination eventually went to Justice Anthony Kennedy. Other service For many years, Higginbotham was a faculty member at the Federal Judicial Center and, as an appointee of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. He served as president of the American Inns of Court Foundation, and in 1996 the Dallas chapter of that organization renamed itself after him. He has been a leading proponent and former chairman of The Center for American and International Law, a Dallas-based organization which aims to train foreign and domestic lawyers and police officers, a Fellow of the American Bar Association, chairman of its Appellate Judges Conference, member of the Board of Editors of the ABA Journal, and advisor to the National Center for State Courts on its study of habeas corpus. He is also a lifetime member of the American Law Institute and a member of the Board of Overseers, Institute of Civil Justice, RAND Corporation. Speeches and writings Higginbotham has published a number of articles in law reviews and newspapers.See, e.g., Two Judges' Persepctives on Trial by Jury, 12 Tex. Wesleyan L.

Notable opinions *In In re LTV Securities Litigation, 88 F.R.D. 134 (N.D. Tex. 1980), Higginbotham formulated one of the earliest versions of the \\"fraud on the market\\" theory of loss causation, using language later quoted by the Supreme Court when it adopted the theory, see Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 244 (1988). *In Schultea v. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc), Higginbotham allowed under Rule 7 notice pleading in potential qualified immunity cases but required, in reply to an allegation of qualified immunity, more detailed pleading, a tack later approved by the Supreme Court. *In Flores v. City of Boerne, 73 F.3d 1352 (5th Cir. 1996), Higginbotham upheld the Religious Freedom Restoration Act against the claim that the Act exceeded Congress's powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court later reversed the decision. *In Doe v. Beaumont Independent School District, 240 F.3d 462 (5th Cir. 2001) (en banc), Higginbotham found that public school students and their parents had standing to challenge district's \\"Clergy in Schools\\" volunteer counseling program and that facts issues required reversal of summary judgment to defendants. *In Van Orden v. Perry, 351 F.3d 173 (5th Cir. 2003), Higginbotham upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a Ten Commandments display on the Texas State Capitol, concluding that its secular history and purpose rendered it constitutional. The Supreme Court later affirmed. *Between 2000 and 2006, Higginbotham, sitting as the Circuit Judge along with two district judges in a Voting Rights Act three-judge panel, twice changed Texas's Congressional districts. His later effort, which struck a balance between competing interests while hewing closely to the Texas legislature's intent, was widely hailed.Burka, Paul, Senior Executive Editor of Texas Monthly (2006). Exit Lines. Retrieved 2007-01-01. *In June Medical Services v. Russo, 30 F.3d 397 (5th Cir. 2018), Higginbotham dissented in a case upholding Louisiana's Act 620, which requires physicians performing abortions to have active admitting privileges at a hospital within thirty miles of a clinic. Higginbotham criticized the majority for reviewing the statute de novo, as a district court would, saying, \\"Appellate judges are not the triers of fact. It is apparent that when abortion comes on stage it shadows the role of settled judicial rules.\\" Present Higginbotham continues to maintain a full workload on the court, though he has taken senior status. He is Jurist in Residence at St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas, where he teaches courses in Constitutional Law and Federal Courts. He has also taught at the University of Texas School of Law, the University of Alabama School of Law, the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, and the Texas Tech University School of Law. The University of Alabama School of Law maintains an endowed scholarship in his name. He was married to Elizabeth O'Neal Higginbotham until her death on June 10, 2017, at the age of 78.Dallas Morning News, June 14, 2017. They have two daughters, Anne Elizabeth and Patricia Lynn, and 6 grandchildren. He lives on his ranch in Blanco, Texas.  Awards and Recognition  * Samuel E.

The strings in each multiple-string course are typically tuned in unison or an octave. Normally, the term course is used to refer to a single string only on an instrument that has also multi-string courses. For example, a nine-string baroque guitar has five courses: most are two-string courses but sometimes the lowest or the highest consists of a single string. An instrument with at least one multiple-string course is referred to as coursed, while one whose strings are all played individually is uncoursed.  Rationale and types  Multiple string courses were probably originally employed to increase the volume of instruments, in eras in which electrical amplification did not exist, and stringed instruments might be expected to accompany louder instruments (such as woodwinds or brass). Eventually, however, they came to be employed to alter the timbral characteristics (the \\"tone\\") of instruments as well. Strings within a multistring course may have all the strings tuned to the same pitch (e.g. mandolins); they may be tuned to the same pitch class but in different octaves (e.g. Tiple); or the strings may be tuned to different pitches, usually for special effect.See for Example. Examples of instruments that use two-string courses include: Examples of instruments that use three-string courses include: * Saz * Cimbalom * Guitarrón chileno * Mandriola * Piano * Tiple colombiano * Twelve-string bass Examples of instruments that use four- (or more) string courses include: * Cimbalom * Guitarrón chileno As may be seen, some instruments contain courses with differing numbers of strings. A typical piano, for example, contains courses with one, two, and three strings, in different parts of its range. Mandolins All members of the mandolin family, except some versions of the lowest-pitched, have courses each of two or three strings, most commonly eight strings in four courses. The exception is some varieties of mando-bass, which have four individual strings. 12-string guitar. The one shown here is an Ibanez instrument. Lutes Guitars =Baroque guitar= The baroque guitar has five courses, with the bottom four always double strung, and the top string (the \\"chanterelle\\") either double or single. There are also several patterns of modern ten-string guitar but all have ten single strings, played individually. =Twelve-string guitar= The twelve-string guitar has twelve strings, in six courses. The courses are most often tuned E-A-D-G-B-E, similarly to a six-string guitar; however, older instruments were often tuned one tone lower D-G-C-F-A-D to reduce the tension on the neck, and commonly played with a capo on fret 2. The lowest three courses (E-A-D) are normally tuned at octaves, with the primary string uppermost and the octave below it, while the upper two courses (B-E) are tuned to unison. The G course is either unison or at octaves. On some electric twelve-string guitars, and most notably the Rickenbacker 360/12, the octave strings are below the primary strings. Tiple Tiple Colombiano American tiple The national instrument of Colombia, the tiple Colombiano, has four courses of three strings each. Its higher-pitched relative, the tiple requinto, is similarly triple-strung. The American tiple, a smaller instrument loosely derived from the Colombian tiple, uses two double-strung courses and two triple-strung courses. Twelve-string bass Detail of twelve string bass The electric twelve-string bass has twelve strings in four triple courses. Basses have also been built with six double courses and other configs but these are very rare.

It was built in 1959 as venue for ice hockey, figure-skating competitions and the opening and closing ceremonies at the 1960 Winter Olympics and held 8,500 people. Standing-room crowds of 10,000 people were reported for the hockey games between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (on the second-to-last day of the 1960 Winter Olympics) and the U.S.-Czechoslovakia ice hockey game during the final day. Named for Charles R. Blyth, an investment banker who led the California Olympic Commission, Blyth Arena was open on its south side, enabling a view of the mountains. The 400m speed skating track was just to the south of the open side of the arena. This side of the arena also faced the 70m and 90m ski jumps and the slopes of Squaw Valley now known as the Red Dog. Following the Olympic Games, the wood constructed ski jump facilities were left unmaintained and slowly deteriorated over time. In 1963 the 400m speed skating track was replaced by a parking lot in spite of protests from California speed skaters; since at the time it was known to be the only mechanically frozen 400m track in the country. From 1963 to 1983, the Squaw Valley ski area operator appealed regularly to the state of California to have the arena torn down to provide still more parking. Destruction In 1982 the United States Department of Agriculture made a push for energy conservation. One part of that program was funding to improve insulation on many buildings. The U.S. Forest Service received some of that money to insulate the roof of the arena and the next year the roof collapsed. What was not appreciated at the time was that the roof was not built to hold much snow, but had survived for 23 years without a problem. The plan had always been that heat generated from the ice chilling equipment in the arena traveled to the ceiling, warmed the uninsulated roof, and melted the snow. With the energy conservation measures in place, the snow did not melt due to waste heat and the building collapsed under the weight. The arena was demolished in 1983 after the roof collapsed due to snow accumulation. The site is now a parking lot for the Squaw Valley ski resort. Although gone, Blyth Arena is remembered as playing a major role in Olympic ice-hockey history, and to a lesser extent, in Olympic figure-skating history, where the host country won the men's (David Jenkins) and women's (Carol Heiss) individual titles. In addition to its use by the Olympics, the arena was for several years a site for the Worldwide Church of God's annual Feast of Tabernacles. Evangelists Herbert W. Armstrong and Garner Ted Armstrong spoke at the arena several times during the period that the Feast of Tabernacles was held in Squaw Valley. Replacement There is a new ice arena at High Camp at the top of the cable car tramway, at 2500 meters. This rink is essentially an outdoor rink which is covered during late spring, summer and early fall. The roof panels are removed for the winter or the wind could potentially remove them. There is a set of Olympic rings hanging at this rink, causing many people to think that the 1960 Olympic figure skating and hockey were conducted on this new ice rink even though there is no seating around the rink nor any way for spectators to have accessed the rink in 1960.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helmintho- toxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. It is directly implicated in epithelial cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. PRG2 is a 117-residue protein that predominates in eosinophil granules. It is a potent enzyme against helminths and is toxic towards bacteria and mammalian cells in vitro. The eosinophil major basic protein also causes the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils, and activates neutrophils and alveolar macrophages.  Structure  Structurally the major basic protein (MBP) is similar to lectins (sugar-binding proteins), and has a fold similar to that seen in C-type lectins. However, unlike other C-type lectins (those that bind various carbohydrates in the presence of calcium), MBP does not bind either calcium or any of the other carbohydrates that this family recognize. Instead, MBP recognises heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

KG is a German family-owned company that operates worldwide and is known for its high-pressure cleaners, floor care equipment, parts cleaning systems, wash water treatment, military decontamination equipment and window vacuum cleaners. Headquartered in Winnenden, Germany, it produces both cleaning equipment and full cleaning systems. The company is the world market leader in cleaning technology and employs more than 10,000 people worldwide. In 2017 it posted sales revenues of €2.5 billion ($2.88 billion)https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nyc- parks-historical-dover-patrol-monument-to-receive-restorative-cleaning-from- renowned-karcher-group-300710621.html and sold more than 13 million machines. Kärcher has 100 subsidiaries in 60 countries.  History  The inventor Alfred Kärcher (1901–59) from Baden-Württemberg founded the company in 1935 in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt. Initially Kärcher specialised in the design of industrial submersible heating elements, i.e. in salt smelters which were heated with immersion heaters. After numerous experiments, a hardening furnace for alloys was produced, the so-called “Kärcher Salt-Bath Furnace”. Some 1,200 units were sold up to 1945. Karcher invented the first modern pressure washer, the DS 350 in 1950. The company’s main focus then switched to cleaning equipment for professional and private users. Since then, Kärcher has made lead in the design and development of pressure washers. The company’s product range was expanded and now covers the entire field of cleaning (sweepers, detergents, scrubber-driers, wet and dry vacuums, vacuum cleaners, battery- powered brooms, steam cleaners, dry ice blasting equipment, parts cleaners, water treatment systems, vehicle washes and wastewater recycling systems). Kärcher also offers pumps and watering systems. In 1974 the corporate color was changed from blue to yellow. From that year, under the leadership of Alfred Kärcher’s widow Irene Kärcher, the company launched the HD 555, the first pressure washer for private users. Today the family-owned company, which is based in Winnenden near Stuttgart, is represented in 160 countries with 100 subsidiaries all over the world, selling commercial cleaning equipment as well as cleaning equipment for the private consumer. Kärcher owns the American brands of Landa, Hotsy, and Shark pressure washers, Cuda parts washers, Watermaze water treatment systems, and Windsor Kärcher Group floor cleaning systems, and Italian manufacturing company Hawk Pumps, or Woma Pumps in Germany. They are the primary supplier of cleaning systems to both NATO and the US Military.  Common noun  In some countries such as Germany, France, Poland, Russia, Georgia, Mexico and the United States the term Kärcher is colloquially used synonymously with a pressure washer used to clean cars, outdoor equipment etc. French politician Nicolas Sarkozy once declared that La Courneuve, a banlieue outside of Paris where a boy was killed by a stray gunshot, would be \\"cleaned out with a Kärcher\\" (nettoyer la cité au Kärcher) -- meaning all criminals and other undesirables should be removed and washed out. This comment was highly controversial, as many French associate the banlieues with immigrants, especially North Africans. Sarkozy's use of the word led to it becoming a verb: \\"to Karcher\\" or \\"Karcherize\\". Presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen told residents of Argenteuil, many of them immigrants, \\"If some want to Karcherize you, to exclude you, we want to help you get out of these ghettos.\\" As a response, Kärcher France sent a letter to all of the candidates in the 2007 presidential election asking them not to use the company's name this way, and has run ads in newspapers disassociating itself from the remarks. Cultural sponsorship Under its cultural sponsorship program, Kärcher has supported more than 90 projects to clean internationally prominent buildings such as the National Monument in Jakarta (2014), the London Eye in London (2013),http://www.itv.com/news/london/story/2013-03-20/cleaning-the-london- eye/ the Space Needle in Seattle (2008), the Presidents’ heads at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial (2005),https://www.myvan.com/craft-and-makers- en/kaercher-sprinter-worldwide/ the Colossi of Memnon in Luxor (2003), the Colonnades on St Peter’s Square in Rome (1998), the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin (1990) the Statue of Liberty in New York City (1985) and the Statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro (1980). In 2011 it cleaned the Loreley open-air stage and the N Seoul Tower. Kärcher is also a partner of SOS Children’s Villages and a member of the UN Global Compact network.

Until 1998 Argentina employed a four- digit postal code for each municipality, with the first digit representing a region in the country, except in the case of the city of Buenos Aires (which had different postal codes starting in 1000 and with the other numbers varying according to the zone). The unique codes became the base for the newer system, officially called CPA (', Argentine Postal Code). Usage The CPA is not mandatory for private use, but companies that do mass mailings are benefit from discount if they use the CPA. Despite this, the CPA is still not in wide use by private persons, and even government sources and private businesses often list only the base code (the old system). In order to ease the adoption of the new postal code, the former state mail company (') provides a look-up feature on its website. The CPA is intended to improve the quality and speed of mail delivery, but mail without a well-formed CPA will be delivered correctly as well. Structure The CPA consists of three parts: *A single letter (ISO 3166-2:AR) that references the province (for example, C for Capital Federal, Q for Neuquén). *Four digits (the old postal code or a variation of it on the last digits) showing the town or city. *Three letters, identifying a side of the city block where the address is located. =Position 1= The first letter in the CPA, which identifies the province, has its origins in the old Argentine license plates system, which gave each province a letter, usually its initial.

In the 1970s, the station moved to a Top 40 format, and later easy listening and Adult Contemporary, before becoming a rock station in March 1979. During this time, KUPD-FM's original license was not renewed as the result of a 1988 comparative renewal hearing for KUKQ and KUPD- FM, in which the stations lost their original licenses for lying to the Federal Communications Commission about an alleged secret owner. An additional owner was ruled unfit to hold a license due to a 1982 criminal conviction in Arizona. The stations were instead awarded to former owner Jack Grimm, his wife Jackie, and Ruth Clifford, doing business as Tempe Radio, Inc. In 1992, after years of appeals, Grimm and Clifford took over KUKQ and KUPD-FM on new licenses, retaining the call letters, facilities and formats of the stations by buying them from Tri-State Broadcasting.

It is located from the center of Paris. History The history of La Courneuve begins, as that of the rest of the region, with the invasion of European tribes and the eventual conquering of the area by the Romans. During the Middle Ages, the area was like many other small villages. With its proximity to Paris, it soon became a fashionable country destination, with a number of gentry residing there. It had two notable châteaux - Sainte-Foi and Poitronville. Towards the end of Napoleon's reign, the entire area experienced large population growth. This along with improved methods of farming eventually transformed the area into the major legume producer for the Paris regional. In 1863, the first major industrial enterprise was introduced and the area soon became a strange mix of factories and farmlands. Industrial estates were juxtaposed with bean plantations and that would continue until after World War II. During the 1960s, as Paris could no longer meet the demands of a further exploding population (largely the result of immigration from former colonies), La Courneuve, like many other suburbs of Paris, was designated as one of the \\"zones à urbaniser en priorité\\" (areas to be urbanized quickly) and was built up at a very rapid pace, with the construction of large council estates and tower blocks and other HLM developments.

The osmolarity of a solution is usually expressed as Osm/L (pronounced \\"osmolar\\"), in the same way that the molarity of a solution is expressed as \\"M\\" (pronounced \\"molar\\"). Whereas molarity measures the number of moles of solute per unit volume of solution, osmolarity measures the number of osmoles of solute particles per unit volume of solution. This value allows the measurement of the osmotic pressure of a solution and the determination of how the solvent will diffuse across a semipermeable membrane (osmosis) separating two solutions of different osmotic concentration.  Unit  The unit of osmotic concentration is the osmole. This is a non-SI unit of measurement that defines the number of moles of solute that contribute to the osmotic pressure of a solution. A milliosmole (mOsm) is 1/1,000 of an osmole. A microosmole (μOsm) (also spelled micro-osmole) is 1/1,000,000 of an osmole. Types of solutes Osmolarity is distinct from molarity because it measures osmoles of solute particles rather than moles of solute. The distinction arises because some compounds can dissociate in solution, whereas others cannot. Ionic compounds, such as salts, can dissociate in solution into their constituent ions, so there is not a one- to-one relationship between the molarity and the osmolarity of a solution. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) dissociates into Na+ and Cl− ions. Thus, for every 1 mole of NaCl in solution, there are 2 osmoles of solute particles (i.e., a 1 mol/L NaCl solution is a 2 osmol/L NaCl solution). Both sodium and chloride ions affect the osmotic pressure of the solution. Another example is magnesium chloride (MgCl2), which dissociates into Mg2+ and 2Cl− ions. For every 1 mole of MgCl2 in the solution, there are 3 osmoles of solute particles. Nonionic compounds do not dissociate, and form only 1 osmole of solute per 1 mole of solute. For example, a 1 mol/L solution of glucose is 1 osmol/L. Multiple compounds may contribute to the osmolarity of a solution. For example, a 3 Osm solution might consist of: 3 moles glucose, or 1.5 moles NaCl, or 1 mole glucose + 1 mole NaCl, or 2 moles glucose + 0.5 mole NaCl, or any other such combination. Definition The osmolarity of a solution, given in osmoles per liter (osmol/L) is calculated from the following expression: : mathrm{osmolarity} = sum_i varphi_i , n_i C_i where * φ is the osmotic coefficient, which accounts for the degree of non-ideality of the solution. In the simplest case it is the degree of dissociation of the solute. Then, φ is between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates 100% dissociation. However, φ can also be larger than 1 (e.g. for sucrose). For salts, electrostatic effects cause φ to be smaller than 1 even if 100% dissociation occurs (see Debye–Hückel equation); * n is the number of particles (e.g. ions) into which a molecule dissociates. For example: glucose has n of 1, while NaCl has n of 2; * C is the molar concentration of the solute; * the index i represents the identity of a particular solute. Osmolarity can be measured using an osmometer which measures colligative properties, such as Freezing-point depression, Vapor pressure, or Boiling-point elevation.  Osmolarity vs. tonicity  Osmolarity and tonicity are related but distinct concepts. Thus, the terms ending in -osmotic (isosmotic, hyperosmotic, hyposmotic) are not synonymous with the terms ending in -tonic (isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic). The terms are related in that they both compare the solute concentrations of two solutions separated by a membrane. The terms are different because osmolarity takes into account the total concentration of penetrating solutes and non-penetrating solutes, whereas tonicity takes into account the total concentration of non- freely penetrating solutes only. Penetrating solutes can diffuse through the cell membrane, causing momentary changes in cell volume as the solutes \\"pull\\" water molecules with them. Non-penetrating solutes cannot cross the cell membrane; therefore, the movement of water across the cell membrane (i.e., osmosis) must occur for the solutions to reach equilibrium. A solution can be both hyperosmotic and isotonic. For example, the intracellular fluid and extracellular can be hyperosmotic, but isotonic – if the total concentration of solutes in one compartment is different from that of the other, but one of the ions can cross the membrane (in other words, a penetrating solute), drawing water with it, thus causing no net change in solution volume. Plasma osmolarity vs. osmolality Plasma osmolarity can be calculated from plasma osmolality by the following equation:Page 158 in: Osmolarity = osmolality * (ρsol − ca) where: *ρsol is the density of the solution in g/ml, which is 1.025 g/ml for blood plasma.Density of Blood The Physics Factbook. Edited by Glenn Elert. Retrieved on 26 Mars, 2009 *ca is the (anhydrous) solute concentration in g/ml – not to be confused with the density of dried plasma According to IUPAC, osmolality is the quotient of the negative natural logarithm of the rational activity of water and the molar mass of water, whereas osmolarity is the product of the osmolality and the mass density of water (also known as osmotic concentration). In simpler terms, osmolality is an expression of solute osmotic concentration per mass of solvent, whereas osmolarity is per volume of solution (thus the conversion by multiplying with the mass density of solvent in solution (kg solvent/litre solution). : text{osmolality} = sum_i varphi_i , n_i m_i where mi is the molality of component i. Plasma osmolarity/osmolality is important for keeping proper electrolytic balance in the blood stream. Improper balance can lead to dehydration, alkalosis, acidosis or other life-threatening changes. Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) is partly responsible for this process by controlling the amount of water the body retains from the kidney when filtering the blood stream.

It is the head town of the Caseros Department, and lies about west of Rosario and 202 km south- southwest of the provincial capital Santa Fe, on National Route 33. It has a population of about 35.058 inhabitants (). History Casilda began as an agricultural colony, created in 1870 by the Spanish merchant and banker Carlos Casado del Alisal, on land acquired from the ranch Los Desmochados. Casado del Alisal named it Colonia Candelaria (Candelaria was a stop on the way from Rosario to Mendoza). On 11 November 1873 the colony officially became a town, named Villa Casilda after Casado del Alisal's mother. Casilda produced the first Argentine shipment of wheat to the European market. In 1883 the railway Ferrocarril Oeste Santafesino reached the town, prompting an accelerated growth and bringing prosperity. Casilda became a city on 19 November 1907. Culture The city is home to a Rural Extension Agency of the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) and the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Rosario (UNR). Economy The economy of the area is based on agriculture, especially soybean, wheat and corn; cattle farming has been largely displaced to less fertile lands and feed lots by the advance of these crops. Casilda also has flour mills, fertilizer factories, and many other industries, usually in the form of small and medium enterprises or cooperatives. In addition, Casilda produces honey and has received the title of Provincial Capital of Honey.

The station is owned and operated by iHeartMedia. Its studios are located in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport and its transmitter is in South Mountain Park. History =Early years= Three applicants filed in 1976 for one of the last Class C FM allotments in Phoenix: American International Development, owned by Julia Zozaya; Herbert Owens, owner of Turf Paradise; and KXIV (1400 AM). In June 1979, the Federal Communications Commission issued an initial decision awarding the frequency to Zozaya. However, KXIV challenged the initial decision, alleging that the signatures on Zozaya's applications did not match; the commission's review board agreed, overturning the initial decision and finding in favor of KXIV. Zozaya, who was legally blind, appealed the review board's finding, claiming that her disability resulted in the mismatched signatures, and on May 7, 1981, the FCC issued a final ruling awarding the 99.9 frequency to Zozaya. The station signed on the air July 4, 1982, as Spanish-language station KNNN, Phoenix's first Spanish-language station on FM and at the time the only one operating in Arizona. It operated from a converted home at 4548 W. Osborn Road on Phoenix's west side. Technical difficulties that developed on the first day of operation prompted KNNN to go silent again until July 12. In late 1983, Zozaya sold the station for nearly $4 million to TransCom Communications, owned by Robert G. Herpe and former KDKB owner Eric Hauenstein. By January 1984, it was apparent that a format change was likely coming as the new owners engaged former KDKB morning man Bill Andres. KNNN ceased broadcasting on February 28 to make way for TransCom's adult contemporary outlet, KLZI, which began broadcasting in March. The new outlet, doing battle with KKLT (98.7 FM), made a dent in its competitor's ratings in the first survey. Meanwhile, the Phoenix market would not get another Spanish-language station on FM until the creation of KVVA-FM in 1987. KLZI—along with KSUN, which TransCom was in the process of buying—was sold in 1986 to Duffy Broadcasting of Dallas in a $15 million transaction. It was announced the same day as the sale of KOOL-AM-FM for the same price, with both tying as records for the Phoenix market. =Relaunch as KESZ= On January 15, 1988, KLZI gave way to KESZ \\"EZ-Rock 99.9\\", remaining in the adult contemporary format. Also introduced was a new airstaff, which included Barry Chase and Beth McDonald in mornings, as well as Marty Manning. Success was not immediate: with the station languishing at 15th in the ratings that summer, Chase was fired and Manning moved to mornings opposite McDonald. After the Arizona Television Company, owner of KTVK (channel 3), acquired the station in 1990, KPNX meteorologist Bill Austin joined the morning show, which became known as \\"Beth and Bill\\". In the span of a year, Arizona Television purchased KESZ, Phoenix Magazine, and a TV production studio. The station's share remained steady, but cume increased throughout the 1990s to a top-5 position. 1996 also saw the first time KESZ played Christmas music over the holiday season. In 1997, Arizona Television—by then known as MAC America Communications—announced that it was forming a joint venture with Buck Owens, owner of KNIX; the venture, known as OwensMAC, would operate KESZ and MAC America's struggling station at 103.5 FM. In 1999, KESZ became the market's top-billing station for the first time. =KESZ under Clear Channel/iHeartMedia= In 1999, Jacor, which was already in the process of merging with Clear Channel Communications, acquired KNIX from Owens and KESZ from OwensMAC for $84 million and $58 million, respectively, marking the end of one of the market's last large independent owners. \\"Beth and Bill\\" continued in morning drive until Austin retired in February 2010 as a result of bladder cancer, when the show was renamed \\"Beth and Friends\\"; he died four months later at the age of 55. KESZ has continued to see success with Christmas music and is typically one of the top-rated stations in the United States during the holiday season. In the Holiday 2019 Nielsen Audio survey, KESZ earned a station-record 19.2 rating, up from the prior two years. HD Radio KESZ's HD Radio signal is multiplexed. The main signal is a simulcast of KESZ's adult contemporary programming. The second channel initially carried KEZ's Classic Channel programmed by iHeartMedia's Format Lab classic hits format consisting of songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. As of April 2017, this changed to iHeart 70s. On October 1, 2017, KESZ-HD2 switched to a Christmas music format and continued to do so until November 14, 2018, when the primary station went Christmas (as planned) for the holiday season, and the HD2 moved to soft adult contemporary as \\"99.9 HD2 The Breeze.\\" The move gave iHeart the right to use the \\"Breeze\\" name in the state of Arizona, preventing any other station group to use the name in the case of another station flipping to soft AC, which saw a renewed interest in late 2018. In September 2019, KESZ added a simulcast of KGME “Fox Sports 910” to its HD2 stream, bumping The Breeze format to HD3.

It was released in 1997 on Noise Records. It is the only album to feature former Blind Guardian drummer Thomen Stauch.  Story  The Iron Savior is a gigantic vessel in the orbit of the planet Earth. It is controlled by an immortal human brain – the bio-unit – which is hooked to a mighty computer system that carries out its orders and controls the vessel’s daily routine. The Iron Savior was built and designed by the ancient civilisation of Atlantis to defend themselves against the deadly threat of the so called Alliance. Except the lost continent of Atlantis, all land was controlled and dominated by this global force. In these parts of the world moral evolution took a different path. Gaining ultimate power was their only focus. Ruled by pure egoism, where killing and betraying were legal methods to achieve welfare, this civilisation never developed a social spirit. To care and provide for themselves as well as possible was their only existing law. For millennia the balance of power between Atlantis and the Alliance made war useless since the Atlantean weapon technology was more developed. But suddenly this balance was about to change and an Alliance attack on Atlantis seemed to become possible. In this situation, Atlantis developed a global defence project based on a huge vessel in Earth orbit, the Iron Savior. Equipped with the latest technology and enormous firepower this project was supposed to regain the old balance of power again. But then the dream of a peaceful co- existence was broken. A traitor sold the secret codes to the Alliance. With these codes the Alliance managed to paralyse the Savior’s bio-unit and to take control over the computer. In a devastating assault the defender turned into a dreadful assailant and the moon colony of Atlantis was turned to dust. But the war was not lost yet. A brave landing team managed to board the Iron Savior and to regain control. In a race against time they sent the vessel out into space to make a second misuse by the Alliance impossible. They programmed a course that should bring the Savior back to the Sol system 350,000 years later in the hope that the conflict will be resolved and Earth would be united. For those men it was a final journey of no return. Before they died out in the cold a prime directive for all actions was programmed into the computer systems in case the Alliance would still exist: Protect Atlantis and conquer the Alliance. This directive could only be deactivated by the proper Atlantean security code sequences. But it was already too late to stop the war. In grim and rage the Alliance pushed their buttons and in a final atomic strike Atlantis was destroyed completely and was lost in the seas forever. But the rest of the world was also affected by this catastrophe. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, atomic fallout and dramatic changes in climate turned Earth into a living hell. Those who survived, slowly, from generation to generation , degenerated more and more. Finally evolution was thrown back into the stone age where the dawning of another mankind began… Now in the year 2108 the Iron Savior returned to Earth and is confronted with a scenario where the civilisation of Atlantis no longer exists. All attempts to contact possible survivors failed. The bio-unit is still paralysed and unable to make decisions. So the computer still in charge draws the fatal conclusion that Atlantis was destroyed by the Alliance who still exists and rules the planet. With the logic of a lifeless machine the Iron Savior carries out its Prime directive: 'PROTECT ATLANTIS AND CONQUER THE ALLIANCE.'

First years Martin Schempp was born in Stuttgart. After completing his commercial education, he helped out in his father's craftsman's business. In 1926, at the age of 21, he emigrated to the USA in the hope of finding better working conditions there. After working at various odd jobs, he finally found employment as a chemical laboratory technician at a steel mill. A talk by Charles Lindbergh about his Atlantic crossing so inspired Martin about aviation that he returned to Germany in 1928 to learn how to fly. After completing his basic soaring training, he acquired his pilot's license for powered aircraft at the Klemm company in Böblingen. It was during this time that he met Wolf Hirth, with whom he was to establish a close, lifelong friendship. Martin Schempp returned 1929 to the USA to build German sailplane designs under license there at \\"Haller-Hirth Sailplanes\\" and to act as a soaring instructor at \\"Haller School Of Soaring Flight\\" in Pittsburgh (Greensburg Airport). Spectacular flights with a number of unintentional ditchings made him and soaring known in the USA. After his successes in the 2nd National Soaring Championships in Elmira, New York (which is America's equivalent to the Wasserkuppe, Germany's soaring Mecca) in 1931, he flew a distance of 63.7 miles and reached an altitude of 5,370 feet in this competition the following year. He won second place in the distance competition and first place in the altitude competition. Based on these successes, he earned silver C badge No. 8 (worldwide). He moved to California at the end of 1932, where he worked with Hawley Bowlus on his high-performance sailplane \\"Albatros\\". In 1934, feeling that his professional prospects in the USA were too uncertain, Martin Schempp accepted an offer from Wolf Hirth, who was the head of the soaring school on the Hornberg at the time, to hire him as a soaring instructor there. With the assistance of Wolf Hirth, Martin Schempp opened in Göppingen his own company in 1935: \\"Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp\\". Martin Schempp proved to be an adept and circumspect head of production, who would succeed over decades in working with his employees to build high-quality sailplanes inexpensively. The Gö 1 \\"Wolf\\" and Gö 3 \\"Minimoa\\" became world-renowned sailplanes. In 1938, Wolf Hirth, mainly responsible for the design work, officially became a partner in the company, which then took on the new name “Sportflugzeugbau Schempp-Hirth”. The company relocated to Kirchheim-Teck the same year. By 1939, the list of customers included clients from all continents except Australia. The Minimoa, 110 of which were built, is still regarded as one of the most beautiful sailplanes from the wood era. In 1939, Wolf Hirth opened his own company in Nabern, which collaborated closely with Schempp-Hirth during the war. In addition to sailplanes for pilot training, the two companies supplied the two-seater Gö IV (designed by Wolfgang Hütter); the Habicht (plane), an aerobatic glider, and wooden subassemblies for Messerschmitt, the Me-321/323 \\"Gigant\\" and the Me-109 fighter. After the war In the eyes of the Americans, Martin Schempp had such great human integrity and recognition that they appointed him the interim mayor of Kirchheim unter Teck after the war – despite the formal \\"burden\\" of him being the head of a production facility for military products. He was relieved by an elected mayor in 1945 and once again devoted all of his time to the factory, now to manufacture urgently needed furniture and household goods using aircraft materials saved through the end of war. When gliders were allowed to fly again in Germany in 1951, he ceded the sailplane market to Wolf Hirth. Only after Wolf Hirths' death in 1959 did Schempp-Hirth increasingly become involved in sailplane construction in addition to the construction of powered aircraft undertaken with Wolf Hirths' consultation and assistance. Martin Schempp acquired the license to build the best standard-class sailplane of its time, the \\"Standard Austria,\\" and put it into mass production. Martin Schempp soon realized that the future would belong to composite sailplanes, and he therefore secured the assistance of Klaus Holighaus. Klaus Holinghaus' first work for Schempp-Hirth was to increase the wingspan of the Standard Austria to produce the SHK with 17-m wings. Upon arriving in Kirchheim, Klaus Holighaus implemented his ideas in the form of the composite sailplane for the Open Class – the Cirrus. Martin Schempp gave him free rein in this matter, which Klaus Holighaus used to produce the (wildly) successful Cirrus, Nimbus, Standard Cirrus and Janus. After handing over management of the factory in 1969 and control of the company in 1972, Martin Schempp fully transferred the Schempp-Hirth company to Klaus Holighaus in 1977 and withdrew after 42 years of actively shaping, directing and accompanying its fortunes – still following its growth and successes with great interest and involvement. Martin Schempp died after a long illness on July 9, 1984.

Prior to October 2012, it was located a block away in the basement of the Chicago Theological Seminary, next to the campus of the University of Chicago, and stocked the largest selection of academic volumes in the United States throughout an extensive maze of shelves. The Co-op also operates 57th Street Books, also in the Hyde Park neighborhood, which houses a carefully curated collection of general interest titles, including kids' books, science fiction, mysteries and cookbooks. The Co-op's reputation was so great that Columbia University invited manager Jack Cella to either open a branch in New York City or leave and open a new store there. Until the university gained its own neighborhood academic bookstore in the late 1990s, many Columbia scholars ordered books from the Co-op. Currently, the Co-op has over 53,000 members, 3,500 of whom are located overseas. The following countries have at least 100 members: Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Australia.

Adler was a member of Megadeth from 2015–2017, playing percussion on their fifteenth album Dystopia, and performed all touring dates in support of that album, as well as the touring and creative obligations with Lamb of God. Adler played in several local bands including Calibra, Jettison Charlie, Grouser and Darker Days before founding Lamb of God in 1994. Adler is well recognized for his open- handed technique, his use of the heel-toe technique, and his unusual approach to the drum kit as a left handed player on a right handed kit. Biography Adler attended Bishop Ireton High School in Alexandria, Virginia; He attended college at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia where he met former bandmates John Campbell and Mark Morton. His inspirations include former Wrathchild America and current Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin, and Stewart Copeland of The Police. Other influences are John Bonham, Dave Lombardo, Gar Samuelson, Lars Ulrich, Billy Cobham, and Gene Hoglan. According to DRUM! Magazine, Adler describes his first drum kit as a disaster: > \\"The bass drum legs were different lengths so they wouldn't touch the ground > at the same time. Every time I would hit it, it would wobble from left to > right. The cymbal stands were duct taped together, and I think after two or > three times playing the kit, the pedalboard actually broke in half because > it was made of that crappy old fake metal.\\" In 2006, Adler collaborated with revered progressive guitarist Ron Jarzombek and began the project Blotted Science. In 2013, Adler moved to Toronto, Canada to contribute to and record the album Volition with the progressive metal band Protest the Hero. The album went on to deliver Adler his first Juno Award (Canadian equivalent to the US Grammy). In 2014, he contributed several drum tracks to the Testament album Dark Roots of the Earth. On August 9, 2014 ABC News radio asked Adler in an interview if he did the drums for the new Slipknot single \\"The Negative One\\". Adler responded with \\"I can't confirm nor deny it\\". Adler later dismissed this in a later interview. Adler performing with Lamb of God at Rock am Ring 2015 In 2016, Adler recorded three songs with Jim Gillette, Michael Angelo Batio, and Victor Wooten in a California studio for a Nitro reunion album. As of October 2017, he left the Nitro reunion project to focus on a mid-2018 release and tour with Lamb of God. Adler played on Megadeth's 2016 studio release Dystopia and on all live shows during the following world tour, juggling his time between Lamb of God and Megadeth. On July 1, 2016, Adler left Megadeth due to continued pressure to join full-time and leave Lamb of God. In lieu of leaving the band he started, Adler recommended his friend Dirk Verbeuren to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine who accepted his recommendation. Verbeuren took over the throne for Megadeth at that time after agreeing to quit Soilwork as well as his other projects. On 12 February 2017, Adler won his first Grammy award for Dystopia which won the Best Metal Performance category at the 59th Grammy Awards. As he was no longer a band member he did not attend the ceremony with current Megadeth drummer Verbeuren attending with the band instead. In late 2017, Adler was involved in a motorcycle accident. He revealed the details of the accident a year later in September 2018, when questions were raised about his absence from the Lamb of God tour. On July 19, 2019, following a time period of a year where Adler was not touring with the band, Adler parted ways with Lamb of God. The band eventually announced Art Cruz as his permanent replacement. Adler scheduled multiple international clinic dates in the back half of 2019 and joined a Richmond Virginia local project with the members of Kepone. In April of 2018, Adler founded Kintsugi Management, an artist management firm. Kintsugi focuses on Adler's passion for music, the artists that inspire him and employs multiple international partners. On June 18th, 2020, Adler officially revealed his new project, Firstborne, with James LoMenzo (Megadeth, Black Label Society). Their debut track, \\"Anthem\\", along with the entire EP, released the same day on all streaming platforms, with Adler pledging to donate 100% of sales to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund during the holiday of Juneteenth.  Personal life  In February 2019, Adler announced his engagement to his longtime girlfriend. Equipment Adler uses Saturn Mapex Drums, his own signature Black Panther 12x5.5\\" snare, and Gibraltar Hardware. He also uses and endorses Evans Drumheads, Pro-Mark signature Sticks, Trick Pedals and Meinl Cymbals.

Since 2001, it operates as a brand of Valero and has withdrawn the brand from a majority of Texas gas stations and had converted most of the stores to Valero or sold them off to Texaco or other companies. History The origins of Diamond Shamrock can be traced back to three foundation companies: Diamond Alkali, Shamrock Oil and Gas, and Sigmor Corporation. =1910-1983= Diamond Alkali In 1910 a group of glass manufacturers founded Diamond Alkali in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They wanted the company to produce soda ash, a key ingredient in glass production. A factory was built in Painesville, Ohio, in 1912 to produce soda ash. During the 1920s, TR Evans led Diamond Alkali, which under his leadership became an important chemical producer. After World War II Ray Evans, TR's son, led the company to decentralize its operations. In Deer Park, Houston, Texas, in 1946 a new plant was built to produce Chlorine and Caustic soda. In 1948 the company moved its headquarters from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, Ohio. During the 1950s a third plant was constructed in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, helping the company continue to enlarge its range of products, expanding to produce plastics and chemicals for agriculture. The 1960s saw continued expansion of Diamond Alkali. A facility was opened in Delaware City, Delaware and additional chemical companies were purchased, including Chemical Process Company of Redwood City, California and the Nopco Chemical Company of New Jersey. In 1967 Diamond Alkali merged with Shamrock Oil and Gas of Amarillo. At the time of the merger the company produced about 20 percent oil and gas and 80 percent chemicals. In 1978 Diamond Shamrock moved its headquarters to Dallas. By 1980 Diamond Shamrock had about 12,400 employees in thirty-seven countries. Shamrock Oil and Gas John Sheerin founded Shamrock Oil and Gas on August 9, 1929. As a native of Ireland he named the company after the symbol of his country of origin. The company was financed by the Fownes family of Pennsylvania and headquartered in Amarillo. The early years of the company were difficult experiencing a loss of about $9 million. In 1933 Shamrock built its first refinery and its first gas station, both in Sunray, Moore County, Texas. James Harold Dunn joined the company in 1938 as a vice president and general manager, having previously been an engineer at the Lone Star Gas Corporation. The following year Shamrock showed its first, albeit small, profit. During 1939-1940 Lone Star and Shamrock cooperated on the construction of a plant at Murchison in Henderson County whose aim was to recycle natural gas. In 1943 the company paid its first dividend, and by 1944 the company was listed on the NYSE. In 1945 Dunn became the company president, a post he had for ten years. In 1955 CA Cash succeeded him, and in 1959 Shamrock opened its first catalytic cracking unit in Sunray. In 1960 Shamrock purchased a large number of gas stations from the chain of Sigmor. Sigmor During the 1930s and 1940s Sigfried (Sig) Moore operated the chain. In 1943 Moore loaned Thomas E. Turner, an employee, money to launch his own business. Turner decided to use the name Sigmor for the chain of stores he established during the 40s and 50s. In 1952 Sigmor was incorporated. In 1959 a restructuring took place which allowed each separate gas station to incorporate separately. In 1960 most of the chain was purchased by Shamrock and then leased back to Turner, who continued to lead the company. In 1978 Sigmor purchased its stations back from Diamond Shamrock, continuing to market DS products. By 1983 Sigmor was one of the largest independent service-station chains in the USA. Diamond Shamrock The merger gave Diamond Shamrock 600 retail outlets, plus the Three Rivers oil refinery which was built by Sigmor during the 1970s. In 1987 The Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Company severed ties with Diamond Shamrock Corporation, which was the parent company, and became independent with its headquarters in San Antonio. At that time, as part of the reorganization, Diamond Shamrock Corporation became Maxus Energy Corporation, severing all legal ties to the Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Company. In 1990 Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Company shortened its name to Diamond Shamrock, Incorporated, as it had taken the step of incorporating at that time. 1985–2001 In 1985 the company had a $604.7 million loss. It restructured itself in the year before December 1986. On Wednesday December 3, 1986 T. Boone Pickens offered to buy Diamond Shamrock for $2 billion. Kit Freiden of the Associated Press stated \\"some analysts predicted the giant energy company would reject the offer.\\"Freiden, Kit. \\"Diamond Shamrock may reject Mesa bid.\\" Associated Press at the Houston Chronicle.

In 1988 the company's annual refinery sales were $1.8 billion. Diamond Shamrock owned and operated 529 stores. 423 of them were in Texas, with 94 of them in Greater Houston. The company owned an additional 64 stores in Colorado. In 1988 the company bought from investor F. Philip Handy 80 Tenneco gasoline stations, with 30 of them in Houston. According to the plans, the Tenneco stores would be rebranded as Diamond Shamrocks.Pearson, Anne. \\"Diamond Shamrock to buy gas stations.\\" Houston Chronicle. Tuesday December 6, 1988.

In 1995 Diamond Shamrock had 2,000 stores, with most of them in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Louisiana. Of them, over 170 stores were in Houston. That year, Diamond Shamrock bought the National Convenience Stores Stop N Go chain for $260 million. The plans called for the combined company to be headquartered in San Antonio. The combined company was to have two refineries in Texas, 11,000 employees, and 2,600 stores. - Available at NewsBank, Record Number HSC11091306995.

It is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) east of U.S.-owned Belle Isle, and 360 yards (330 m) from the Windsor shore. The island was formed from a peninsula of the Canadian shore by the action of the Detroit River. There is a central marsh on the island. The present channel was eroded until the core of the island remained. There are man-made channels cut through the island to ensure fresh water supply and recreational opportunities. The island's flora and fauna have been heavily affected by human activity, and the forest is the result of a rehabilitation programme. Formerly an Ontario provincial park, ownership was transferred to the City of Windsor in 1999. The Detroit River passes 200 yards (183 m) off its northern shore and daily ships pass. The island offers attractive Detroit city views, a wide sandy beach and shallow river bottom, and is a favorite with summer boaters. As of June 27th 2018, the City of Windsor began to run a ferry service to the island for day trips. Tours operate Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, weather permitting, from June to October. Boaters, canoers and kayakers can enjoy the island's trails and beaches and approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) of canals. The park is open only during the day. Sailors are advised to anchor along the southern shore of the island, abeam the Windsor Yacht Club. Speed between red buoy DP2 west of Peche Island and green buoy DP5 east of Peche Island must be held below 5 knots (9 km/h). For kayakers, the circumnavigation distance is approximately 3 miles (4.8 km). From November through March large numbers of waterfowl, especially canvasback, redhead, lesser scaup, common goldeneye and common merganser, are all found in the nearby waters. Peregrine falcons and bald eagles are often attracted by these large flocks and can sometimes be seen perched in the island's larger treetops, or in the nesting platforms constructed by the Essex County Field Naturalists' Club. Muskie and walleye, bigmouth bass, bluegill and perch are found in the waters surrounding the island, and fishing pressures are reported low. Water quality is good, and carefully monitored, as the City of Windsor's supply is drawn from nearby. Peche Island is one of the few places where the rare blue ash tree (Fraxinus quadrangulata) can be found. Name Early French explorers' maps state the island was named Isle au Large, or Isle du Large. Possible meanings include \\"at a distance\\", since Peche Island is the farthest island upstream, on the Detroit River, before entering Lake St. Clair, or \\"keep your distance\\", because of dangerous shallows on the north side. The island was next called variations of \\"Peche\\" Isle, including Isle aux Pecheurs and Isle a la Peche (Isle à la Peche), the French word for \\"fishing\\" - the island was once used as a fishing station. Local accounts from folk onomastics have incorrectly derived the name from a peach orchard once located there, or connected the name with the French word for \\"sin\\", claiming the island was once the preferred site for duels and assignations. History Foggy morning inside the island.Gorgeous autumn evening inside the island Treetop view from inside the island The island was used by natives and Ottawa Native Chief Pontiac in the summer months. It was a known as a Native fishing village because of the abundance of white fish in the waters surrounding it. After the coming of the Europeans, Alexis Maisonville purchased the island in 1774 from the Ottawa Natives.Upper Canada Land Board Minutes in the District of Hess 1765-1790 This purchase was later revoked by Governor Dorchester, and all islands became Native lands. The first and only known permanent residents of the island were a French-Canadian family named LaForest. In 1775 Louisa St. Aubin gave birth to an illegitimate (native) son Charles in 1774. She married on February 2 1780 at Ste Anne church Detroit to Antoine LaForest, son of William and Marguerite Tremblay, settlers at Grosse Pointe (Grand Marais) in 1750 when the King gave land grants for settlement in Detroit. She gave birth on January 15 1781 to her second child, Jean Marie Laforest, who may have been the first Laforest born on Peche Island. There is evidence that the LaForests were living with Indians, and treated as if they were natives at this time. There is also evidence that her grandmother, Louise Gauthier St. Aubin, was fluent in the native language and went to the Ottawa village to exchange her baked goods for honey and bear grease. See Detroit News article Peche Parade Sept 12 1955 and testimony from her uncle Gabriel St. Aubin about the Battle of Bloody Run. They shared the island with local natives. According to Laforest family records the LaForest dit Tineau families never had a deed to the island. They did ask for Liberty of the island in 1832. They received the right to fish on it. Even when ownership was transferred to the Crown by the Chippewa Indians in 1857, they were not asked to leave the island. A survey done by J. Barthey on February 14 1859 shows three homes on the island. They were log huts and 16 x 32 ft with an outhouse behind each one. The names on the homes were Charles Jr, Oliver and Benjamin. Charles and Benjamin were the sons of Charles LaForest dit Tineau and Ursula Soulliere. Oliver was the son of Joseph LaForest and Marie Anne Casavan. Oliver left the island and his brother Leon took it from him. In the tax rolls of 1868 in Sandwich Ontario these three are listed as living on Peche Island: Charles Teno Lafforette, Benjamin Teno Lafforette and Leon Lafforette. They had 18 acres of land each. It was Charles LaForest dit Tineau's sons that sold the island for 300 dollars to William Gasper Hall. They left Peche Island to farm on land across from the island where their brothers Jean Baptist and Antoine had been farming since 1838. Leon and his wife and family remained on the island after the sale. They were very poor. In 1877 he could not pay his taxes of $13.92 and was listed as a very poor person. He died in 1881 in Tecumseh, Ontario. His daughter Sophie Rose Champine, on behalf of her mother Rosalie Drouillard LaForest, started the inquiry into the sale of the island. They felt they did not agree to sell their share of it. They had moved to River Rouge at the time of this dispute. It was her mother Rosalie who supposedly gave the \\"curse of Peche island\\". Hiram Walker's sons purchased the property in 1883, from the estate of William G. Hall. There is a fable that the property was forcefully taken from the Laforet family by Hiram Walker's men and was cursed by the Laforets as they left. It was used as a summer home by Hiram Walker, who attempted, for many years, to develop it. Canals were dug to bring in supplies and to ensure the flow of fresh water. Yachts were purchased - the Pastime and the Lurline - for travelling to the island from Walker's office and for cruises and parties on the river and lakes. Walker built a 40-room mansion. He planted many trees and established an orchard, along with building a greenhouse to cultivate flowers. He next added a golf course, stables, icehouse and a carriage house. A generator for electric power was constructed. Today, the only visible construction on the island is the ruins of the Walker estate, the result of a 1929 fire. According to The Ferry Steamers: The Story of the Detroit-Windsor Ferry Boats by William Oxford, the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company, then owners of Boblo Island Park, bought the island in 1907. In 1913, the company announced plans to turn it into an amusement park. The ferry company president, Walter Campbell, lived in Walker's summer home while planning to turn it at least temporarily into the central pavilion of his new resort. He died there at the age of 71 in 1923. The island passed to DWFC's successor, the Bob-Lo Excursion Company, in 1939. No further development took place, and the island was sold in 1956 and then again in 1962, this time to E. J. Harris, who envisioned a $30 million resort. He paid $1500 per month for the island, which he intended to expand by with fill. Dredging started in 1965 for a 1000-well marina. The plan included an 18-hole golf course, plus Canadian-themed recreation areas: ice skating, a ski hill, restaurants, a hotel, reforestation, and possible cable car service from Windsor and Detroit. On-island transport would be by horse and carriage and dog sleds. The project was to be completed by 1972. As a 1968 newspaper ad advertised the area, at least some of this work had actually been done. He constructed several buildings, and sewage, hydro, water and telephone were connected to the mainland. The project operated for one season with ferry boats from Dieppe Park and barges from Riverside. However, due to mismanagement, Harris ran into stiff opposition from neighbours and local political leaders. By 1971 he had lost $700,000 and was over $500,000 in debt. He offered Peche Island for auction. The island passed briefly through the hands of a developer who foresaw an exclusive residential community on the island before the Canadian government bought it back for $400,000. Early plans to develop the island as a nature area, with groomed trails, mooring facilities and shelters, stalled for lack of funds. While originally hoping to obtain the island for $1.00, the City of Windsor acquired the land from the Province of Ontario on January 1, 1999 for a reported fee of $1.3 million.Peche Island bought in $1.3-million deal: [Final Edition] Roseann Danese Star Municipal Affairs Reporter. The Windsor Star [Windsor, Ont] 18 May 1999: A3. Included in the purchase, the city also got 276.7 acres of water lots and 1.3 acres on the mainland, on the north side of Riverside Drive East next to Lakeview Marina. There are no plans to develop the island beyond maintaining public toilets. On January 16, 2018, the City of Windsor announced it was going to spend $CAD 1 million on a pontoon boat for residents that do not have their own boats or canoes or kayaks, but still wish to visit the island, as well as for new signage regarding the new ferry service. The boat would have a capacity of around a dozen or so pedestrians or cyclists and operate in the summer only. This is the result of an earlier proposal from 2009. Wrecks In 1865, the 38-ton schooner Eugenie wrecked on Peche Island. The steamship Oneida ran aground there in July 1871. On July 8, 1998, the Tadoussac ran aground east of Peche Island. Lighthouse The Peche Island Rear Range Light was built of cast iron in 1908 to mark the narrow passage from Lake St. Clair to the Detroit River and guarded the reef for some 75 years. It was never manned. In 1926 the height was raised to and with that additional height the tower protected the passage until September 23, 1983, when it was scheduled for decommission and destruction. Learning of the plan to demolish the tower, a rescue effort was begun by Marine City, Michigan to relocate it to a site in the city's Waterworks Park. The tower's weight is 35 tons and with the height of and a diameter of the move took ingenuity and perseverance, but was finally successful.

The unit was formed wholly of Roman Catholics by the politician Eoin O'Duffy, who had previously organised the banned quasi-fascist Blueshirts and openly fascist Greenshirts in Ireland. Despite the declaration by the Irish government that participation in the war was unwelcome and ill-advised, 700 of O'Duffy's followers went to Spain. They saw their primary role in Spain as fighting for the Roman Catholic Church against the Red Terror of Spanish anticlericalists. They also saw many religious and historical parallels in the two nations, and hoped to prevent communism gaining ground in Spain. Initial involvement The Irish Catholic primate Cardinal Joseph MacRory was approached in early August 1936 by the Spanish nationalist Count Ramírez de Arellano, a Carlist from Navarre, for help for the Nationalist rebels. MacRory suggested that O'Duffy was the best man to help, as his politics were supportive and he had organised the enormous Dublin Eucharistic Congress in 1932.Othen, Christopher. Franco's International Brigades, London: Reportage Press, 2008, pp. 111–112. In 1935 O'Duffy had formed the National Corporate Party, a small fascist group, and hoped that its involvement in Spain would increase its popular vote. He travelled to Spain later in 1936 to meet Franco and Ramírez, promising that 5,000 volunteers would follow him. Franco's desire for Irish support changed in an opportunist manner. Early in the war, when Franco was one of a group of rebel generals, he felt that encouraging Irish involvement would cement his support from the equally religious-minded Carlist groups, and so ensure his leadership of the Nationalists. By December 1936 he was certain of the Carlists' support, and thereafter played down the need for Irish volunteers. Support for the brigade Support for Irish involvement was based primarily on the Catholic ethos of most Irish people, as distinct from their opinion on Spanish politics per se. Many Irish Independent newspaper editorials endorsed the idea, and on 10 August 1936 it published a letter from O'Duffy seeking assistance for his \\"anti-Red Crusade\\". The Catholic Church was naturally on his side. Cardinal McRory stated 'There is no room any longer for any doubts as to the issue at stake in the Spanish conflict…It is a question of whether Spain will remain as she has been so long, a Christian and Catholic land, or a Bolshevist and anti- God one.'https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary- history/ireland-and-the-spanish-civil-war/ Many local government County Councils passed resolutions in support, starting with Clonmel on 21 August. However, the Irish government and senior civil servants were dismayed by the Church's militant position on the war in Spain, one official in the Department of External Affairs describing it as 'not very helpful guidance' and worrying about the involvement of Irish citizens in 'a foreign war of this terrible character'.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/ The Irish leader de Valera remained strictly neutral, and, despite the opposition of the Fine Gael party, but with the support of the Labour Party, signed Ireland up to the multi-national Non- Intervention Committee in February 1937.https://www.historyireland.com/20th- century-contemporary-history/ireland-and-the-spanish-civil-war/ In late 1936 de Valera's publicist Aodh de Blácam wrote \\"For God and Spain; the Truth about the Spanish War\\", in support of Franco. Rallies were also held around the country in support of Franco by a Catholic organisation named the Irish Christian Front, including a mass meeting of 40,000 people in Cork city, where some rioting broke out between Republican and pro-Franco supporters.https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary- history/ireland-and-the-spanish-civil-war/ This support was mirrored outside the Irish Free State. In the USA the largely Catholic Irish American community was in a minority that supported Franco and the rebels, but a proposal in the US Congress to allow sales of arms to the Spanish Republic was opposed successfully by a campaign led by the Catholic Joseph Kennedy.Beevor A. The battle for Spain (Phoenix, London 2007) p.270. In Northern Ireland, support was so strong in the Catholic minority that it largely abandoned the Northern Ireland Labour Party, whose leader Harry Midgley supported the Spanish Republic. Midgley was greeted at one party meeting with chants of \\"we want Franco\\".Othen C., p.111. Volunteers In late 1936 some 7,000 men volunteered, of whom about 700 eventually went to Spain. While many of the officers were aligned with O'Duffy's political party, the majority of his force were not NCP members but former Blueshirts still loyal to the general. Some were former IRA or National Army men, like O'Duffy veterans of the pro- Treaty side of the Irish Civil War.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish-brigade- in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU But many others were young and naive, the Irish Department of External Affairs described them as 'very young men, who have been enticed from their families by the impression that they are going to fight for Christianity'.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods- battle-oduffys-irish-brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU One author has described some of the Brigade as 'social misfits who saw themselves as the twentieth century's Wild Geese, and rural lads talked into enlistment by rhetoric from the pulpit.Othen p113 According to Matt Doolan, an ex-brigader, “the Irish Brigade was a very fair cross-section of Irish life of the period, including a number of prominent members of the Old IRA.”Doolan, 1986, quoted in Othen, p113 By now Franco was less keen on having an Irish Brigade, and O'Duffy had difficulty persuading him to arrange a ship to transport his men; a ship expected in October was cancelled. 200 travelled to Spain in small groups, and eventually 500 others embarked on the German ship Urundi at Galway in November 1936. Large crowds gathered to sing ‘Faith of Our Fathers’ as volunteers were blessed by priests and handed Sacred Heart badges, miraculous medals and prayer books. One of O'Duffy's associates, Liam Walsh had secured a commitment from Nazi Germany to send the Urundi to pick up the Irish volunteers.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU It docked at Ferrol in December 1936. Training and deployment Hotel Álvarez—later named Alfonso IX—where O'Duffy lived while training in Cáceres.http://www.requetes.com/irlanda.html From their training base at Cáceres the volunteers were attached to the Spanish Foreign Legion as its \\"XV Bandera\\" (roughly, \\"fifteenth battalion\\"), divided in four companies. Their uniforms were German ones dyed a light green, with silver harp badges. Two of their officers, Fitzpatrick and Nangle, were Irishmen who had formerly served as officers in the British Army; O'Duffy worried that they were actually in the employ of the British government, and in turn Fitzpatrick considered O'Duffy to be \\"a shit\\".Othern C., p.116. At Cáceres, the Brigade's discipline and in particular their excessive drinking was strongly criticized by their Spanish superiors. There was also dissension between the volunteers and their Chaplain, Father Mulrean, who made himself unpopular due to his public berating of the Irishmen for their 'immoral' behaviour in front of Spanish officers Fearghal McGarry, Eoin O'Duffy, A Self Made Hero, p.295-299 Many of the volunteers also witnessed mass executions by the machine gunning of captured republicans at Caceres, one recalling, 'we saw General Franco's army executing the Reds in mass groups every morning'.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU On 19 February 1937 they were deployed to the Jarama battle area, as part of the right flank at Ciempozuelos, but when approaching the front line they were fired upon by a newly formed and allied Falangist unit from the Canary Islands. In an hour- long exchange of friendly fire 2 Irish and up to 9 Canarians were killed.Othen C., op. cit., p.117http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle- oduffys-irish-brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU McGarry, Eoin O'Duffy, p.302 Most of the Brigade's time at the front was spent manning the trenches at Ciempozuelos, where, according to one volunteer, 'we never saw the Reds but were often under Red artillery fire'. Casualties due to artillery and mortar fire as well as disease and ill health mounted steadily.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU In its only offensive action, against the village of Titulcia in a rainstorm, six brigaders were killed and 15 wounded before they retired to their own trenches; the following day the brigade refused to continue the attack and was placed in defensive positions at La Maranosa nearby.Beevor A., op. cit., p.221Othen C., op. cit., p.118. These were the only two incidents the brigade was involved in where fighting took place.http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary- history/ireland-and-the-spanish-civil-war/ Mixed reputation As Franco no longer needed the brigade for political reasons, he never sent a second ship for the next 600 volunteers who had assembled in Galway in January 1937. In February, the prospect of more Irish reinforcements arriving was precluded by the de Valera government passing a law prohibiting any more volunteers to leave for Spain to fight for either side.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU The brigaders in Spain had a problem coping with oily food and the unaccustomed profusion of good wine.Othen C., p.115. In April 1937 O'Duffy's adjutant Captain Gunning made off with the wages and a number of passports. O'Duffy's men started to nickname him \\"O'Scruffy\\" and \\"Old John Bollocks\\".Othen C., p.159. One Brigade member noted in his diary that morale was collapsing, 'Bandera cracking up - all men are getting sick & weak, dozens going to hospital each day...great rumours about going home. cited in McGarry, Eoin O'Duffy, p.313 Meanwhile after the failed assault on Titulcia, the Francoist general Juan Yagüe wrote to Franco reporting that due to 'the total lack of professional commanders... the military efficiency of this unit is absolutely nil' and recommending that the Irish Brigade be dissolved, with those who wanted to serve in other units accommodated and with the rest repatriated to Ireland.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU Withdrawal and reaction O'Duffy then offered to withdraw his unit, and Franco agreed. The new Foreign Legion general Juan Yagüe loathed O'Duffy. Most of the brigade returned to Cáceres and was shipped home from Portugal. On its arrival in late June 1937 in Dublin it was greeted by hundreds, not thousands as expected, and O'Duffy's political career was over. Showing their displeasure with the affair, the volunteers from County Kerry and from the north of Ireland marched off separately from the main contingent, disassociating themselves from O'Duffy.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU By the time Irish pro-Franco volunteers returned to Ireland, there was no longer widespread support for Franco's cause. Fearghal McGarry writes, 'As it dragged on and atrocities such as the German bombing of Guernica, a village in the Catholic Basque region, became known the idea of Franco leading a religious crusade became more difficult to sustain. Also significant was the collapse of the opportunistic pro-Franco lobby. By the summer of 1937 the Irish Brigade had returned in failure and the Christian Front had acrimoniously collapsed under its own internal pressures. Even the Catholic church toned down its pro-Franco stance when it was revealed that the Christian Front had gained control of its national collection for Spain under rather dubious circumstances'.https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary- history/ireland-and-the-spanish-civil-war/ The losses of the Brigade are not exactly clear. One bandera member cited 35 killed in Spain and 40 more wounded.http://www.theirishstory.com/2018/10/24/gods-battle-oduffys-irish- brigade-in-the-spanish-civil-war/#.W-CnwTGYTIU While another count calculates that ten were killed in action and another 21 died of wounds or disease.https://comeheretome.com/2018/08/21/gabriel-lee-1904-37-and-eoin- oduffys-irish-brigade/ Historian Fearghal McGarry writes that 'they left behind them fifteen dead compatriots [and] six hospitalized legionnaires McGarry, Eoin O~Duffy, p.315 The Irish government destroyed its files relating to the Brigade in May 1940.

Development The LS-1 Standard Class design was the first aircraft type arising from the partnership between Wolf Lemke and Walter Schneider, who had already worked together as students on the ground breaking Akaflieg Darmstadt D-36. Here, and in subsequent Lemke-Schneider (LS) designs, Wolf Lemke concentrated on the aerodynamics while Walter Schneider contributed mostly to the structural and production issues. The LS1 made its debut at the 1968 German National Championships, taking first and second place with the designers themselves at the controls. The success of this design increased in the subsequent years until, in 1975, it was the most flown glider in the German Nationals. The LS1-c took first place in the 1970 World Championships at Marfa, Texas. The manufacture of the LS1 was discontinued after the IGC introduced the new unrestricted 15 metre-class in the spring 1977, as the manufacturer needed all its resources to increase production of the LS3. A total of 464 LS1 were built. It was succeeded by the LS2 and LS4. Design =Aerodynamics= * The designers desired to demonstrate that high performance and pleasant flight characteristics could coexist in a standard class sailplane built with the then still-unexplored GRP technology. * The performance improvements came from the wing having a high aspect ratio, the double tapered wing; and the new FX 66-S-196 laminar-flow airfoil profile developed by Professor F.X. Wortmann. This profile supports laminar flow over a wide range of lift coefficient. * The natural qualities of the airfoil profile combined with careful wing design yielded gentle low-speed behaviour. * Variants up to the LS1-d had an all-flying tail with oversensitive handling characteristics at high speeds. A conventional stabiliser and elevator were adopted for later variants. Although fractionally less efficient, this is much safer and more pleasant to fly. * The front of the original two-piece canopy was blended with the fuselage for improved aerodynamics. =Construction= * The materials used were glass fibre, Conticell foam, polystyrene, plywood for the spar webs and hardwood in reinforcements. Wood was phased out in the LS1-f version. * The FX 66-S-196 profile, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of almost 20%, made it possible to build a light and economical spar. This was important because in the late sixties glass fibre was the only affordable reinforcement material - carbon was still too expensive. * The GRP fuselage shell was produced in female moulds, in an innovative method developed by Wolf Lemke. The LS1 V-1 prototype was the pattern or ‘plug’ for the serial production moulds. * The undercarriage was initially fixed, as required by the standard class rules of the time. The wheel was sprung and had its own wheel housing, separate from the internal fuselage space. The wheel brake was coupled to the air brake system. * The new one-piece canopy of the LS1-f required an innovative hinge with complex kinetics to deliver the forward opening movement. Variants * LS1-0 V-1 - prototype had an internal load bearing tubular steel scaffold (as in present-day Schempp-Hirth sailplanes). This structure was substituted by full GRP construction in production versions. * LS1-0 - angle of incidence was increased and improvements to the control system. (23 built of LS1-0. LS1-a, and LS1-b together) * LS1-a - trailing edge air brakes of the prototype were dropped in favour of conventional Schempp- Hirth air brakes (change incorporated on all further variants) (23 built of LS1-0. LS1-a, and LS1-b together) * LS1-b - (23 built of LS1-0. LS1-a, and LS1-b together) * LS1-c - (198 built of LS1-c and LS1-d together) * LS1-d - was the first to have water ballast, following a class rule change. (198 built of LS1-c and LS1-d together) * LS1-e - version was built privately by a Rolladen-Schneider employee under the direction of Wolf Lemke. Differs from the LS1-c only in the use of an LS2 type tailplane (2 built) * LS1-ef - tailplane of the LS1-f and the same fuselage as former versions (1 built) * LS1-f - introduced the one-piece canopy, conventional tailplane, redesigned rudder and structural changes that allowed more water ballast and higher flight mass. It also has a reduced wing incidence relative to the fuselage, resulting in noticeably better high speed performance than the earlier LS1 variants. (240 built) * LS1-f(45) - Water ballasts of 2 x 90 liters instead of 2 x 45 liters, increasing the maximal wing loading from 40 to 45 kg/m2 (hence the name)http://www.aeroclubprealpivenete.it/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/Rolladen-Schneider-LS1-Flight-Manual.pdf (2 built).

He was the owner of several bars in East Belfast. Early life Gray, the son of James and Elizabeth Gray, was born in 1958 and raised a Protestant in East Belfast.Jim Gray He had one sister, Elizabeth. He left school at age 15 and had ambitions of becoming a professional golfer, playing off a handicap of three. He briefly worked at the Short Brothers' factory but did not hold the job long as he was heavily involved in petty crime with the Tartan gangs prevalent in loyalist areas at the time. Ulster Defence Association According to an interview in the Sunday World with his ex-wife Anne Tedford, to whom a youthful Gray was married for four years (a marriage that produced one son, Jonathan), Gray joined the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA) when she was in maternity hospital. She claimed that Gray was offered a lift home by a near-neighbour, Gary Matthews, who was already a UDA member, and that Matthews had Gray sworn in as a member soon afterwards.\\"Downward Spiral\\", Crime World supplement, Sunday World, March 2010, pp. 26–27 He eventually rose to become brigadier of the East Belfast Brigade, taking over after Ned McCreery was killed by the UDA in 1992. =Brigadier= Nicknamed \\"Doris Day\\" and the \\"Brigadier of Bling\\", Gray, who was 6'3\\" in height, became known as the most flamboyant leader in the UDA with his dyed blond bouffant hair, permanent suntan, gold earring, ostentatious jewellery, and expensive pastel clothing. In their book UDA – Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, journalists Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack described him as \\"looking more like an ageing New Romantic\\" than the leader of a paramilitary organisation.McDonald & Cusack, p. 365 He once attended a UDA meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, John Reid, wearing a loud Hawaiian-print shirt with a pink jumper draped over his shoulders.Anne McHardy. \\"Violent 'brigadier of bling' favoured loud shirts and cocaine but talked peace for the UDA\\". The Guardian, 6 October 2005. A heavy cocaine user, Gray made large amounts of money from selling drugs, protection racketeering, and extortion. Gray's criminal empire was reported to have made him one of the richest brigadiers in UDA history. He also acquired several bars in his native east Belfast. One of these, the \\"Avenue One\\" in Templemore Avenue, he used as the headquarters for his substantial criminal empire. He lived in an expensive luxury flat in an exclusive private residence and was protected by a devoted gang dubbed \\"the Spice Boys\\". A supporter of Rangers, Gray was reported as knowing a number of players personally and meeting them during his regular visits to Ibrox Park.Lister & Jordan, p. 314 The Bunch of Grapes, Gray's pub on Belfast's Castlereagh Road Renowned for his violent temper, he once allegedly brutally beat then stomped on a man's head during an outdoor Rod Stewart concert at Stormont in full view of the audience. On another occasion, he violently attacked a man with a golf club after the latter had beaten him in a game of golf. For that assault, Gray was barred from the Ormeau Golf Club. He had allegedly ordered the killing of his predecessor McCreery, whom he accused of being a police informer. Gray then took over his brigade and one of his pubs. In January 2001, the gunman, Geordie Legge met a grisly end, allegedly at the hands of Gray and his henchmen. Legge had reportedly denounced Gray's organised criminal racket and tried to interfere with Gray's lucrative drug-dealing, and he was repeatedly tortured and stabbed to death inside \\"The Bunch of Grapes\\", another of Gray's east Belfast pubs.McDonald & Cusack, p. 367 After the killing, Legge's body was placed in a carpet and dumped outside Belfast. Legge's knife wounds were so severe that his head was almost severed from the body. The pub was set on fire to eliminate the signs of the torture that had been carried out inside. Gray was one of the mourners who attended Legge's funeral. Gray and his right-hand man Gary Matthews, who co-owned the Bunch of Grapes, sought to claim on their insurance for the pub fire and sued AXA when they refused to pay out. Gray and Matthews were eventually forced to drop the case as the judge did not accept their version of events surrounding the fire and AXA successfully argued that they had not disclosed their UDA membership when they took out the policy.Leading loyalist drops action, bbc.co.uk; accessed 13 August 2016. A mural supporting Gray's East Belfast Brigade in Tullycarnet The following year on 13 September 2002, Gray was shot in the face by UDA rivals; the plastic surgery to repair the considerable facial injuries cost £11,000. The shooting, which was blamed on West Belfast Brigadier Johnny Adair, had been described by the police as \\"loosely related\\" to the death of Stephen Warnock, a Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader, in one of the loyalist feuds.Top loyalist murdered on doorstep BBC News Adair had previously started a whispering campaign against both Gray and John Gregg of the UDA South East Antrim Brigade, claiming both men were to be stood down as part of his attempts to take full control of the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, p. 368 As part of this Adair, who was close to the LVF, had visited the Warnock family and suggested that Gray had been involved in their relative's death (which had actually been carried out by a hired Red Hand Commando gunman after Warnock refused to pay a drug debt to a North Down businessman).McDonald & Cusack, p. 371 As a result, Gray was shot by a lone gunman after he left the Warnock home, where he had been paying his respects to the deceased.McDonald & Cusack, p. 372 On 25 September, Gray discharged himself from the Ulster Hospital to attend a meeting of all the brigadiers bar Adair at which he, John Gregg, Jackie McDonald, Billy McFarland and Andre Shoukri found Adair guilty of treason for his role in Gray's shooting and released a press statement to the effect that Adair was expelled from the UDA.Lister & Jordan, pp. 320-21 Two weeks after the attack, Gray flew to Tenerife for a holiday. He allegedly owned property in Spain. Gray's son, Jonathan, died of a drugs overdose in 2002 while with his father on holiday in Thailand. An October 2005 report by the Belfast Telegraph claimed that Jim Gray was bisexual and would regularly take holidays to Thailand to have sex with teenage boys.Child sex shame of UDA chief , Belfast Telegraph; accessed 26 March 2016. Expulsion and arrest Gray was expelled by the UDA leadership in March 2005, for \\"treason\\" and \\"building a criminal empire outside the UDA\\", according to the South Belfast brigadier, Jackie McDonald. It was suggested that Gray was a Special Branch informer who passed on information to the police about his friends and associates.\\"The death of Doris Day\\", Guardian.co.uk, 12 October 2005; retrieved 17 June 2011. In April that year, he was arrested whilst driving; several thousand pounds were found in the car, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) believed he was intending to travel to the Republic of Ireland with what they suspected to be the proceeds of drug dealing and extortion. Gray was charged with money laundering, and held in custody until September when he was released on bail. During this time, police raids on a number of locations brought in thousands of documents related to this investigation. At the same time the prominent Belfast estate agent Philip Johnston was also arrested under suspicion of money laundering.Cleared man 'financially ruined' Gray was replaced as head of the UDA East Belfast Brigade by Jimmy Birch. Shooting death Gray was shot five times in the back and killed outside his father's house in the east Belfast Clarawood estate on 4 October 2005, by two unknown gunmen. The shooting took place at 8 p.m. while he was unloading weight-lifting equipment from the boot of his silver Mini Cooper. As his body lay on the front lawn, local people took photos and passed the news to others via their mobile phones. According to Gray's father, his son had left the house after Gary Matthews arrived to give him a set of weights and cigarettes that he had bought for Gray in Spain. Shots rang out and when Gray's father went out to see what had happened he found his son had been shot and Matthews was ringing for an ambulance.Police give up hope of convicting Jim Gray's murderers, belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 19 December 2015. The involvement of other loyalist factions was suspected, fueling speculation that he was murdered to prevent him making an agreement with the police to expose his former associates in the UDA. Six people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder,\\"Six held for questioning over Gray murder\\", rte.ie; accessed 19 December 2015.Jim Gray's gay lover held for questioning about murder, nuzhound.com, 7 October 2005. Ultimately however no charges were brought with the investigating officer, Detective Inspector Deborah McMaster, admitting at Gray's inquest in 2007 that the police had largely given up on securing any convictions due to a lack of evidence. East Belfast MP Peter Robinson (later First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2008 to January 2016) stated after Gray's killing that \\"there was no excuse for the murder\\". Fellow UDA member and former friend, Michael Stone claimed that Gray had told him he was a businessman rather than a loyalist, as loyalism did not pay the bills.Jonathan McCambridge, \\"Gray was a tout, says killer Stone\\". Belfast Telegraph, 6 October 2005. Unlike most brigadiers, he was not given a paramilitary funeral, complete with volleys of gunfire fired over the coffin. It was a private affair, attended by only 14 mourners. As a further sign of his unpopularity among loyalists, a street disco was held in east Belfast to celebrate his death. Gray's effigy, with a curtain ring representing his trademark single gold earring, was thrown upon a bonfire. In lieu of murals dedicated to his memory, there was only graffiti scrawled on an east Belfast wall which read: \\"Jim Gray RIP – Rest in Pink\\".

He was featured on the cover of TIME Magazine on August 24, 1970.Time Magazine (August 24, 1970) Changing Wall Street: Dreyfus Fund's Howard Stein Stein invented the first \\"no load\\" money market fund and created the first tax-free municipal bond fund. Early life Howard Mathew Stein was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 6, 1926. His parents were immigrants from Poland and also had another son and daughter, in addition to Stein. Stein initially planned to become a musician, beginning to learn the violin when he was 5. Stein attended the Straubenmuller Textile High School and the Juilliard School. However, Stein gave up on his music career and went into business. At the age of 23, he loaded steel on to trucks. He then became a trainee at Bache & Co.. In 1955, Stein left Bache and joined Dreyfus. Career Stein joined the Dreyfus Corporation as an analyst in 1955. He was appointed President in 1965, and Chairman and CEO in 1970. Stein served as Chairman and CEO of Dreyfus for more than 30 years. When Stein started at Dreyfus in 1955, it had approximately 2 million dollars in assets. Before the sale in 1994, this had grown to 90 billion dollars. Dreyfus was sold to Mellon Bank Corporation in 1994 for $1.8 billion. Stein retired in 1996. Dreyfus Third Century Fund was one of the first funds to combine socially conscious objectives with financial criteria. Created by Stein in 1972 and named for the coming national bicentennial, the fund has been influential in shaping similar philosophically-oriented investments. In addition, in 1974, Dreyfus introduced the first direct marketed, no-load money market fund. Stein became even more focused on money-market and bond funds and succeeded in creating the first tax-free municipal funds, which Dreyfus launched in 1976. Stein's progressive politics made him a target of Richard Nixon, and Stein was one of the people on Nixon's enemies list. In 1988, Stein served on The Brady Commission, also known as the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, created by President Ronald Reagan to investigate the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, also known as Black Monday.The New York Times, February 14, 1988, Sunday, Late City Final Edition In 1999, Stein started Joy of Giving Something, Inc.

New York State Insurance Department. Albany, N.Y.: New York Insurance Dept., 1907, p. 188. John Randolph Bland was the company's principal founder. On October 29, 1900, the company president John R. Bland vehemently denied that the company had paid any commissions to Richard Crocker with the intent of obtaining business in New York. Bland called it a \\"diabolical outrage\\" that the company had been brought up in a political campaign. At the time, the company's business in New York was overseen by company vice president Andrew Freedman. In May 1902, the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company of Maryland purchased a controlling interest in the stock of the New York surety company The Lawyer's Surety Company. The surety company remained in business, and there was no merger. On November 20, 1902, the company agreed along with two other major Baltimore bonding surety companies, the American Bonding and Trust Company and the Fidelity and Deposit Company to \\"end rate cutting in taking bonds.\\" The New York Times estimated that the agreement would implemented in other cities as well. There was a Supreme Court case concerning the company in 1908, with United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States ex rel. Struthers Wells Co.

Starting in the early 1970s and over the next few decades, the former Mount Saint Agnes College campus was owned and used by United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company and the St. Paul Companies. In 2003 the campus was purchased by Johns Hopkins University. Executives John J. Kennedy was a New York State Treasurer from 1911 to 1914, who committed suicide in 1914. Previously, Kennedy had been the resident vice president at Buffalo of the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company of Baltimore, a bonding company connected with Tammany, but upon his election in 1910 had turned over his business to his son William who became Resident Secretary at Buffalo of the company. William Kennedy was linked in the bonding business with Charles F. Murphy, Jr., the nephew of Tammany Hall boss Charles F. Murphy. Both Kennedys, Murphy and others had been investigated by Governor Martin H. Glynn's Special Graft Investigator James W.

Critically regarded as one of the English playwright's major dramatic works, it features his characteristically economical dialogue, characters' hidden emotions and veiled motivations, and their self-absorbed competitive one-upmanship, face-saving, dishonesty, and (self-)deceptions.Billington 257–67; cf. performance review by Bryden 204–06 and review essay by Merritt 192–99; see also film reviews by Canby and Ebert. Inspired by Pinter's clandestine extramarital affair with BBC Television presenter Joan Bakewell, which spanned seven years, from 1962 to 1969,Billington 257–58, 264–67; cf. the memoir by Bakewell, which includes two chapters on her relationship and affair with Pinter. the plot of Betrayal integrates different permutations of betrayal relating to a seven-year affair involving a married couple, Emma and Robert, and Robert's \\"close friend\\" Jerry, who is also married, to a woman named Judith. For five years Jerry and Emma carry on their affair without Robert's knowledge, both cuckolding Robert and betraying Judith, until Emma, without telling Jerry she has done so, admits her infidelity to Robert (in effect, betraying Jerry), although she continues their affair. In 1977, four years after exposing the affair (in 1973) and two years after their subsequent break up (in 1975), Emma meets Jerry to tell him that her marriage to Robert is over. She then lies to Jerry in telling him that, \\"last night\\", she had to reveal the truth to Robert and that he now knows of the affair. The truth however, is that Robert has known about the affair for the past four years. Pinter's particular usage of reverse chronology in structuring the plot is innovative: the first scene takes place after the affair has ended, in 1977; the final scene ends when the affair begins, in 1968; and, in between 1977 and 1968, scenes in two pivotal years (1977 and 1973) move forward chronologically.For an analysis of the plot structure, see Quigley 230–31. As Roger Ebert observes, in his review of the 1983 film, based on Pinter's own screenplay, \\"The Betrayal structure strips away all artifice. In this view, the play shows, heartlessly, that the very capacity for love itself is sometimes based on betraying not only other loved ones, but even ourselves.\\" Still, drawing on the frequently commented influence of Proust's In Search of Lost Time and Pinter's work on 1977's The Proust Screenplay on Betrayal, more emotionally complex interpretations are possible based on a stress on dual motions, one forward in calendar time toward disillusion and one backward toward the redemptive recovery of time, in each work. Setting London and Venice, from 1968 to 1977 (in reverse chronology).Pinter specifies the location in the stage directions describing each scene, as given in the plot summary. According to his initialed note on the same page, \\"Betrayal can be performed without an interval, or with an interval after Scene Four\\" (n. pag. [7]).

Adaptations Pinter adapted Betrayal as a screenplay for the 1983 film directed by David Jones, starring Jeremy Irons (Jerry), Ben Kingsley (Robert), and Patricia Hodge (Emma). Autobiographical inspiration Betrayal was inspired by Pinter's seven-year affair with television presenter Joan Bakewell, who was married to the producer and director Michael Bakewell, while Pinter was married to actress Vivien Merchant.Michael Billington, Harold Pinter, rev. and expanded ed. (1996; London: Faber and Faber, 2007) 264–67.Joan Bakewell, The Centre of the Bed (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2003). . (Two chapters deal with the relationship and affair with Pinter.) The affair was known in some circles; when Betrayal premiered in 1978, Lord Longford (father of Antonia Fraser), who was in the audience, commented that Emma appeared to be based on Joan Bakewell;An affair to remember, Daily Telegraph, 7 October 2003 but the affair only became public knowledge after it was confirmed by Pinter in Michael Billington's 1996 authorised biography, and further confirmed in Joan Bakewell's later memoir The Centre of the Bed. Pinter wrote the play while engaged in another long-running affair, this time with Antonia Fraser, which became a marriage in 1980 after he divorced Merchant. However, Pinter explained to Billington that although he wrote the play while \\"otherwise engaged\\" with Fraser, the details were based on his relationship with Bakewell.(Billington 264–67) Cultural allusions \\"The Betrayal\\" (1997), episode 8 of the 9th (final) season of the NBC Television series Seinfeld (Sony Pictures), alludes overtly to Pinter's play and film Betrayal, which appears to have inspired it. Apart from the title, \\"The Betrayal\\", and the name of one-off character Pinter Ranawat who appears in the episode, the episode is structured and runs in reverse chronological order and also features love triangles as one of its central themes. According to Kent Yoder, all of these allusions were deliberate.The Betrayal – Seinfeld Episode Guide, StanTheCaddy.com.

They can reach running speeds of up to . =Diet= The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required (3 liters per 100 kg bodyweight and day). =Reproduction= A three-day-old gemsbok fawn Mother and calf at the Buffalo Zoo The gemsbok is polygynous, with one resident male mating with the receptive females in the herd. The male is known to secure exclusive mating access to the females by attempting to herd mixed or nursery herds onto his territory. The gemsbok has no specified breeding season, but the young in a given herd tend to be of a similar age due to reproductive synchrony between females. Pregnant females leave the herd before giving birth. The gestation period lasts 270 days and mothers give birth to 1-2 offspring. The calf remains hidden 6 weeks after birth, after which mother and calf rejoin the herd. The calf is weaned at 3.5 months, becomes independent at 4.5 month, and achieves sexual maturity at 1.5–2 years in both sexes.

It is a generic term for various tantric assemblies or feasts, in which practitioners meet to chant mantra, enact mudra, make votive offerings and practice various tantric rituals as part of a sādhanā, or spiritual practice. The ganachakra often comprises a sacramental meal and festivities such as dancing; the feast generally consisting of materials that were considered forbidden or taboo in medieval India, where the tantric movement arose. As a tantric practice, forms of gaṇacakra are practiced today in Hinduism, Bön and Vajrayāna Buddhism. Professor Miranda Shaw summarises the experience of a gaṇacakra: ::The feast is an esoteric ritual that unfolds in many stages. The sacred space for the ceremony is demarcated by geometric designs drawn on the ground with powdered pigments, and an elaborate array of offerings and foods are laid out. The participants don special insignia like bone ornaments and crowns and use musical instruments of archaic design... for inducing heightened awareness. Practitioners sit in a circle and partake of sacramental (dry) meat and wine (often liquor) served in skull-cups. The feasts also provide an occasion for the exchange of ritual lore, the ritual worship of women (sripuja), and the performance of sexual yogas. The feast culminates in the performance of tantric dances and music that must never be disclosed to outsiders. The revelers may also improvise \\"songs of realization\\" (caryagiti) to express their heightened clarity and blissful raptures in spontaneous verse. Samual holds that: ::[S]erious Tantric practice is generally seen as appropriate for a small minority only. The ancient Indian ', the circle ritual...discussed earlier, is far in the past. In Tibetan practice it has long been replaced by the ' (Tibetan: tshogs), a considerably tamer affair, still involving a sacramental meal but normally performed indoors and without possession or dancing.Samual (1998: p. 126) Origins John Woodroffe (writing as Arthur Avalon, 1918) affirms that the panchamrita of Tantra, Hindu and Buddhist traditions are directly related to the Mahābhūta or Five Elements and that the panchamakara is actually a vulgar term for the pañcatattva: Sacred space The ganachakra, or 'tantric feast', can be seen as a mandala of sacred space. Pettit emphasises the importance of the gathered \\"group\\" (gana) or sangha to Vajrayana sādhanā and the creation of sacred space such as the ganachakra: Pettit links the importance of the group or gana to the manifestation of the ganachakra and the sacred space or the mandala (in this sense cognate with chakra) with the liturgical tools of mantra, visualisation and sacred architecture: Pettit states that sacred space is created spontaneously wherever the Three Jewels (cognate with the gankyil) is manifest and that this sacred architecture or mandala is not dependent upon the built environment of monolithic cultures: In Hindu tantra In Hindu tantra, a ganachakra typically consists of five elements known as panchamakara or the \\"five Ms\\": madya (wine), mamsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudra (lakshmi or rice or grain), and maithuna (sex or Bhog-vilash or yab-yum) a form of tantra. In Buddhist tantra =Ganachakra and the Mahasiddhas= Samual defines the ganachakra succinctly: Vajranatha associates the Ganachakra with the \\"higher tantras\\" or mysteries , the anuttarayogatantra, and associates a non-monastic origin and tributary of this Mystery Rite to the Mahasiddha tradition which has roots in a complex and coterie of esoteric traditions of numerous Siddha, Yogi, Sadhu and holy peoples of Buddhist, Hindu and non-sectarian practices and views: =In Tibetan Buddhism= In Vajrayana and Dzogchen, it is traditional to offer a gaṇacakra to Padmasambhava or other deities, usually gurus, on the tenth lunar day, and to a form of dakini such as Yeshe Tsogyal, Mandarava or Vajrayogini on the twenty-fifth lunar day. Generally, participants are required by their samaya \\"vow\\" to partake of meat and alcohol, and the rite tends to have elements symbolic of coitus. Traditions of the Ganachakra liturgy and rite extends remains of food and other compassionate offerings to alleviate the insatiable hunger of the hungry ghosts, genius loci and other entities. David Snellgrove (1987) holds that there is a tendency oft-promoted by Tibetan lamas who disseminate teachings in the Western world, to treat references to sexual union and to sadhana that engages with the \\"five impure substances\\" (usually referred to as the \\"five nectars\\") as symbolic.Snellgrove, David (1987). Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors. Volume One: p.160. Boston, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. (v.1). In the twilight language of correspondences and substitutions there is no inconsistency. Although, when modern tantric apologists and scholars employ the term \\"symbolic\\" as though no external practices were engaged in literally, they mislead and perpetuate an untruth. Snellgrove (1987) provides an amended translation of his earlier translation of the Hevajra Tantra (II. vii.5-13): In the Tibetan Buddhist practice of Chöd, a variation of the gaṇacakra has the practitioner visualizing offering their own body as a feast for the gods/demons invited to the feast.

Oikos One. An Akathist Hymn (, \\"unseated hymn\\") is a type of hymn usually recited by Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic Christians, dedicated to a saint, holy event, or one of the persons of the Holy Trinity. The name derives from the fact that during the chanting of the hymn, or sometimes the whole service, the congregation is expected to remain standing in reverence, without sitting down (ἀ-, a-, \\"without, not\\" and κάθισις, káthisis, \\"sitting\\"), except for the aged or infirm. During Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Christian religious services in general, sitting, standing, bowing and the making of prostrations are set by an intricate set of rules, as well as individual discretion. Only during readings of the Gospel and the singing of Akathists is standing considered mandatory for all.  History  The Akathist is also known by the first three words of its prooimion (preamble), Te upermacho stratego (Τῇ ὑπερμάχῳ στρατηγῷ, \\"To you, invincible champion\\") addressed to Holy Mary (Panagia Theotokos, \\"The all-holy birth-giver of God\\"). The akathist par excellence is the one written during the seventh century for the feast of Annunciation of the Theotokos (25 March). This kontakion was traditionally attributed to Romanos the Melodist since kontakia of Romanos dominated the classical repertoire 80 kontakia sung during the cathedral rite of the Hagia Sophia, though recent scholarship rejects this authorship like in case of many other kontakia of the core repertoire. The exceptional case of the Akathist is that the Greek original consists of 24 oikoi, each one beginning with the next letter of the alphabet.See the majuscules in ET-MSsc Gr. 925, ff.80r-87r. Due to the excessive length the kontakion became truncated like the others, but even the earliest chant books with musical notation (the Tipografsky Ustav, for instance) have the complete text of all 24 oikoi written out, but the last 23 oikoi without musical notation.For the earliest translation into Old Church Slavonic within the territory of the Kievan Rus, see Moscow, State Tretyakov Gallery, Ms. K-5349, ff.58v-64r (about 1100). The second folio (between 58 and 59) with the continuation of the notated prooimion and the text of the first three oikoi is missing. Since the 14th century the Akathist moved from the menaion to the moveable cycle of the triodion, and the custom established that the whole hymn was sung in four sections throughout Lent. As such it became part of the service of the Salutations to the Theotokos (used in the Byzantine tradition during Great Lent). Another particular characteristic feature of the Akathist is the extraordinary length of the refrain or ephymnion which conists of a great number of verses beginning with χαῖρε (“Rejoice”) which are called in Greek Chairetismoi (Χαιρετισμοί, \\"Rejoicings\\") or in Arabic Madayeh, respectively; in the Slavic tradition it is known as Akafist. The chairetismoi are only repeated in every second oikos, and from a musical point of view the ephymnion consists just of a short musical phrase, either about the last χαῖρε verse or about allelouia. The writing of akathists (occasionally spelled acathist) developed within the Slavic traditions as a genre of its own as part of the general composition of an akolouthia, although not all compositions are widely known nor translated beyond the original language. Reader Isaac E. Lambertsen has done a large amount of translation work, including many different akathists. Most of the newer akathists are pastiche, that is, a generic form imitating the original 6th-century akathist to the Theotokos into which a particular saint's name is inserted. In the Greek, Arabic, and Russian Old Rite traditions, the only akathist permitted in formal liturgical use is the original akathist. Legends about the origin Icon of the Akathist of the Theotokos. Fresco detail, 1644. Church of the Deposition of the Robe of the Mother of God, Moscow Kremlin. Apart from its usual dedication to the menaion and the early custom to celebrate kontakia during the Pannychis (festive night vigil celebrated at the Blachernae chapel),Alexander Lingas (1995). the Akathist had also the political function to celebrate military victories or to ask during wars for divine protection intermediated by prayers of the Theotokos. This function is reflected within the synaxarion. According to the synaxary the origin of the feast is assigned by the Synaxarion to the year 626, when Constantinople, in the reign of Heraclius, was attacked by the Persians and Avars but saved through the intervention of the Most Holy Theotokos. A sudden hurricane dispersed the fleet of the enemy, casting the vessels on the shore near the Great church of the Theotokos at Blachernae, a quarter of Constantinople inside the Golden Horn. The people spent the whole night, says the account, thanking her for the unexpected deliverance. \\"From that time, therefore, the Church, in memory of so great and so divine a miracle, desired this day to be a feast in honour of the Mother of God ... and called it Acathistus\\" (Synaxarion). This origin is disputed by Sophocles (Greek Lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine Periods, s. v.) on the ground that the hymn could not have been composed in one day, while on the other hand its twenty-four oikoi contain no allusion to such an event and therefore could scarcely have been originally composed to commemorate it. Perhaps the kontakion, which might seem to be allusive, was originally composed for the celebration on the night of the victory. However the feast may have originated, the Synaxarion commemorates two other victories, under Leo III the Isaurian, and Constantine Pogonatus, similarly ascribed to the intervention of the Theotokos. No certain ascription of its authorship can be made. It has been attributed to Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople, whose pious activities the Synaxarion commemorates in great detail. Quercius (P.G., XCII, 1333 sqq.) assigns it to George Pisida, deacon, archivist, and sacristan of Hagia Sophia whose poems find an echo both in style and in theme in the Akathist; the elegance, antithetic and balanced style, the vividness of the narrative, the flowers of poetic imagery being all very suggestive of his work. His position as sacristan would naturally suggest such a tribute to the Theotokos, as the hymn only gives more elaborately the sentiments condensed into two epigrams of Pisida found in her church at Blachernae. Quercius also argues that words, phrases, and sentences of the hymn are to be found in the poetry of Pisida. Leclercq (in Cabrol, Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie, s.v. \\"Acathistus\\") finds nothing absolutely demonstrative in such a comparison and offers a suggestion which may possibly help to a solution of the problem. Structure Icon of the Theotokos Orans from Spasky Cathedral in Yaroslavl (13th-century). When an akathist is chanted by itself, the Usual beginning, a series of prayers which include the Trisagion (thrice- holy) is often said as a prelude to the akathist hymn. The akathist may also be included as a part of another service, such as Matins or a Molieben. The hymn itself is divided into thirteen parts, each of which is composed of a kontakion and an oikos (Greek: οίκος, house, possibly derived from Syriac terminology). The kontakion usually ends with the exclamation: Alleluia, which is repeated by a choir in full settings or chanted by the reader in simple settings. Within the latter part of the oikos comes an anaphoric entreaty, such as Come or Rejoice. For example, the Akathist to the Theotokos: Kontakion One :Queen of the Heavenly Host, Defender of our souls, we thy servants offer to thee songs of victory and thanksgiving, for thou, O Mother of God, hast delivered us from dangers. But as thou hast invincible power, free us from conflicts of all kinds that we may cry to thee: *Rejoice, unwedded Bride! Oikos One :An Archangel was sent from Heaven to say to the Mother of God: Rejoice! And seeing Thee, O Lord, taking bodily form, he was amazed and with his bodiless voice he stood crying to her such things as these: *Rejoice, thou through whom joy will flash forth! *Rejoice, thou through whom the curse will cease! *Rejoice, revival of fallen Adam! *Rejoice, redemption of the tears of Eve! *Rejoice, height hard to climb for human thoughts! *Rejoice, depth hard to contemplate even for the eyes of Angels! *Rejoice, thou who art the King's throne! *Rejoice, thou who bearest Him Who bears all! *Rejoice, star that causest the Sun to appear! *Rejoice, womb of the divine incarnation! *Rejoice, thou through whom creation becomes new! *Rejoice, thou through whom the Creator becomes a babe! *Rejoice, unwedded bride! The thirteenth kontakion (which, unlike the preceding twelve, does not have a corresponding oikos) is usually followed by the repetition of the first oikos and kontakion. After the thirteen kontakia and oikoi, additional prayers are added, such as a troparion and another kontakion. The final kontakion is the famous \\"Tēi Hypermáchōi Stratēgōi\\" (\\"Unto the Defender General\\"), a hymn addressing Mary as the savior of Constantinople in the 626 siege: > :Unto the Defender General the dues of victory, ::and for the deliverance > from woes, the thanksgiving :::I, Thy city, ascribe Thee, O Theotokos. :And > having your might unassailable, ::deliver me from all danger :::so that I > may cry unto Thee: :Rejoice, O Bride unwedded. Various ways of celebration Detail of the icon of the Praises of the Theotokos, before which the Akathist may be chanted. The Theotokos is shown enthroned in the center, with Christ Emmanuel above her. To either side are shown the prophets who foretold the Incarnation. In the full icon, scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary surround this vignette. When the word akathist is used alone, it most commonly refers to the original hymn by this name, the 6th century Akathist to the Theotokos. This hymn is often split into four parts and sung at the \\"Salutations to the Theotokos\\" service on the first four Friday evenings in Great Lent; the entire Akathist is then sung on the fifth Friday evening. Traditionally it is included in the Orthros (Matins) of the Fifth Saturday of Great Lent, which for this reason is known as the \\"Saturday of the Akathist\\". In monasteries of Athonite tradition, the whole Akathist is usually inserted nightly at Compline. The four sections into which the Akathist is divided correspond to the themes of the Annunciation, Nativity, Christ, and the Theotokos herself. The hymn itself forms an alphabetical acrostic--that is, each oikos begins with a letter of the Greek alphabet, in order--and it consists of twelve long and twelve short oikoi. Each of the long oikoi include a seven-line stanza followed by six couplets employing rhyme, assonance and alliteration, beginning with the greeting Chaíre and ending with the refrain, \\"Rejoice, Bride without bridegroom!\\" (also translated as \\"Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded!\\") In the short oikoi, the seven-line stanza is followed by the refrain, Alleluia. The Salutations to the Theotokos service, often known by its Greek name, the Χαιρετισμοί/Chairetismoí (from the Χαίρε/Chaíre! so often used in the hymn), consists of Compline with the Akathist hymn inserted. It is known in Arabic as the Madayeh. Icons There are also several icons of the Theotokos which are known by the title of \\"Akathist\\": =Hilandar= The Icon of the Theotokos \\"Of the Akathist\\" is on the iconostasis of Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos. In 1837 a fire occurred at this monastery, and the monks were chanting the Akathist Hymn in front of this icon.

His most prominent works included Codman House, Lincoln, Massachusetts, and the personal residence of Isabella Stewart Gardner. Later in his architectural career he founded, along with Charles Brigham, Sturgis and Brigham. The firm lasted nearly two decades in New England and received many notable commissions such as the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Early life Sturgis was born in Macau, China on August 5, 1834. He was a son of the \\"very intelligent\\" p. 138, Lady Napier's letter, 19 August 1834 Russell Sturgis, a wealthy Boston merchant active in the China opium trade. After attending Boston Latin School, he traveled extensively in Europe when his father became a partner in Barings Bank in London. In England, he studied architectural drawing under James K. Colling. In 1858, Sturgis married Frances Anne Codman of Boston, later to be aunt of noted interior designer Ogden Codman, Jr. Career For the first three years after his 1858 marriage, Sturgis was in Surrey, where he tried an architectural practice, but their time there ended with the death of their first child, Julia, in January 1861.The Sturgis family archives are held by the Boston Atheneun, together with a manuscript life of the architect.

Floyd Sturgis, John Hubbard in J M Marter (ed) The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2011, 601-2 =Colling & Stugis= Garthmyl Hall by J K Colling, 1859 By 1856/7 he had joined with Colling to form an architectural partnership.For an outline of Colling's life and architectural training see: Antonia Brodie (ed) Directory of British Architects, 1834-1914: Vol. 2 (L-Z), 594, British Architectural Library, Royal Institute of British Architects, 2001M Stratton. The Terracotta Revival: Building Innovation and the Industrial City in Britain and Northern America. Gollancz, London 1993, 144-47. Stratton states that the \\"collaboration\\" between Sturgis and Colling started in 1866 (pg144), this is surely a misprint for 1857 It seems Colling provided the designs and detailing for the architectural work and that Sturgis supervised the work in progress. Albany, LiverpoolTheir first commission was the Albany erected in 1856 for the Liverpool banker Richard Naylor. The Albany was built as a meeting place for cotton brokers. It contained offices and meeting rooms, together with warehousing facilities in the basement. It seems probable that this commission came to Colling and Sturgis as a result of Sturgis' fathers banking connection. The Albany was followed by the building of Ashwicke Hall in Marshfield, Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire for the Liverpool Attorney John Orred.David Verey, rev. Alan Brooks: Gloucestershire 1: The Cotswolds (1999) , pg 472, . This was a massive castellated Tudor Gothic House with a lofty octagonal tower at the S E. Then in 1859, John Naylor, brother of Richard Naylor, who was also a banker and Montgomeryshire landowner requested Colling to re-build Garthmyl Hall, Berriew for his brother-in-law Major- General William George Gold.Haslam R and Scourfield R, \\"Powys:Buildings of Wales\\", 2nd edition, Yale University Press Colling was given a free hand by the wealthy John Naylor when building Garthmyl Hall, as seen by the use of lavish gilding and plasterwork for ceiling decoration, and for the ornamental stonework on the exterior. This was an opportunity for him to put into practice some of the designs illustrated in his books. It is assumed that Sturgis was also involved in this project, as there appears to be widespread use of Terracotta, which would have been supplied by Blashfield of Stamford in this project; and that stylistically this house appears to be a precursor to Sturgis' use of terracotta in America.M. Stratton, The Terracotta Revival: Building Innovation and the Industrial City in Britain and Northern America, Gollancz, London 1993, 144-47 =Bryant & Gilman and Boston practice= Codman House, Lincoln, Massachusetts In autumn 1861 Sturgis and his wife returned to Boston, where Sturgis found work at Bryant & Gilman, then the largest architectural firm in Boston. During this time he worked his own practice as well, providing designs for seaside cottages for members of the family and others. These included * Sunnywaters in (1863), Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, for his older brother Russell.Floyd, 2011 * The Grange, or Codman House, in Lincoln, Massachusetts, which he thoroughly redesigned from in 1862-8 for his wife's brother Ogden Codman. * Lowlands, Nahant, Massachusetts, for George Abbott James. * House in Cotuit, Massachusetts, for the Charles Russell Codman. * Greenvale Farm (1864), Portsmouth, Rhode Island. * Seaside house (1864), Land's End, on Ledge Road, Newport, Rhode Island, for Sam Ward, his father's business associate. This house was later acquired by Edith Wharton, a cousin through the New York Newbolds, and completely reworked by her and Ogden Codman Jr. for their book, The Decoration of Houses. * The Rocks (1866), Newport Rhode Island. =Sturgis & Brigham= The Codman Building, 1873 In 1866, Sturgis formed a partnership with a fellow Bryant and Gilman employee, Charles Brigham, to found Sturgis and Brigham. This partnership would last twenty years, until shortly before Sturgis's death. Sturgis was also visiting England regularly and continued to work closely with Colling, who supplied him with designs. Colling is known to have supplied the designs for stonework on Pinebank Mansion (1868) a house for Edward N. Perkins' on the shore of Jamaica Pond.\\"Stratton\\", 144 Sturgis also imported terracotta from J. M. Blashfield's works at Stamford, Lincolnshire for this project, which served as the prototype for the terracotta used for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Following the recommendations of Henry Cole, Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sturgis & Brigham were appointed architects to build the new Boston Museum of Fine Arts (1870–76) in a Gothic style. Colling prepared all the drawings for the terracotta decoration and commissioned them from Blashfield's works. At this point terracotta production had hardly developed in the United States and the products often lacked durability. The building of the Museum was the first major use of Terracotta in an American building and led to its widespread popularity. It did not bring success to Blashfield, who had underestimated the cost of the contract and the problems of shipping to America. The Stamford Terracotta Company was forced in liquidation in 1874.\\"Stratton\\",146 For future supplies of terracotta for the Codman and YMCA buildings in Boston, which were the work of Sturgis & Brigham, they were likely to have been reliant in terracotta from the Chicago Terracotta Company, run by James Taylor, Blashfield's former foreman.For charting the developing use of Terracotta in Chicago and Boston see \\"Stratton\\", 147-163 Other buildings by Sturgis include: * Church of the Advent on Beacon Hill, executed in the Early English Gothic Style between 1875 and 1888. * Isabella Stewart Gardner House for Isabella Stewart Gardner on Beacon Street in Boston. * Frederick Ames House at 306 Dartmouth Street in Boston's Back Bay (now known as the Ames-Webster Mansion). * \\"The Cottage\\" (1870) for H. H. Hunnewell on the Hunnewell estate in Wellesley, Massachusetts. This last commission is considered to be the first bona fide example of the Queen Anne style of residential architecture in the United States. =Later life= In later years Sturgis re-designed the 1737 Boylston House in Brookline, Boston, which he rented between 1870 and 1888 from Colonel Henry Lee. Sturgis died on a visit to England in 1888. After his death, his nephew Richard Clipston Sturgis continued the architectural practice. Literature * Boit, Robert Apthorp (2009).

Its flagship product, CodeWarrior, comprised an IDE, compilers, linkers, debuggers, libraries, and related tools. In 2005 it was absorbed into Freescale, which continues to sell these tools. In 2015, Freescale Semiconductor was absorbed into NXP. History Founded by Greg Galanos in 1985 as Metropolis Computer Networks in Hudson, Quebec, Metrowerks originally developed software development tools for the Apple Macintosh and UNIX workstations. Its first product was a Modula-2 compiler originally developed by Niklaus Wirth, the creator of the ALGOL W, Pascal and Modula-2 programming languages. It had limited success with this product. In 1992, it began an effort to develop development tools for Macintosh computers based on the newly announced PowerPC processor as well as legacy support for 68k chipsets. It shipped the first commercial release of CodeWarrior in May 1994 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. The release was a great success. Metrowerks received much credit for helping Apple succeed in its risky transition to a new processor. In March 1994 Metrowerks had its initial public offering, trading under the symbol MTWKF (NASDAQ foreign exchange) and continued to trade on Canadian exchanges. Also in 1994, Metrowerks opened a small sales and R&D; office in Austin, Texas to be closer to the manufacturers of the new PowerPC chips, IBM and Motorola. Metrowerks later moved its corporate headquarters to Austin along with Greg Galanos (Founder/President/CTO) and Jean Belanger (Chairman/CEO). By 1996 Metrowerks had begun expanding its CodeWarrior product line to target platforms besides Macintosh computers, including: * Mac OS PowerPC * Mac OS 68k * General Magic's Magic Cap OS * BeOS * Microsoft Windows x86 * NEC v8xx, VRxxxx * General MIPS (ISA I-IV) * General PowerPC embedded * General 68k embedded * General Coldfire embedded * General ARM embedded * PlayStation, PS2 and PSP * Nintendo 64 and GameCube * Sega Saturn * Java tools * Nokia SymbianOS (toolchain sold to Nokia in late 2004) * PalmPilot In August 1999, Motorola's semiconductor sector (Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector, or SPS) acquired Metrowerks for roughly $100 million in cash. After the acquisition, Jean Belanger moved to become VP of business development in SPS and after a short stint as Director of Software Strategy for SPS, Greg Galanos left to become a General Partner and Managing Director at SOFTBANK Venture Capital, known as Mobius Venture Capital since December 2001. David Perkins, previously SVP of Business Development at Metrowerks, assumed the title of President and CEO. Metrowerks subsequently acquired a small number of other companies including HIWARE AG, Embedix and AMC. In 2002, David Perkins assumed the role of Corporate Vice President of NCSG at Motorola SPS; Jim Welch (previously the CFO of Metrowerks) assumed the role of CEO. In late 2003, Jim Welch left to become CEO of Wireless Valley Communications and Matt Harris (who was previously CEO of Lineo and Embedix) became the new CEO of Metrowerks. In 2003, Motorola spun off its semiconductor group as a separate company named Freescale Semiconductor. In early 2005, Matt R. Harris left Metrowerks to become CEO of Volantis at which time Freescale management decided to absorb Metrowerks completely and not treat it as a wholly owned subsidiary. CodeWarrior for Mac OS had successfully made the transition to Apple's new Mac OS X operating system, supporting the Carbon development environment. However, Apple invested heavily in their own development tools for OS X (Xcode), distributed free of charge and always up to date. The increasing prominence of the Cocoa development environment marginalized CodeWarrior, and finally the surprise announcement of the Mac's switch to Intel processors – mere weeks after Freescale had sold the Metrowerks Intel compiler tools to Nokia – signalled the end of CodeWarrior on the Mac. In July 2005, Freescale discontinued CodeWarrior for Mac OS. In October 2005, Freescale retired the Metrowerks name but continues to develop CodeWarrior and other developer technologies as part of Freescale's Developer Technology Organization. Metrowerks' logo of the iconic factory worker and other visual branding was created by illustrator Bill Russell Addendum: Freescale's website now says, \\"CodeWarrior for Mac OS has been discontinued and is no longer sold or supported.\\" It has several downloadable updates, but the most recent modification date is 15 August 2005.

History and current state The old school building of what was then named Gamaliel Bradford High School was originally built as a public works project in 1938 during the Great Depression, designed by Perry Shaw and Hepburn and built by M. Spinelli and Sons Co., Inc. The building has been modified with several additions throughout its existence, most recently with a new fitness center. The 1938 building was replaced in 2012 with a new building in the former parking lot. Renewal and expansion Wellesley High School in 2009 before demolition Age and maintenance issues have taken their toll on the school structure. The increasing size of the student body as well as the evolving nature of education have challenged the capability of the building to meet the needs of the school community effectively and safely. In September 2005, the exploration of options for a new building or refurbishment was commenced by the town.http://savewhs.org/townsman1012A.htm In October 2007, a public meeting was held to introduce several options for the expansion of the school, including renovation and extension of the existing building and its demolition and replacement by a completely new structure. The site has been expanded by purchase of three adjacent properties in Seaver Street and transfer of publicly owned land. On December 10, 2008, town voters approved the project by nearly 2 to 1 (5,026 YES to 2,869 NO), to build a new, state-of-the art high school on the parking lot next to the existing buildings. Site clearance started in August 2009 with the relocation of one house to a nearby site. Construction began March 2010 with an estimated completion date of September 2013. The new facility opened in February 2012, and the school held a gala to say goodbye to the old building, and alumni such as Billy Squier, Jane Curtin, and Biz Stone gave last rites in the school auditorium over a series of weekend concerts and get-together events in 2011. After much analysis, the existing structure was declared to be a good example of the Art Deco style of Architecture; however, it was found by the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) not to be a historically significant example and was demolished in 2011 and 2012. The State authorities held the final say in this ruling, but the A.I.A. review opened the door for the eventual knock-down and the final site plotting. The new structure, which opened to students in February 2012, incorporates some of the design features of the prior building and is limited in its visual impact to blend with the surrounding residential neighborhood. The total cost was estimated to be $130 million with $85 million of that total to be raised from State and Federal matching funds. However, the final project came in under budget at $90 million and opened 18 months ahead of schedule.

The brow ridge, or supraorbital ridge known as superciliary arch in medicine, refers to a bony ridge located above the eye sockets of all primates. In Homo sapiens sapiens (modern humans) the eyebrows are located on their lower margin. Structure The brow ridge is a nodule or crest of bone situated on the frontal bone of the skull. It forms the separation between the forehead portion itself (the squama frontalis) and the roof of the eye sockets (the pars orbitalis). Normally, in humans, the ridges arch over each eye, offering mechanical protection. In other primates, the ridge is usually continuous and often straight rather than arched. The ridges are separated from the frontal eminences by a shallow groove. The ridges are most prominent medially, and are joined to one another by a smooth elevation named the glabella. Typically, the arches are more prominent in men than in women, and vary between different ethnic groups. Behind the ridges, deeper in the bone, are the frontal sinuses. =Terminology= The brow ridges, being a prominent part of the face in some ethnic groups and a trait linked to both atavism and sexual dimorphism, have a number of names in different disciplines. In vernacular English, the terms eyebrow bone or eyebrow ridge are common. The more technical terms frontal or supraorbital arch, ridge or torus (or tori to refer to the plural, as the ridge is usually seen as a pair) are often found in anthropological or archaeological studies. In medicine, the term arcus superciliaris (Latin) or the English translation superciliary arch. This feature is different from the supraorbital margin and the margin of the orbit. Some paleoanthropologists distinguish between frontal torus and supraorbital ridge.American Heritage Dictionary. supraorbital In anatomy, a torus is a projecting shelf of bone that unlike a ridge is rectilinear, unbroken and goes through glabella.torus Some fossil hominins, in this use of the word, have the frontal torus, but almost all modern humans only have the ridge. =Development= Spatial model The Spatial model proposes that supraorbital torus development can be best explained in terms of the disparity between the anterior position of the orbital component relative the neurocranium. Much of the groundwork for the spatial model was laid down by Schultz (1940). He was the first to document that at later stages of development (after age 4) the growth of the orbit would outpace that of the eye. Consequently, he proposed that facial size is the most influential factor in orbital development, with orbital growth being only secondarily affected by size and ocular position. Weindenreich (1941) and Biegert (1957, 1963) argued that the supraorbital region can best be understood as a product of the orientation of its two components, the face and the neurocranium. The most composed articulation of the spatial model was presented by Moss and Young (1960), who stated that \\"the presence… of supraorbital ridges is only the reflection of the spatial relationship between two functionally unrelated cephalic components, the orbit and the brain\\" (Moss and Young, 1960, p282). They proposed (as first articulated by Biegert in 1957) that during infancy the neurocranium extensively overlaps the orbit, a condition that prohibits brow ridge development. As the splanchocranium grows, however, the orbits begin to advance, thus causing the anterior displacement of the face relative to the brain. Brow ridges then form as a result of this separation. Bio- mechanical model The bio-mechanical model predicts that morphological variation in torus size is the direct product of differential tension caused by mastication, as indicated by an increase in load/lever ratio and broad craniofacial angle.Oyen and Russell, 1984, p. 368-369 Research done on this model has largely been based on earlier work of Endo. By applying pressure similar to the type associated with chewing, he carried out an analysis of the structural function of the supraorbital region on dry human and gorilla skulls. His findings indicated that the face acts as a pillar that carries and disperses tension caused by the forces produced during mastication. Russell and Oyen et al. elaborated on this idea, suggesting that amplified facial projection necessitates the application of enhanced force to the anterior dentition in order to generate the same bite power that individuals with a dorsal deflection of the facial skull exert. In more prognathic individuals, this increased pressure triggers bone deposition to reinforce the brow ridges, until equilibrium is reached. Native American man with pronounced brow ridge and sloping forehead. Oyen et al. conducted a cross-section study of Papio anubis in order to ascertain the relationship between palate length, incisor load and Masseter lever efficiency, relative to torus enlargement. Indications found of osteoblastic deposition in the glabella were used as evidence for supraorbital enlargement. Oyen et al.’s data suggested that more prognathic individuals experienced a decrease in load/lever efficiency. This transmits tension via the frontal process of the maxilla to the supraorbital region, resulting in a contemporary reinforcement of this structure. This was also correlated to periods of tooth eruption. In a later series of papers, Russell developed aspects of this mode further. Employing an adult Australian sample, she tested the association between brow ridge formation and anterior dental loading, via the craniofacial angle (prosthion-nasion-metopion), maxilla breadth, and discontinuities in food preparation such as those observed between different age groups. Finding strong support for the first two criteria, she concluded that the supraorbital complex is formed as a result of increased tension due to the widening of the maxilla, thought to be positively correlated with the size of the masseter muscle, as well as with the improper orientation of bone in the superior orbital region. =Function= The brow ridge functions to reinforce the weaker bones of the face in much the same way that the chin of modern humans reinforces their comparatively thin mandibles. This was necessary in pongids and early hominids because of the tremendous strain put on the cranium by their powerful chewing apparatuses, which is best demonstrated by any of the members of the genus Paranthropus. The brow ridge was one of the last traits to be lost in the path to anatomically modern humans, and only disappeared in a majority of modern humans with the development of the modern pronounced frontal lobe. This is one of the most salient differences between Homo sapiens and other species like the Homo neanderthalensis. Image of a rugby player with a pronounced supraorbital ridge. =Paleolithic humans= Pronounced brow ridges was a common feature among paleolithic humans. Early modern people such as those from the finds from Jebel Irhoud and Skhul and Qafzeh had thick, large brow ridges, but they differ from those of archaic humans like Neanderthals by having a supraorbital foramen or notch, forming a groove through the ridge above each eye, although there were exceptions, such as Skhul 2 in which the ridge was unbroken, unlike other members of her tribe. This splits the ridge into central parts and distal parts. In current humans, almost always only the central sections of the ridge are preserved (if preserved at all). This contrasts with many archaic and early modern humans, where the brow ridge is pronounced and unbroken. Other animals Gorilla with a frontal torus The size of these ridges varies also between different species of primates, either living or fossil. The closest living relatives of humans, the great apes, have a relatively pronounced supraorbital ridge, which has also been called a frontal torus while in modern humans it is relatively reduced. The fossil record indicates that the supraorbital ridge in early hominins was reduced as the cranial vault grew; the frontal portion of the brain became positioned above rather than behind the eyes, giving a more vertical forehead.

To ensure safety off the playing field, a barrel sock or plug for the marker is also compulsory. Depending on type of play, additional equipment can include gloves, a pack designed to comfortably carry pods containing extra paintballs, and a squeegee or swab for cleaning out the barrel in case a paintball breaks. Players may also elect to wear padding or armor in order to reduce the impact of incoming paintballs. Markers A paintball marker is the primary piece of equipment used in paintball to tag an opposing player. An expanding gas (usually carbon dioxide or high-pressure air) forces a paintball through the barrel at a muzzle velocity of approximately . This velocity is sufficient for most paintballs to break upon impact at a distance, but not so fast as to cause tissue damage beyond mild bruising. Nearly every commercial field has, and strictly enforces, a rule limiting the muzzle velocity of a paintball at or below . Speeds above 250 are typically needed to ensure the paintball breaks on impact; the field limit is thus usually somewhere in between, often 260-280fps. The technology used to design and build paintball markers has advanced over time, beginning with the original \\"Nel-Spot\\" bolt-action pistols, progressing to pump-action markers, then to semi-automatic mechanical markers, and finally culminating in the electropneumatic paintball marker. In mechanical designs, the trigger manipulates a sear, which is holding a hammer, ram, or sealed gas chamber in its resting state. Pulling the trigger releases the sear, allowing the marker's action to cycle. There are a variety of mechanical designs, the most common being the \\"blow-back\\" marker, which utilizes a spring-loaded ram released by the sear to open a pin valve; the pressurized gas released through the valve is directed through the bolt to fire the marker, and also pushes the ram back where it is caught again by the sear, resetting the action for the next shot. There are other systems that saw success in earlier days of the sport, such as blow-forward (AGD Automag) and pneumatically actuated recocking (WorrGames Autococker); elements of these designs were carried forward into modern electropneumatic designs but the original examples of these mechanisms are rarely seen today. In electropneumatic designs, the trigger, instead of being mechanically linked to the action of the marker, simply activates an electronic microswitch (or more recently, a magnetic or optical sensor). That information is passed through control circuitry to a computer-controlled solenoid valve which can open and close very quickly and precisely, allowing gas to move into or out of various pressure chambers in the marker to move the bolt and fire the paintball. This disconnect of the trigger from the action allows electronic trigger pulls to be very short in length and very lightweight (similar to a mouse click; the mechanisms are virtually identical), which dramatically increases rate-of-fire over a fully mechanical design. Solenoid-controlled gas valve designs also allow for reduced weight of internal parts, which both lightens overall weight and reduces the time it takes for the marker to cycle through firing a single paintball. In fully electropneumatic designs, there are two primary mechanism types: * The \\"poppet valve\\" (or simply \\"poppet\\") design functions similarly to a mechanical blowback or Autococker-style marker; when the trigger is pulled, low-pressure air from the solenoid brings the bolt forward to chamber the paintball and also sends a connected, weighted ram into a pin valve, which opens to allow high-pressure air into the chamber, launching the ball. Then, either additional air from the solenoid in a \\"two-way\\" design, or a spring in a \\"FASOR\\" (Forward Air, Spring-Operated Return) design, returns the bolt and ram to the open position. Another paintball drops into the open chamber and the action is ready to fire again. Poppets are typically valued for high gas efficiency, as the low-pressure system to move the ram and the limited time the high-pressure valve is open saves gas compared to most competing designs. However, the nature of the mechanism produces very loud \\"pops\\" when the marker is fired, and the movement of the ram and bolt and the sudden high-pressure release of air can increase recoil, affecting accuracy during rapid fire. They are also more mechanically complex; most designs require two regulators, one to adjust the \\"high-pressure\\" air launching the ball, and a second one to further lower the pressure to operate the ram. * The \\"spool valve\\" (\\"spoolie\\") typically uses the bolt itself to hold air in a filling chamber. This high- pressure air is either self-balancing so there is no net force to open the bolt (a \\"balanced\\" spool valve), or is kept in check by additional air from the solenoid pushing backward on the bolt (an \\"unbalanced\\" or \\"dump-valve\\" spool). When the trigger is pulled, the solenoid of a balanced system pushes the bolt forward, or in a dump-valve vents the air from the forward pressure chamber. As the bolt moves forward, it seals off the inlet allowing high- pressure gas into the filling chamber, and then releases the stored charge of air through the bolt into the main chamber to launch the ball. The solenoid then resets the bolt by allowing air to re-enter the forward chamber and pushing the bolt backward to re-seal the filling chamber and open the inlet. Spool valves are typically valued for their quieter and smoother operation, and their reduced mechanical complexity (often the only major moving part is the bolt), but are often less gas-efficient than poppet valves due to the large charge of air behind the bolt and the single operating pressure used both to move the bolt and launch the ball. In addition to fully electropneumatic marker designs, electronic trigger frames, with a solenoid- controlled sear, can be fit to most mechanical \\"blow-back\\" designs, such as the Kingman Spyder line of entry-level markers. These allow the high rates of fire seen in full electropneumatic designs at a very low cost compared to higher-level markers; however they typically have both the higher recoil of poppets (even worse, typically, as the designs use a traditional high-mass hammer driven forward by a spring) and relatively low gas efficiency due to a single operating pressure. Contrasting this move toward high rates of fire, there is also a strong following of stock-class paintball games, where players use older, purely mechanical pump-action marker designs to purposefully limit rate of fire. Pump markers require the player to recock the marker, using a pump handle similar to a pump-action shotgun, before each shot. Stock-class games and competitions require the use of pump markers, and also often limit the types and capacities of propellant sources and loading mechanisms that players may use. With the decreased rate of fire and carrying capacity, increased need for reloads of both paintballs and propellant, and the generally quieter report of these markers, stock-class play places more emphasis on accuracy, stealth, and tactics. Propellants Paintball markers are powered by the expansion of gas stored in a compressed gas bottle. The two most common forms of compressed gas are carbon dioxide and high-pressure air (HPA). =Carbon dioxide= A typical CO2 canisterBecause CO2 becomes a liquid when compressed, it must expand to a gas in order to be used by most paintball markers, although several older models actually require liquid CO2 in order for proper operation.Conrad, H., Lehmkuhler, F., & Sternemann, C. (2009). The Carbon dioxide-water interface of gas hydrate formation. The Journal of the American Chemical Society, 131(2), Retrieved 2010 April 2 from Scopus Database This expansion is not adiabatic and requires energy, causing the tank to cool as heat is used to expand the liquid CO2 into gas. Eventually, under sustained fire, and especially in cold weather, the tank can become so cold that ice crystals form on it. If the CO2 bottle does not have an anti-siphon tube fitted, or is shaken while firing, the liquid CO2 may enter the marker. The liquid CO2 then passes through the marker instead of the tank, evaporating and causing the marker to freeze. This results in large clouds of CO2 vapor ejected from the marker upon firing, caused by the liquid CO2 evaporating in/around the barrel. This is known as \\"drawing liquid\\". This can cause damage to internal seals and O-Rings, and can \\"freeze\\" some markers, putting it out of commission for some time while it warms back up. Simple operation designs such as in-line blow-back (most Tippmanns), guns designed before HPA was more widely used, or guns using 12-gram CO2 powerlets are usually not affected by this problem, but it can still cause damage to the marker over time. For this particular reason, most high-end markers recommend that you use HPA. Technically, CO2 and HPA can propel the paintball, but when high rates of fire are attained, liquid is sucked into the marker which can damage or even destroy electrical components inside the marker such as the solenoid. Never leave a CO2 container in sunlight, as the heat will cause the gas to expand to a dangerous level. The tanks include safety valves in their construction, but there is no need to use them or take unnecessary risks. With normal back- bottle setups (or, air systems utilizing a horizontal air source adapter, more commonly called an ASA), the less dense gaseous CO2 will rise to the top half of the tank. Normally, ASAs are angled slightly so the gaseous CO2 is always available at the valve of the tank. Special devices known as anti-siphon tubes extend the mouth of the valve, and provide only CO2 from the top part of the tank. During rapid successions of shots, gaseous CO2 is used up. Liquid CO2 will take some time to evaporate and rebuild the internal pressure. This process causes potentially large changes in velocity and therefore, in accuracy and range. =High-pressure air or N2= A Pure Energy N2 tank with a remote line attached The newer high-pressure air (HPA) paintball markers use compressed air or nitrogen (N2) for propulsion, to attempt to offset issues with other types of propellants such as . Due to nitrogen's low critical point, when pure nitrogen or air (which is 78% nitrogen) is compressed, it remains in gaseous form unless the temperature goes well below . When it expands, the tank also cools due to the Joule-Thomson effect, but at a far lower rate than liquid because it does not have to phase-change from liquid to gas. The lack of vaporization reduces the variation in output gas pressure associated with rapid successions of firing cycles, improving accuracy and reducing the chance of \\"freeze-up\\" malfunctions. However, because the propellant gas is stored at higher pressures (up to ) while liquid CO2 is stored at around , HPA tanks need to be built to higher pressure ratings and are thus heavier and more expensive. The tanks themselves can either be filled with pure N2 or air (which is 78% N2). Tanks smaller than may not last heated matches, while larger tanks are cumbersome and require mounting options that create a larger marker profile. There are two different kinds of HPA tanks in paintball. There are aluminium tanks which are preferred by younger players because while aluminium tanks are heavy and only hold about , they are also much cheaper to buy (at about USD $50, only slightly more than tanks). The second kind of tank is made from carbon fiber, which is much lighter and stronger than aluminium (being able to contain and in some rare cases , as opposed to only that an aluminium tank will hold). Generally, carbon fiber tanks are preferred by more experienced players and buyers with a larger budget, because the qualities are very reliable and have proven themselves worthy of their generally hefty price tags. HPA tanks are generally filled from specially designed air compressors which are made to create extremely high pressures (unlike shop compressors). Although HPA tanks may, in theory, be refilled from other sources such as a conventional scuba tank or an average general-purpose air compressor, the pressure available from these sources is far below the pressure that HPA tanks are designed for. For example, shop compressors create around range, an order of magnitude less than HPA tanks are designed for (typically in the range of ). HPA tanks are filled from a nipple instead of the ASA valve, which allows them to be filled while the tank is still attached to the paintball marker. =Propane= In 2005, Tippmann introduced the Tippmann C3 with PEP (Propane Enhanced Performance); the first paintball gun to use propane as a propellent.Wahjudi, J. (2009, February 17). Tippmann C3. Retrieved from This increased the number of balls that could be shot before needing to refill the tank (around 100 times more: which gives 50,000 shots per 470-millilitre tank), as well as having a lower gas pressure. =Comparison= Nitrogen is generally preferred over carbon dioxide for a few reasons. Nitrogen will not liquefy and leak into the marker, while if the CO2 tank does not have an anti-siphon tube installed, or if there is no expansion chamber or regulator, liquid CO2 can leak into the marker, causing damage to O-rings and dangerous overpressures. The solenoid valves on electro-pneumatic markers are particularly sensitive to this, and thus many manufacturers will specify to use only nitrogen or HPA with their electro-pneumatic markers. Because it is always controlled by 2 or more pressure regulators, Nitrogen generally has a more consistent shot velocity than CO2. This is because when the playing area is warm, the normally unregulated CO2 will expand more rapidly from the liquid form, causing the marker to fire at a higher velocity. But when the temperature is lower, either a cool day, or from rapid firing of the marker, the expansion within the tank occurs more slowly, causing a decrease in the velocity of the subsequent shots. This is especially apparent during rapid firing while using unregulated CO2. The cooling effect of rapid discharge of CO2 causes the temperature of the liquid CO2 to drop dramatically, resulting in a significant loss in overall pressure. This effect can be greatly overcome by the use of a regulator on the tank and one on the marker, and then setting the marker up to operate well on low pressure (about 400-600 psi.). Most CO2 markers are designed to operate from a bare, unregulated tank of CO2. The heretical act of placing a regulator at the neck of the tank will 'filter' most of any liquid escaping, but also reduce the natural pressure from the CO2 tank in the process. Hence the need for the marker to operate on pressures well below the natural pressure of CO2. The second regulator is used to modulate the final pressure to a point below what the CO2 tank can deliver when frosty cold (around 500–600 psi.), or toasty warm (900–1200 psi.). A qualified air smith can perform the necessary changes inside the marker to accommodate the lower operating pressure. This adds some expense to the marker but is a solution if you don't have access to HPA (Nitrogen). Some markers prefer 900–1000 psi. or more so they do not work well at pressures that CO2 provides at its natural, room temperature pressure, so adding regulators will be an exercise in futility. The effect of temperature on HPA or nitrogen, on the other hand, is negligible. However, CO2 tanks are significantly cheaper than nitrogen tanks. The nitrogen tanks traditionally cost slightly less to be filled than the CO2 tanks at approximately three to five US dollars. Also, many fields offer better rates for HPA fills due to the lower cost to the field; HPA is generally cheaper to procure as it has myriad industrial applications, and the field can even purchase the equipment to pressurize their own cylinders on-site. CO2, on the other hand, must be separated from other gases before bottling, usually through super-cooling air to the condensation point of each gas, a process that requires far more sophisticated and expensive equipment when adding regulators to prevent liquid 'splash' and also avoid the dreaded sag in pressure, Masks A typical paintball mask with a MARPAT coverSometimes called \\"goggles\\", masks are safety devices that players are required to wear. These completely cover the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of a person. Some masks even feature throat guards. The lenses are designed to protect against paintballs traveling up to , but are not guaranteed to withstand impacts at greater speeds.Paintball Mask Buying Guide. Retrieved from Double-layered or \\"thermal\\" lenses are also available. These lenses are much less prone to fogging. These work by separating an inside and an outside lens with an air chamber, that allows for the difference in temperature between the inside and the outside of the mask without forming condensation. However, if any moisture whatsoever somehow gets in between the two lenses, the inner faces of both lenses will fog, and it will take a very long time to dry out, if it does at all. Fogging masks can be a significant hazard while playing. Besides the lost vision, players may be tempted to remove their mask and expose themselves to serious eye injuries.Taban, M., & Sears, J.E. (2008). Ocular finding following trauma from paintball sports. Eye, 22(7), Retrieved 2010 April 4 from Scopus Database. To reduce fogging of lenses while playing, some masks include electric fans that remove humidity and dry the lens. This is especially useful for situations that require wearing the mask for extended periods of time, such as wood play, large games, or being a referee. Finally, there are many anti-fog topical solutions that players can apply. The exterior of the thermal lenses (or the lenses, in non-thermal masks) is usually made of Polycarbonate. This material provides excellent impact resistance. Because polycarbonate is soft, these lenses are manufactured with anti-scratch coatings. But great care must be taken to keep proper care of the lenses. Many vendors recommend the immediate replacement of very scratched lenses, or lenses subjected to very strong impacts. Generally, more expensive masks tend to be smaller (which in turn makes the player a smaller target), more comfortable, have more interchangeable parts and be made of soft enough material to get some bounces.Redwood, . (2008). Choosing the right paintball masks. Wolf Pack Paintball Team, Retrieved from http://www.wolfpackpaintballteam.com/paintball/paintball-masks.html Retrieved 2010 April 16 While playing paintball, even just shooting at the ground or trees, wearing proper paintballing masks is mandatory for safety. Some paintballs are very thick and can bounce off the ground, and other objects, and hit people. Hoppers/loaders Hoppers contain the paintball supply for a marker, much as magazines contain the ammunition on a regular rifle. With few exceptions, hoppers are all mounted above the marker, and most use gravity as the ultimate force to get the balls in the marker. That is to say, if most hoppers are turned upside down, the marker will not be fed with balls and will cease to fire. There are three main types: Gravity Feed, Agitated Feed, and Force Feed loaders. Gravity Feed hoppers often get jammed up with balls at the feed neck, which can result in a marker 'dry firing' (firing without paint) or chopping balls due to the timing of the ball entering the marker. This is detrimental to the speed and performance of the marker. Agitated Feed hoppers improve on the Gravity method of feeding the marker. Some use simple agitation levers or paddles inside the hopper to shake up the balls and guide them down the feed neck. Others (sometimes colloquially known as 'revies') use a paddle wheel inside the hopper to force any balls reaching the bottom of the hopper into the feed neck. Agitated Feeders need gravity to keep the balls rolling toward the bottom of the hopper before they can reach the loading mechanism. The 'Revo' with 'Z-Board' uses an electric motor to spin the paddle wheel at high speed and this method remains one of the fastest loading systems as of March 2013. Force Feed loaders create a stack of paint balls leading into the marker. Most of these hoppers maintain a constant tension on the ball stack to ensure that once a paintball is fired, a new one immediately takes its place. A special feed tube is sometimes used to allow placement of a hopper below the chamber, giving the marker a much lower profile. Any hopper-based loading system still relies on gravity to get paint into the drive portion of the loader itself. The 'Warp' loader uses an electric motor to rotate two silicone discs with ball-shaped divots, which add each ball to a stack headed down the feed tube into the chamber. Helical Feed loaders are a form of Force Feed loader which use helix (or coil) shaped clips. In most designs, each clip is preloaded (typically before a match begins) with paintballs which are stacked under constant pressure to ensure a continuous feed of balls into the chamber. One drawback to this pressure is that paintballs stored in the clip will become deformed over time, causing jams or inaccuracy. Using a feed tube, these loaders can be mounted under a barrel. Helical feed loaders can fire continuously in any orientation. The 'Q-Loader' system uses a spring-driven clip, eliminating the potential noise of a motor-driven system. The 'Q-Loader' system is capable of loading 100 balls in less than 3 seconds, though breakage can occur at higher spring tensions. There is some confusion about the term 'loader'. A loader typically refers to a powered or constant-pressure system, whereas gravity feed systems are generally referred to only as a hopper. In short, a loader system may include a hopper, and a hopper may function using gravity without any loader at all, but the two terms are often used interchangeably. Paintballs Original Nelson paint tube produced around 1985 for oil-based paintballs.Paintballs, also simply called \\"paint\\", are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. Paintballs are made of materials found in food items, and are edible but taste disagreeable as they tend to dry up the mouth. The use of polyethylene glycol (a laxative) in the fill can also cause gastrointestinal distress in individuals who eat a number of paintballs; therefore, they should be kept out of reach of young children. Early paintballs were made of glass and filled with inedible oil-based paint, since they were made for marking trees and cattle, but modern paintballs should easily wash out of most clothing. The color of the shell does not necessarily indicate the color of the fill. Most common paintballs and paintball markers are described as .68 caliber (17.3 mm), but many factors affect the exact dimensions. Paintballs and barrels vary in size from .43 caliber to .71 caliber (17 mm to 18 mm). In addition, paintballs are seldom perfectly round and are very sensitive to heat and moisture. A hot or humid day may result in paint swelling or becoming misshapen. Care should be taken to keep paintballs out of the sun and away from moisture. An insulated cooler works well for this on the field. The gelatin shell of a paintball is designed to break upon impact, although ricochets or \\"bounces\\" may occur. There are many types of paintballs, including glow in the dark paintballs for use at night, scented paintballs, and formulations for winter play. When dropped on the ground, groundwater or condensation may swell the paintball, which could cause a jam in the barrel or rupture and foul the internal workings of the marker. Dropped ammunition is known as 'loose paint', and should not be used in paintball markers. Generally speaking, paintballs of greater price are subjected to more stringent manufacturing processes, quality checks, and standards, making their size and shape more consistent. This is very important for accuracy. Better paintballs also tend to have thinner shells to improve the frequency of breaking on impact rather than bouncing, and thicker, more opaque fills that are more visible and harder to wipe off. While it is theoretically possible to freeze a water-based paintball, the polyethylene glycol additive drastically lowers the freezing point of the mixture, making it highly unlikely to actually freeze it into something harder than a regular paintball. When introduced to a very cold environment, the paintball's shell will most likely dimple (making it less accurate) and the shell will become brittle. U.S. SWAT teams often use paintball-like balls, also known as pepper balls, filled with oleoresin capsicum, the active ingredient of pepper spray, as a non-lethal incapacitation method. However, pepperballs are shot at a higher velocity than is safe for paintball (above ) and the shells are not made from gelatin, but rather a frangible plastic to make shots more painful for faster incapacitation. Pepperballs can be shot out of almost any paintball marker. Recently, HydroTec has released a new paintball. It uses a corn-based shell and a fill which is 98% water. The paintball shell tolerates temperatures up to . These features, along with a unique construction process, make for a much more consistent paintball. Within Islam, the consumption or even touch of anything pork-related is not allowed or considered to be Haram. So there have been requirements for Muslim players to use paintballs which are \\"Halal\\" which means approved by Islam. These paintballs are made from beef gelatine. These are often called \\"Halal paintballs\\". =Reusable paintballs= A reusable ball is a foam substitute for a paintball; one common brand is Reballs. Most reusable paintballs are the same size as normal paintballs, but weigh slightly more and do not contain a paint filling. As they do not break open to leave a paint mark on players, they are practical for indoor locations where an accumulation of paint from broken paintballs would be a problem. This makes this form of paintball questionable, since no mark of paint is left, it allows players to cheat much more easily. A Reball is more expensive than a paintball, but since they can be cleaned and reused many times, they potentially have a lower cost per use. Some paintball parks have added dedicated reball fields, and some fields have actually gone exclusive with Reballs, eliminating the use of paintballs entirely. The primary use of Reballs, as intended initially by the manufacturer, is as a practice aid for teams who wish to save money by using reusable ammunition. Other manufacturers have created similar products, such as the V-Ball, a Velcro (hence the name V-Ball) reusable paintball. Reballs are also used at a lower velocity because of their inability to break on whoever they hit. For example, a Regular paintball will normally be shot at slightly less than , while a Reball is supposed to be used at around . It is noteworthy that the composition of Reballs results in increased ricochets, depending on the surfaces that they hit. Although these paintballs or reballs are cost-effective, they are not allowed on many courses, because Reballs can become dirty, and attempting to shoot the dirty Reball can damage and weaken the integrity of the barrel. The term 'reusable balls' does not refer to paintballs that have been picked up from the ground. Clothing Woodsball players usually wear camouflage clothing. Paintball clothing needs to be tough and durable. For woodsball, camouflage clothing is effective for blending in with the environment; players may wear army surplus military fatigues, Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), Army Combat Uniform (ACU) or DPM styles. For speedball, however, the small field and artificial obstacles make camouflage ineffective; players, therefore, will often choose to wear a brightly coloured team uniform for ease of identification. For scenario games, players will tend to dress in a style appropriate to the character or force they are representing. In order to minimize the sting of close-range hits, players often wear extra layers of clothing padding as well. Clothing worn for tournament paintballing is constrained by tournament rules, which prohibit thick padded materials likely to adversely affect the chance of paintballs breaking on the target.American Paintball League, . (2003). 2003 standard rule book for tournament paintball. Retrieved from Retrieved 2010 April 16 Players need adequate padding to protect the elbows and knees for slides on hard ground and chest protectors for shots to the chest. The player(s) could get seriously injured if these parts are not protected. Footwear varies enormously between Speedball and Woodsball/scenario games. In woodsball, the rough terrain and uneven, often muddy ground makes footwear with good grip and plenty of ankle support a necessity. This lends itself to boots, either military-style or walking/hiking boots. In speedball, however, the added weight of thick boots is a distinct disadvantage, as is the reduction in mobility. Speedball players, therefore, tend to wear athletic shoes with soft cleats designed for field sports, such as soccer or football. Common accessories =Drop forward= A drop forward is a marker add-on which is used to reposition the air canister to a more comfortable position or one which improves the balance of the marker. They usually tilt the canister onto a slight angle and move it forward of its original position. They come in all shapes and sizes, however, so it is a personal preference which direction the tank is \\"dropped\\" - it is possible to mount the tank vertically, reversed or almost any other conceivable position. Most players use it to assist with balancing the marker, or to reduce its total length to make it more maneuverable (particularly if it has an extremely long barrel). Some marker designs do not permit the installation of a stock if the air cylinder is left in its standard location, necessitating a drop- forward if the player wishes to install a stock to improve accuracy. There is a dispute among many players, however, that a drop forward will make the player's profile unnecessarily tall and wide, as the tank pushes the loader higher up above the head and may cause the player to hold his/her arms out wider in play to make up for the unnatural angle the drop will put on a grip. =Remote line= A remote lineA remote line is a hose (a gas line) which can be connected to a marker and to the tank, which allows the user more freedom of movement while handling the marker, because the tank can now be stored on a pod belt or in a pouch. Their utility lies in decreasing the weight and length of the marker, making it more maneuverable. However, they may get caught in trees and shrub, and if the tank is hit it still counts as a kill, even though it is on the player's back. Remote lines are not frequently used by tournament players, as it adds unnecessary weight (and the presence of the gas tank is factored into the design of tournament markers, making them extremely unbalanced if the tank is removed). Some remote lines utilize a slide check as a valve. =Pod= A pod full of paintballs Pods, also known as guppies or simply tubes, are simply rigid tubular plastic containers which hold paintballs. The most common pod size holds about 140 paintballs; however, other sizes are available, and 100 paintball pods are common at rental sites, while there are also pods for smaller paintball pistols which only have the capacity of 10 paintballs (such pods are usually called tubes). Standard pods use a spring-loaded plastic top to enable them to be opened quickly and single-handedly. There are variations - for example, Dye Lock Lid pods which use a simple locking mechanism to ensure they won't open accidentally, or Syn Shockpods, which are engineered to be able to be shaken vigorously without the paint inside breaking. The oldest and largest manufacturer of pods is Allen Paintball Products in Ohio USA, they have been making paintball products since 1987. =Harness= Harnesses, or pod packs, are hip-worn belt packs or full vests that hold pods full of paintballs, and in some cases the player's gas tank if using a remote line. Most hoppers hold about 200 paintballs, and many modern electropneumatic markers can empty a full hopper in 10 seconds of sustained fire. In woodsball, and especially in scenario paintball, a player may be away from a base at which they can reload for an extended period of time. In speedball, the necessity of suppressing fire requires a very large amount of paint for a single game or match. In both cases, a harness with pods allows a player to have a portable supply of paint, without weighing down his or her marker with an enormous hopper. Harnesses capable of carrying a tank in addition to pods are usually labeled with a +1 (e.g. A harness capable of carrying four pods and a tank would be labeled 4+1). In addition, newer harness design make use of collapsible \\"expansion sleeves\\" in between the \\"main\\" sleeves. Packs with expansion sleeves are generally labelled X+Y, for instance 4+5, and indicate the number of main sleeves followed by the number of expansion sleeves. Some packs have multiple \\"tiers\\" of expansions or extra sleeves in very different locations on the harness, and may be labelled 4+3+2 where the last number is the additional set of expansions. Harnesses for speedball tend to consist of a bellyband with sleeves in the back for the pods, and are designed to carry widely varying amounts of paint while maintaining a small profile. They more often have expansion sleeves, though some woodsball harnesses feature them as well. Pods most often face lid-down, so that any pod can be reached by either of the player's hands and pulled out quickly, regardless of how the player is situated. Speedball harnesses rarely feature tank pouches; speedball players must refill tanks often, and switch hands often to lean out from the left or right of a bunker, both of which are made more complicated when using a remote line. For speed and convenience, speedball players often temporarily discard empty pods on the ground and retrieve them between games; for this reason, ease of reloading pods into the harness is often a secondary concern to player profile and ease of access. Harnesses for woodsball have features designed to aid concealment, such as camouflage colors. Simpler harnesses consist of a belt pack with a number (usually 4, 6, or 8) of formed pockets for pods. They less often feature expansion sleeves (though some do). They are more likely to have the pockets side-facing, or in front of the player, which allows the player to more easily place an empty pod back in its pocket. This is necessary as discarding and retrieving \\"spent\\" pods is infeasible on a woodsball field consisting of many acres of dense forest. They usually, but not always, feature a tank pouch, allowing use of a remote line with a \\"mil-sim\\" marker for added realism. =Squeegee= A \\"cable\\" squeegeeSqueegees are used to clean out debris from the barrel and breach, including dirt/mud, paint and shells from broken paintballs, and residue from the shells' gelatin coating. One common design is the \\"rod squeegee\\", and consists of a hinge-mounted rubber disc on the end of a plastic rod of sufficient length to reach the full length of the barrel. The rubber washer end is inserted sideways into the barrel, pushed to the bottom and subsequently withdrawn with the rubber disc rotated ninety degrees (so that the disc now touches the inner circumference of the barrel and scrapes the paint out). Such designs often place the hinged disk on an inner cable or rod that is manipulated by a trigger at the other end; by pulling the trigger, the disk is forced to rotate into contact with the barrel surface. For situations where the marker's bolt or barrel can be quickly removed, a \\"cable squeegee\\" may be used. A cable squeegee is simply one or more rubber disks mounted perpendicular to a flexible metal cable (usually with a plastic jacket to avoid marring the barrel's surface). The end opposite the disc(s) (the \\"pull end\\") is inserted into the rear of the bolt chamber or the chamber side of the barrel, as appropriate, and fed through until the pull end protrudes from the front of the barrel. The squeegee is then pulled through the breech and/or barrel. Some designs incorporate a swab of an absorbent material that picks up anything the disc(s) leave behind. Because they require removal of the bolt or barrel, they are slower to use than a rod squeegee; however, being composed mainly of a flexible cable, they can be easily coiled up into a very compact size. A \\"Battle Swab\\" is used commonly in speedball for extremely quick cleaning; a double-ended stick with soft absorbent fur is simply shoved down the length of the barrel to remove any performance hindering paint or shell. The swab often has a bendable rubber section in the middle so that it can be folded over and stored in a pocket. Battle swabs generally do not clean as thoroughly as other methods, but they can be used in a few seconds where other methods take far longer. Regardless of the design, as the squeegee is withdrawn, the barrel is perfunctorily cleaned to allow continued use of the marker. This allows the player to reduce the amount of paint or other debris in the marker, which can severely reduce accuracy, without having to remove themselves from play. A more thorough cleaning is recommended once time allows. =Barrel blocks= A barrel blocker in a Tippmann 98 Custom and by itself above. A barrel block is a family of safety devices that mechanically obstruct the end of the marker's barrel. They are intended to ensure that, should all other safety devices incorporated in the marker fail or be deactivated, a paintball fired by the marker will not leave its barrel and cause injury. Barrel blocks are usually required by commercial fields, to be used on any marker that is in an area where masks are not required. Forgetting to replace it after leaving a game and entering a safe zone will usually earn a warning. Repeated infractions will often result in ejection from the site. This is done for liability reasons and to lower possibility of unexpected injury to anyone around, especially important when involving eye safety. There are two common types of barrel block: * A barrel plug is a plastic or rubber plug that fits snugly into the muzzle end of the marker's barrel, like a wine cork. If made of plastic, they generally incorporate one or more rubber o-rings to provide friction against the barrel surface. These were the original and universal form of barrel block before the introduction of the barrel sock, but are now generally eschewed by players and fields in favor of barrel socks. When using a barrel plug, if a paintball is fired, it will break against the plug in the barrel, lining the barrel with paint and drastically affecting accuracy until the barrel can be squeegeed. Barrel plugs can also be hard to remove and install properly; the high friction that keeps the plug in place when needed also inhibits its intentional removal. The force of the paintball impacting against the plug is often enough to dislodge it; with modern electronic markers having \\"automatic\\" and \\"burst\\" modes of fire, a single pull of the trigger may be enough to expel the barrel plug from the barrel, which can cause injury in itself, and also exposes those nearby to any further shots leaving the barrel after the plug has been expelled. Barrel plugs, therefore, are not an absolute safety against accidental marker discharge and eye injury. * Barrel socks, also commonly called barrel sleeves or barrel condoms, are a newer form of barrel block, and consist of a cloth pouch with an adjustable elastic cord. The pouch is placed over the muzzle of the marker, and the elastic cord is stretched over the feed neck of the marker, and tightened so the pouch is kept securely on the muzzle. If a paintball is fired, it will exit the muzzle and be caught immediately by the pouch. Barrel socks have several advantages over barrel plugs. First, if a paintball is fired, it will generally break in the pouch after leaving the barrel. This generally results in less mess inside the barrel itself (though it is generally still necessary to clean the barrel afterward). Barrel socks are also easy to install and remove; a properly adjusted sock can simply be lifted off by the player against the force of the elastic; it can be completely removed from the marker, or for convenience it can be left hanging by its cord from the feed neck, allowing it to be put back in place at a moment's notice. Most importantly, a barrel sock, with the cord properly tightened, will remain in place over the barrel even after repeated shots, and thus it provides a far more reliable barrier against unintentional shots causing injury. Most fields use a product called a 'Barrel Capp' for their rental equipment. Other equipment =Paint grenades= Although not legal in tournament play, paint grenades may be found in recreational and scenario play. There are two kinds of grenades in use: * Non-explosive grenades are generally closer to water balloons in function. One common grenade design consists of a rubber tube sealed securely at one end and more loosely at the other, with an arming pin which, when pulled, loosens that end. The tube is filled with paint under pressure, usually from a syringe. When the grenade is thrown against a hard surface, the loose end of the tube is unsealed, and the paint is sprayed over a wide area, potentially marking players. Another common design consists of a small compressed CO2 tank surrounded by a container of paint. * Explosive paint grenades are powered by a small black powder \\"banger\\", tipped with a short time-fuse. A small plastic bag of paint is wrapped around this, and the whole assembly is contained in a breakable fibre case (usually segmented to resemble a WWII-era grenade). The end of the fuse protrudes from the top of the casing, and is tipped with a friction-sensitive material similar to the head of a match. This is then covered with a removable cap as a form of \\"safety catch\\". To fire the grenade, the cap is removed and its specially roughened outer surface is struck against the fuse, igniting it. The grenade is immediately thrown; the fuse burns down to the tightly packed black powder in two or three seconds and the grenade explodes. This paint is normally a different color to the fill of the normal paintballs used on that field, as spray from a grenade (by definition) must count as a kill. Under most rules, any mark from a paint grenade is sufficient to count as an elimination. =Grenade launcher= Paintball grenade launchers are used in recreational and scenario paintball games to launch paint grenades. They are more accurate than throwing a paint grenade, which gives an advantage. Tippmann products such as the X7 are able to have a grenade launcher attached. =Paint mines= Paint mines are simulated land mines for use in Paintball. Several devices have been designed to spray paint over an area when triggered by passing players. Some of these devices are placed on the ground where, once a person steps on them, forces paint to shoot up and around the target marking the stepper and any nearby teammates. =Smoke grenades= Smoke grenades, also used in military and law enforcement training, may be allowed in a paintball game. In tournament paintball the use of smoke grenades or any other explosive is strictly prohibited.US Painball League, . (2009). 2009 official rule book. http://www.nppl.com, Retrieved from The grenades create a screen of smoke which can obscure the movement of players and make it more difficult for the opposition to hit them. Some large-scale scenarios use military-issue smoke grenades, but for recreational use, smaller commercial 'smokes' are preferred (due mainly to cost and convenience). =Thunderflashes= Alongside paint and smoke grenades, many recreational paintball venues sell small thunderflashes for use during games. These are effectively black-powder fireworks which explode with a loud bang, but have a sufficiently small blast to be thrown at opposing players with reasonable safety (provided they do not attempt to pick them up). They are used in the same way as the explosive paint grenades described above. In practice, thunderflashes have little purpose in a paintball game; their effectiveness at their supposed task of disorienting the enemy is dubious. Nevertheless, they are popular with occasional players, presumably in emulation of the much bigger flashbangs used by the military. =Slingshots= A variation of paintball uses slingshots instead of markers to propel the paintballs. Because slingshots may shoot faster than , sometimes up to , most paintball fields don't allow them. A normal game usually requires all players to use slingshots, but some games may allow certain players to use pump-action markers vs. slingshots, such as Cowboys and Indians. =Airow gun= The Airow gun uses a combination of mechanical and pneumatic power to convert the energy from a compound, or recurve bow. The energy released is generally equivalent to the power generated by a marker. Entire games have been dedicated to the use of Airow Guns, in a fashion similar to that of slingshot paintball. =Paintball bazooka= A \\"paintball bazooka\\", or a \\"paintball rocket launcher\\" is a modified paintball gun or an item built from scratch to specifically \\"kill\\", or \\"take out\\" a paintball tank. Most often they fire rockets built from scratch or multiple Paintballs. Many players prefer not to have one because they severely limit what they can do because of the large, hard projectiles they usually fire can injure a player. The only exception of ones that can be fired at anything besides tanks, and/or buildings are the type that fire multiple paintballs instead of rockets. =Paintball artillery= Paintball artillery ranges from howitzers, through mortars to anti-tank guns. These paintball weapons are usually made of PVC and wood combination, but heavy-metal steel replicas do sometimes appear. Their ammunition ranges from firing a cluster of paintballs, small water balloons, through small pyro-grenades (used in some mortars) to foam rockets. Foam rockets are the most common ammunition for anti-tank guns. Some AT guns are using soft and fragile marking ammunition instead.  Vehicles  Paintball tanks are a wide variety of vehicles sometimes used in woodsball events to eliminate large numbers of opponents by using protection and superior firepower. They can range from golf carts covered in plywood to real military tanks with real guns converted to fire paintballs. Many paintball sponsors and businesses sometimes have their own paintball tanks which they take to events. Although local paintball parks usually don't make use of vehicles (since the cost of the vehicle and its maintenance can be prohibitive), tournaments and other 'sponsored' events will often feature several. = Mechanised paintball = As well as infantry-based paintballing, there are also opportunities to take part in more mechanised versions. A number of companies offer experience days featuring an opportunity to drive a \\"tank\\" (often actually an armoured personnel carrier) fitted with a paintball \\"gun\\".example of a tank paintball experience day (retrieved 18 August 2010) Two such vehicles are then driven around a course, each trying to inflict more paint damage on the other. In a similar vein, Radio-controlled model tanks (typically around 1:6 scale) can also be fitted with paintball markers and used in a similar way.RC tank Combat (retrieved 18 August 2010) Equipment maintenance =Marker maintenance= A well-maintained paintball marker will last longer and be more reliable. A paintball marker should be disassembled and checked for problems routinely. For example, it is not uncommon for O-rings to break, or for paintballs to break inside the barrel. The latter problem can be solved temporarily when the player is \\"in the field\\" by using a pipe-cleaner-like tool referred to as a squeegee. However, it is important to disassemble the marker after the game and properly clean out any affected parts with the marker company's recommended material/solvent (such as a special cloth, or lubricant) and a paper towel. After cleaning, the marker should be lubricated with commercially available paintball lubricant. Most such lubricants are oils or greases derived from formulae used in pneumatic tools (such as Dow 33) or from gun lubricants. However, lubricants marketed as gun oils should not be used, as most commercial brands contain petroleum solvents to remove powder fouling; these solvents will degrade the synthetic rubber o-rings in a paintball marker. The technician should then ensure that the marker is unloaded before firing several shots to blow out any remaining paint and dry out the interior. Replacements for broken parts should only be sourced from the manufacturer of the marker. Many guns also have elements not designed to be maintained by end users (such as solenoid valves); these should not be disassembled, and if they become faulty they are typically replaced outright. =Mask maintenance= If the mask's lens are covered in paint, it is important not to simply wipe the paint off, because doing so may cause debris to scratch the lens. The player should leave the field and clean off the lens using water and a towel or a piece of cloth or you can bring your own. When thermal lenses are used, water or anti-fog treatment should be applied only to the outer lens, as moisture of any kind between the two lenses will ruin the lens system. The interior portion of a thermal lens is also quite soft and should only be wiped clean with a microfiber lens cloth designed specifically for cleaning glasses or goggles without scratching. Products such as Windex or other glass and spectacle cleaners should never be used, as they are designed to be used on glass rather than polycarbonate. Doing so could damage the anti-fog treatments, or compromise the integrity of the lens, putting the player at risk of serious injury. A convenient method is to use a cheap small spray bottle to spray water onto the lens rather than pouring it on. Another good lens-cleaning agent is a 50–50 mixture of rubbing alcohol and water. After it is mixed it should be put into a spray bottle for use. Use only a clean cloth on the mask; paper towels will scratch the lenses. Anti-fog spray is also available, which coats the lens in a temporary fog-resistant film. Some new lenses will come \\"pre-treated\\" by anti-fog, or the lens will say \\"fog- resistant\\" — with these lenses, it is advised that anti-fog chemicals are never used as the chemicals can damage the lens beyond further use. Lenses should be replaced once a year, as their strength is adversely affected by exposure to sunlight. =Paint to barrel matching= Paintballs generally change shape or size due to differing temperature or humidity, or even due to varying manufacturing processes. If a paintball is larger than the barrel bore, it will at a minimum cause reduced efficiency due to increased friction. Oversized paintballs can also break inside the barrel and coat the inside with paint, causing shot inaccuracy until it is cleaned out. If the paintball is too small for the barrel, air will escape around the paintball when firing, causing a drop in velocity and accuracy. Correcting for this by adjusting the velocity adjuster on the marker could cause a lack of air efficiency. To check for a good paint-to-barrel match, remove the barrel from the marker and insert a paintball into the barrel. If the paintball simply rolls through the barrel, then the paintball is too small for that barrel. If the paintball does not roll out, then attempt to blow the paintball out of the barrel using your mouth. Ideally, you should be able to easily blow the paintball out, however, if this is not possible and the paintball becomes stuck, then the paintball is too large for the barrel.. Because of the varying sizes of paintballs and barrels, many people opt for an adjustable-bore barrel, commonly called a barrel system or barrel kit. These barrels allow for the user to adjust the internal bore of the barrel to allow for a perfect match for the paint being used. The kits may use pieces called \\"backs\\" to adjust bore size, or inserts, which are used in the Scepter barrel kit. Such examples of an adjustable-bore barrel are the Furious Lotus, Sly Dual-Carbon, Powerlyte Scepter, MacDev Matchstick, Smart Parts Freak Barrel, Dye Ultralight, Stiffi Switch Kit, and the Deadlywind Fibur. =HPA cylinder hydrostatic testing= Since the propellant cylinder used by players are subjected to high pressures and stresses, they must be tested in accordance with the laws of the country the player operates in. In the United States, the United States Department of Transportation requires that cylinders undergo a hydrostatic test at certain intervals, depending on the Special Permit or exemption certificate granted to the manufacturer for the cylinder, and cylinder size. DOT speciation 3AL Aluminum cylinders have a five-year hydro cycle (meaning they must be hydrostatically re-tested every five years) and an unlimited service life. Cylinders with a DOT Special Permit may require hydrostatic re-testing at different intervals, and have varying service life depending on the Special Permit. It is illegal to fill a cylinder that is outside of its hydro date. cylinder that have been abandoned, damaged, have failed hydrostatic re- testing, have failed a formal inspection, or are out of service life should be properly condemned and removed from service by a trained professional.

It is named for American President James Monroe and is the fourth highest mountain on the 4000 footers list for New Hampshire. The Appalachian Trail skirts its summit, which is the next highest peak on or near the trail north of Mount Rogers in Virginia. The Lakes of the Clouds, and its AMC hut, lie nestled at the col between Mount Monroe and neighboring Mount Washington. Lying between Mount Washington and Mount Eisenhower, Mount Monroe is inaccessible by road but may be reached by several hiking trails. The most direct route to its summit from the valley below is chiefly via the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail which starts to the northwest near the base station of the Mount Washington Cog Railway. After ascending to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, the eastern terminus of the trail, one proceeds to Monroe's summit via the Crawford Path and then the Monroe Loop trail. Other routes to the summit ascend via the Crawford Path from Crawford Notch, singly or in combination with the Edmands Path from Mount Clinton Road to the west of the mountain, with the final ascent to the summit accomplished by the Monroe Loop. From the east, one can trek to Monroe via a combination of the Boott Spur, Tuckerman Ravine, or Lion Head trails, among others, traversing via intervening trails, or descend from the summit of Mount Washington, which may be reached on foot, by car or by the Cog Railway, along the Crawford Path or by other routes. Very frequently hikers will visit Monroe in combination with Washington or Eisenhower and sometimes with other nearby peaks. Mount Monroe offers majestic views across the Lakes of the Clouds to its grand neighbor to the northeast, Mount Washington, over higher, to Mount Jefferson and Mount Clay north of Washington and to Boott Spur and Mount Isolation south of the dominant peak, as well as fine views to the west along the southern spine of the Presidential Range, through the Dry River valley, and out to more of the White Mountains to the south and west and to Vermont beyond. As with Mount Washington, the upper reaches of Mount Monroe lie above tree-line in a sub-arctic tundra climate zone, characterized by highly variable and often very severe weather, especially from late fall through early spring. One distinguishing feature of the mountain is the largely flat Monroe Lawn south of the summit, traversed by the Crawford Path and home to several rare species of plant, including the endangered Robbins Cinquefoil, which survive in this harsh, outlying climate and terrain where other plants perish. Visitors traversing the Lawn are strictly limited to the trail in order to protect the many fragile flora which grow there. Other notable features of the mountain include its subpeaks, \\"Little Monroe\\" to the west of the principal peak and approximately shorter, and Mount Franklin, southwest of the summit and nearly above sea level. The mountain, as with much of the Presidential Range, is characterized by steep walls on either side of the main ridge, to its northwest and southeast, making for strenuous climbs from the valley below and for numerous waterfalls - especially along the route followed by the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail - and frequently scarred by landslides.Steven D.

She was the first woman attorney in New Jersey and then used her legal training for the advancement of women's rights, the social settlement movement in Jersey City, and a gender free writing of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947. Mary Philbrook was born in Washington, D.C. in 1872 but her family moved to Jersey City by the time she was six. She attended Public School #11 (now the Martin Luther King, Jr. School) and then Jersey City High School (now William L. Dickinson High School). Philbrook left school before graduating to become a stenographer in a law office, and she applied to be admitted to the New Jersey Bar in February 1894. The fact that Mary had not attended college, law school, or even finished high school was no barrier to her admission as a lawyer. At the time, candidates could simply apply to take the bar exam. Some three hundred female lawyers were practicing in thirty other states, but the New Jersey Court decided that \\"[a] woman is not, by virtue of her citizenship, vested by the Constitution . . . with any absolute right. . . to practice as an attorney.\\" New Jersey suffragists, including Cecilia Gaines, President of the Jersey City Woman's Club, lobbied the legislature to pass a law in 1895 allowing women to become lawyers in New Jersey, and Mary Philbrook was the first to be admitted. She worked for the law firm of Bacot and Record in Jersey City before starting her own practice. In 1906 she was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court, the first woman from New Jersey to be so appointed. Philbrook volunteered to be counsel for the Legal Aid Society at Cornelia Bradford's Whittier House in lower Jersey City, and she helped Mabel Smith Douglass and the College Club of Jersey City to promote the founding of New Jersey College for Women (now Douglass College). During the suffrage campaign, Philbrook supported the militant activism of Alice Paul and her National Woman's Party in Washington, D.C. After the passage of the 19th Amendment, Philbrook worked with Alice Paul for the passage of an equal rights amendment. In 1947 Philbrook led a successful effort to change the wording of the New Jersey Constitution to ensure equal rights for women. As a result, the word \\"persons\\" is used to include both sexes, making sexual discrimination unconstitutional. Philbrook died in 1958. Every year, the Rutgers School of Law - Camden confers the Mary Philbrook Public Interest Award to a distinguished individual who has honored the spirit of Mary Philbrook by serving the public interest in the legal field. The award is presented at a gala dinner that also honors law school students who have particularly distinguished themselves in public interest law.

On September 12, 1992, Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-47 carried 10 Get Away Special (GAS) canisters. Amongst these GAS cansisters was G-102 sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America's Exploring Division in cooperation with the TRW Systems Integration Group, Fairfax, Virginia. The project was named Project POSTAR. (The name was a combination of the words \\"Post\\" and \\"Star\\"). Beginnings What was to become Project POSTAR began in late 1978 when TRW purchased the \\"GAS Can\\" for $10,000. The Exploring Division of the Boy Scouts of America announced the opportunity for Explorer Posts and Sea Explorer (see: Sea Scouting) Ships to design experiments to fly on the Space Shuttle. Approximately two-hundred Posts and Ships from around the United States expressed interest in developing an experiment, and thirty- eight submitted a first phase proposal. A panel of scientists and engineers from NASA, TRW, and the Boy Scouts of America, headed by astronaut James A. Lovell, selected eighteen experiments for the second phase. In 1982, the experiments were pared down to a final eleven. NASA Explorer Post 1275 located at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland integrated all the experiments into the GAS canister. Tragedy and Success NASA grounded the Space Shuttle program after the explosion of Space Shuttle Challenger during the launch of mission STS-51-L on January 28, 1986. This action meant that Project POSTAR might not ever fly. Due to the hard work of many, an albeit smaller Project POSTAR was launched on Space Shuttle Endeavour on September 12, 1992. The final seven experiments and their sponsors were: * Capillary Pumping developed by Explorer Post 9005 and sponsored by the McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, MO. * Cosmic Ray developed by Sea Explorer (see:Sea Scouting) Ship 101 and sponsored by the American Legion of Bridgeport, CT. * Crystal Growth developed by Explorer Post 310 and Emulsions developed by Explorer Post 310, both sponsored by Chesebrough-Pond's Research Laboratory, Trumbull, CT. * Fiber Optics developed by Explorer Post 475 sponsored by the Naval Avionics Center, Indianapolis, IN. * Floppy Disk developed by Explorer Post 1022 sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Columbia, Maryland. * Fluid Droplets developed by Explorer Posts 822 and 2268 sponsored by Martin Marietta, Littleton, CO and the Denver Museum of Natural History, Denver, CO. * Command, Power and Mechanical Systems designed by Explorer Post 1275 sponsored by the Goddard Explorer Club of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.

She was last seen alive spending time at the home of the Skakel family, across the street from her home in Belle Haven. Michael Skakel, also 15 at the time, was convicted in 2002 of murdering Moxley and was sentenced to 20 years to life. In 2013, he was granted a new trial by a Connecticut judge and released on $1.2 million bail. On December 30, 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled 4–3 to reinstate Skakel's conviction. The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed itself on May 4, 2018 and ordered a new trial. The case attracted worldwide publicity, as Skakel is a nephew of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Moxley murder On the evening of October 30, 1975, Martha Moxley left with friends to participate in \\"Mischief Night\\", in which neighborhood youths would ring bells and pull pranks such as toilet-papering houses.Framed by Robert Kennedy, Jr. According to friends, Moxley began flirting with, and eventually kissed, Thomas Skakel, Michael's brother. Moxley was last seen \\"falling together behind the fence\\" with Thomas Skakel, near the pool in the Skakel backyard, at around 9:30 p.m. The next day, Moxley's body was found beneath a tree in her family's backyard. Her pants and underwear were pulled down, but she had not been sexually assaulted. Pieces of a broken six-iron golf club were found near the body. An autopsy indicated that she had been both bludgeoned and stabbed with the club, which was traced back to the Skakel home. Investigation and trial =Initial investigation= Thomas Skakel was the last person seen with Moxley on the night of the murder, and he had a weak alibi. He became the prime suspect, but his father forbade access to his school and mental health records. Kenneth Littleton, who had started working as a live-in tutor for the Skakel family only hours before the murder, also became a prime suspect. However, no one was charged, and the case languished for decades. In the meantime, several books were published about the murder, including Timothy Dumas' nonfiction A Wealth of Evil (1999), Dominick Dunne's fictional account of the case, A Season in Purgatory (1993) and Mark Fuhrman's nonfiction Murder in Greenwich. Over the years, both Thomas and Michael Skakel significantly changed their alibis for the night of Moxley's murder. Michael claimed that he had been window-peeping and masturbating in a tree beside the Moxley property from 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Two former students from Élan School, a treatment center for troubled youths, testified they heard Michael confess to killing Moxley with a golf club. Gregory Coleman testified that Michael was given special privileges, saying Michael bragged, \\"I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.\\" =Investigation reopened= When William Kennedy Smith was tried (and acquitted) for rape in 1991, a rumor surfaced that he had been present at the Skakel house on the night of the Moxley murder, with the clear insinuation that he might have been involved. Although this proved to be unfounded, it resulted in a new investigation of the then-cold case. The Sutton Associates, a private detective agency hired by Rushton Skakel in 1991, conducted its own investigation of the killing. The Sutton Report, later leaked to the media, revealed that both Thomas and Michael Skakel altered their stories about their activities the night Martha was killed. In 1993, author Dominick Dunne, father of murdered actress Dominique Dunne, published A Season in Purgatory, a fictional story closely resembling the Moxley case. Mark Fuhrman's 1998 book Murder in Greenwich named Michael Skakel as the murderer and pointed out numerous mistakes the police had made in investigating the case. Even in the years before the Dunne and Fuhrman books, Greenwich Police detectives Steve Carroll and Frank Garr, as well as police reporter Leonard Levitt, had become convinced that Michael Skakel was the killer. =Trial= In June 1998, a rarely invoked one-man grand jury was convened to review the evidence of the case. After an 18-month investigation, it was decided there was enough evidence to charge Michael Skakel with murder. On January 9, 2000, an arrest warrant was issued for an unnamed juvenile for Moxley's murder. Skakel surrendered to authorities later that day. He was released shortly thereafter on $500,000 bail. On March 14, Skakel was arraigned for murder in a juvenile court as he was 15 years old at the time of Moxley's murder. On January 31, 2001, a judge ruled that Skakel would be tried as an adult. Skakel's trial began on May 7, 2002, in Norwalk, Connecticut. He was represented by attorney Michael Sherman. Skakel's alibi was that at the time of the murder he was at his cousin's house. During the trial, the jury heard part of a taped book proposal, which included Michael Skakel speaking about masturbating in a tree on the night of the murder--possibly the same tree under which Moxley's body was found the next morning.; cf. In the book proposal, Skakel did not admit to committing the murder. Prosecutors took words from the book proposal and overlaid them on graphic images of Moxley's dead body in a computerized, multimedia presentation shown to jurors during closing arguments. In the audiotape, Skakel said that he was afraid he might have been seen the previous night \\"jerking off\\", and he panicked. Though the jury heard the whole tape, during the closing arguments the prosecutor did not play the portion of the audiotape in which Skakel had said \\"jerking off\\", giving the impression that he was confessing to the murder. On June 7, 2002, Skakel was found guilty of murdering Moxley, and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He was assigned to the Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown, Connecticut. The prosecutors' use of the multimedia presentation during closing arguments was included in Skakel's initial appeal. In their brief responding to that appeal, the prosecution argued: Michael Skakel Michael Christopher Skakel (born September 19, 1960) is the middle of seven children, born to Rushton Walter Skakel and Anne Reynolds. Rushton's sister Ethel is the widow of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Skakel's grandfather George was the founder of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, a coal company that was one of the largest and wealthiest privately held corporations in the United States. The family lived in the affluent neighborhood of Belle Haven in Greenwich, Connecticut. After his mother's death from brain cancer in 1973, Skakel began abusing alcohol. He was a poor student and reportedly flunked out of a dozen schools. He also struggled for years with dyslexia, which went undiagnosed until he was 26.Foderaro, Lisa W. \\"2 Kennedys Sent Pleas For Skakel\\" New York Times. August 30, 2002. His cousin Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. later wrote that Skakel was a \\"small sensitive child — the runt of the litter with a harsh and occasionally violent alcoholic father who both ignored and abused him.\\" According to neighbors and family friends, the Skakel children were given unlimited amounts of money and were largely unsupervised. In 1978, Skakel was arrested for drunk driving in New York. To avoid criminal charges, Skakel's family sent him to the Élan School in Poland, Maine, where he received treatment for alcoholism. He ran away from the school twice before leaving after two years. Skakel later attended Elmira College and earned a bachelor's degree. During the 1980s, he attended several rehab facilities before finally becoming sober in his twenties. He also pursued a career as a professional athlete; Skakel competed on the international speed skiing circuit and tried out for the speed skiing demonstration team that appeared at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. In 1991, he married professional golfer Margot Sheridan, with whom he has one child. Sheridan filed for divorce shortly after Skakel was arrested for Moxley's murder in January 2000. Their divorce was finalized in 2001. Post- trial In January 2003, attorney Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Skakel's cousin, wrote a controversial article in The Atlantic Monthly entitled \\"A Miscarriage of Justice,\\" insisting that Skakel's indictment \\"was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison.\\" Kennedy argued that there is more evidence suggesting that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live- in tutor, killed Moxley. He also called Dominick Dunne the \\"driving force\\" behind Skakel's prosecution. =Appeals= Skakel continued to fight his conviction. In November 2003, Skakel appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, arguing that the trial court erred because the case should have been heard in Juvenile Court rather than in Superior Court, that the statute of limitations had expired on the charges against him and that there was prosecutorial misconduct. On January 12, 2006, the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected Skakel's claims and affirmed his conviction. Subsequently, Skakel retained attorney and former United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, who filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Skakel before the Supreme Court of the United States on July 12, 2006. On November 13, 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\\"Skakel Murder Conviction Left Intact by U.S. Supreme Court,\\" Bloomberg, November 13, 2006 In 2007, Skakel's new attorneys, Hope Seeley and Hubert Santos, filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for a new trial in the Connecticut trial court that had originally heard his case, based on a theory involving Gitano \\"Tony\\" Bryant, cousin of Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant and a former classmate of Skakel at the private Brunswick School in Greenwich. In a videotaped interview with Skakel's private investigator Vito Colucci in August 2003, Bryant said that on the night of Moxley's murder, one of his companions had wanted to rape her. Bryant said that he did not previously come forward because his mother had warned him that as a black man he would be tagged for the unsolved murder. A two-week hearing in April 2007 allowed the presentation of this hearsay evidence, among other matters. In September 2007, Skakel's attorneys filed a petition, based in part on Bryant's claims, asking for a new trial; prosecutors formally responded that Bryant may have made up the story to sell a play about the case. The new Skakel defense team also hired a full-time investigative team to review existing and new information--particularly a book written about Élan School--in preparation for the hearing. They argued that no Élan residents who knew Skakel, other than Gregory Coleman, had ever spoken about Skakel's confession to anyone, including to the author of the book. On October 25, 2007, a Superior Court judge denied the request for a new trial, saying Bryant's testimony was not credible and that there was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in the original trial. Skakel's lawyer appealed this decision to the Connecticut Supreme Court. On March 26, 2009, a five-judge panel of the court heard arguments on this appeal. On April 12, 2010, the panel ruled 4–1 against Skakel's appeal. Skakel then appealed based on a charge of incompetence against Mickey Sherman, his lead attorney at the trial. In an April 2013 hearing in Vernon, Connecticut, Skakel testified that Sherman, rather than focusing on Skakel's defense, instead had basked in celebrity. Skakel also claimed that Sherman was more interested in collecting fees to settle Sherman's own financial problems than in defending Skakel. Sherman testified in defense of his actions, while continuing to maintain his belief in Skakel's innocence in the Moxley case. =Parole hearings= Skakel had been imprisoned at the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, Connecticut. On January 24, 2012, Skakel and his attorneys argued for a sentence reduction, claiming that he should have been tried in juvenile court. On March 5, 2012, Skakel lost his bid for a sentence reduction. Skakel's first parole hearing was held on October 24, 2012. Skakel was denied parole. He continued to deny the killing. Skakel's next parole hearing was scheduled for October 2017. =2013= On October 23, 2013, Skakel was granted a new trial by Connecticut judge Thomas A. Bishop, who ruled that Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, failed to adequately represent Skakel when he was convicted in 2002. Prosecutors stated they would appeal the decision. John Moxley, the victim's brother, said that the ruling took his family by surprise and that the family hoped the state would win on appeal. In his ruling, Bishop wrote that defense in such a case requires attention to detail, an energetic investigation and a coherent plan of defense, stating: \\"Trial counsel's failures in each of these areas of representation were significant and, ultimately, fatal to a constitutionally adequate defense...As a consequence of trial counsel's failures as stated, the state procured a judgment of conviction that lacks reliability.\\" On November 21, 2013, Skakel was released on a $1.2 million bond along with other conditions: he was to be monitored with a GPS device, could have no contact with Moxley's family, must periodically check in over the phone and would not be allowed to leave the state of Connecticut unless granted permission, although he has since relocated to Westchester County, New York. =2016= In July 2016, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. released a book entitled Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit. In December 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court reinstated Skakel's murder conviction with a 4–3 majority decision, writing that his conviction was the result of \\"overwhelming\\" evidence presented by prosecutors and that his legal representation had been adequate. =2018= In January 2018, prosecutors asked the Connecticut Supreme Court to revoke Skakel's bail and to return him to prison to resume serving his sentence. On May 4, 2018, the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated Skakel's conviction and ordered a new trial. The court ruled that Sherman had \\"rendered ineffective assistance\\" when he failed to contact an alibi witness whose name had been provided by Skakel and that as a result, Skakel was deprived of a fair trial. State prosecutors in Stamford still have the power to call for a new trial against Skakel. No determination has been made by the State’s Attorney’s office. In popular culture In September 2017, the rights to Kennedy's book were optioned by FX Productions to develop a multi-part television series. The American Court TV (now TruTV) television series Mugshots featured the case in an episode entitled \\"Michael Skakel - A Killing in Greenwich\\". The case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries on February 16, 1996. In 2014, Connecticut-born rapper Apathy released a song entitled \\"Martha Moxley (Rest in Peace)\\" featuring Chris Webby, Kappa Gamma, Annoyd and Hayze. The song repeatedly, but subtly, references the event, referring to Moxley and Skakel by name. In June 2019, Oxygen premiered a three-part documentary entitled Murder and Justice: The Case of Martha Moxley, hosted by legal analyst and former prosecutor Laura Coates. On August 10, 2020, Crime Junkie released an episode on the murder of Martha Moxley.

There he conducted for the company of Selina Dolaro under the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1876. In May 1878, for Carte, he conducted The Sorcerer by Gilbert and Sullivan and also conducted H.M.S. Pinafore in July and August 1878, while Alfred Cellier was assisting Arthur Sullivan at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden.See advertisements in The Era on 21 July 1878, p. 8; 28 July 1878, p. 8; and 4 August 1878, p. 8. He also conducted a \\"special operatic performance\\" of H.M.S. Pinafore at The Crystal Palace on 6 July 1878. Goossens became famous as a musical director of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, for whom he conducted the first English performance of Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser, in Liverpool in 1882. He became principal conductor of Carl Rosa in 1889. He conducted Rosa's company in a command performance, in November 1892, of The Daughter of the Regiment for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle.

It is usually referred to as The Tempest (or Der Sturm in his native German), but the sonata was not given this title by Beethoven, or indeed referred to as such during his lifetime. The name comes from a reference to a personal conversation with Beethoven by his associate Anton Schindler in which Schindler reports that Beethoven suggested, in passing response to his question about interpreting it and Op. 57, the Appassionata sonata, that he should read Shakespeare's Tempest;Anton Schindler (Constance S. Jolly, trans). Beethoven As I Knew Him. First published 1966 by Faber and Faber, London. Republished by The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. some however have suggested that Beethoven may have been referring to the works of C. C. Sturm, the preacher and author best known for his Reflections on the Works of God in Nature, a copy of which he owned and, indeed, had heavily annotated. Although much of Schindler's information is distrusted by classical music scholars, this is a first-hand account unlike any other that any scholar reports. The British music scholar Donald Francis Tovey says in A Companion to Beethoven's Pianoforte Sonatas: > With all the tragic power of its first movement the D minor Sonata is, like > Prospero, almost as far beyond tragedy as it is beyond mere foul weather. It > will do you no harm to think of Miranda at bars 31–38 of the slow > movement... but people who want to identify Ariel and Caliban and the > castaways, good and villainous, may as well confine their attention to the > exploits of Scarlet Pimpernel when the Eroica or the C minor Symphony is > being played (pg. 121).  Structure  The piece consists of three movements and takes approximately twenty-five minutes to perform: Each of the movements is in sonata form, though the second lacks a substantial development section. = First movement = :700px The first movement alternates brief moments of seeming peacefulness with extensive passages of turmoil, after some time expanding into a haunting \\"storm\\" in which the peacefulness is lost. This musical form is unusual among Beethoven sonatas to that date. Concerning the time period and style, it was thought of as an odd thing to write (a pianist's skills were demonstrated in many ways, and showing changes in tone, technique and tempo efficiently many times in one movement was one of them). The development begins with rolled, long chords, quickly ending to the tremolo theme of the exposition. There is a long recitative section at the beginning of this movement's recapitulation (foreshadowing the oboe recitative in the first movement of Symphony No. 5), again ending with fast and suspenseful passages that resolve to the home key of D minor. = Second movement = :700px The second movement in B major is slower and more dignified. The rising melodic ideas in the opening six measures are reminiscent of the first movement's recitative. Other ideas in this movement mirror the first, for instance, a figure in the eighth measure and parallel passages of the second movement are similar to a figure in measure 6 of the first. = Third movement = :700px The third movement is also in sonata form and is back in the home key of D minor. It is at first flowing with emotion and then reaching a climax, before moving into an extended development section which mainly focuses on the opening figure of the movement, reaching a climax at measures 169–173. The recapitulation, which is preceded by an extensive cadenza-like passage of sixteenth notes for the right hand, is followed by another transition and then another statement of the primary theme. The refrain undergoes phrase expansion to build tension for the climax of the movement at measure 381, a fortissimo falling chromatic scale.

The first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689 in response to the mutiny of a large portion of the army which stayed loyal to James II upon William III taking the crown of England.William Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents, 19 (2d ed., Government Printing Office 1920) The Mutiny Act, altered in 1803, and the Articles of War defined the nature and punishment of mutiny until the latter were replaced by the Army Discipline and Regulation Act in 1879.Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879. Parliament website This, in turn, was replaced by An Act to consolidate the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879, and the subsequent Acts amending the Same, to be known as The Army Act in 1881.[https://lawexplores.com/the-army/ The Army. Law Explorer This was extended or amended or consolidated annually (the most recent update having been made in 1995). Today, mutiny by British forces is punished under the Armed Forces Act 2006. Depending on events, additions, and changes within the established system more than one Mutiny Act might be passed within a given year. Within the empire specific geographical disturbances were sometimes governed by specific acts, such as the Mutiny, East Indies Act 1754 (27 Geo. 2 c. 9), or the Mutiny, America Act from 1765 (5 Geo. 3 c. 33) to 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c. 11). A closely related series of Marine Mutiny Acts starting in 1755 (28 Geo. 2 c. 11) would regulate his Majesty's marine forces while on shore, and continue well into the 19th century. Background During the Middle Ages, European rulers applied the same laws to both civilian and military populations.William Winthrop, 45. Because of this, military law (law governing armed forces) and martial law (control of society by the military) were not independent legal approaches. Rulers began separating the laws governing the civilian population and the laws for the armed forces as the medieval period drew to a close.Henry Wager Halleck, Military Tribunals and Their Jurisdiction, Mil. L. Rev. Bicent. Issue 14, 15 (1975). Civilian codes and courts eventually gained power at the expense of military law and control. The first code that specifically regulated military personnel (as opposed to civilians) was the French ordonnance of 1378. In England, William the Conqueror's Aural Regis (or King's Court) assisted him in ruling both his armed forces and the English population. Over time, this court divided and developed specialized legal expertise. King Edward I created a Court of Chivalry headed by the Lord High Constable and the Earl Marshall, two members of the King's Court.John Stuart-Smith, Military Law: Its History, Administration, and Practice, Mil. L. Rev. Bicent. Issue 24, 28 (1975). This Court of Chivalry was given authority over cases of military law, chivalry, heraldry, and murder or high treason overseas.Sir Matthew Hale, The History of the Common Law of England, 26 (Charles M. Grey ed., U. Chi. Press 1971). The army was seen as the crown's personal force. Its governance, as a military force, was the crown's royal prerogative. The crown governed the military by publishing articles of war. These articles applied to the army during a specific war or campaign.William Winthrop, 18. The Court of Chivalry assisted the crown by preparing these articles and enforcing them. Therefore, military law could and would change depending on the campaign or war. Although harsh, the articles were clear in their expectations for military personnel. Meanwhile, courts of equity and courts of common law developed and were given authority to govern civilians. Common law did not have rules specific to military forces and common law courts could not apply military rules. However, prior to the Petition of Right, and especially during the reign of the Tudors and Stuarts, the crown would applied articles of war (which defined the military law) against civilians in Britain in trials administered by courts- martial (an exercise of martial law). The capricious use of harsh military law by the crown against civilians included the imposition of the death penalty. The practice of enforcing military law against civilians and the usurpation of common-law courts' authority by courts-martial caused an outcry. The lack of a distinction between military law and martial law caused English legal minds to attack the exercise of military law during peacetime.William Winthrop, 46-47. William Blackstone complained, This abuse of the crown's prerogative (the crown's right to make and enforce rules for the military) caused Parliament to pass the Petition of Right in 1628. This act stated that neither civilians nor soldiers and officers who were in England during peace were subject to military courts or law.William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England vol. IV, 436–7. Only common-law courts and courts of equity could exercise authority over individuals in peacetime England. Because the articles of war did not fall under these court's jurisdiction, military law couldn't be applied to anyone in England, whether soldier or civilian.William Winthrop, 14, 46. (The Petition of Right ensured, “[t]hat the exercise of Martial Law, whereby any Person should lose his Life or Member, or Liberty, may not be permitted in Time of Peace, when the King’s Courts are open for all Persons to receive Justice.”) Passage of the first Mutiny Act King William III replaced King James II in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. At the time, a number of Scottish troops felt James II was still the true monarch. They marched home, refusing to obey orders from William III to fight in Holland. The mutinous troops were located in England during peacetime so only common law and courts of equity had authority over them. However, these courts' power did not include the ability to enforce mutiny (which was a military law crime and not a common law crime). Therefore, no legal action could be taken to stop or punish the troops. Parliament responded by passing the Mutiny Act 1688 (1 Will. & Mar. c. 5 ).An Act for punishing Officers or Soldiers who shall Mutiny or Desert Their Majestyes Service. This act made desertion, mutiny, and sedition of officers and soldiers crimes triable by court-martial in peacetime England and made such crimes punishable by death. The passage of this act initiated the codification of military law in Great Britain.William Winthrop, 19. Payment for quartering the troops was first included in the Mutiny Act 1692 (4 Will. & Mar. c. 13).An Act for punishing Officers and Soldiers who shall mutiny or desert Their Majesties Service and for punishing False Musters and for the payment of Quarters. Renewal of the Mutiny Acts Because the Bill of Rights prohibited the existence of a standing army during peacetime without the consent of Parliament, the Mutiny Act was expressly limited to one year's duration. As a result, Parliament annually passed a new mutiny act.Henry Wager Halleck, 18-19. The Articles of War, published by the crown, continued to govern military forces outside colonies overseas while the mutiny acts imposed military law on military forces in peacetime England. Many other changes occurred during this transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy, which were \\"products of the exigencies and opportunities of the quarter century of warfare on the grand scale that commenced with the accession of William and Mary, when England, and then Britain, was able \\"to set out such Fleets and Armies as were never heard of among our Ancestors.\\"\\"Stephen Foster, Evan Haefeli, Oxford History of the British Empire Companion Series: British North America in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, An Overview. DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206124.003.0002 \\"additional instances of the efflorescence of institutions and institutionalization generally in the same period, which also comprehended the Bank of England, the National Debt, and a standing army funded by the annual Mutiny Act.\\" A new mutiny act was passed each year until 1879.David Glazier, Precedents Lost: The Neglected History of the Military Commission, 46 Va. J. Int’l. L. 5, 12 (2005). The Mutiny Act was modified early on to allow courts-martial for other military crimes besides mutiny, sedition, and desertion. Modifications to the Mutiny Act allowed courts-martial trial of soldiers for acts prohibited by the Crown’s articles of war, as long as the articles conformed to the Mutiny Act 1718.William Winthrop, 20. Civilians who were closely associated to the military, such as victuallers, could also be tried by courts-martial.British Articles of War of 1765 § VIII, art. I, II. In 1807 all serving black soldiers recruited as slaves in the West India Regiments of the British Army were freed under that year's Mutiny Act. The Quartering Acts The Mutiny Acts 1765 and 1774 are better known as Quartering Acts because of the changes which added quartering requirements for British troops in the American Colonies, beyond what the Army had provided.

He served as the first Governor of North Dakota from 1889 to 1891, after it was admitted as a state to the union. Born in the Finger Lakes region of New York state, Miller had moved to the Dakota Territory in 1878. With a partner he bought thousands of acres of land for what was called bonanza farming: large-scale farming of wheat as a commodity crop on an industrial scale. The Northern Pacific Railroad connected such farms to the populous eastern markets. He became a wealthy partner or owner of three major agricultural companies; the last also provided milling and other services. Biography Miller was born in Dryden, New York, in 1843 in the Finger Lakes region. He became a farmer there. In the late 19th century, the government sold off large amounts of land at inexpensive prices in the Dakota Territory after extinguishing Native American claims, and Miller joined the thousands of people moving there. So many came from the Northern Tier of states that they established a political and social culture similar to that in New York, the Upper Midwest and New England. In 1878, he moved to the Dakota Territory with Jeremy W. Dwight and purchased 17,000 acres (69 km²) of land in the fertile Red River Valley land of Richland County. As \\"bonanza farmers,\\" the two men established the Dwight Farm and Land Company, selling some land as speculators. They became quite wealthy from cultivation of wheat as a commodity crop. Miller married Addie S. Tucker on February 22, 1882. They had two daughters.Dale Niewoehner, \\"1st N.D. governor’s mausoleum restored\\", Pierce County Tribune, October 31, 2014; accessed October 12, 2016 Career In 1888 Miller was elected to the Dakota Territory Council, the territorial legislature. In 1889 Miller participated in the constitutional convention that resulted in North Dakota statehood. In 1889 he was the Republican nominee for Governor of North Dakota. He had no aspirations to the office, but North Dakota Republicans were convinced that he was the only candidate who could unite the party – Miller had developed a reputation for honesty by resisting lobbyists and others who attempted to obtain favorable action from the Council through bribery and other corrupt means. Persuaded that if he did not run the Republicans would lose, Miller agreed to become a candidate. He won by popular vote in the General Election in 1889. In 1890, the state had a total white population of 190,983, having increased from 2,405 in the territory in 1870.\\"North Dakota Historical Population\\", based on US Census data; North Dakota State University During Miller's two-year tenure, the state government was formed. After serving his term, Miller declined to run again for re-election or other political office. He returned to his bonanza farm business, raising wheat and grain on an industrial scale. He organized the John Miller Land Company in 1896. In 1906 Miller became president of the newly incorporated Chaffee-Miller Milling Company. His partner Herbert F. Chaffee and he arranged for milling flour, and supplied feed and other agricultural services. The company had offices in North Dakota and Duluth, Minnesota. Miller died in 1908. Death Miller died in Duluth, Minnesota in 1908. His family accompanied his body as it was returned to his birthplace of Dryden, New York. He was buried in Green Hills Cemetery. In 1910 a granite mausoleum was erected at his gravesite, and his remains were reinterred in it. Miller's wife and two daughters were also later buried here. In 2014 the mausoleum was restored and a plaque was added with Miller's name and title; a United States flag was installed nearby.  References  Further reading *William C.

The film stars Colin Firth as Colin, an English painter who travels to the town of Hope, Vermont, in the United States after a traumatic experience. There, he meets Mandy (Heather Graham), a nursing home worker who helps him get over the breakup between him and Vera (Minnie Driver). Plot When English painter Colin is dumped by his childhood love and fiancee, he decides to travel to a place with the most hopeful name he can find. He arrives in Hope, a quiet town in Vermont in autumn, and showing clear signs of emotional distress, checks into a hotel. He tries to forget his troubles by drawing the eccentric town residents and asks for \\"rubbers\\" instead of erasers at a store, causing the small-town locals to go on alert. The casual request embodies cultural differences with Americans and Brits and causes some misunderstandings between the characters. The quirky, outlandish hotel manager, Joanie, sees the state he is in, calls over her friend Mandy, a nursing home attendant, to talk with him and take his mind off his troubles. The small town residents all know each other and have boring predictable lives, but by bringing Colin and Mandy together, Joanie and her fellow Hope residents add some romance and drama to their own lives. A pair of opposites, Colin is a reserved English artist and Mandy is a free spirited Vermont person that decorates her room with \\"her symbol\\" of butterflies. Eventually they fall in love with each other, with Colin healing and building a new life while finally getting over the breakup with his ex- girlfriend Vera. Suddenly though, the attractive, sophisticated, witty and charming Vera shows up to get Colin back. Extremely self-confident and oblivious to anyone's ideas or feelings that do not match hers, Vera denies that Colin is no longer interested and relentlessly pursues him, while finding out about him and Mandy. Vera exploits Mandy's insecurities about her new relationship with Colin and being a simple country person, while manipulating Colin's memories of their shared romantic and cultural history. Vera and Colin's twenty years together adds to Vera's leverage, of couples that inevitably take each other for granted or stay together out of habit, but Colin tells her that, \\"In one minute...short span of time...you not only became unimportant as an aim in life, but also the very thing I need to flee from in order to find happiness\\". Later Colin goes to Vera's hotel room to tell her to leave Mandy and him alone and go back to England, however, she changes into sexy underwear while smoking and sets off the fire alarm. Mandy sees the two together in front of the hotel during the fire evacuation and assumes Colin took her back. Colin tries to clear up the misunderstanding with Mandy but the only thing she wants from him is a promise to never contact her again. Colin agrees on the condition that she get a passport. The residents of Hope are small town unsophisticates but very familiar with personal dilemmas and the ordinary common feelings in everyone's lives, of loneliness, heartbreak, confusion, and naturally join in Colin and Mandy's drama. With other motives, Colin flatters the town mayor with a personal portrait and accepts an offer of an \\"appreciation gift\\". Vera tells Colin that the town mayor found out her genealogy is linked to Hope, Vermont but Colin reveals to her that it was faked to convince Vera that they are over while refocusing her fixation with him to instead become the Queen of Hope at the town festival. Vera is finally convinced by Colin that their romance is over and decides to enjoy the consolation of becoming the Queen of Hope. After Colin leaves Hope, Joanie tells Mandy that Colin's cousin was supposed to meet him, but forgot to cancel the meeting and that she should pick him up at Hope Springs. When Mandy gets there, she finds it is Colin and he proposes, giving her a vintage butterfly engagement ring with their names engraved in it. Colin carries her back to the hotel, where they pass and wave to Vera, Mr. and Mrs. Peterson and the residents of Shiny Shores where Mandy lives and works. Mandy tells him that she is too heavy to be carried through the whole town and warns him of hurting his back. When they finally get to the hotel and undress, Colin's back is hurt despite Mandy's warnings. They are happily reunited with no more complications from others and look forward to traveling back to England together, with Colin finding happiness when he least expected it.

These dogs were bred to hunt vermin and other quarry which lived in underground dens. Earthdog den tests involve man-made tunnels that the dogs must navigate, while scenting a rat, \\"the quarry.\\" The dog must follow the scent to the quarry and then \\"work\\" the quarry. Depending on the sanctioning organization, “working” means barking, scratching, staring, pawing, digging; any active behavior. The quarry is protected at all times by wooden bars across the end of the tunnel. The hunting encounter is controlled, and neither the dog nor the quarry (usually two rats) are endangered by the activity. In Canada, earthdog tests are sanctioned by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC). In the United States, two major organizations sanction earthdog tests: the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the American Working Terrier Association (AWTA). AKC earthdog tests AKC earthdog tests are intended as noncompetitive venues in which the handlers may gauge their dog’s natural hunting aptitude when presented with an underground hunting situation. According to the AKC General Regulations for Earthdog Tests, the noncompetitive program begins with a basic introduction to den work and quarry, progressing through gradual steps to the point where the dog can demonstrate that it is willing to perform the required tasks, including seeking its quarry and working it underground. =Eligibility= Dogs that are registered with the AKC and are six months of age or older may participate in AKC Earthdog tests. They do not need to be intact, and purebred dogs that have been assigned “Indefinite Listing Privilege” (ILP) numbers, may also participate. In comparison to the American Working Terrier Association (AWTA) tests, fewer breeds are permitted in AKC tests, with mixed breeds being excluded altogether. The following breeds are classified as eligible to participate in AKC Earthdog tests: *American Hairless Terrier *Australian Terrier *Bedlington Terrier *Border Terrier *Cairn Terrier *Cesky Terrier *Dachshund *Dandie Dinmont Terrier *Glen of Imaal Terrier *Jagdterrier *Lakeland Terrier *Manchester Terrier *Miniature Bull Terrier *Miniature Pinschers *Miniature Schnauzer *Norfolk Terrier *Norwich Terrier *Parson Russell Terrier *Rat Terrier *Russell Terrier *Scottish Terrier *Sealyham Terrier *Silky Terrier *Skye Terrier *Smooth Fox Terrier *Welsh Terrier *West Highland White Terrier *Wire Fox Terrier *Yorkshire Terrier =Program= AKC earthdog tests differ from AWTA trials in that the AKC program is broken down into several more levels of increasing difficulty: ;Introduction To Quarry (IQ I and IQ II) : Dogs that have never competed at an earthdog test will need to be introduced to the quarry. Dogs have different levels of prey drive and some need more encouragement than others. The Introduction to Quarry is simply designed to acquaint a dog with \\"going to ground\\", following a scent trail and “working a rat\\". At this stage, the dog is asked to negotiate a tunnel with a single right-angle turn. At the end of the tunnel is a rat in a cage, which is placed behind dowel bars. The handler may talk to their dog and encourage the dog to “work” the rat. The judge may also attempt to interest the dog by shaking the quarry cage, by tapping or scratching the cage or the tunnel itself, or by making other noises. ;Junior Earthdog (JE) : Junior Earthdog (JE) is the first level of competition in which a title may be earned. A Junior Earthdog tunnel long and has three right-angle turns, is set into the earth and is completely dark. The entrance is well-scented with rat smells. The dog is released 10 feet from the tunnel entrance, after which it has 45 seconds to enter the tunnel and traverse the tunnel to reach the quarry. The dog must then begin to work the quarry within 30 seconds of reaching it, and most continue to work without interruption for 60 seconds. After that time has elapsed, the dog must then allow the handler to remove it from the tunnel via a hatch at the quarry end. The handler is permitted to give the dog one command when releasing the dog or before it enters the tunnel, but otherwise must remain quiet at the release point until the time of retrieval. To earn a JE title, the dog must successfully pass the JE test twice under two different judges. ;Senior Earthdog (SE) : To pass a Senior Earthdog (SE) test, a dog must accomplish the following: Follow a scent line to a tunnel entrance that the dog cannot see from ground level; track through a completely dark tunnel containing three 90 degree turns to the rats; not be distracted by a false entrance/exit arrangement; not be distracted by a dead end tunnel that is scented with rat bedding; once at the rats, work the rats for 90 seconds (working is defined as barking, digging, scratching, biting the bars); after working the rats, and after the rats are removed from the tunnel, leave the tunnel when called by the handler and return to the handler within 90 seconds. To earn an SE title, a dog must receive three qualifying scores from two different judges after previously earning their JE title. ;Master Earthdog (ME) : Master Earthdog is the most difficult test in the AKC Earthdog program. For each test, two dogs are drawn at random. The dogs hunt together as a brace on open land starting from a distance of from the tunnel entrance. Along the way they encounter a \\"false den\\" scented to seem used by quarry but with no quarry inside, which they must investigate at their handler's command without indicating a quarry present. The hunting party proceeds in the direction of the tunnel, but the handlers must stop short of the tunnel and may not show the dogs where the tunnel is. Each dog must search for quarry in that area until they discover the tunnel entrance and actively indicate where it is and that quarry is present. After both dogs have indicated the presence of quarry, one of the dogs is sent into the tunnel while the other brace dog is tethered to a ground stake about away from the tunnel entrance. : A Master Earthdog tunnel is to long with three right-angle turns. The dog will encounter a false den and false exit similar to a Senior Earthdog tunnel, and also must pass through a constriction and a roller that simulate roots and other obstacles in a natural tunnel. The dog in the tunnel must reach the quarry within 90 seconds. Once at the quarry, the dog must begin to work the rats within 15 seconds and must work them continuously for 90 seconds. They must not be distracted from working by the judge scraping or digging alongside the tunnel. The scraping is meant to approximate the hunter digging down to the spot where the dog is holding the quarry at bay. The handler has 15 seconds to remove the dog from the tunnel after their 90 seconds of work is complete. After the first dog has completed the tunnel portion of the test, the dogs trade roles. Each dog is judged on how well they \\"honor\\" a hunt by the other dog while tied to the stake: The honoring dog must show interest but must not make enough noise to interfere with the judge listening to hear the dog working in the tunnel. Four passes under three different judges is required for a Master Earthdog title. ;Endurance Earthdog (EE) : An Endurance Earthdog test is intended to demonstrate the consistency of a hunting earthdog. A dog earns a pass performance in Endurance Earthdog by completing both the SE test and ME test during the same earthdog trial event. A dog who passes both tests during five different earthdog events is awarded an Endurance Earthdog title. An Endurance Earthdog may continue to compete to earn as many Endurance titles as they can, with each subsequent title suffixed with a numeric designation. AWTA earthdog den trials The AWTA predates the AKC earthdog program and was founded to promote and test the working abilities of terriers and dachshunds. The AWTA awards Certificates of Gameness to terriers and Dachshunds who achieve a score of 100% in the AWTA open class. To qualify in the open class, a dog must be released near the trial's earth tunnel opening, find its way into the tunnel and reach the quarry, all within 30 seconds (50% of score) and then “work” the rat continuously for a full 60 seconds (remaining 50% of score). Timing starts from the moment the dog is released by the handler. The dog may enter the tunnel and come out or walk around the tunnel, but it must get to the rat within the time allotted. However, once it reaches the rat, it must remain with it for the aforementioned 60 seconds. The following breeds are recognized (and therefore able to compete) in AWTA den trials: *Australian Terrier *Bedlington Terrier *Border Terrier *Cairn Terrier *Cesky Terrier *Dachshund *Dandie Dinmont Terrier *Fell Terrier *Wire Fox Terrier *Smooth Fox Terrier *Glen of Imaal Terrier *Jack Russell Terrier *Jagdterrier *Lakeland Terrier *Norwich Terrier *Norfolk Terrier *Patterdale Terrier *Scottish Terrier *Sealyham Terrier *Skye Terrier *Welsh Terrier *West Highland White Terrier Other small terrier breeds may compete in the miscellaneous class.

The series was originally planned for a 2012 premiere. MTV remained dormant on releasing news about the series for over a year until November 29, 2012, when MTV announced the series would premiere on January 3, 2013, and feature two weekly half-an-hour back-to-back episodes with twelve episodes total. It was announced on February 6, 2013, that Buckwild will be returning for a second season. Following the death of Shain Gandee on April 1, 2013, due to carbon monoxide poisoning, production of the second season was suspended until further notice. It was announced on April 9, 2013, that MTV had chosen to cancel the series. On April 14, 2013, it was reported that executive producer J.P. Williams from Parallel Entertainment stated that his company would like to revive the series in another location with a new cast. In April 2014, Slednecks was announced. The series had the same premise as Buckwild but was set in Alaska. However, Slednecks has also since been canceled. Episodes =Season 1 (2013)= =Specials (2013)= Reception The series is described as having a \\"Jackass-like element,\\" including depictions of \\"activities like mud racing, squirrel hunting and rope swinging\\". It has been criticized for propagating negative stereotypes of West Virginians. The state's film office has refused to authorize a tax credit for its production, citing a concern that it might portray the state \\"in a significantly derogatory manner\\". The series has also been deemed the \\"Redneck Jersey Shore\\" with the series even debuting on the exact time slot that Jersey Shore once held. On December 7, 2012, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin spoke out against the series, explaining that it wrongly depicts the lives of those who reside in the state. Manchin requested that MTV cancel the series before it aired. \\"This show plays to ugly, inaccurate stereotypes about the people of West Virginia,\\" Sen. Manchin wrote in a letter to the president of MTV. Manchin went on to criticize MTV for encouraging local young people to misbehave for the camera. \\"You preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior — and now you are profiting from it. That is just wrong.\\" Incidents =Pre-cancellation= Arrest of Salwa Amin Cast member Salwa Amin was arrested on February 10, 2013. After obtaining a search warrant, officers moved in on the property.

After both were taken out, Salwa had a large quantity of oxycodone in her purse while Booker had a sizable amount of cash. Additionally, three bags of heroin were found in the shed. Jones told police that Amin and Booker brought the drugs to his home in order to distribute. In all, the three were arrested and arraigned on felony charges of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Amin waived her preliminary hearing in court and her case will now be sent to the grand jury. MTV has no comment on the situation. Amin was rearrested on March 27, 2013, due to her first court- ordered drug test being positive for oxycodone and morphine. She was booked as a pretrial felon and held without bail. On May 4, 2013, it was reported that Amin would be released from jail for an undetermined amount of time in order to complete a court-ordered inpatient rehab program for opiates.

It won the Newbery Medal in 1971. Summer of the Swans was adapted for television as Sara's Summer of the Swans in 1974. Characters Sara Godfrey: the protagonist, who is convinced that her fourteenth summer is \\"the worst summer of her life.\\" She and her two siblings have been living with their Aunt Willie ever since their mother died six years before. (Their father works in Ohio and visits on occasional weekends.) Sara is portrayed as a very superficial girl, obsessed with the way things (especially her body) look, and constantly frets about her feet, which she believes are too large. She seems to hold grudges easily; for example, her grudge against Joe Melby, a boy whom she once had a conflict with at school. Sara is the closest in her family to her younger brother, Charlie. She is very annoyed with him and sometimes resorts to bullying him, and she resents her sister Wanda's beauty. Charlie Godfrey: Sara's 10-year-old brother. He is mentally handicapped since his brain was ravaged by a high fever at the age of three. He cannot speak but can make noises. (He is able to speak in the TV special version.) He can understand all that is said to him and can nod or shake his head in response. Although 10 years old, he cannot draw and writes certain letters backward. He enjoys listening to the ticking of the watch he always wears, although he cannot tell time. He loves watching the swans in the lake near their house; this eventually leads to his disappearance. Of all the members of his family, he appears closest to Sara. Wanda Godfrey: Sara's 19-year-old sister. Sara is very jealous of her, as she believes Wanda is beautiful, though it is Aunt Willie's opinion that they look exactly alike. Wanda works at the local hospital and had a boyfriend named Frank. She is generally exasperated by Sara's constant self-criticism. Willamina \\"Aunt Willie\\" Godfrey: Sara's aunt, her father's sister, who has been looking after her nieces and nephew since the death of their mother six years previously. Aunt Willie seldom listens to what the children have to say and is extremely stubborn. It is implied that her age is somewhere over 40. Joe Melby: a boy around Sara's age who attends the same school she does. Sara has hated him ever since an incident where Charlie's watch went missing, and she believed Joe had taken it. Eventually, she discovers she was wrong and forgives him. Joe helps Sara find Charlie, and at the end of the novel, he invites her to a party. Mary Weicek: Sara's best friend, who helps her out with everything possible. Sam Godfrey: Sara's father, who works in Ohio and visits on occasional weekends. Sara views her father as she would a stranger; he is not the same loving person that he once was. Reception At the time of the book's publication, Kirkus Reviews said: \\"With increasing frequency juvenile fiction is contracting to the dimensions of a short story and the endoskeleton (dialogue, stage directions, asides to the audience) of drama--of which the climax to Sara's season of discontent is a good example... The book is a succession of clicks that connect, a sparse but acute self-possessing.\\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal- winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author John Rowe Townsend wrote, \\"The people in The Summer of the Swans are credible, tones of voice are accurately caught, and there is a frequent wry humor in the dialogue; but the book seems to me to be a slight one.\\" Television adaptation Summer of the Swans was filmed as Sara's Summer of the Swans for an ABC Afterschool Special broadcast October 2, 1974.

He is the namesake of the town of Moultonborough in Carroll County, New Hampshire. Early Colonial Life and King George's War Jonathan Moulton was born in the town of North Hampton. He spent much of his childhood as an apprentice (indentured servant) to a cabinetmaker. In 1745, he won his freedom and left the cabinet making trade. He worked as a silversmith and formed the Moulton and Towle Silversmithing Company. He ended up leaving the silversmithing trade to his partner and the company is still called Towle Silversmithing Company today, where it still manufactures silverware and kitchen utensils. He was appointed as a captain of a ranger company in the New Hampshire Militia. In the same year, he was with the New England army under the command of William Pepperrell that took Fortress Louisbourg from the French. For the rest of King George's War, Moulton fought against the Ossipee Indians that were allied to the French around Lake Winnipesaukee until they were killed or driven to Canada. During one winter scout from Dover, New Hampshire, Capt. Moulton and his men ambushed six Ossipee warriors on the ice of Lake Winniepesaukee. Five of the warriors were killed in the first volley and the sixth ran away, followed closely by Moulton's massive black dog that attacked and killed the fleeing warrior. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war in 1748. It would be only six years until the next war between Britain and France. After the end of the war in 1749, Jonathan married Abigail Smith. Together they had eleven children. Also during this time, Moulton opened a store in Hampton and started importing goods from Europe and the West Indies. French and Indian War until the American Revolution With the resumption of the colonial struggle in 1754 with the French and Indian War, Moulton once again served as a captain in the New Hampshire Militia and was elected to the New Hampshire General Court. After the end of the French and Indian War, Moulton was granted large tracts of land on the north side of Lake Winnipesaukee in the towns of Moultonborough (named after himself), New Hampton, Tamworth, Center Harbor and Sandwich, by the governors Benning Wentworth and John Wentworth. In 1764, with the wreck of the mast-ship St. George off the coast of Hampton, Moulton and many of the other town residents salvaged many of the goods aboard for their own profit. In the early morning hours of March 15, 1769, Moulton's mansion burned to the ground. This fire helped to start one of the most interesting legends about him as the \\"Yankee Faust\\". The American Revolution During the events that led up to the American Revolution, Jonathan Moulton was elected as moderator of the Hampton town meetings, chosen as a member of the Committee of Safety, appointed as a delegate to the patriot assembly at Exeter, New Hampshire, and commissioned as the Colonel of the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment of Militia. On September 21, 1775, his wife Abigail died of smallpox. A year later, he married Sarah Emery and fathered four more children. For the first two years of the American Revolutionary War, Col. Moulton's regiment guarded the 18-mile seacoast of New Hampshire against British invasion. But in the fall of 1777, he marched with his men to the Battle of Saratoga in New York and the defeat of Lt. General, John Burgoyne's British army invading from Canada. Col. Moulton and the 3rd New Hampshire Militia served in Gen. John Stark's brigade during the battle. He was promoted to Brigadier General by George Washington who was impressed with his battlefield skills. Post-war After the end of the American Revolution, Moulton continued his role in the New Hampshire militia. On March 25, 1785, he was created Brigadier General of the 1st Brigade of the New Hampshire Militia. Civilian Life Jonathan was rewarded lands (for his successes during the war) in the lakes region of New Hampshire and founded the town of Moultonborough. He settled in North Hampton, New Hampshire and was one of the first people to paint his house colonial white. This was not a popular decision with some of the local townspeople since paint had to be imported from Britain. Jonathan participated in a feud over farm land with a neighbor which was exacerbated by a series of slanderous editorials written in The Boston Post, Boston's major newspaper at the time. The feud became part of a civil suit in which the judge, a long time friend of the general, ruled in his favor. Mysteriously, the Moulton's barn was burned down and no one ever claimed responsibility. He expressed that he was more upset about losing the animals than losing the barn itself, which could be re- built. Jonathan Moulton died at the age of 71 on September 18, 1787. His body was moved in the middle of the night before burial and his tombstone disappeared. Two years later, in 1789, George Washington stopped and paid his respects to General Moulton's widow Sarah on his tour of the new United States of America. Supernatural legends During his life Jonathan Moulton was a controversial figure in the Province of New Hampshire and later the state. =The Yankee Faust= In the first legend, in which Jonathan's house burns down, it was said that he had made a Faustian deal with the devil and had outsmarted him by saying that he would sell his soul to the devil if the devil would fill his boots up with gold coins on the first of every month. Jonathan found the largest set of boots in all of the Province of New Hampshire. The next month the devil returned to fill up the boots with gold, but no matter how many gold coins he poured in the boots they would not fill. Jonathan had cut off the soles of the boots and put the boots over a hole in the floor and all the gold coins fell into the basement of the house. The devil, after being outsmarted by Jonathan, burnt down his house in revenge. The gold coins disappeared. =The New Wife and The Old, A Poem written by John Greenleaf Whittier= In the second tale, the ghost of Moulton's first wife Abigail appears on his wedding night and takes the ring off the finger of his new wife Sarah as the two are in bed together. In a final legendary story, a pallbearer at Moulton's funeral opened his coffin to find it empty, replaced by a box of gold coins with the devil stamped on them. Jonathan Moulton was in fact buried without a tombstone and the site of his grave is now unknown.

Wilhelm Leuschner, a stove fitter's son, was born in 1890. His father's name was also Wilhelm Leuschner, and his mother's name was Marie. Leuschner grew up in poverty. In 1903, he began an apprenticeship as a wood sculptor. After finishing this in 1907, he joined the trade union and, on the occasion of the Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) Exhibition, he moved to Darmstadt, where he worked in a furniture factory. In 1910, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and became more deeply involved with the union. He also wed Elisabeth Batz in 1911. After fighting in the First World War on the Eastern Front in 1916, he became a city councillor and Chairman of the Darmstadt Unions in 1919. In 1924, he became a member of the Hesse Legislature (Landtag) for the SPD. In 1928 he became Hesse's interior minister. In the Landtag at that time, Leuschner often found himself at odds with jurist and fellow Landtag member Dr. Werner Best, who represented the NSDAP, and would later go on to become very prominent in the Nazi régime. In January 1933, Leuschner was elected to the board of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (\\"Nationwide German Union Federation\\"). In April 1933, after the Nazis had seized power in Germany, Leuschner was forced to resign, and gave up his office of Hessian Interior Minister. The following May brought Leuschner's arrest in the course of the Nazis' union-breaking programme. In June, he was arrested once again, mistreated, and held for a year in prisons and concentration camps (Börgermoor and Lichtenburg). In June 1934, he was released from the concentration camp and began to build up a resistance network. In 1936, he took over a small manufacturing workshop which produced pub utensils, but it soon became the hub of the \\"illegal Reich leadership of German unions\\". Leuschner struggled actively in those resistance groups close to the unions and maintained contact with the Kreisau Circle, and from 1939, also with the resistance group around Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. After the planned coup d'état, Leuschner was most likely to become Germany's vice- chancellor; however, Claus von Stauffenberg's 20 July 1944 attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia failed. Leuschner was arrested on 16 August 1944, and was brought before the Volksgerichtshof, where he was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out on 29 September 1944 at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin The Bundesland Hesse awards a medal named \\"Wilhelm-Leuschner-Medaille\\".

Prologue Cortés' expedition arrived at Tenochtitlan, the Mexica capital, on November 8, 1519, taking up residence in a specially designated compound in the city. Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took Moctezuma II, the king or Hueyi Tlatoani of the Mexica, hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cortés' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise. During the following 98 days, Cortés and his native allies, the Tlaxcaltecas, were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital. =Cortés heads off Spanish punitive expedition= In June 1520, news from the Gulf coast reached Cortés that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by Governor Velázquez of Cuba to arrest Cortés for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, Pedro de Alvarado, Cortés marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez sent to capture him. When Cortés told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him. Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cortés headed back to Tenochtitlan. =Loss of control in Tenochtitlan= During Cortés' absence, Pedro de Alvarado ordered a preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named Cuitláhuac. Cortés ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, A map of Tenochtitlan and its causeways leading out of the capital With Moctezuma dead, Cortés and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder, food, and water in short supply, Cortés decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully. Since the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cortés ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder. This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city. =The Spanish head for the causeway out= On the night of July 1, 1520,Various sources give dates ranging from June 30 to July 4, a problem further confounded by the use of the Julian calendar in Europe at this time, which had diverged from the true (solar) date by almost 12 days. Cortez's large army left their compound and headed west, toward the Tlacopan causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the Eagle Warriors, who sounded the alarm. First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of Huitzilopochtli from atop Templo Mayor.León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The Broken Spears: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon Press, The fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain. Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cortés pressed ahead and reached dry land at Tacuba, leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing. Seeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cortés and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered Pedro de Alvarado, unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and Tlaxcaltecas. According to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, it was at this point that tears came to Cortés' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle. Cortés, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cortés himself had been injured in the fighting. All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses. The sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition. Cortés himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition.Prescott, Appendix. Francisco López de Gómara, who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.Prescott, Book 5, Chapter 3. Montezuma's son, Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma) was killed and the Tepanec prince Tlaltecatzin, King Cacamatzin, his three sisters and two brothers were also killed. Diaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later Battle of Otumba. The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand. The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women. The few women who survived included La Malinche the interpreter, Doña Luisa, and María Estrada. The event was named La Noche Triste (\\"The Night of Sorrows\\") on account of the sorrow that Cortés and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan. Aftermath Further battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of Lake Zumpango. One week later, at the Battle of Otumba, not far from Teotihuacan, they turned to fight the pursuing Aztecs, decisively defeating them — according to Cortés, because he slew the Aztec commander — and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach Tlaxcala. It was in Tlaxcala that Cortés plotted the siege of Tenochtitlan and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.

In the comics, Kroenen was a relatively unremarkable Nazi SS scientist, whose most distinguishing characteristic was that he always wore a gas mask and protective bodysuit, which Mignola attributes to a disfiguring accident of some kind. Director Guillermo del Toro created a significantly expanded biography for the character, to appear as a supervillain in the 2004 film adaptation. History =Comics history= A German scientist working for the Nazis, and a member of the Thule Society, Dr. Kroenen became one of the top scientists for Project Ragna Rok, and a close disciple of Grigori Rasputin, along with Ilsa Haupstein and Leopold Kurtz. He was present with Rasputin at the secret ritual in Scotland that brought Hellboy to the world. Kroenen, Haupstein, and Kurtz were frozen inside a secret Nazi base, until they were resuscitated by industrialist Roderick Zinco, acting on Rasputin's orders. Kroenen resumed work on several of his former projects, including making an \\"Apocalypse Army\\" by combining corpses with robotics. He also convinced Zinco to retrieve the head of his colleague, Herman von Klempt, from South America. Kroenen retained an affection for his colleague, though Rasputin had rejected Klempt as unsuitable for Ragna Rok. When Klempt's head was re-animated, he tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad - and instead to use the Army to retrieve Klempt's work in South America. Overhearing, Kurtz became furious and attacked Klempt's head, screaming, \\"Rasputin is master!\\" In a panic, Kroenen seized a knife and killed Kurtz. When their plan failed, an enraged Rasputin struck Zinco, who was blinded. Wandering around, Zinco accidentally pressed a self-destruct button in the base, destroying it completely. Despite appearances, Kroenen survived and resurfaced years later with Leopold Kurtz to assist Isiah Marsten in acquiring a vessel from the B.P.R.D. Kroenen assumed the body was intended for Rapustin before learning that Marsten tricked him into resurrecting the Black Flame, escaping the resulting chaos with von Klempt's head. Kroenen was found sometime later by Varvara, who reawakened von Klempt and invited the two men to join her cause in rebuilding Pandemonium on Earth. Kroenen became increasingly skeptical of Varvara, who eventually incinerated him. =2004 film biography= Karl Ruprecht Kroenen as seen in the first Hellboy film In the first film adaptation of Hellboy, director Guillermo del Toro created a significantly expanded biography for Kronen that is mentioned in a series of comic panels in the book Hellboy: The Art of the Movie and the special features of the film's DVD. Born in 1897 Munich, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen was an opera prodigy with angelic features and blonde hair who toured the capitals of Europe until his career ended once his voice deepened with the onset of puberty. Kroenen demonstrated symptoms of masochism at a very early age, which combined with his perfectionism into an extreme form of \\"surgical addiction\\" out of self-loathing in his teenage years that led to him conducting brutal experiments on himself: Surgically removing his own eyelids, lips, and his toe- and finger nails. He also designed a tight- fitting gas mask to filter out germs, which he wore almost permanently. He also became quite adept with mechanical devices, believing that fusing mechanical constructs with living bodies would help create perfection. One of his early inventions was a clockwork nightingale that sang a Mozart aria perfectly. A masterful fencer, he also became renowned for his swordsmanship and created his own signature swords. In 1930, he met the resurrected Rasputin and quickly became his most loyal disciple. He subsequently joined the Nazi Party, and rose quickly through the ranks, joining the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933 and achieving the rank of Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel). He was awarded the Iron Cross for services to the Third Reich, including a tour of duty as commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, where he served with distinction. Kroenen became head of the Thule Society, a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult. He helped them to spearhead Project Ragna Rok, engineering the portal generator that would conjure the Scarlet Beast, Hellboy, in October 1944. When Allied Forces stormed the island off the coast of Scotland where Project Ragna Rok took place, Kroenen killed several of the American soldiers attacking the base, but was distracted by a grenade thrown under the portal device by a young Professor Trevor Bruttenholm. Kroenen tried to retrieve the grenade, but his left hand was blown off, and a length of concrete reinforcing rod (or rebar) impaled him through the chest, severing his spine. Shortly thereafter, he disappeared. After his disappearance, in 1956, an unmarked grave in Romania was found. Dental records identified the remains as those of Kroenen. However, Kroenen reappeared in 2004. Thanks to the inexplicable powers of science and black magic, Kroenen \\"repaired\\" himself with a prosthetic mechanical hand, a steel rod replacing the broken part of his spine and a clockwork heart, operated by a wind-up key implanted in his chest. By cranking the key, he was able to increase his speed and reflexes. After long decades, the blood in his veins dried up completely, leaving only dust, and rendering him virtually invulnerable to gunshot wounds. He could also turn the key to \\"switch off\\" his body (literally), remaining in a dormant state and appearing dead, until he was reanimated. He used this deceptive technique to infiltrate the BPRD headquarters. After critically wounding BPRD Agent Clay, he faked his own death and lay beside Clay, and they were both taken into the headquarters. Once inside, Kroenen drew Rasputin there, and personally killed the now elderly Professor Bruttenholm, before disappearing with Rasputin. The BPRD tracked Rasputin to his own mausoleum beneath Moscow. Hellboy seemingly avenged Bruttenholm's death by throwing Kroenen into an impalement trap — a spiked pit hidden beneath a trapdoor. Skewered on the stakes, Kroenen was crushed when Hellboy dropped a giant cog on top of him. This is unknown if Kroenen survived this or not. Kroenen's smashed gas mask later appeared in a display case at the BPRD in Hellboy II: The Golden Army. In the script for that film, an epilogue scene was written to be a lead-in for a third movie, but was cut for budgetary reasons. An animated version of the scene appears on the DVD's special features. Found by Roderick Zinco in the mausoleum ruins, Kroenen's remains are brought to a doctor to be revived with advanced alchemy, before traveling to the Arctic into a long abandoned Nazi weapon storage building to insert the disembodied head of Kroenen into a huge robotic body at which point Kroenen awakes and praises his \\"Master\\" foreseeing his resurrection as Rasputin appears on screen. In the commentary of Golden Army, Guillermo del Toro also stated that, in the planned story for the third film, Kroenen was to have some history with the character of Johann Krauss. This was hinted in the second film when Johann is seen staring in deep thought at Kroenen's mask in the display case during the part when Hellboy is in the ward. Weapons and equipment Kroenen's comics version is a fairly ordinary scientist, who seems to possess some surgical training. In the 2004 film and the 2019 film's flashback, the former having him wear an SS uniform with a pair of Katar (कटार)-like daggers concealed in the sleeves, Kroenen wields a Luger P08 pistol. In his later appearances in the 2004 film, he wields a pair of tonfa-style swords along with several other daggers strapped to his suit. Portrayals =Hellboy (2004)= Czech actor Ladislav Beran portrayed Kroenen in the 2004 film adaptation of Hellboy. This portrayal is radically different from the comics. Kroenen, who originally played the part of a meek character, who Del Toro describes as someone who is likely to say \\"Aargh! Don't break the machine!\\" is here portrayed as a murderous soldier who is inhumanly loyal to Rasputin. The spelling of his middle name was also changed from \\"Ruprect\\" to \\"Ruprecht\\". =Hellboy (2019)= Kroenen also appears in the 2019 film reboot, portrayed by Ilko Iliev. Critical response German film historian Florian Evers devotes a whole chapter of his book on National Socialism in modern pop culture to the character of Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. He points out the allegoric puzzle segments of Shoah-iconography behind the design of Kroenen, calling him an incarnation of the Holocaust.

He was America's best known botanical illustrator of his day. Sprague was born in Hingham, Massachusetts and apprenticed with his uncle as a carriage painter. In 1840, a young Sprague met John James Audubon, who had admired Sprague's bird drawings. In 1843, Sprague served as an assistant to Audubon on an ornithological expedition up the Missouri River, taking measurements and making sketches. Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii), an uncommon and inconspicuous bird, was discovered on that expedition and named for Sprague. Some of Sprague's fine drawings were incorporated into Audubon's later publications, without credit. Sprague's diary of this expedition is in the Boston Athenaeum. In 1845, Sprague met Asa Gray (1810–1888) of Harvard College, and, over many years, Sprague illustrated several of Gray’s works, including the plates for the atlas (1857) to \\"Botany. Phanerogamia\\" in Charles Wilkes' United States Exploring Expedition During the Years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842 (1845–1876). He also illustrated Asa Gray and John Torrey's various volumes of the U. S. War Department's Reports... (1855–1860), as well as works for George B. Emerson, George Goodale, and Alpheus Baker Hervey. In 1960, Harvard University's Houghton Library exhibited approximately 100 of Sprague’s paintings, drawings and illustrations. In 2003, Sprague's works were included in the Hunt Institute’s exhibition American Botanical Prints of Two Centuries. Major collections of Sprague's work are held by the Boston Athenaeum, the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), the Smithsonian Institution (on indefinite loan to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Verification, Carnegie Mellon University), and by Harvard University.

This concept is similar to an economy's production being below the production possibilities frontier. Gap analysis identifies gaps between the optimized allocation and integration of the inputs (resources), and the current allocation-level. This reveals areas that can be improved. Gap analysis involves determining, documenting and improving the difference between business requirements and current capabilities. Gap analysis naturally flows from benchmarking and from other assessments. Once the general expectation of performance in an industry is understood, it is possible to compare that expectation with the company's current level of performance. This comparison becomes the gap analysis. Such analysis can be performed at the strategic or at the operational level of an organization. Gap analysis is a formal study of what a business is doing currently and where it wants to go in the future. It can be conducted, in different perspectives, as follows: # Organization (e.g., Human Resources) # Business direction # Business processes # Information technology Gap analysis provides a foundation for measuring investment of time, money and human resources required to achieve a particular outcome (e.g. to turn the salary payment process from paper-based to paperless with the use of a system). Note that \\"GAP analysis\\" has also been used as a means of classifying how well a product or solution meets a targeted need or set of requirements. In this case, \\"GAP\\" can be used as a ranking of \\"Good\\", \\"Average\\" or \\"Poor\\". (This terminology appears in the PRINCE2 project management publication from the OGC (Office of Government Commerce).) Gap analysis and new products The need for new products or additions to existing lines may emerge from portfolio analysis, in particular from the use of the Boston Consulting Group Growth-share matrix--or the need may emerge from the regular process of following trends in the requirements of consumers. At some point, a gap emerges between what existing products offer and what the consumer demands. The organization must fill that gap to survive and grow. Gap analysis can identify gaps in the market. Thus, comparing forecast profits to desired profits reveals the planning gap. This represents a goal for new activities in general, and new products in particular. The planning gap can be divided into three main elements: usage gap, existing gap, and product gap. =Usage gap= The usage gap is the gap between the total potential for the market and actual current usage by all consumers in the market. Data for this calculation includes: * Market usage * Existing usage =Existing usage= Existing consumer usage makes up the total current market, from which market shares, for example, are calculated. It usually derives from marketing research, most accurately from panel research, but also from adhoc work. Sometimes it may be available from figures that governments or industries have collected. However, these are often based on categories that make bureaucratic sense but are less helpful in marketing terms. The 'usage gap' is thus: : usage gap = market potential – existing usage This is an important calculation. Many, if not most, marketers accept existing market size-- suitably projected their forecast timescales--as the boundary for expansion plans. Though this is often the most realistic assumption, it may impose an unnecessary limit on horizons. For example: the original market for video- recorders was limited to professional users who could afford high prices. Only after some time did the technology extend to the mass market. In the public sector, where service providers usually enjoy a monopoly, the usage gap is probably the most important factor in activity development. However, persuading more consumers to take up family benefits, for example, is probably more important to the relevant government department than opening more local offices. Usage gap is most important for brand leaders. If a company has a significant share of the whole market, they may find it worthwhile to invest in making the market bigger. This option is not generally open to minor players, though they may still profit by targeting specific offerings as market extensions. All other gaps relate to the difference between existing sales (market share) and total sales of the market as a whole. The difference is the competitor share. These gaps therefore, relate to competitive activity. =Product gap= The product gap—also called the segment or positioning gap—is that part of the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers. This segmentation may result from deliberate policy. Segmentation and positioning are powerful marketing techniques, but the trade-off—against better focus—is that market segments may effectively be put beyond reach. On the other hand, product gap can occur by default; the organization has thought out its positioning, its offerings drifted to a particular market segment. The product gap may be the main element of the planning gap where an organization can have productive input; hence the emphasis on the importance of correct positioning. Use to develop a better process A gap analysis can also be used to analyze gaps in processes and the gulf between the existing outcome and the desired outcome. This step process can be illustrated by the example below: * Identify the existing process: fishing by using fishing rods * Identify the existing outcome: we can manage to catch 20 fish per day * Identify the desired outcome: we want to catch 100 fish per day * Identify and document the gap: it is a difference of 80 fish * Identify the process to achieve the desired outcome: we can use an alternative method such as using a fishing net * Develop the means to fill the gap: acquire and use a fishing net * Develop and prioritize Requirements to bridge the gap A gap analysis can also be used to compare one process to others performed elsewhere, which are often identified through benchmarking. In this usage, one compares each process side-by-side and step-by-step and then notes the differences. One then analyzes each deviation to determine if there is any benefit to changing to the alternate process. The results of this analysis (in the context of the benefits and detriments of changing processes) may support the maintenance of the current process, the wholesale adoption of an alternate process, or a fusion of different aspects of each process.

The stations' owners began this shared time arrangement in 1990 after both vying for the frequency. Both KVCP and KPHF use the same transmitter off Shaw Butte Trail in Phoenix. History The station went on the air in 1992 as KNAI, a non-commercial educational radio station broadcasting a radio format of Regional Mexican music and information for farm workers and other immigrants from Mexico. The station was owned by the National Farm Workers Service Center, Inc., and carried the Radio Campesina Network, with stations in California, Nevada and Arizona. The word \\"campesina\\" translates to \\"peasant\\" or \\"farm worker.\\" On September 2, 2011, lawyers representing radio stations KNAI and KUFW (Woodlake, California) notified the FCC that license holder National Farm Workers Service Center, Inc., had legally changed its name to the \\"César Chávez Foundation\\" on June 30, 2010. Chávez was a noted leader of the Farm Workers movement. In March 2017, it was announced that the César Chávez Foundation was planning to buy AM 860 KMVP, also in Phoenix, which would allow programming to be heard around the clock in the Phoenix media market, while KNAI was off the air. On May 15, 2017, KNAI added the \\"-FM\\" suffix; the same day, KMVP changed its call letters to KNAI. CCF paired 860 AM with an FM translator, and in October, La Campesina moved exclusively to 860 AM and 101.9 FM; the station then began airing a loop directing listeners to the new frequencies. KNAI-FM changed its call letters to KCCF-FM on February 8, 2018. The move of the \\"La Campesina\\" programming from a non- commercial educational station to a commercial radio station coincided with a $115,000 fine for violations of the FCC's underwriting regulations at KNAI-FM and KUFW; the network's other stations operate on a commercial basis. On September 24, 2018, the Cesar Chavez Foundation announced that they had sold KCCF-FM to Wisconsin-based evangelical Christian broadcaster VCY America for $4.9 million, who was to maintain the shared-time arrangement with Family Radio and KPHF, making 88.3 a full-time Christian station, albeit with two different operators and licenses.

The Hilly Flanks are the upland areas surrounding the Fertile Crescent of Southwest Asia, including the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, the Taurus Mountains, and the highland parts of the Levant.

He also observed that many of the wild progenitors of domesticated crops had their natural habitats in the Hilly Flanks, as did wild sheep and goat.

As of 2020, of the trail have been completed. When finished, the trail will be over of paved and gravel paths, bike lanes, and sidewalks, linking 47 cities across nine counties and crossing seven toll bridges. It is a project of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), in collaboration with other agencies, private companies, non-profit organizations, and advocacy groups. The trail is intended to provide recreation for hikers and bicyclists, viewpoints for wildlife, space for environmental education, and corridors for bicycle transportation as well as access to historic, natural and cultural sites, including over 130 parks. Route San Francisco Bay Trail alignment as of 2019 The Bay Trail is an interconnected trail system that links parks, open spaces, points of interest, and communities on or near the bay shoreline. It will not only encircle the Bay but will also provide access inland to open spaces and preserves, streams, and the Bay Area Ridge Trail, which forms the second of two concentric rings around the bay. Sections of the Bay Trail exist in all nine Bay Area counties. The longest continuous segments include 26 miles (41 km) primarily on gravel levees between East Palo Alto and San Jose in Santa Clara County; 25 miles (40 km) in San Mateo County between Millbrae and San Carlos; 17 miles (27 km) in central Alameda County from San Leandro to Hayward; and 15 miles (24 km) along the shoreline and on city streets through Richmond in Contra Costa County. The northernmost trail section passes through San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Protected bicycle and pedestrian lanes exist on seven Bay Area toll bridges: Golden Gate Bridge, Carquinez Bridge, Benicia-Martinez Bridge, Dumbarton Bridge, the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, and the Bay Bridge. In the last case, the path cannot be used to cross the bay, as the western span lacks a bike path. The San Mateo–Hayward Bridge, the longest bridge in California, currently lacks a pedestrian or bike path entirely. History Bay Trail plaque, Embarcadero, SF The idea for the Bay Trail was launched in the Fall of 1986, when Senator Bill Lockyer of Hayward was having lunch with a local editor in a waterfront restaurant. The end-of-session legislative frenzy was over, and Senator Lockyer was in a reflective mood. “Let me try this idea out on you,” he said to his companion. “What if we tried to develop a pedestrian and bicycle path around the bay, with access to the shoreline?” His luncheon partner applauded the idea and urged the senator to pursue it. The outcome was Senate Bill 100. Coauthored by all Bay Area legislators, the bill passed. It defined parameters of the planning process, designated the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) as the lead agency, and provided $300,000 for the preparation of a Bay Trail Plan by July 1, 1989. The Bay Trail Plan, adopted by ABAG, shows a network of trails that meander and loop along the shore, connecting all nine surrounding counties and crossing the region’s toll bridges.

Signal velocity is usually equal to group velocity (the speed of a short \\"pulse\\" or of a wave- packet's middle or \\"envelope\\"). However, in a few special cases (e.g., media designed to amplify the front-most parts of a pulse and then attenuate the back section of the pulse), group velocity can exceed the speed of light in vacuum, while the signal velocity will still be less than or equal to the speed of light in vacuum. In electronic circuits, signal velocity is one member of a group of five closely related parameters. In these circuits, signals are usually treated as operating in TEM (Transverse ElectroMagnetic) mode. That is, the fields are perpendicular to the direction of transmission and perpendicular to each other. Given this presumption, the quantities: signal velocity, the product of dielectric constant and magnetic permeability, characteristic impedance, inductance of a structure, and capacitance of that structure, are all related such that if you know any two, you can calculate the rest. In a uniform medium if the permeability is constant, then variation of the signal velocity will be dependent only on variation of the dielectric constant. In a transmission line, signal velocity is the reciprocal of the square root of the capacitance-inductance product, where inductance and capacitance are typically expressed as per-unit length. In circuit boards made of FR-4 material, the signal velocity is typically about six inches (15 cm) per nanosecond. In circuit boards made of Polyimide material, the signal velocity is typically about 16.3 cm per nanosecond or 6.146 ps/mm. In these boards, permeability is usually constant and dielectric constant often varies from location to location, causing variations in signal velocity. As data rates increase, these variations become a major concern for computer manufacturers. :mathrm{v_s} = { frac{c}{sqrt{varepsilon_{r} mu_{r}}} } approx { frac{c}{sqrt{varepsilon_{r}}} }  where varepsilon_{r} is the relative permittivity of the medium, mu_{r} is the relative permeability of the medium, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The approximation shown is used in many practical context because for most common materials mu_{r} approx 1.

The story about a young girl and a magical salamander was inspired by Larson's youth playing in nature, and it was originally released as a webcomic. Synopsis The book covers the relationship between Hailey, a young girl, and Salamander, a magical forest- dwelling being. The character Hailey lives on the edge of a small city, frequently walking with her magical friend through the forest next to her house, listening to his stories. As Hailey grows older, her interests slowly shifts away and she eventually ceases to visit the woods. Years later, Hailey visits the woods one last time and meets Salamander again. The girl shares a story with him, before bidding farewell and moving away. Development Larson spent a lot of time playing around a creek as a child, imagining a \\"king of the salamanders\\" living in an underground palace with quartz walls. The original working title of Salamander Dream was \\"Salamander King\\", and Larson paid close attention to detail in how she presented nature in the comic, spotlighting specific species of plants, insects, and birds that she had encountered throughout her life. Larson came into contact with Kean Soo in 2004 after she moved to Toronto. Soo was just planning to create Jellaby, and the two realized that their two story concepts were very similar. Larson and Soo launched the website Secret Friend Society at the start of 2005, with the goal of attracting attention from publishers. Here, Soo began posting Jellaby and Larson began posting Salamander Dream as webcomics, though Larson got contacted by Chris Pitzer of AdHouse Books quickly. Salamander Dream was published in print by AdHouse Books on September 14, 2005, as Larson's first full-length graphic novel. Reception Jonathan H. Liu of Wired recommended the book, in particular for children at elementary age up through the American middle grades. Salamander Dream was named as one of the best webcomics of 2005 by both Publishers Weekly and The Webcomics Examiner. The latter praised Salamander Dream in particular for how it \\"captures the energy and loneliness of growing up ... while presenting a hopeful picture of a grown-up world as full of magic as any child's imagination,\\" all with minimal usage of dialog.

KVRX's studios are at the Hearst Student Media Building on campus, and its transmitter is located in East Austin. kvrx.org broadcasts via the internet and through iTunes Radio, TuneIn.com and an iPhone app 24 hours a day, seven days a week. History In the Spring of 1986, students at the University of Texas at Austin formed a committee called the Student Radio Task Force with the intention of raising both institutional and student support for a campus radio station. Two years later, SRTF had secured the support of Texas Student Publications (now Texas Student Media, the University organization which houses all student media and publication outlets). Before receiving its broadcasting license, the fledgling station used the call sign KTSB, and began its first narrowcast via cable television in April 1988.Texas Student Media History of KVRX Radio KTSB's call letters were changed to KVRX nearly six years later in January 1994, after the FCC approved a unique time-share agreement between KTSB and KOOP for the 91.7 FM frequency, the last remaining non-commercial frequency in Austin (the call letters \\"KTSB\\" were already in use by another station, necessitating the change). KVRX would go on to broadcast on the FM frequency in November 1994. Programming KVRX's slogan is \\"None of the Hits, All of the Time,\\" and more recently, \\"Your Texas Independent Music Authority.\\" Both refer to the station's alternative programming. KVRX's format includes music, news, sports and community programming, including the popular \\"Local Live\\" segment that airs every Sunday 10-11 p.m. CST. \\"Local Live\\" features both local and nationally touring musical acts in live, in-studio broadcast performances and interviews. KVRX only plays music that is not featured on commercial media outlets, and the varied community programs cover local, national and worldwide issues that often do not get covered in mainstream print and broadcast outlets. Notable artists that have performed on \\"Local Live\\" to later gain greater recognition include The Black Keys, Spoon, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Death Cab For Cutie, Ratatat, Shearwater, Kinky Friedman, Acid Mothers Temple, Animal Collective, Explosions in the Sky and Daniel Johnston. Each year KVRX staff and volunteers select the best \\"Local Live\\" recordings and include them on an annual Local Live CD (and occasionally DVD) compilation.Local Live CDs Another program nearly as old as the station itself is \\"Lone Star Lullabies\\", which features a playlist of all-Texas music. In addition to its radio programming, KVRX maintains an active presence in the Austin, Texas independent music scene by organizing live concerts and official shows, including during the South by Southwest music festival each Spring.

Only the script is transformed, not the language. Description For the purposes of this article, the word \\"inkprint\\" means text prepared for reading by the eye, whether printed, displayed on a screen, or stored in a computer; \\"braille\\" means text prepared for reading by the finger, whether brailled, displayed on an electronic device, or stored in a computer. Braille translation software or embedded hardware converts inkprint into braille or braille into inkprint. Usually someone has inkprint in a word processor file or at an URL and wants braille. The braille could be sent to a braille embosser to produce physical braille or to an electronic notetaker. Another circumstance is that someone has braille in an electronic braille notetaker that they want to produced in inkprint to be shared with someone who does not read braille. Braille translation software is usually classified as assistive technology, since the action of the software provides braille for a blind person. Braille translators can be run by people with or without sight. A braille translator can run on a smartphone,Support for wireless braille displays in iOS 5, Apple Accessibility retrieved 3/29/2012 personal computer, network server,Robobraille (server-based braille software) retrieved 3/29/2012 or (historically) larger mini-computers or mainframes of larger institutions. Some languages use uncontracted braille, where each letter uses a specific braille character. Uncontracted braille requires manipulation of capitalization, emphasis, numbers, and punctuation. Some languages use contracted braille, where the rules for various braille abbreviations are quite complex. For example, in contracted English braille, the word think (5 letters) is rendered as 3 characters: ⠹⠔⠅(th)(in)k. The use or non-use of these contractions is related to pronunciation. For example, the \\"th\\" sign is used in think, but not pothole. Unless properly programmed, a computer might make a mistake that no person would make, such as using the contraction for mother in the word chemotherapy. The most difficult part of producing braille is making the decision of when and when not to use contractions. When people make these decisions it is braille transcription; when computers make these decisions it is braille translation. History The first practical application of computer translation and production of braille used mainframe computers at the American Printing House for the Blind of Louisville, Kentucky.Braille Translation System for the IBM 704 by Ann S.

Obenshain had served as the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, and was nominated in 1978 to run as the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, but died prior to the election. Biography Obenshain was the son of Josephine (Dudley) and Samuel S. Obenshain (1904–2000), a professor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, where he grew up. The elder Obenshain was active in Virginia's Republican Party during the era of the Byrd Organization, the Democratic machine of Harry F. Byrd, which dominated Virginia's government from his election as governor in 1925 until the 1966 Democratic primary when two powerful Byrd incumbents lost and Harry F. Byrd Jr. barely won his father's seat. Richard graduated from Bridgewater College in Rockingham County, Virginia and was admitted to the Virginia Bar. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1964. In that same year, he ran for the House of Representatives in based in Richmond, facing Democratic State Delegate David E. Satterfield III. Obenshain nearly ended the long run of Democratic dominance in the district, losing by only 654 votes.https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=147719 He nearly won on the strength of Barry Goldwater carrying the district; Goldwater won every county-level jurisdiction in the district except for the city of Richmond.https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/datagraph.php?year=1964&fips;=51&f;=1&off;=0&elect;=0 However, Republicans had been making inroads among Byrd Democrats for some time before then. As early as the 1930s, several Byrd Democrats had begun splitting their tickets for national elections due to the national party's growing friendliness toward liberal policies. Obenshain was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Attorney General in 1969 and became chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia in 1972. Even with the growing trend of ticket- splitting among Byrd Democrats, well into the 1970s the GOP barely even existed at the state and local level in much of Virginia. Under Obenshain's leadership, however, a record number of Republicans were elected to seats in the Virginia General Assembly, the first such major gains since Reconstruction in the late 19th century following the American Civil War. In the summer of 1978, Obenshain won his party's nomination to run for the U.S. Senate to replace retiring William L. Scott. On the night of August 2, the small twin- engine Piper PA-34 Seneca airplane carrying him home from a campaign appearance crashed in trees while attempting a night-time landing at the Chesterfield County Airport, a general aviation facility near Richmond. Killed along with the 42-year-old candidate were a pilot and a flight instructor. Former U.S. Secretary of the Navy John Warner was selected to replace Richard Obenshain as the party's nominee for the U.S. Senate race. He won in November, and went on to hold the seat for 30 years. Children In 2003, two of Richard Obenshain's children enjoyed major successes in Virginia politics. First, his daughter, Kate Obenshain of Winchester, became the first woman to head the Republican Party of Virginia. Ironically, her opponent was state Republican party treasurer Richard Neel Jr., an Alexandria lawyer whose father was the pilot who died in the same crash as Richard Obenshain. Then, in November, Obenshain's son, Mark Obenshain, an attorney based in Harrisonburg, was elected to the Virginia State Senate from the 26th district. He was the 2013 Republican nominee for Attorney General of Virginia. Legacy According to an article in the Virginian-Pilot newspaper, his political legacy was \\"skill at birthing an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, his prescient support of Ronald Reagan and bold tax cuts, and his tireless crusade to curb Democratic dominance in the state.\\" In Richmond, the state headquarters of the Republican Party of Virginia is named \\"The Richard D. Obenshain Center\\" in his honor. ::\\"The most important goal in my life is to have some significant impact in preserving personal freedom in the life of this country.\\" ::::Richard D. Obenshain According to Virginia State Senator Mark Obenshain (R-26), the above statement is slightly misquoted and should read as the following: ::\\"The most important goal in my life is to have some significant impact in preserving and expanding the realm of personal freedom in the life of this country.\\" ::::Richard D.

Located near the Missouri River between Underwood, North Dakota and Washburn, North Dakota, it is the largest lignite-fired electricity plant in North Dakota. Its two generators are each rated at 605 megawatts (Unit 1 went in service in 1979, Unit 2 came online in 1980), with a peak total production of nearly 1.2 gigawatts. The station is owned by Great River Energy, an alliance of Minnesota rural electric cooperatives, and transmits its power to Minnesota over the CU power line, a HVDC transmission line which is operated at +/- 400 kV. The line and plant were completed and put in service by 1981. The Coal Creek Station, part of the larger CU Project, was the subject of controversy. The boiler building of Coal Creek Station is 89.91 meters high. Hereby the boiler is fixed to the roof. The chimney of Coal Creek Station is 198.12 metres tall. Coal Creek Station is the third-largest producer of coal ash in the country, generating over four million pounds of surface waste stored onsite each year.

The school takes children aged four through 18 and provides an education based in American pedagogy with an international perspective. The kindergarten classes are inspired by the Reggio Emilia method. The school has been rated \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted,https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2771575 and has a strong track record for Ivy League and Association of American Universities (AAU) collegiate placements. History The school was established in 1951 by journalist Stephen Eckard. It was first situated in Eckard's home, and was a school primarily for 13 students. The school's colors, orange and black, are inspired by Eckard's alma mater, Princeton University. Prior to that, the school's official colors were red and black. In 1964, the newly formed Board of Trustees made the landmark decision to raise funds for a $7 million building to house the whole school. They broke ground in 1968 with the help of David K.E. Bruce. The cornerstone was laid two years later by Ambassador Walter Annenberg. The Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher, MP, then Secretary of State for Education and Science, spoke at the building's dedication in 1971. In September 2000, the School opened a new High School wing, which included an additional 24,000 square feet of space, a new gym, art studios, high-tech computer labs and a renovated library.https://www.asl.org/about/history In June 2006, the School broke ground on the School Center for Education and the Arts, to create a 450-seat theater and new flexible teaching and performance space. The Center was completed in the winter of 2007 and officially opened in March 2008. In 2011, the School marked its 60th anniversary by celebrating Founder's Day on 21 April, the date on which founding headmaster Stephen L. Eckard opened the doors of his Knightsbridge flat to begin the American School in London in 1951. In May 2014, the School broke ground, once again, on the construction of a Community Arts Building (opened in January 2016); an underground Aquatic & Fitness Center with a 6-lane, 25-meter swimming pool, fitness center and multipurpose instruction space (opened September 2016); and the renovation of a middle school science labs (opened in September 2016).

Early life Brown was born in Biloela, Queensland and studied drama at the University of Queensland. He began his career in the early 1970s at Queensland Theatre Company, working alongside Geoffrey Rush. He was openly gay.  Abroad  Brown's career took him abroad to Britain, where he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), and was the first Australian commissioned to write and perform in their own play – The Swan Down Gloves. The show opened at the Barbican Theatre (RSC's home theatre from 1982–2002) and had a Royal Command Performance. As a member of the RSC (between 1976–1982, 1986–88 and 1994–96) Brown toured with their productions throughout Europe, playing Paris, Vienna, Berlin and Munich. He also appeared in the RSC's premiere production of The Wizard of Oz in the gender-bending roles of The Wicked Witch of the West and Miss Gulch, for which he was nominated for an Olivier Award in 1988. While working in the United Kingdom, Brown also performed in the West End, at the Aldwych and Haymarket Theatres, the Chichester Festival Theatre, English National Opera and Dublin Theatre Festival. While performing onstage at Stratford he was spotted by John Cleese, who cast him in Fierce Creatures, the sequel to A Fish Called Wanda. In New York, Brown made his Broadway debut as an actor in 1986 in Michael Frayn's Wild Honey with Ian McKellen, directed by Christopher Morahan, and as a playwright with his adaptation of a benefit performance of A Christmas Carol in 1985, featuring Helen Hayes, Len Cariou as Scrooge, MacIntyre Dixon, Celeste Holm, Raúl Juliá, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Harold Scott, Carole Shelley, and Fritz Weaver, directed by W.

A girl in a dress. Children's clothing or kids' clothing is clothing for children who have not yet grown to full height. Grandma bait is a retail industry term for expensive children's clothing. Children's clothing is often more casual than adult clothing, fit for play and rest. Hosiery is commonly used. More recently, however, a lot of childrenswear is heavily influenced by trends in adult fashion. Due to the rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, celebrities and fashion bloggers have been using their accounts to post pictures of their children wearing luxury \\"street style\\" clothing, thus inspiring parents to dress their children as they would dress themselves. Children's clothing is care about their health. Good quality, well designed, garments are now a priority for a growing number of parents and children's clothing is getting a prime place in top label stores and high-end fashion retail outlets. Dresses are also getting separately designed for boys and girls at a very early age. History Function Two girls wearing sleeveless tops and shorts Function and design must meet at the right proportions in children's clothes for it to be popular and accepted. Fabric choices, openings and fastenings, fit and ease, trimmings used are all major considerations when designing children's wear. Some other factors a designer designing for children's clothing should focus on are the changing shape of the growing kid and different proportions of the different parts of the body. Leisure wear and sports wear are two very prominent design styles in children's clothing. Girls clothing are available in a wide range and styles. Children's clothing is also sometimes worn by adult midgets, dwarves or short people. Sizes American sizes for baby clothes are usually based on the child's weight. European sizes are usually based on the child's height. These may be expressed as an estimated age of the child, e.g., size 6 months (or 3–6 months) is expected to fit a child in height and in weight.Size chart from Carter’s and OshKosh B’gosh Children's clothing and gender More recently gender-specific children's clothing has become a contentious issue. According to some feminist thinkers, children's clothing has become increasingly segregated, with young girls especially being expected to wear pink. Peggy Orenstein writes in her book, Cinderella Ate My Daughter, that pink-coloured and princess-themed clothes are almost ubiquitous for young girls in shops in America. She sees this as problematic because it limits girls to not only one colour, but also to one spectrum of experience, and it \\"firmly fuses girls' identity to appearance.\\"Orenstein, Peggy Cinderella Ate My Daughter Harper Paperbacks, 2011, p.34 According to Historian Jo B.

Kaghan Valley is always accessible during the summer season (May to September) and closed to visitors during winter. This is because the glaciers block the roads leading to Kaghan Valley during winter, causing the roads to close. These glaciers would melt from February to April.

Dowd) of the Temple Grove Ladies Seminary (now Skidmore College) in Saratoga Springs, New York. He was the first person to propose multiple time zones for any country, those for the railways of the United States. He did not propose their extension to the entire world, which was suggested by the Italian mathematician Quirico Filopanti, and championed by the Canadian engineer Sandford Fleming. About 1863, he first proposed time zones for United States railways to teenage girls whom he was teaching. In 1869, he presented his idea to a committee of railway superintendents in New York. As a result, in 1870 he published a pamphlet entitled \\"A System of National Time for Railroads\\" wherein he proposed four time zones, each 15° wide, the time of each being one hour different from the next, named Washington, first, second, and third hours. The central meridian of the first zone was the Washington meridian. The borders of all zones were lines of longitude. In 1872, he modified his proposal so that the first zone was centered on the 75th meridian west of Greenwich, with the others 90°, 105°, and 120° west of Greenwich. Now all had geographic borders, such as the Appalachian Mountains for a portion of the border between the first and second zones.Charles F. Dowd, A.M., PH.D.; a narrative of his services ..., ed.

House of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 1985) Except for meridians based on Greenwich, the system adopted by the railroad industry on 18 November 1883 ignored Dowd's proposal. The adopted system by William F. Allen, editor of the Traveler's Official Railway Guide, had borders that passed through railway terminals, even some in major cities, like Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Charleston—these formed the border between the eastern and central time zones. It included a fifth time zone for eastern Canada, called Intercolonial Time after the Intercolonial Railway serving eastern Canada. Each of these boundary cities had to adopt one of the two railroad zones or continue to use local mean solar time. The 1918 Standard Time Act moved the borders to relatively rural areas.

The insurgents, led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, declared that the Mahdi (the \\"redeemer of Islam\\") had arrived in the form of one of their leaders, Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani, and called on Muslims to obey him. For nearly two weeks, Saudi Special Forces, advised by three GIGN French commandos and other commandos fought battles to reclaim the compound. The seizure of Islam's holiest site, the taking of hostages from among the worshippers and the deaths of hundreds of militants, security forces and hostages caught in the crossfire in the ensuing battles for control of the site shocked the Islamic world. The siege ended two weeks after the takeover began and the mosque was cleared.Benjamin, The Age of Sacred Terror (2002) p. 90 Al-Qahtani was killed in the recapture of the mosque but al-Otaybi and 67 of his fellow rebels who survived the assault were captured and later beheaded.Mackey, Sandra. The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom. Updated Edition. Norton Paperback. W.W. Norton and Company, New York. 2002 (first edition: 1987). pbk., p. 234. Following the attack, the Saudi King Khalid implemented a stricter enforcement of Shariah (Islamic law), giving the ulama and religious conservatives more power over the next decade, and religious police became more assertive. Background The seizure was led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, a member of an influential family in Najd. He declared his brother- in-law Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani to be the Mahdi, or redeemer, who arrives on earth several years before Judgement Day. His followers embellished the fact that Al-Qahtani's name and his father's name are identical to Prophet Mohammed's name and that of his father, and developed a saying, \\"His and his father's names were the same as Mohammed's and his father's, and he had come to Makkah from the north\\", to justify their belief. The date of the attack, 20 November 1979, was the first day of the year 1400 according to the Islamic calendar; this ties in with the tradition of the mujaddid, a person who appears at the turn of every century of the Islamic calendar to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity.Benjamin, The Age of Sacred Terror, (2002) p. 90 Al-Otaybi was from one of the foremost families of Najd. His grandfather had ridden with Ibn Saud in the early decades of the century and other of his family members were among foremost of the Ikhwan.1979 Makkah – Grand Mosque aka Holy Mosque, Global Security He was a preacher, a former corporal in the Saudi National Guard and a former student of Sheikh Abdel Aziz bin Baz who went on to become the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. =Goals= \\"Al-Otaybi had turned against Bin-Baaz and began advocating a return to the original ways of Islam, among other things: a repudiation of the West; abolition of television and expulsion of non- Muslims\\".Wright, Sacred Rage, (2001), p. 152 He proclaimed that \\"the ruling Al-Saud dynasty had lost its legitimacy because it was corrupt, ostentatious and had destroyed Saudi culture by an aggressive policy of Westernization\\". He regarded radio, television and working women to be great \\"evils\\". Al-Otaybi and Qahtani had met while imprisoned together for sedition, when al-Otaybi claimed to have had a vision sent by God telling him that Qahtani was the Mahdi. Their declared goal was to institute a theocracy in preparation for the imminent apocalypse. It is important to emphasize, however, that the 1979 rebels were not literally a reincarnation of the Ikhwan and to underscore three distinct features of the former: They were millenarians, they rejected the monarchy and they condemned the wahhabi ulama. =Relations with ulama= Many of their followers were drawn from theology students at the Islamic University of Madinah. Al-Otaybi joined the local chapter of the Salafi group Al-Jamaa Al-Salafiya Al-Muhtasiba (The Salafi Group That Commands Right and Forbids Wrong) in Medina headed by renowned Sheikh Abdel Aziz bin Baz, chairman of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas at the time. The followers preached their radical message in different mosques in Saudi Arabia without being arrested.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.88–9 The government was reluctant to confront religious extremists. When Al-Otaybi, al- Qahtani and a number of the Ikhwan were locked up as troublemakers by the Ministry of Interior security police (Mabahith) in 1978, members of the ulama (including bin Baz) cross-examined them for heresy but they were subsequently released as being traditionalists harkening back to the Ikhwan, like al- Otaybi's grandfather and, therefore, not a threat.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), p. 103 (softcover) Even after the seizure of the Grand Mosque, a certain level of forbearance by ulama for the rebels remained. When the government asked for a fatwa allowing armed force in the Grand Mosque, the language of bin Baz and other senior ulama \\"was curiously restrained\\". The scholars did not declare al-Otaybi and his followers non-Muslims, despite their violation of the sanctity of the Grand Mosque, but only termed them \\"al- jamaah al-musallahah\\" (the armed group). The senior scholars also insisted that before security forces attack them, the authorities must offer them the option to surrender. =Preparations= Because of donations from wealthy followers, the group was well-armed and trained. Some members, like al-Otaybi, were former military officials of the National Guard.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), p. 102 (softcover) Some National Guard troops sympathetic to the insurgents smuggled weapons, ammunition, gas masks and provisions into the mosque compound over a period of weeks before the new year.Benjamin, The Age of Sacred Terror, (2002), p. 90 Automatic weapons were smuggled from National Guard armories and the supplies were hidden in the hundreds of tiny underground rooms under the mosque that were used as hermitages.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), p. 104 (softcover) Seizure In the early morning of 20 November 1979, the imam of the Grand Mosque, Sheikh , was preparing to lead prayers for the 50,000 worshippers who had gathered for prayer. At around 5:00 am he was interrupted by insurgents who produced weapons from under their robes, chained the gates shut and killed two policemen who were armed with only wooden clubs for hitting people who were not listening to them.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), p. 101 (softcover) The number of insurgents has been given as \\"at least 500\\" or \\"four to five hundred\\", and included several women and children who had joined al-Otaybi's movement. At the time the Grand Mosque was being renovated by the Saudi Binladin Group.1979 Seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca: The Attack and the Siege That Inspired Osama bin Laden . Retrieved 15 January 2014. An employee of the organization was able to report the seizure to the outside world before the insurgents cut the telephone lines. The insurgents released most of the hostages and locked the remainder in the sanctuary. They took defensive positions in the upper levels of the mosque, and sniper positions in the minarets, from which they commanded the grounds. No one outside the mosque knew how many hostages remained, how many militants were in the mosque and what sort of preparations they had made. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit. The commander of the National Guard, Prince Abdullah, was also abroad for an official visit to Morocco. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to the Sudairi Brothers – Prince Sultan, then Minister of Defence, and Prince Nayef, then Minister of Interior, to deal with the incident. Siege Smoke rising from the Grand Mosque during the assault on the Marwa-Safa gallery, 1979. Soon after the rebel seizure, about 100 security officers of the Ministry of Interior attempted to retake the mosque, but were turned back with heavy casualties. The survivors were quickly joined by units of the Saudi Arabian Army and National Guard. At the request of the Saudi monarchy, three French Groupe d’Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) commandos were sent to advise Saudi forces in Mecca. By evening the entire city of Mecca had been evacuated. Prince Sultan appointed Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, head of the Al Mukhabaraat Al 'Aammah (Saudi Intelligence), to take over the forward command post several hundred meters from the mosque, where Prince Turki would remain for the next several weeks. However, the first order of business was to seek the approval of the ulama, which was led by Abdel Aziz bin Baz. Islam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque, to the extent that plants cannot be uprooted without explicit religious sanction. Bin Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in Medina. Regardless, the ulama issued a fatwa allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), pp. 103–104 (softcover) With religious approval granted, Saudi forces launched frontal assaults on three of the main gates. Again the assaulting force was repulsed as they were unable to break through the insurgents' defences. Snipers continued to pick off soldiers who revealed themselves. The insurgents aired their demands from the mosque's loudspeakers throughout the streets of Mecca, calling for the cut-off of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the Arabian Peninsula.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.92 In Beirut an opposition organization (the Arab Socialist Action Party – Arabian Peninsula) issued a statement on 25 November, alleging to clarify the demands of the insurgents. The party, however, denied any involvement in the seizure of the Grand Mosque.Saudi Opposition Group Lists Insurgents' Demands in MERIP Reports, No. 85. (February 1980), pp. 16–17. Officially, the Saudi government took the position that it would not aggressively retake the mosque, but rather starve out the militants. Nevertheless, several unsuccessful assaults were undertaken, at least one of them through the tunnels in and around the mosque.see also: Wright, Robin B., 1948 Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam Simon & Schuster c 2001, p. 148 However, this account is contradicted by at least two other accounts,see also including that of then GIGN commanding officer Christian Prouteau:see also the three GIGN commandos trained and equipped the Saudi forces and devised their attack plan (which consisted of drilling holes in the floor of the Mosque and firing gas canisters wired with explosives through the perforations), but did not take part in the action and did not set foot in the mosque but the action was rather performed by Saudi commandos. The Saudi National Guard and the Saudi Army suffered heavy casualties. Tear gas was used to force out the remaining militants. According to a US embassy cable of 1 December, several of the militant leaders escaped the siege and days later sporadic fighting erupted in other parts of the city. The battle had lasted for more than two weeks, and had officially left \\"255 pilgrims, troops and fanatics\\" killed and \\"another 560 injured ... although diplomats suggested the toll was higher.\\" Military casualties were 127 dead and 451 injured.

They were not shown leniency. The king secured a fatwa from the Council of Senior Scholars which found the defendants guilty of seven crimes: * violating the Grand Mosque's sanctity; * violating the sanctity of the month of Muharram; * killing fellow Muslims and others; * disobeying legitimate authorities; * suspending prayer at Masjid al-Haram; * erring in identifying the Mahdi; * exploiting the innocent for criminal acts. On 9 January 1980, 63 rebels were publicly beheaded in the squares of eight Saudi cities (Buraidah, Dammam, Mecca, Medina, Riyadh, Abha, Ha'il and Tabuk). According to Sandra Mackey, the locations \\"were carefully chosen not only to give maximum exposure but, one suspects, to reach other potential nests of discontent.\\" = Policies = King Khalid, however, did not react to the upheaval by cracking down on religious puritans in general, but by giving the ulama and religious conservatives more power over the next decade. He is thought to have believed that \\"the solution to the religious upheaval was simple: more religion.\\" First, photographs of women in newspapers were banned, then women on television. Cinemas and music shops were shut down. School curriculum was changed to provide many more hours of religious studies, eliminating classes on subjects like non-Islamic history. Gender segregation was extended \\"to the humblest coffee shop,\\" and religious police became more assertive. =Legacy= Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, has pointed to the siege of the Grand Mosque and the Iranian Revolution of the same year as events that pushed Saudi Arabia in a more conservative direction for decades afterwards. In a 2018 interview with 60 Minutes he said that before 1979, \\"We were living a very normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries. Women were driving cars. There were movie theaters in Saudi Arabia. Women worked everywhere. We were just normal people developing like any other country in the world until the events of 1979.\\" While this image of pre-1979 Saudi Arabia is disputed, the religious establishment did gain more power and money after 1979, leading to a stricter interpretation of Islam in society and the law, as well as increased international influence for Wahhabism. =In popular culture= In 2018 a documentary, The Siege of Mecca, was directed by Dirk Van Den Berg and produced by Dirk Van Den Berg and Pascal Verroust which analysed the incident based on the reports of eye-witnesses and experts.

After eluding the traps and tranquilizer darts of SPCA officials and police officers for 11 days, she was finally captured just after midnight on February 26 in Clifton, Cincinnati, Ohio. She lived out the rest of her life at Farm Sanctuary's New York Shelter in Watkins Glen, New York, where she was particularly popular with animal rights activists and animal lovers. Finding a permanent home for her was a source of some debate, as most considered her no longer eligible for slaughter. The Cincinnati Zoo declined to house her, citing health concerns and the possibility that she could not be safely contained. Jan Malley, a Northern Kentucky woman with a farm, was also considered as a possibility. In late March, however, artist Peter Max offered $180,000 worth of paintings to the SPCA for use at their next auction. In return, he took custody of the cow, whom he named to commemorate not only her dramatic pursuit of liberty, but the city into which she escaped. Cincinnati Freedom received the key to Cincinnati, but didn't wear it during the Cincinnati Reds Findlay Market Opening Day Parade on April 1, 2002, as planned, because she was judged too jumpy and nervous to participate. She was brought to her permanent home at Farm Sanctuary's New York Shelter on April 11, 2002, where she spent the rest of her life. She was reported to be doing well in the sanctuary and had apparently made a number of friends, including Queenie, a cow who escaped from a slaughterhouse in Queens, New York, in 2000.

The inaugural (posthumous) inductee to the International Circus Hall of Fame, Leitzel died in hospital two days after a fall during a live performance. Early life Leitzel was born as Leopoldina Alitza Pelikan in a family of circus performers. Her father was most likely Willy Dosta, an itinerant circus performer; another possible candidate was Edward J. Eleanore, a Hungarian army officer and theater performer. Her mother, Nellie Pelikan, was a Czech circus acrobat. Nellie was one of 6 children born to Eduard Pelikan, an acrobat/clown/strongman. Eduard's son Adolf performed as a clown under the pseudonym \\"Bluch Landolf\\". Lillian's brother, Arthur Pelikan, later became director of the Milwaukee Art Institute.Dean Jensen, Queen of the Aur She spent her childhood in Germany, where she lived with her maternal grandparents. Although she had been well- educated and had prepared to pursue a career as a concert pianist, she joined her mother's aerobatic circus group, the Leamy Ladies. The troupe was completed by her aunts Tina and Toni and Lily Simpson and they toured Europe in 1905. \\"The Leamy Ladies (Lillian Leitzel at left) in 1905. In 1910, she came to the United States with the circus troupe and performed with Barnum and Bailey. The group later dissolved and its members returned to Europe, but Leitzel continued to attempt to perform in the American vaudeville circuit. In South Bend, Indiana, she was seen by an agent of the Ringling Brothers who offered her a contract. When Ringling and Barnum and Bailey merged, she became a huge star and a headline performer for the circus. Act and personality Leitzel performing in 1925 Leitzel's act included one-armed planges, momentarily dislocating the shoulder during each plange. She would flip her body over her shoulder repeatedly, sometimes hundreds of times in a feat of endurance, encouraging the audience to count each one in unison. Only four feet, nine inches, she was also famous for her demanding personality and temper. Leitzel was the first performer in history to command her own private Pullman car completely furnished with her own baby grand piano.Eckley, Wilton. The American Circus. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984. Her quick temper was legendary. It was not uncommon to witness Leitzel cursing or slapping a roustabout who did not adjust her rigging exactly to her liking. Further, Leitzel was known to fly off the handle and fire then rehire her personal maid, Mabel Cummings, several times a day. In sharp contrast, she was known to the children on the show as \\"Auntie Leitzel\\", and she would hold birthday parties for her fellow performers in her private dressing tent.Willson, Dixie. \\"Under the Big Top\\", Good Housekeeping, June–October 1931. Marriages The identity of her first husband is unknown. She married Clyde Ingalls in 1920, and the couple divorced in 1924. Her third husband was circus trapeze performer Alfredo Codona, whom she wed in 1928. Accident and death On February 13, 1931, she fell to the ground from her rigging while performing in Copenhagen, Denmark at the Valencia Music Hall, when the swivel that held the rope in place fractured and snapped. She and Codona had been performing in Europe separately, and he rushed to Copenhagen. After she apparently showed signs of improvement, Codona returned to his company in Berlin. However, she died on February 15, two days after the fall, aged 39.

M. Thomas (born 27 January 1935), is a British novelist, poet, playwright and translator. He is best known for his novel The White Hotel (1981). Life Thomas was born in Redruth, Cornwall, UK. He attended Trewirgie Primary School and Redruth Grammar SchoolBBC website - Donald Michael Thomas before graduating with First Class Honours in English from New College, Oxford in 1959. He lived and worked in Australia and the United States before returning to his native Britain. He published poetry and some prose in the British Science fiction magazine New Worlds (from 1968). The work that made him famous is his erotic and somewhat fantastical novel The White Hotel (1981), the story of a woman undergoing psychoanalysis, which has proved very popular in continental Europe and the United States. It was short- listed for the Booker Prize in 1981, coming a close second, according to one of the judges, to the winner, Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. The author himself stated in an interview on BBC Radio Cornwall in 2015 that the Booker judges wanted to split the prize between him and Salman Rushdie, but that the Board informed them that this wasn't in the rules, although the rules were indeed changed in this respect the following year. It has also elicited considerable controversy, as some of its passages are taken from Anatoly Kuznetsov's Babi Yar, a novel about the Holocaust. In general, however, Thomas's use of such \\"composite material\\" (material taken from other sources and imitations of other writers) is seen as more postmodern than plagiarist.Felder, L., D M Thomas - The Plagiarism Controversy in Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook, 1982 In the 1950s, at height of the Cold War, Thomas studied Russian during his National Service.

CIC is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS – AdvancED - Cognia) and by the International Baccalaureate Organization in its Middle Years (MYP) and the Diploma Program (DP). At the conclusion of the 2019-2020 school year, student enrollment was just over 100. CIC offers an Early Learning Program (Pre-Nursery [Age 2 Years] through Kindergarten); an Elementary Age Program; and a Secondary Program - all supported by project-based learning with the ultimate goal of worldwide university acceptances upon graduation. Enrollment is balanced between the three programs, and all students participate in classes like Music, the Fine Arts, Technology, Physical Education, and the Collaboratory (a new makerspace- style learning area). CIC is an active member of the Venezuelan Association of North American Schools (VANAS).  History  CIC traces its history back to 1896. Originally called Colegio Americano, the school merged with Academia La Castellana in 1971 and took the name Colegio Internacional de Caracas, in English, The International School of Caracas. CIC has remained on the current campus for 50 years.  Academics  The educational programs of the Colegio International de Caracas combine academic instruction with a global world view. CIC offers the International Baccalaureate Program. In eleventh and twelfth grades, the school offers the Diploma Program (DP) of the International Baccalaureate. The Diploma Program requires students to study languages, mathematics, sciences, humanities, fine arts and theory of knowledge. To prepare for the demands of the IB Diploma Program, the school offers the IB Middle Years Program (MYP), a program that integrates courses in languages, humanities, technology, mathematics, arts, sciences, and physical education through the curricular lenses of health and social education, community and service, environment, human ingenuity, and approaches to learning. English is the language of instruction. For those students who come to the school not speaking English, CIC offers English for Speakers of Other Languages a comprehensive (ESOL) program. For those students who come to the school not speaking Spanish, the school offers Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) classes. As part of the school's commitment to holistic learning, students participate in various grade-level field trips that integrate concepts taught in various classes. Students participate in the Model United Nations (MUN) programs in the middle school (JMUN) and the high-school (SAMUN) as well as a comprehensive volunteering program.  Facilities  The facilities consists of 37 classrooms including an elementary wing, a new makerspace, 4 laboratories, 2 computer rooms, 5 offices, 2 music rooms, 3 art rooms, 2 book rooms, and a library with over 30,000 volumes, books, and audio- visual materials. The 4 secondary science laboratories are designed to be used by both secondary and elementary students. All classrooms, computer laboratories and the media center have access to the Internet, with a wireless network all around campus. There is abundant space for sports and recreation as the School has a full-size artificial turf soccer field, covered basketball courts, and a street hockey area. The physical education building includes dance/weight rooms, locker rooms and a physical education office. Students also have access to an indoor-outdoor canteen area that provides breakfast, lunch, and snacks.  Library  The CIC Library is housed in a 565 square meter area, with roughly 30,000 books, 10,000 of which belong to the Elementary Library. Materials are mostly in English, but there are also books in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Greek, and Japanese. For students in elementary school, library classes occur every week. These classes focus on teaching students how to best function in libraries: The classes concentrate on such things as the use of on-line catalogues, web pages, videos, and magazines, all of which help students in their research. The CIC library catalogue has been updated with Lexile number for 75% of all books: labels are placed on the spines, and each student is given a personal Lexile number after taking the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) reading test. A student’s lexile number is matched with an equivalent Lexile book number. The student is able to choose a book that matches his/her reading level.  Students  CIC students have very diverse backgrounds. Students come from many countries such as Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Venezuela, Jamaica, Sudan, and Iran. About 25% of students are primarily English-speaking, and just over half are Spanish-speaking. All graduates continue to higher education in the United States, Canada, Spain, Venezuela, Europe, The Middle East, and elsewhere. With few exceptions, CIC students possess passports from countries other than Venezuela.  Faculty  As an accredited school, CIC employs certified teachers from all over the world (mainly from the United States and Venezuela), and uses professional recruiting fairs to fill its teaching needs. Finance  CIC's budget is driven by tuition, and a team of administrators and board members set an annual budget that is approved by the school board. Fees for parents include annual tuition, capital fees, and other expenses that are submitted to CIC in both dollars and local currency.

There are a number of applications for tethers: balloons, kites, tethered wind-energy conversion systems, anchors, tethered water-flow energy conversion systems, towing, animal constraint, spaceflight, and power-kiting. Tethering is also used to prevent the theft of a computer at a school or library. Failures Tethers may break by various means; if a tether is a signal, then interruption by signal barriers breaks the tether. If the tether is a cord or rope, then upon reaching the breaking strength of the tether, the tether fails in its function. Failure modes for tethers are considered when designing arrangements where a tether is needed. When a tether or line breaks suddenly, backlash of the segments may cause severe damage or loss of life. Safety links are sometimes used to prevent excessive tension in a tether involved in towing objects or persons, like in the towing of sailplanes; the safety link in a tether is thus a tether itself.

Over the years, it has featured performances from vaudeville and silent movies to grand opera starring such notables as Lionel Barrymore and Mary Pickford. The design of the theater is based on the Orpheum Theatre, built by Rapp and Rapp in Champaign, Illinois in 1914.

One of Manchester's main railway terminals between 1880 and 1969, it has been converted into an exhibition and conference centre, originally known as G-MEX, but now named Manchester Central. The structure is a Grade II* listed building. On 27 March 2020, the UK government announced that the building would be converted into an emergency hospital, intended to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and with 1,000 beds. It is expected to open in mid-April. History The station was built between 1875 and 1880 by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), and was officially opened on 1 July 1880. The architect was Sir John Fowler and the engineers were Richard Johnson, Andrew Johnston and Charles Sacré for the three companies which formed the CLC. While it was being built, a temporary facility, Manchester Free Trade Hall Station (after the Free Trade Hall a landmark building nearby) was in use from 9 September 1877. It had two wooden platforms serving four tracks. When the station opened, the temporary station became Manchester Central Goods. In 1963, the building was Grade II* listed for its special architectural or historic interest. Construction details The station's roof is a single span wrought iron truss structure long with a span of , and was high at its apex above the railtracks. Glass covered the middle section, timber (inside) and slate (outside) covered the outer quarters. The end screens were glazed with timber boarding surrounding the outer edges. It was constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co. The substructure and masonry partition were provided by Robert Neill and Sons of Manchester. Underneath the train shed is a large brick undercroft with intersecting tunnel vaults, above which were six platforms above street level which exited the station onto viaducts and bridges. The undercroft was used for storage and connected to the adjacent goods sidings by a carriage lift. The station's two-storey south wall has 15 bays separated by brick pilasters. At ground-floor level the bays have three round-headed windows and at first-floor level three square-headed. In the 20th century a glazed canopy was erected at the entrance at north end. Manchester Central Station on a winter's day in 1961 A temporary wooden building, erected at the front of the station to house ticket offices and waiting rooms was planned to be replaced by a grander edifice, for example a hotel and railway offices as at London St Pancras, but remained in use until the station closed. The Midland Hotel was built by the Midland Railway in 1898–1903 on an adjacent site. Railway usage Manchester railways 1910 Midland lines The Midland Railway (MR), one of the CLC's partners, used Manchester Central as its terminus for services including express trains to London St Pancras. Beginning in 1938, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (successor to the MR) ran two prestige expresses, The Peaks and the Palatine, stopping en route at Chinley, Millers Dale, Matlock, Derby and Leicester. Between 1960 and 15 April 1966, during the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, Central Station was the terminus for the Midland Pullman, a streamlined blue six-coach diesel multiple unit. This stopped at Cheadle Heath (now closed), before running fast to St Pancras. Services through Millers Dale finished in July 1968, when the line was closed as a through route. The station provided local services to Chester and Liverpool, but closed to passengers on 5 May 1969, when the remaining services were switched to Manchester Oxford Road and Manchester Piccadilly stations. Accidents and incidents *On 8 June 1939, a passenger train departed against a danger signal and was in collision with another passenger train. Several people were injured. *In October 1965, detectives who had arrested Ian Brady for the murder of 17-year-old Edward Evans in Hattersley discovered evidence in a left luggage locker at the station. This evidence connected them to the disappearances of two missing children, who were soon discovered to have been murdered by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley in the widely reported Moors murders, in which at least five children and teenagers were murdered. Post-railway era  =Dereliction and redevelopment= Central Station car park (1980) Over a decade, Central Station fell into a dilapidated state, was damaged by fire and was used as a car park. The property was acquired by Greater Manchester Council and, in 1982, work began on converting it into an exhibition centre, which opened in 1986 as the Greater Manchester Exhibition and Conference Centre or G-Mex. It was subsequently renamed Manchester Central, in honour of its railway history. The undercroft was converted into a car park, serving the centre and Bridgewater Hall. =Light rail= A Metrolink tram (1992) The opening, in 1992, of the Metrolink light rail system has seen the conversion of suburban heavy rail lines such as the former Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway to Altrincham and the disused Cheshire Lines Committee route via Didsbury. With the introduction of Metrolink, rail services from south Manchester ran once more to Central Station. However, instead of trains running into the Central Station arch, light rail vehicles now cross the railway viaduct and stop at Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop. They then run down a ramp which runs parallel to Lower Mosley Street, alongside the south- eastern side of the former train shed, before reaching street level where they operate as trams and head towards St Peter's Square.

It is known for the quarrying of Ashford Black Marble (a form of limestone), and for the maidens' garlands made to mark the deaths of virgins in the village until 1801. Some of these are preserved in the parish church. The civil parish population (including Sheldon) taken at the 2011 Census was 559. History The name Ashford derives from the Old English æsc and ford, and means a ford where ash-trees grow. In 926 the village was known as Æscforda and in the Domesday Book of 1086 it was Aisseford. The addition of \\"in-the-Water\\" occurred in the late 17th century, and reflected the proximity of the village to meanders of the River Wye. In the Domesday Book Ashford was described as one of the locations in the area where lead was refined. In 1786, Ashford had mills for carving and polishing the local black marble. By 1848, it had 950 inhabitants. The village passed to the Cavendish family in the 16th century (from the Nevilles) and finally sold off in the 1950s to pay death duties. Culture The tradition of well-dressing continues in Ashford as in many other villages in the Peak District. Each year slabs of clay are decorated by village volunteers using petals, leaves and other plants to create a picture. The finished designs are then displayed at the six wells around the village and the event is marked by a church service and procession through the village to bless the wells. The event takes place around Trinity Sunday. Transport The village is bypassed by the A6 road. Notable buildings Within Ashford's civil parish are 62 structures that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest. None is listed as Grade I but there are two structures (Ashford Hall and the Sheepwash Bridge) that are Grade II*. All the others, including Thornbridge Hall and the parish church, are Grade II. Ashford Hall dates from 1785, though alterations were made in about 1840. It is a five-bay, three-storey building of gritstone and ashlar, with a balustered parapet around its slate roof. It has an early-19th-century conservatory. Sheepwash Bridge The Sheepwash Bridge is a packhorse bridge with an attached stone sheepwash: lambs were placed in the pen on one side of the river and the ewes swam across the river to get to them, while being pushed underwater by the shepherds to clean the fleece before shearing. Large trout inhabit the waters of the Wye around the bridge. It is a Scheduled Monument as well as a listed building. Ashford's parish church was mostly rebuilt in 1868–70 but has a partly 13th-century tower, a 14th-century north arcade and a recovered Norman tympanum above the south doorway. In the churchyard lies the base and stump of a Grade-II-listed churchyard cross, variously dated to the 14th or 15th century. Thornbridge Hall dates from the 18th century but was enlarged in 1871 and radically altered in a neo-Tudor style in 1897. Demography In the 2011 census, Ashford-in-the-Water was 99.5% White, and 0.2% Asian. Notable people Robert Armitage Sterndale, naturalist, artist, writer and statesman who worked in India before becoming Governor-general of St. Helena, was born in the village.

Junior's Grill was a restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States. It was located on the Georgia Tech campus in the Bradley Building near Tech Tower. It was a family business owned by Tommy Klemis. The restaurant served breakfast, lunch and dinner Monday through Thursday (breakfast and lunch only on Friday), and was famous among students for its French toast and battered chicken fingers. It closed on April 21, 2011, due to declining business.  History  Junior's was founded by Wilbur Gold, Jr. in 1948 as Pilgrim's and was originally located on North Avenue at Techwood Drive just south of campus. In 1958, the Georgia Board of Regents made plans to redevelop the property where Pilgrim's was located sometime in the future, and instead of accepting a year-to-year lease, Gold sold the business to James Klemis and John Chaknis, who changed the restaurant's name to Junior's Grill. Junior's remained in its original location until 1967, when the Board of Regents exercised its option to redevelop. The restaurant was relocated down the street to what had formerly been a barbershop, across from Smith Dormitory. The new location was much smaller than the original, and in 1987, Junior's expanded into the Engineer's Bookstore's former location next door. Soon after, the Georgia Tech Foundation purchased the property in preparation for the possibility that Atlanta would be an Olympic Games host city and gave Junior's a five-year lease. Demolition and construction for the 1996 Summer Olympics forced the restaurant to close in October 1993. Alumni, students and staff had petitioned to save Junior's and have the school find new premises for it. Renovations of the Bradley Building began in November 1993, and Junior's re-opened in that location in February 1994. Junior's closed indefinitely at 2:30pm on Thursday April 21, 2011. Culture The Georgia Tech student newspaper, The Technique, proclaimed that one of the 99 things every Tech student should do before they graduate is, \\"Eat at Junior's (and wonder why Tommy isn't in charge of all campus dining)\\". \\"Tommy\\" in this quote refers to James Klemis' son Tommy, who succeeded him as owner of the business. Some of the most popular items were the chicken fingers and burgers in \\"baskets,\\" which came with a choice of side (usually French fries) and a soft drink. In addition, there was a traditional hot line that served breakfast and lunch, as well as an assortment of grill items that could be ordered à la carte. The restaurant housed a collection of historical items and memorabilia related to Georgia Tech, including historical photographs of the campus, portraits of prominent alumni and visitors, and a section of the goalpost from the school's 1990 National Championship victory at the Citrus Bowl. Legacy Klemis Kitchen serves as a food pantry for students with dietary needs and financial concerns that limit their access to proper nourishment. The Klemis Kitchen Initiative started as an idea from several students who had known there was a gap in the fulfillment of the dietary needs of students on the Georgia Tech campus. As their peers they decided to take action and help prevent hunger for Tech students. Tommy Klemis, during his time on campus, often took care of the needs of these students. The Klemis Kitchen Initiative was created to fill the void that was created after Junior's Grill closed. Naming the project after Klemis honors both the history and legacy of Junior's Grill. \\"I can't think of a better legacy to leave for our future Tech students than one that actively provides funds to feed those in need,\\" he said. \\"It honors all the employees of Junior's, many of whom were students.\\"  References  1948 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Restaurants established in 1948 Landmarks in Atlanta Restaurants in Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia Tech buildings and structures Buildings and structures in Atlanta Restaurants in Atlanta 2011 disestablishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Junior's Grill"},{"id":"2836027","text":"Seaboard Railroad may refer to: *Seaboard Air Line Railroad *Seaboard Coast Line Railroad *Seaboard System Railroad ","title":"Seaboard Railroad"},{"id":"2836034","title":"List of schools in Venezuela"},{"id":"2836040","text":"Richard Allen Askey (4 June 1933 – 9 October 2019) was an American mathematician, known for his expertise in the area of special functions. The Askey–Wilson polynomials (introduced by him in 1984 together with James A. Wilson) are on the top level of the (q-)Askey scheme, which organizes orthogonal polynomials of (q-)hypergeometric type into a hierarchy. The Askey–Gasper inequality for Jacobi polynomials is essential in de Brange's famous proof of the Bieberbach conjecture. Askey earned a B.A. at Washington University in 1955, an M.A. at Harvard University in 1956, and a Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1961. After working as an instructor at Washington University (1958–1961) and University of Chicago (1961–1963), he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1963 as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics. He became a full professor at Wisconsin in 1968, and since 2003 was a professor emeritus. Askey was a Guggenheim Fellow, 1969–1970, which academic year he spent at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam. In 1983, he gave an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Warsaw. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993. In 1999, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2009, he became a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In December 2012, he received an honorary doctorate from SASTRA University in Kumbakonam, India. Askey explained why hypergeometric functions appear so frequently in mathematical applications: \\"Riemann showed that the requirement that a differential equation have regular singular points at three given points and every other complex point is a regular point is so strong a restriction that the differential equation is the hypergeometric equation with the three singularities moved to the three given points. Differential equations with four or more singular points only infrequently have a solution which can be given explicitly as a series whose coefficients are known, or have an explicit integral representation. This partly explains why the classical hypergeometric function arises in many settings that seem to have nothing to do with each other. The differential equation they satisfy is the most general one of its kind that has solutions with many nice properties\\". Askey was also very much involved with commenting and writing on mathematical education at American schools. A well-known article by him on this topic is Good Intentions are not Enough.

It contains 0.711% uranium-235, 99.284% uranium-238, and a trace of uranium-234 by weight (0.0055%). Approximately 2.2% of its radioactivity comes from uranium-235, 48.6% from uranium-238, and 49.2% from uranium-234. Natural uranium can be used to fuel both low- and high-power nuclear reactors. Historically, graphite-moderated reactors and heavy water- moderated reactors have been fueled with natural uranium in the pure metal (U) or uranium dioxide (UO2) ceramic forms. However, experimental fuelings with uranium trioxide (UO3) and triuranium octaoxide, (U3O8) have shown promise. The 0.72% uranium-235 is not sufficient to produce a self-sustaining critical chain reaction in light water reactors or nuclear weapons; these applications must use enriched uranium. Nuclear weapons take a concentration of 90% uranium-235, and light water reactors require a concentration of roughly 3% uranium-235. Unenriched natural uranium is appropriate fuel for a heavy-water reactor, like a CANDU reactor. On rare occasions, earlier in geologic history when uranium-235 was more abundant, uranium ore was found to have naturally engaged in fission, forming natural nuclear fission reactors. Uranium-235 decays at a faster rate (half-life of 700 million years) compared to uranium-238, which decays extremely slowly (half-life of 4.5 billion years). Therefore, a billion years ago, there was more than double the uranium-235 compared to now. During the Manhattan Project, the name Tuballoy was used to refer to natural uranium in the refined condition; this term is still in occasional use. Uranium was also codenamed \\"X-Metal\\" during World War II. Similarly, enriched uranium was referred to as Oralloy (Oak Ridge alloy), and depleted uranium was referred to as Depletalloy (depleted alloy).

P. Lovecraft. It is written in a mythic/fantasy style and is associated with his Dream Cycle. It was first published in The Scot, a Scottish amateur fiction magazine, in June 1920. Plot According to the tale, more than 10,000 years ago, a race of shepherd people colonized the banks of the river Ai, in a land called Mnar, forming the cities of Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron (not to be confused with Kadath), which rose to great intellectual and mercantile prowess. Craving more land, a group of these hardy people migrated to the shores of a lonely and vast lake at the heart of Mnar, founding the city of Sarnath. But the settlers weren't alone. Not far from Sarnath was the ancient grey-stone city of Ib, inhabited by a queer race who had descended from the moon. Lovecraft described them as \\"in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it.... They had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears, and were without voices.\\"H. P. Lovecraft, \\"The Doom That Came to Sarnath\\". These beings worshipped a strange god known as Bokrug, the Great Water Lizard, although it was more their physical form that caused the people of Sarnath to despise them. The citizens of Sarnath killed all the creatures inhabiting Ib, destroyed the city, and took their idol as a trophy, placing it in Sarnath's main temple. The next night, the idol vanished under mysterious circumstances, and Taran-Ish, the high-priest of Sarnath, was found murdered. Before dying, he had scrawled a single word onto the empty altar: \\"DOOM\\". Ten centuries later, Sarnath was at the zenith of both its power and decadence. Nobles from distant cities were invited to the feast in honor of Ib's destruction. That night, however, the revelry was disrupted by strange lights over the lake, heavy greenish mists, and the tidal marker, the granite pillar Akurion, was mostly submerged. Soon, many visitors fled, maddened by fear. After this, some of the survivors reported seeing the long- dead inhabitants of Ib peering from the windows of the city's towers instead of the king and his retinue, while others refused to say exactly what they had seen. Those who returned saw nothing of those unlucky enough to be left behind, only empty marsh, many water lizards, and most disturbingly, the missing idol. Ever since then, Bokrug remained the chief god in the land of Mnar. Inspiration The influence of Lord Dunsany on the story can be seen in the reference to a throne \\"wrought of one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come\\", which evokes the gate \\"carved out of one solid piece\\" of ivory in Dunsany's \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\". Though Sarnath is a historical city in India --the place where Buddha first taught-- Lovecraft said that he thought he invented the name independently.

Parker; 1872–1952) was a flamboyant American street dentist described as \\"a menace to the dignity of the profession\\" by the American Dental Association. However, \\"Much of what he championed—patient advocacy, increased access to dental care, and advertising—has come to pass in the U.S.\\" Parker attended Philadelphia Dental College, which would become the Temple University School of Dentistry. After six weeks without a single patient, he decided to advertise. He hired one of P.T. Barnum's ex-managers to help him take his practice on the road. He created the Parker Dental Circus, a traveling medicine show with his dental chair on a horse-drawn wagon while a band played. The band attracted large crowds and hid the moans and cries of patients who were given whiskey or a cocaine solution that he called \\"hydrocaine\\" to numb the pain. He charged 50 cents for each extraction and promised that if it hurt, he would pay the patient $5. At one point, he claimed to have pulled 357 teeth in one day, which he wore on a necklace. He legally changed his first name to \\"Painless\\" when he was accused of breaking a false advertisement law by claiming that his dentistry was truly painless. When business thrived, he hired assistants and established a chain dentistry business. In the end, Parker ran 28 West Coast dental offices, employing over 70 dentists, and grossing $3 million per year. Parker is mentioned in the song \\"Orange Claw Hammer\\" by musician and poet Don Van Vliet. The Historical Dental Museum at the Temple University School of Dentistry has a display dedicated to Parker, with his necklace of 357 teeth and a large wooden bucket filled to the brim with teeth that he had personally pulled.

History The area had been the major industrial region of Sheffield but had gone into decline since the 1960s. Huge parts of it were derelict and the city as a whole was suffering from large unemployment. The Corporation was established in 1988 and, in common with other development corporations, it was the planning authority for the area during its existence.Planning Functions Order It was wound down in 1997 with development operations ceasing on 1 April 1997 and dissolved on 1 July 1997. Key economic indicators During its existence it invested £101 million of government money and £7.5 million from the European Union. This was supported by £680 million of private investment. It reclaimed 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land and created over 5 million square feet (460,000 m2) of commercial floor space. It also created 18,000 new jobs. It also regenerated the local landscape with 160,000 trees and shrubs and renovated the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.House of Lords Debates Hansard Developments The most famous development during its time was Meadowhall Centre, which was Europe's largest shopping centre when it was built in 1991. It also brought the Abbey National share exchange centre to the area along with several call centres. Sheffield City Airport was also built during this time but is now facing an uncertain future since the end of chartered flights and the construction of Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield airport. The Victoria Quays at the end of the Don Valley Navigation also received a large investment. Although largely built in the region the SDC had no involvement with the World Student Games development. There was also due to be a four lane link road from junction 34 of the M1 at Meadowhall and the city centre. This was abandoned for a more modest improvement of the local roads when the early 1990s recession struck. In the end a total of of road was improved. Criticism In 1989 there was accusations that the chairman was using his authority for personal financial gain. Although he was never found to be doing anything improper or asked to step down, he did have business interests within the region. He was also a non-executive chairman of a company who invested in regeneration projects in Sheffield.Hansards Debates After the SDC The land continued to be developed after the dissolution of the SDC. A further 6,000 jobs were already due to be created and £124 million was pledged to redevelopment of Sheffield by the government over the next 7 years.Hansards written answers Since 1997 the lower Don Valley has also seen further investment due to its links.

The station serves NSW TrainLink diesel multiple unit trains travelling south to Bomaderry and north to Kiama. Early morning and late night services to the station are provided by train replacement bus services. In the past, the station precinct also catered to freight trains carrying dairy products. History The NSW Government Railways opened its South Coast Line extension, from Bombo to Bomaderry, on 2 June 1893. The town was initially served by both the main Gerringong Station and a smaller, unmanned stop called Omega, two kilometres to the north. The timing was fortuitous: the district's main link to Sydney, the jetty at Boat Harbour, had been destroyed in a storm two years previously. The arrival of the railway marked the end of coastal shipping to Gerringong after close to half a century of service. The Gerringong district was home to a highly productive dairy industry. The opening of the railway dramatically improved local producers' access to the lucrative Sydney market, so the then Gerringong Co-Operative Dairy Society moved its operations to a site neighbouring the station in 1908. The factory's rail siding was extended in 1936. On the night of 18 August 1941, lightning struck wiring leading to Gerringong's weatherboard station building, setting it alight. A report in the local Kiama Reporter says that 150 townsfolk gathered at the scene, and a firehose was run from the adjacent factory to fight the blaze, but the building was lost – only the brick chimney and an iron safe remained. \\"The train from Sydney ... was held up for about twenty minutes on account of the fire,\\" the Reporter recorded. A new brick station building was built in its place in 1942 in the functionalist style; it remains on the site in modified form today. Over time, freight declined in importance for the railway, and cost pressures led to the closure of low-patronage stations across the network. By 1986, the Omega railway station had closed, and in 1991 the dairy co-op abandoned its siding in favour of road transport.  Operations  The South Coast Line south of Kiama is non-electrified single track.

Redmond, 518 U.S. 1 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court created a psychotherapist-patient privilege in the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Background  Mary Lu Redmond was a police officer for the Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. On June 27, 1991, she was the first to respond to a fight-in-progress call. She arrived to find Ricky Allen chasing another man and brandishing a butcher knife. Redmond repeatedly ordered Allen to drop the knife, but Allen ignored her. At one point in the chase, it appeared to Redmond that Allen was about to stab the man he was chasing, and so she shot Allen. Allen died at the scene. Acting as the representative of Allen's estate, Jaffee filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Redmond had used excessive force during the altercation. Witnesses testified that Allen was not armed during the altercation. During discovery, Jaffee discovered that Redmond had sought counseling from a licensed clinical social worker. Jaffee sought the social worker's notes for the purpose of cross-examining Redmond at the trial. Redmond opposed the request, claiming that the notes were protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege. The trial judge rejected this argument, and the jury later awarded Allen's estate $545,000 in damages. Redmond appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which vacated the decision of the trial court and remanded. In its opinion, the privilege of which Redmond sought to avail herself did exist in federal law, and the trial court should have applied it. Jaffee asked the Supreme Court to review the Seventh Circuit's decision, and it agreed to do so. Majority opinion When the United States Congress enacted the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975, it expressly left the development of evidentiary privileges to the courts. The \\"privilege of a witness... shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted... in the light of reason and experience.\\" Under these common-law principles, the law favors compelling witnesses to give whatever evidence they can, unless there is some other \\"public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\\" The psychotherapist- patient privilege, like the attorney-client and spousal privileges, flows from society's desire to facilitate certain relationships of confidence and trust. \\"Effective psychotherapy... depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communication made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede disclosure of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment.\\" These are the important societal interests the psychotherapist-patient privilege works to protect. By contrast, if there existed no privilege for communications between psychotherapists and their patients, people would decide not to seek treatment for mental illness, particularly illnesses and traumas that are likely to result in litigation. If there were no privilege, evidence such as that sought from Redmond by Allen's estate would not likely arise in the first place, and would remain out of court just as if it were privileged. Two other considerations favored recognizing a federal psychotherapist-patient privilege. First, all 50 states recognized some form of the psychotherapist-patient privilege; thus, the \\"reason and experience\\" of those states counseled in favor of recognizing the privilege in federal courts. Indeed, as long as federal courts declined to recognize the privilege, those courts undermined the promise made by the states that afforded the privilege to their citizens. The secrets they shared with their psychologists could still be revealed to the world in federal courts housed across the street from the courts of their own states. Second, the proposed draft of the Federal Rules of Evidence included nine specific privileges, one of which was a psychotherapist-patient privilege. In the past, the Court had rejected an attempt to create a state legislative privilege within the Federal Rules of Evidence because that privilege was not included in the draft version of the Rules. When it rejected the draft including specific privileges, Congress did not specifically intend to reject the individual privileges. It simply intended to leave the contours of the privileges to the Courts. For all these reasons, the Court held that a psychotherapist-patient privilege existed within the Federal Rules of Evidence. The Court also had no trouble applying it to therapy provided by a licensed clinical social worker. Social workers provide a significant amount of mental health treatment. Their clients often are of modest means and cannot afford the assistance of psychiatrists and psychologists. The vast majority of states explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to social workers. Thus, the Court saw no reason to delimit the privilege so as to exclude social workers from the privilege. Dissenting opinion Justice Scalia disputed every major logical premise on which the majority's decision rested. The heart of his dissent, however, stemmed from two basic propositions. First, that the relative social importance of psychotherapy was not established. > Effective psychotherapy undoubtedly is beneficial to individuals with mental > problems, and surely serves some larger social interest in maintaining a > mentally stable society. But merely mentioning these values does not answer > the critical question: Are they of such importance, and is the contribution > of psychotherapy to them so distinctive, and is the application of normal > evidentiary rules so destructive to psychotherapy, as to justify making our > federal courts occasional instruments of injustice [by excluding truthful > evidence from court]? Second, the lack of sufficient basis to distinguish psychotherapists from others in society in whom people place valuable confidences. \\"For most of history, men and women have worked out their difficulties by talking to... parents, siblings, best friends, and bartenders--none of whom was awarded a privilege against testifying in court.\\" As a result, he could not see how extending an evidentiary privilege to psychotherapists would facilitate mental health treatment. From Scalia's vantage point, two flaws in the majority's argument were most troubling. Although all states had a psychotherapist privilege as part of their law, those states had enacted the law through legislation. The majority, by contrast, was creating one judicially after Congress had expressly declined to do so. The majority's justification--that the federal privilege was necessary to avoid undermining the laws of the states--seemed to Scalia to be an inverse form of preemption. Also, the states were not uniform in their treatment of the question presented in the case-- whether the testimony of a licensed social worker should be privileged from disclosure in court. Social workers serve a variety of roles and have a variety of backgrounds and training. \\"Does a social worker bring to bear at least a significantly heightened degree of skill -- more than a minister or rabbi, for example? I have no idea, and neither does the Court.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 518 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume External links www.jaffee-redmond.org * \\"The Psychotherapist- Patient Privilege After Jaffee v.

The free-form property of isotonic regression means the line can be steeper where the data are steeper; the isotonicity constraint means the line does not decrease. In statistics, isotonic regression or monotonic regression is the technique of fitting a free-form line to a sequence of observations such that the fitted line is non-decreasing (or non-increasing) everywhere, and lies as close to the observations as possible.  Applications  Isotonic regression has applications in statistical inference. For example, one might use it to fit an isotonic curve to the means of some set of experimental results when an increase in those means according to some particular ordering is expected. A benefit of isotonic regression is that it is not constrained by any functional form, such as the linearity imposed by linear regression, as long as the function is monotonic increasing. Another application is nonmetric multidimensional scaling, where a low-dimensional embedding for data points is sought such that order of distances between points in the embedding matches order of dissimilarity between points. Isotonic regression is used iteratively to fit ideal distances to preserve relative dissimilarity order. Isotonic regression is also used in probabilistic classification to calibrate the predicted probabilities of supervised machine learning models. Software for computing isotone (monotonic) regression has been developed for R, Stata, and Python.  Algorithms  In terms of numerical analysis, isotonic regression involves finding a weighted least-squares fit xin mathbb{R}^n to a vector ain mathbb{R}^n with weights vector win mathbb{R}^n subject to a set of non-contradictory constraints of the kind x_i le x_j. The usual choice for the constraints is x_i le x_{i+1}, or in other words: every point must be at least as high as the previous point. Such constraints define a partial ordering or total ordering and can be represented as a directed graph G=(N,E), where N (nodes) is the set of variables (observed values) involved, and E (edges) is the set of pairs (i, j) for each constraint x_i le x_j. Thus, the isotonic regression problem corresponds to the following quadratic program (QP): :min sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x_i - a_i)^2 text{subject to } x_i le x_j text{ for all } (i,j) in E. In the case when G=(N,E) is a total ordering, a simple iterative algorithm for solving this quadratic program is called the pool adjacent violators algorithm. Conversely, Best and Chakravarti studied the problem as an active set identification problem, and proposed a primal algorithm. These two algorithms can be seen as each other's dual, and both have a computational complexity of O(n).  Simply ordered case  To illustrate the above, let the x_i le x_j constraints be x_1 leq x_2 leq ldots leq x_n. The isotonic estimator, g^*, minimizes the weighted least squares-like condition: : min_{gin mathcal{A}} sum_{i=1}^n w_i (g(x_i) - f(x_i))^2 where mathcal{A} is the set of all piecewise linear, non- decreasing, continuous functions and f is a known function.

Due to routing arrangements and track usage agreements, gondola cars and other rolling stock are often used to transport goods on more than one railroad before reaching the end customer. Under the laws governing railway transport, individual railroads paid a fee, called demurrage, for the excess time other railroads held these cars (whether laden or not) prior to return to their owning road. The demurrage fees were thought to promote the rapid return of rolling stock, since delays equated to extra money spent. Because of the desire to reduce costs by minimizing demurrage, non-owning railroads may have declined the practice of allowing cars to continue on past their initial destination to points further from the car's \\"home\\". This had the effect of decreasing efficiency on these lines, and Railgon (and Railbox) used this argument to promote use of their rolling stock. Railroad deregulation as part of the Staggers Act reduced the need for this service, and the use of this cooperative arrangement consequently declined. As a result, today the Railgon pool is significantly smaller than at its peak. Railgon (and the similar Railbox Company) are currently subsidiaries of TTX Company, formerly the Trailer Train Company, which is owned by multiple railroads and leases cars to them.

The station serves NSW TrainLink diesel multiple unit trains travelling south to Bomaderry and electric multiple unit trains north to Wollongong and Sydney. Early morning and late night services to and from stations to the south are provided by train replacement bus services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History As a seaside town, Kiama was initially reliant on coastal shipping for its links to Wollongong and Sydney. The railway first arrived in the Kiama district in November 1887, with the opening of a new station at North Kiama (since renamed Bombo), on the town's northern outskirts. The terminus was only a temporary arrangement, however: the NSW Government Railways had already signed contracts to further extend the railway south the previous year. Kiama was the northernmost station on that extension, built by firm of W. Monie & J. Angus between 1886 and 1893. The new station opened in June 1893. Kiama was built as a passenger station and combined signal box on an island platform in the centre of the town. The goods yard was also opened and a locomotive sub-depot south of the station. From the timber footbridge, an elaborate landing and covered stair led down to the platform and the brick station was the first example of its type, the design of which was used at many stations built over the next 30 years. The design of the footbridge and stairs (plans dated 1892) were signed by Henry Deane. The line remains a single track with a crossing loop at the station. The Kiama Railway Station yard was originally huge, extending from Terralong Street at the north end to Barney Street to the south. NSW Railways plans dated 1925 for \\"Station Arrangements\\" show (from north to south): a cottage south of Terralong Street; platform extensions and removal of a lamp room from the platform; retaining walls; a cream loading platform on the east side of the yard, east of the platform; tanks under the Bong Bong Street overbridge and a rest house southeast of the overbridge; a cattle yards and weighbridge southeast of the overbridge; and further south, stock yards and an engine shed and turntable (west of rail lines); a goods shed with platform and loading stage, and east of these, another rest house. At the far southern end of the yard, on the south-eastern side, was the Station Master's residence and the Dairy Farmers Co-operative Milk Company building (just north of the Barney Street overbridge). Structures that have since disappeared include the footbridge and stairs, the Station Master's residence, the Bong Bong Street overbridge, the goods shed and the engine shed. A Dairy Farmers Co-Op siding and a N.S.W. Produce Company siding opened in 1947 are also no longer used. Ash pits are shown in the 1925 plan of the station arrangements, north of the turntable: one within the (no longer extant) engine shed and one north of the engine shed. Electric trains began operating on the line from Dapto to Kiama in November 2001, but the line to the south has remained as non-electrified single track. Since 2001, northbound trains from Bomaderry terminate at Kiama, requiring passengers to change to electric multiple unit services heading north. In 2005, the then Minister for Transport, John Watkins, announced that electrification would be extended to the terminus at Bomaderry at an unspecified future date, but the proposal did not progress.

The building has timber framed double hung windows with 9 paned top sashes with coloured glass panes to top sashes and frosted glass to bottom sashes. The majority of doors are timber panelled, and there are some timber panelled double doors, all with multipaned fanlights (some fanlights covered over). Door and window openings have elaborate sandstone reveals and triangular pediments. The awnings on both sides of the building have corrugated steel skillion roofs and elaborate decorative steel awning brackets, mounted on sandstone wall brackets. There is a small weatherboard addition to the south end of the main platform building which has 4 early stop chamfered timber posts at each corner, indicating that this is a weatherboard infill structure within an originally open awning structure. There are modern security screens to windows, and some modern timber flush doors. There is a brick screen wall to the north end of building to screen the entry to men's toilets. Internally, the waiting area has modern floor tiling, and modern ticket windows, timber panelled double doors both sides with frosted glass 8 paned fanlights, a later ceiling with timber battens, and later timber veneer panelling to around 2m height internally to the waiting room. Offices also have later ceilings and later timber veneer panelling to around 2m height (indicating possible presence of rising damp). ;Platform (1893) The island platform generally has a concrete face but its face is open at the northern end. The platform surface is asphalt. ;Turntable (1897) and ash pits A turntable located southeast of the southern end of Eddy Street. The turntable is a sunken circular brick edged structure with a single rail on timber sleepers running around the inside, and a cast iron turntable machine in the centre of the circle marked \\"William Sellers & Co. Philadelphia No. 1327\\". The brick edging of the turntable has a soldier course capping, but is otherwise in stretcher bond. Two rectangular ash pits were reportedly located to the north of the turntable, one of which was formerly within the now no longer extant engine shed. These were described in an earlier study and on historic plans, but were not confirmed to be extant at the time of the station's heritage listing. ;Footbridge (2005) A modern concrete, steel and glass structure with lift and stairs to platform, also modern canopy connecting platform building to the footbridge. ;Bong Bong Street Overbridge ( 2005) A modern concrete road overbridge with concrete piers, located south of the footbridge. Excluded from listing. ;Landscape/natural features There are views from the Station footbridge and platform to the southeast to the ocean and Norfolk Island pine plantings along the Kiama ocean frontage respectively. ;Condition The platform building and island platform were in good condition at the time of the heritage listing, with the modern footbridge and overbridge in very good condition. The condition of the turntable was unknown, and it was unclear if the ash pits were still extant. The platform and platform building are intact except for minor additions (modern platform canopies). The yard structures at Kiama (with the exception of the turntable and possibly the ash pits) have been removed.  Heritage listing  Kiama Railway Station group - including the platform, platform building, turntable and ash pits - are of State heritage significance. Kiama Railway Station is of historical significance as the first railway station on this section of the Illawarra line completed in 1893 from Bombo to Bomaderry, and for its role as a transport hub for the town of Kiama since 1893. The turntable and ash pits are remnant structures from a once substantial yard layout which served the dairying and pastoral industries. The Kiama Railway Station 1893 platform building is of aesthetic significance as the first example of an island platform building that became the model for the standard plans for this building type, known as A8-A10, issued by the NSW Railways in 1899. The building has particularly fine detailing to platform facades and awnings. The Kiama turntable is rare (one of only 3 turntables now extant on the Illawarra line - Bomaderry, Waterfall and Kiama) and of technical significance. Kiama railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Chelnov and Karnov were produced by the same director, and the three games are grouped together by Data East as the .https://web.archive.org/web/20010217192038/http://www.dataeast- corp.co.jp/dev/license/index.htm The game was re-released in 2007 as part of , a series which ported arcade games from the 1980s and 90s to the PlayStation 2. The mobile phone game company G-mode acquired the rights to the game after Data East's bankruptcy, and a mobile phone version of the game has been released for the Vodafone EZweb network. Though the game was initially planned as a sugoroku game titled , the content was completely changed during production into its released form, according to the arcade game magazine Arcadia (Coin Op'ed Video Game Magazine Arcadia). The sheep from this game later appeared in Suiko Enbu: Fuunsaiki as Makoto Mizoguchi's desperation move. Gameplay Trio The Punch is a beat 'em up game where the player chooses a character from three playable characters, and fights numerous enemies across a side-scrolling game screen. Most of the levels are played scrolling to the right, but some loop around the left and right edges of the screen. Other levels allow the player to scroll upwards or downwards by jumping, while some do not contain scrolling at all. The game is completed when the player finishes all 35 levels. The player controls their character with an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons (attack, jump, and special attack). Certain enemies leave behind a heart on the screen after being defeated, and collecting the required number of these hearts for each level causes a boss to appear, who must be defeated in order to complete the level. However, bosses appear from the start in some levels, so hearts do not always need to be collected. =Setting= The game begins in a tropical environment, but later levels may take place in the rainforest, urban cities, Middle Eastern desert, medieval Japan, or a futuristic military base. No instructions or explanations on the plot structure are given as the player progresses across the different levels. The game also contains a \\"game over\\" screen, which consists of an image of Michelangelo's sculpture, the Dying Slave. Choosing to continue the game on this screen causes the sculpture's face to change into a childish, cartoonish version of the original image, though the shadowed portion of the face remains in its original, realistic depiction. =Text= The game's text is displayed almost entirely in Japanese, and uses a unique mixture of hiragana, katakana, and kanji, which ignores conventional grammar and speech. As with many other Japanese games, English appears frequently, but is treated with disregard for grammar and readability. =In-game persona= Many of the game's enemies appear in contexts. While it is fitting to have ninjas appear in the medieval Japan level, and to have robots appear in the space level, the boss of the first level is a gigantic bronze statue of Karnov, which is carried on the shoulders of 4 smaller Karnovs. The word is etched onto the statue's base, and the statue attacks by breathing fire, and will change expressions after receiving damage. The boss of the second level is a gigantic bronze statue of a human fist. =Parodic elements= Trio the Punch is similar to games like Parodius and Konami Wai Wai World in the sense that Data East parodied some of its own games by having Karnov and Chelnov appear as enemies. Other parodic elements include the Darumasan ga koronda feature, where all of the objects on the screen are forced to stop moving. =Structure and game design= The traditional game structure of defeating weak, generic enemies before facing a stronger boss is often ignored in Trio the Punch. Some levels are much shorter than others, and only require one or two enemies to be killed before the boss, and the boss may even appear at the very beginning of some levels. Though the game is seemingly an orthodox side-scrolling action game, jumping on top of enemy bullets causes the player's character to bounce away as if he had landed on a trampoline. This action occurs often throughout the game, but the image of bouncing off of small bullets gives the game an unnatural feel where the laws of physics are ignored. The game's BGM was composed by Data East's music team, . Characters *Tough Guy () - The first playable character wears a baseball cap and track gear, and uses a sandbag and iron claw as weapons. He is best at close-range combat, and is the only playable character that can attack upwards. He makes cameo appearances in several other Data East games, including Boogie Wings (The Great Ragtime Show in Japan). *Ninja () - The second playable character is a ninja that wears a samurai mask over his face. He attacks with throwing knives and shuriken, and is the only character who can use long-range attacks from the start. He automatically transforms into a tree every time he receives damage from enemy characters, and the player cannot move or attack while the transformation lasts. *Swordsman () - The third playable character is a muscular swordsman who can wield a torch, sword, or morning star to fend off enemies. He has the longest weapon reach out of the three characters. * - Chin is a stereotype of the martial arts masters that appear in old kung-fu movies, and seems to be a teacher figure for the three playable characters. However, he appears as a boss in levels 7 and 24, where his body stretches or grows gigantic, and he attacks by shooting bullets shaped like the character 痛 (lit. \\"pain\\" or \\"hurt\\"). * - The title character from Karnov appears as a generic enemy in Trio the Punch. He is bald, bearded, obese, and half-naked, and appears in several different color and shape variations. * - The title character from Chelnov appears as a boss character in Trio the Punch. His body is encased in a powersuit, and he attacks with a huge hammer, which was not present in Chelnov.

His entire squadron was lost in an attack against Japanese aircraft carriers 4 June during the Battle of Midway. Lt. Owens received the Navy Cross and the Presidential Unit Citation (US) posthumously. James C. Owens (DD-776) was laid down 9 April 1944, by the Bethlehem Steel Co., San Pedro, California and launched 1 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James C. Owens Jr., widow of Lt. Owens. The ship commissioned on 17 February 1945, Commander R. H. Blair in command. Service history =World War II= After shakedown off southern California, James C. Owens departed San Pedro 10 May escorting the battleship to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 16 May. She cleared Pearl Harbor on 24 May and sailed as convoy escort via Eniwetok and Ulithi to Okinawa. Arriving 17 June, she continued to Kerama Retto to join DesRon 24, which steamed on 24 June for Leyte, where it joined a cruiser-destroyer striking force. Sailing 13 July via Okinawa, the force entered the East China Sea 22 July to conduct antishipping sweeps. James C. Owens operated with the striking force for a month and then operated out of Okinawa until departing 20 September for Japan as part of the Wakayama Occupation Group. Arriving on 22 September, she supported occupation landings, patrolled off southern Japanese islands, and served as courier and escort ship. Steaming from Japan on 5 December, she reached San Diego on 22 December, departed for the East Coast on 3 January 1946, and arrived at New York on 15 January. For more than 16 months, James C. Owens operated along the Atlantic Coast from New England to Texas.

The ship departed Charleston on 17 February 1965 for a Mediterranean cruise, and carried out advanced antisubmarine operations during her deployment. After her returning to Charleston on 12 July, she was designated a recovery ship for the Gemini V orbital space mission. With the mission successfully completed, the ship returned to her home port 13 September. On 2 November she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for extended overhaul. In March 1966 James C. Owens was back on the line at Guantanamo Bay. While there she rendered assistance to burning cruise ship, Viking Princess. After returning to Charleston for a brief visit, James C. Owens embarked midshipmen for their annual at-sea training. In late August she was assigned as the close-in recovery ship for the second in a series of Apollo unmanned space launches. In September the destroyer was deployed with the 6th Fleet; and, while operating in the Aegean Sea, she was ordered to the scene of sinking Greek ferry Heraklion, where she helped rescue the crew.

With 282 officers and men, OWENS' haze gray hull is a living machine requiring tremendous amounts of supplies to keep her running. During the seven and one-half months she was deployed to Vietnam, OWENS traveled over 52,720 miles, or far enough to steam around the world twice and in doing so used over two and a half million gallons of fuel oil. The ship went along various replenishment ships at sea 63 times, collecting everything from fuel and bullets to electron tubes and ice cream. Although supplies were restocked whenever in port, replenishment ships such as oilers, refrigerator ships and ammo ships remained her primary source of supplies as she spent 76 percent time at sea and on the gun line. During the deployment, over 2100 gallons of paint, 2,000 repair parts and 3,000 items of a consumable nature, such as paint and rollers and swabs, were issued. Over $425,000 was paid out in payrolls. In the ship's galleys aboard, 1145 pounds of hot dogs were consumed, or enough that placed end to end would reach halfway across Charleston S.C between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers. Enough coffee, bug juice [ie kool-aide] and cokes were served or sold that if passed out in Charleston, every man, women and child would receive 3 cups of coffee and 2 cokes. In addition Owens supplied swift boats with goodies and they in turn took mail for us at times to bases on shore to send back to loved ones at home. While aircraft carrier plane guard duty [ w/USS Ranger CVA-61 & USS Enterprise CVN-65 ] and Soviet Trawler surveillance were important assignments, naval gun fire support for our troops remained the most challenging of Owens' assignments. Owens' guns accounted for 12 Viet Cong killed in action, 101 bunkers destroyed, 75 structures damaged and miles of supply and escape routes interdicted.

There is no industry recognized definition for a marine grade stainless steel though it is routinely used by many end-users. In a marine environment it must be made clear as to whether the stainless steel is submerged in seawater or is simply near enough to the seashore such that it can be attacked by the chloride present in seawater by splashing or carried by onshore breeze. Chloride ions can cause localized corrosive attack (pitting and crevice corrosion) of susceptible stainless steels. When the stainless steel will be submerged, a PREN > 40 is typically specified as the minimum for resistance to seawater. Stainless steels, such as super austenitic stainless steels (for example UNS S31254 or N08367), or super duplex stainless steels (for example UNS S32760 or S32750) meet this requirement. Near the seashore 316L is typically considered the minimum grade of for use in such a marine environment. Concentrations of chloride in seawater can vary, and splash zones can cause concentrations to increase dramatically by evaporation, thus the corrosive severity of marine environments can vary. The resistance of any stainless steel near the seashore will also be dependent on whether the stainless surface can be rinsed by rainfall, which will reduce the tendency for surface chlorides to concentrate by evaporation. Thus, the underside of overhangs will be more susceptible to corrosion due to lack of rinsing, also desert locations near the seashore will typically be more corrosive than seashores in locations with high rainfall.

While Shimmer did not take as long to release, seven years to the twelve it took to finish the previous, the band still underwent line-up changes through the period of recording and releasing this album, however not as severely. Both bassists recorded on this album have left the band, though one of the guitarists that has been recorded here eventually returned in late 2005 just prior to its release after a hiatus. The difference in sound between God and the Abyss and Shimmer is striking, with the new direction of the band adding more elements of electronic dance music and a generally dancier sound. Keyboards are more prominent than before and the sound is less garage-centric and more melodic. The album itself is not released yet.

The track was closed for most of the 2010 season due to issues between track manager and promoter Robert MacArthur and the town of Epping. History The track has a long-history of legendary drivers, highlighted by Dynamite Ollie Silva, a super-modified and modified standout who won features races from Canada to Florida with less than top equipment. In the 1970s Star hosted the Supermodifieds and Modifieds (called late models) weekly, and Ollie's weekly battles with \\"Big Daddy\\" Don McLaren, Eddie West, Jim Cheney, Dick Batchelder, and Paul Richardson provided fans with great thrills and memories. In the 1970s the track hosted what was then thought to be the heaviest wedding cake in history, tipping the scales at over 700 lbs. Local journalist Russ Conway was a partial owner and operator of the track from 1965 to 1989. Star Speedway hosted one NASCAR North Tour race in 1985. The track hosted 20 NASCAR Busch North Series events between 1987 and 2001 and four NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour events between 1985 and 1990. The facility had two ACT Late Model Tour races, one in 2013 and the other in 2019. Boston Bruins race Star hosted celebrity races in the 1970s featuring Boston Bruins players. Often Don Awrey (after being traded) would invade Star and beat the local Bruins. Star Classic The track has hosts the Star Classic every fall, featuring the ISMA Super Modifieds. Stars such as Chris Perley (the 2005 winner), Russ Wood, Mike Ordway and Indy veteran Bentley Warren have participated in the 200-lap race. Today The track struggled in the early years of the 21st century, often failing town inspection. It was closed for most of the 2010 season, but was permitted by the town of Epping to be open for three days at the end of October, subject to the completion of required repairs to the facility. In 2008, Bobby MacArthur took over the management, renamed the speedway \\"All- STAR\\", and promoted a very aggressive and diverse program including Supermodifieds, Modifieds and Late Models. Unfortunately, the promotion did not draw enough fans to be successful, leaving the track and promoter seriously in the red. Owner Bob Webber has been operating the track since the departure of MacArthur and has made many improvements.

Despite its key, the left hand voice often plays C minor passages, while the right hand plays relatively consistently within the bounds of E major, giving the piece a unique tone colour. Structural analysis The piece begins with a gentle left hand melody in C minor accompanied by distinctly major right hand block chords. The frequent major ninths and major sevenths contribute luxurious tone colour of the piece. In the eighth bar, a chromatic scale rises back up to the C to repeat the first four bars of the initial melody. This time, a triplet with a dotted rhythm is employed as an additional counterpoint in the right hand. In the thirteenth bar, we see further development of the melody, using sweeping but short crescendos and decrescendos. The next four bars act as a bridge to the second section at bar 17, where a soaring tenor melody is accompanied by luscious harmonies in the right hand. This section continues until the 30th bar, when an A-major chord is played but then, when the pedal lifts, only the third C is heard, and the initial melody is repeated, using the right hand harmony from the ninth bar. The piece ends with three block chords, in a very powerful dominant cadence, with the concluding E-major chord, arpeggiated.

Background Bigge was born at Benton House, Northumberland, England, the son of Thomas Charles Bigge, High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1780. He was educated at Newcastle Grammar School and Westminster School (1795), and in 1797 entered Christ Church, Oxford (B.A., 1801; M.A., 1804). Bigge was called to the Bar in 1806 and was appointed Chief Judge of Trinidad in 1814, a post he held for the next four years. The Bigge Inquiry Since 1817, Lord Bathurst had wanted to examine whether transportation was an effective deterrent to crime. The commissioner may also have been appointed in response to complaints to London from leaders of the community of free settlers including John Macarthur. On 5 January 1819, Bigge was appointed a special commissioner to examine the government of the Colony of New South Wales by Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. His brief was to determine how far the expanding colony of New South Wales could be \\"made adequate to the Objects of its original Institution\\", which were understood to be purely to be a penal colony. He was to come to Australia to investigate all aspects of the colonial government, then under the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, including finances, the church and the judiciary, and the convict system. Together with his secretary Thomas Hobbes Scott, Bigge arrived in Sydney on 26 September 1819, by the ship John Barry. Bigge finished gathering evidence February 1821 and on 10 February, sailed back to England aboard the ship Dromedary. While Bigge was in Australia, there was noticeable friction between himself and Governor Macquarie and he spent much time in the company of the Macarthurs. Bigge's first report was published in June 1822 and his second and third reports in 1823. Elements of Bigge's reports criticised Governor Macquarie's administration including his emancipist policy, expenditure on public works and management of convicts. Macquarie answered criticisms to the secretary of state, Lord Bathurst in 1822. Bigge's reports are now viewed as not showing sufficient detachment and, although there were many excellent recommendations, there were also trifling recommendations and hyper-critical detail. Many of the recommendations from Bigge's second report were incorporated into the New South Wales Act 1823, which reformed the colony's government and judicial system. It also provided for a separate administration for Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Bigge's third report was the most impartial and least contentious. It afforded a generally clear picture of farming and grazing in the Sydney district and west of the Blue Mountains. It did not sufficiently acknowledge the important developments of the Illawarra district and tended to suggest falsely that agriculture was drooping under Macquarie. Otherwise it was well presented and included useful accounts of the state of revenue, trade and the country's economic position. In 1824, Governor Brisbane approved the sale of crown land in accordance with one of Bigge's recommendations. Previously only a nominal quit rent was required for grants by the crown. The establishment of the limits of location, also known as the Nineteen Counties, also resulted from Bigge's recommendations. From 1823, Bigge was given a similar appointment to examine the government of the Cape Colony, Mauritius and Ceylon. Death The arduousness of travel and climate tolled heavily on Bigge after he suffered a leg injury in falling from his horse at the Cape, for which, it is reported, he was treated by a transgender male doctor who turned out to be a quack. In 1829 he had returned to England for the last time. He continued in poor health and was too indisposed to accept a position to report on clerical establishments in 1832. He never married and lived a solitary life in retirement until his accidental death on 22 December 1843 at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. He was buried as directed by his will \\"without ceremony or superfluous expense\\". His nephews Frederick William Bigge and Francis Edward Bigge were pioneer pastoralists in Queensland.

DuBois historical pageant “The Star of Ethiopia\\" was designed to appeal to mass audiences and was a large scaled presentation structured as a prologue and five scenes: # The Gift of Iron, begins with the prehistoric black men who gave to the world the gift of his own invention the welding iron. # The Dream of Egypt, depicts Ethiopia, as the Mother of Men, then leads the mystic procession of historic events past the glory of ancient Egypt, showcasing Africa as the center of art and commerce with the splendid kingdoms of the Sudan and Zymbabwe # The Glory of Egypt, the evolution of human conflict # The Valley of Humiliation, Diaspora and the tragedy of the American slave trade with the resistance to oppression. # The Vision Everlasting highlighting African-Americans in various professional roles Up from slavery slowly . . . the black race writhes back to life and hope. . . on which the Star of Ethiopia gleams forever. Referencing the arts for African Americans, DuBois would write, “This is the dawn of the day for the colored playwright and the colored actor…but we must all be ready to foster and appreciate everything that can give us an entrance into the world beautiful of art.” DuBois, W.E.B.

Pageants in general were not financially successful resulting in difficulty securing suitable financial funding for the pageant movement as DuBois had hoped, writing disappointedly regarding the pageant movement he stated, “the white public has shown little or no interest in the movement. The American pageant Association has been silent…within my own race the usual petty but hurting insinuations of personal greed and selfishness…” DuBois, W.E.B.

He set out to sail around the world alone as a teenager in the summer of 1965. National Geographic magazine carried the story in installments (October 1968, April 1969, October 1970), and he co-wrote a book, titled Dove, detailing his journey. Graham had sailed alone from California to Hawaii on July 21, 1965. At the age of sixteen, he continued heading west in his 24-foot sloop. He was originally given two kittens for company (Joliette and Suzette), and kept two or three cats throughout the entire journey (ending his travels with Kili, Pooh, and Piglet). He married along the way and, after almost five years, ended his journey in Los Angeles. He and his wife, Patti Ratterree, briefly attended Stanford University, then settled in Montana. Graham's book about his voyage, Dove, was published in 1972. His voyage was depicted in a film, The Dove (1974). A follow-up book, Home Is The Sailor, was published in 1983.  The route  = Pacific leg = After a shakedown cruise from San Pedro, California, to Hawaii, Dove left Ala Wai Harbor in Honolulu on September 14, 1965. Graham's first landfall was 14 days later at Fanning Island, a British- controlled atoll. His next planned stop was Pago Pago on the Island of Tutuila in American Samoa. A fierce squall dismasted Dove and left her unable to reach Pago Pago. Under jury rig, Dove set course for Apia on Upolu, Western Samoa. Five months later the repaired Dove sailed to Pago Pago to wait out the hurricane season. On May 1, 1966, Graham sailed Dove to the Vavaʻu Group in Tonga. On June 21, Dove sailed to Fiji: first to Fulanga in the Lau Group, then Kabara and then on to Suva in the Viti Levu Group. Dove next made its way through the Yasawa Group, including the Naviti, Waialailai, Waia, Nalawauki, Tavewa, and Yasawa islands. It was in Fiji that he met the future Patti Graham (born c. 1944), a fellow American traveler who was \\"stopping to work at various places and living mainly by her wits.\\" On October 22, Dove set sail for the New Hebrides, arriving at the capital, Port Vila, four days later. On November 20, Dove pulled into Honiara on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. While in the Solomons, Robin visited Florida Island, Savo Island and Tulagi Island. After one of Doves slowest passages, landfall was made at Port Moresby, New Guinea on March 24, 1967. Dove left New Guinea on April 18 and arrived in Darwin, Australia on May 4. = Indian Ocean leg = On July 6, 1967, Graham sailed Dove out of Darwin and made in 18 days to reach Direction Island in the Cocos Islands. Eighteen hours out of the Cocos Islands, Dove was again dismasted during a brief storm. Graham sailed under jury rig for to reach Port Louis Harbor, Mauritius. After repairs, Dove made for Réunion Island and then sailed to Durban, South Africa, arriving there on October 21. Graham spent nine months in South Africa, calling on ports along the southern edge of the continent including East London, South Africa, Port Elizabeth, Plettenberg Bay, Knysna, Stilbaai, Struisbaai, Gordon's Bay and finally Cape Town. He married his girlfriend and went on a honeymoon at Kruger National Park. = Atlantic Ocean leg = On July 13, 1968, Dove left Cape Town and sailed toward the northern coast of South America. On August 5, Dove made landfall in Clarence Bay, Ascension Island. A week later, Graham sailed Dove out of Clarence Bay and towards Suriname. On August 31, Dove sailed up the Suriname River to the city of Paramaribo. On October 12, 1968, Dove sailed out of the mouth of the Suriname River and headed to Barbados. After a month in Barbados, Graham's new boat, Return of Dove, was sailed down Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Graham sailed Dove from Barbados to Saint Thomas and sold her before continuing his trip in the bigger Return of Dove on November 20, 1969. Eight days later, Graham reached the San Blas Islands, where he spent two months exploring. After spending Christmas and New Year's Day in Cristobal in the Canal Zone, Return of Dove sailed through the Panama Canal with Robin, Patti and the mandatory Panama Canal Company pilot aboard and reaching Balboa on January 17, 1970. Robin then visited the Galapagos Islands. In April 1970 he ended his voyage at Long Beach, CA where had started from 1,739 days and 30,600 miles earlier.  After the journey  About two months after ending his trip, Graham's daughter, Quimby, was born. He attended Stanford University for a semester. Graham and his wife sold the Maverick automobile that Ford Motor Company had given him and used the money to buy a retired postal van. They moved to a mountain property near Kalispell, Montana where they built a log home. In 1972 they moved closer to town and started building a larger log home. The skills learned led Graham to pursue a career as a builder and furniture maker. He and his wife had a second child, a son named Ben. In 1982, he helped skipper a sailboat delivery from Hawaii to California with his father, Lyle, in the crew. This trip helped cement a reconciliation between the two. Their relationship had been strained since near the end of the attempted circumnavigation and started recovering when Lyle helped with the construction of one of Robin's homes. Web site. In 1983 with co-author Derek Gill, Graham wrote a follow-up book titled Home is the Sailor.

On reaching the Caribbean, Dove was replaced by Return of Dove, a 33-foot Allied Luders sloop.Dove web site. Dove remained in and was sailed about the British Virgin Islands after Graham sold her. She sank in Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The Return of Dove was found in Hawaii by Mark and Beverly Langley in 2000. They restored her in 2001.

I wasn't going to tell them.\\" \\"They're speaking French and all of a sudden one guy wants to buy our motor. Another one wanted to buy the rear end. Somebody else bought the transmission. Then somebody else bought the body, frame and roll bars. We came home with an empty trailer\\" said Mr. Silva. Silva built himself a new racer the next week. Silva had offers to race for big-money NASCAR teams, but he turned them down because he wanted to be his own boss. Ollie joined forces for several years with legendary and current car owner Vic Miller in a unique 01 Supermodified which was very successful. One of his last SuperModified rides was in the Clyde Booth \\"nine\\" car. =Notable event wins= Ollie once lapped the entire field twice at the 1974 Hott Wheels 100 All-Star race at the New London-Waterford Speedbowl. He was a multi-time winner of Star Speedway's International Super Modified Classic. Notable championships Silva won NESMRA New England Super-Modified Racing Association championships at Star Speedway in 1967, 1968, and 1978. He won Can-Am Classics championships in 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1974. Silva was the four-time champion at the U.S. Winter Nationals. Silva claimed the 1972 World Series at Thompson Speedway. His career nearly ended in 1978 when he was seriously injured racing at the Monadnock Speedway in New Hampshire driving a modified with the steering wheel on the right side. He returned for a short while in 1980. Legacy Ollie died in 2004, and his memory has been preserved with the annual \\"Ollie Silva Classic\\" at the Lee USA Speedway. \\"NOKIE FORNORO IN EXCITING OLLIE SILVA MEMORIAL WIN AT LEE USA\\" For the first event, locals built a replica of one of Ollie's 1960s \\"Big O\\" coupe modifieds.

He was known for his catchy phrases \\"That's the up-to-the-minute news, and up-to-the-minute that's all the news\\" at the end of his broadcast. He concluded the 5:00 PM news with a teaser, inviting viewers back to get the full story at the station's late evening news program, smiling his signature close, \\"News at ten, see ya then.\\" Biography Putnam was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota. His radio career began on his 20th birthday in 1934 at WDGY in Minneapolis, then continued in Washington, DC at WJSV and later, in New York City. While working in New York, influential newspaper columnist Walter Winchell declared that \\"George Putnam's voice is the greatest in radio.\\" From July 1949 to February 1951 tall, wavy- haired Putnam, known for his rich baritone voice, hosted the evening version of Broadway to Hollywood on the DuMont Television Network. Putnam began working in Los Angeles television in 1951, eventually hosting the highest- rated newscast. At one time or another, he anchored at all four of Los Angeles' major independent stations - KTTV, KTLA, KCOP, and KHJ-TV (now KCAL- TV). In addition to his salary, he was provided a Rolls-Royce automobile while at KTTV and KTLA. He was replaced by news legend Hal Fishman in 1975. Putnam long carried a grudge against Fishman, stating on his radio show Talk Back that he was back-stabbed by him. Putnam made this claim for decades. It is noteworthy that when Fishman produced KTLA's 50th anniversary history in television in 1997, footage of Putnam was not used, though Putnam had been the face of KTLA news in the 1960s and 1970s before the arrival of Fishman. During KTLA's 60th-anniversary special during Thanksgiving weekend in 2007, the KTLA News intro from when George Putnam anchored the news was shown;. Fishman died on August 7, 2007, three months before the 60th anniversary special aired. In 1965, Putnam narrated a film titled Perversion for Profit, in which he warned viewers about magazines containing nudity and homosexual material, saying homosexuals were perverted and misfits, as well as implying they were child molesters.Putnam, George. Perversion for Profit, accessed 28 February 2015 \\"...psychiatrists believe that prolonged exposure of even the normal [heterosexual] male adult to this type of publication [gay-themed magazines], though he may not be aware of its true nature, will nevertheless pervert [him]. Think then, of the consequences to the inexperienced youth, who in purchasing and studying this material, becomes a pawn for these misfits – these homosexuals [...] today's conquest, they [homosexuals] say, is tomorrow's competition. [an image of a young boy in a suggestive pose appears on screen] See the tender age at which homosexuals prefer their conquest!\\" The film was financed by Charles Keating. For his contribution to the television industry, George Putnam was awarded three Emmy awards as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6372 Hollywood Blvd. The late Ted Knight stated that Putnam served in part as a model for the Ted Baxter character in the 1970s television series The Mary Tyler Moore Show on CBS.. Putnam was also noted for his years of participation in the Rose Parade, having ridden in that event from 1951 until 2000, when his horse died. At the time, Putnam said that he was too advanced in age to train another Parade horse. Putnam lived and died at his working ranch in Chino. The ranch housed his sixty-five racehorses, which competed in the Kentucky Derby and all of the racetracks in Southern California. He also spent time at his home of fifty-seven years in Beverly Hills. Putnam was the host of Talk Back, a conservative radio show he hosted daily after leaving the television anchor chair in 1975. It was based at KIEV in Glendale, California (now KRLA) until 2001 and moved to KCAA 1050 in San Bernardino in 2002. Talk Back was distributed nationwide on the Cable Radio Network on CRN1. Although Putnam advocated many conservative viewpoints, he stated many times his status as a \\"lifelong Democrat\\" since his youthful admiration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In addition to political talk Putnam interviewed many people whom he knew in show business including Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Peggy Lee, Doris Day, Charlton Heston, John Wayne, Desi Arnaz, Milton Berle and many others. He and Lucille Ball were very close friends, as evidenced by her yearly in-person appearance on Talk Back on or around his birthday. Downtown Los Angeles workers were thrilled and surprised to see Ball making the walk through the underground level of Arco Plaza to Putnam's studio, often with her husband Gary Morton and no security detail. The studio was enclosed in see-through glass so that people visiting Arco Plaza could witness interviews and on occasion (as with Ball's appearances) ask questions of Putnam's guest. The studio was mainly built for Putnam by KIEV. Putnam is also credited with giving Blog reporter Matt Drudge his start. Putnam published the weekly column \\"One Reporter's Opinion\\" on the Web site NewsMax. One of his focuses was on illegal immigration from Mexico. Putnam received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College in 1985. Putnam had a cameo role as a TV news reporter or anchor in at least three films: Fourteen Hours (1951), I Want to Live! (1958) with Susan Hayward starring as accused murderer Barbara Graham, and the disaster film Independence Day (1996). In a June 12, 2008, e-mail to Putnam's Newsmax readers, it was announced that Putnam was in a Los Angeles hospital undergoing medical treatment on his liver and kidneys. In mid-July he took part in a special on-air 94th \\"birthday\\" show, in which actress Doris Day appeared by telephone, according to the Los Angeles Times. On September 12, 2008, Putnam died at Chino Valley Medical Center in Chino, California. His death was announced to Putnam's Newsmax.com readers. Upon Putnam's passing, the Los Angeles Times recalled the words of former President Richard M. Nixon in a 1984 roast of Putnam given by KTTV to celebrate Putnam's 50th anniversary in broadcasting: \\"Some people didn't like what he said; some people liked what he said. But everybody listened to George Putnam. That is why he has been one of the most influential commentators of our times.\\" See also * Perversion for Profit References External links One Reporter's Opinion at NewsMax.com * Los Angeles News Icon George Putnam Dies at 94 (videos). 1914 births 2008 deaths People from Breckenridge, Minnesota American columnists American radio personalities American television reporters and correspondents Bates College alumni California Democrats Television anchors from Los Angeles American anti-communists ","title":"George Putnam (newsman)"},{"id":"2836316","text":"\\"There's a New Sound\\" is a 1953 novelty song by Tony Burrello and Tom Murray. Burrello, a songwriter and jazz pianist, and Murray started writing novelty songs after they were unsuccessful in having their more serious-minded songs recorded by prominent musicians. They noted the success of music that was seemingly intentionally bad, after hearing a disc jockey play Harry Stewart's version of \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\" sung in Japanese and featuring a geisha orchestra. According to Murray, the disc jockey said that the record was one of the top hits but also \\"one of the most horrible records he had ever heard\\". Horrible Records issue H 100 Burrello and Murray responded by creating the songs \\"There's a New Sound\\" performed by Burello and \\"Fish\\" sung by Leona Anderson, which they released as a single. The former song's lyrics consist of a single chorus repeated five times, each time at a higher pitch. The lyrics describe a \\"new sound ... the strangest sound that you have ever heard\\", which turns out to be \\"the sound that's made by worms\\". Burrello was credited as the artist on the single, which was released on Burrello and Murray's own record label, Horrible, as catalog numbers H 100 (ten-inch 78 rpm format) and H 100-X45 (seven-inch 45 rpm format). It was the Horrible label's first and only release. When Billboard magazine reviewed the single, it commented, \\"A weird one. 'The new sound is the sound made by worms.' Strange sound effects go with nonsense lyric. It's a studied attempt to be as screwy as possible. Quien Sabe?\\" For the flip side, \\"Fish\\", Billboard′s review was \\"Same comment\\". Burrello and Murray originally had only 500 copies of \\"There's a New Sound\\"/\\"Fish\\" issued, to be sent to disc jockeys as a protest record. However, within two weeks, they received orders for more than 100,000 copies of the single. Soon afterward, Burrello and Murray were called upon to write a song for Brucie Weil, who was then 6 years old. The song they wrote for Weil, \\"God Bless Us All\\", reached #18 on the Billboard singles chart. Burrello and Murray were soon called upon to write music for other artists, including a theme song for John Conte and special material for Tony Bennett. Anderson went on to exploit her newfound fame as a \\"horrible\\" musician (the schtick was a parody of opera singers who, in Anderson's opinion, could never \\"kid themselves properly (or) let their voices go\\") by making appearances on The Ernie Kovacs Show and signing with Columbia Records for two more singles.

It was first held in Oxford in January 1992, subsequently being held in summer each year. Loosely based on a theme, each year's event offers panels and workshops related to small press comics along with the opportunity to buy and sell them. There is also a significant social aspect. CAPTION is currently the longest-running comics convention in Britain. CAPTION differs from other conventions by breaking down the distinction between named guests and other attendees, avoiding segregation or special treatment of guests. In addition it prioritizes the social interaction of attendees by encouraging comics creators to place their publications on the CAPTION stall, managed by a rota of volunteers. History CAPTION was founded in 1992 by Adrian Cox, Damian Cugley, Jeremy Dennis, and Jenni Scott. Between 1992 and 2003 CAPTION took place in the Oxford Union Society. Ed Pinsent was an early star of CAPTION conventions, selling his Fast Fiction on his stall.

It is marked at Andante. It has two sections of mysterious major seventh intervals and tritone harmonies, split up by a lyrical E major section. Like many of Scriabin's slower pieces, it is played very rubato. Structural analysis The first section is, as mentioned, very mysterious, as Scriabin employs many tritones and seventh intervals which do not fall into the key of C minor. The first 8 bars feature modulations to D minor and F minor. The ninth bar, marked con anima, introduces an E major melody using more conventional harmonies, but the piece only delves yet again deeper into the depths of the mystery four bars later. Here, marked fortississimo, the initial melody comes out in full force using the broad tessitura scope of the piano. At the seventeenth bar, the piece calms to quiet block chords of F minor, C minor-7, and B major-9 (without the bass B), finally resolving to an arpeggiated final C-minor chord, reminiscent of the ninth prelude immediately preceding this one. This shows Scriabin's ability to find commonality in his most diverse works. Recordings One of the critically acclaimed performances of this piece is that of Mikhail Pletnev on his disc Scriabin: 24 Preludes/Sonatas 4 & 10.

She is portrayed by Grace Park. Two prominent Number Eight copies serving as Galactica pilots are Sharon Valerii and Sharon Agathon, using the call signs \\"Boomer\\" and \\"Athena\\", respectively. Notable copies Cylon models Six and Eight are the most common in the series. Many Number Eight copies have been seen in various roles, including leadership positions; two are featured as central characters — Boomer and Athena. =Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii= Life on Caprica and Galactica Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii is a Cylon sleeper agent programmed with false memories of being raised in the mining colony Troy by parents Katherine and Abraham Valerii, who supposedly died in an accident that wiped out the colony population. Before the mini- series, Boomer and Galen Tyrol are romantically involved, which is against military protocol due to their ranks. Her programming leads her to black out and sabotage the Galactica on several occasions, which Tyrol unwittingly abets by hiding evidence implicating her. In \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", Commander Adama sends Boomer on a mission to destroy the Cylon basestar orbiting Kobol; and after her return, she shoots Adama twice in the chest, putting him in a coma and revealing her nature to the crew. Death and resurrection While Boomer is in the brig, Gaius Baltar manipulates her into revealing how many other Cylons are hidden in the fleet. While Boomer is being transported from the brig, Cally shoots and kills her. In \\"Downloaded\\", Boomer's consciousness is downloaded into a new body in Cylon-occupied Caprica. She resists being identified with the Cylon cause despite being viewed as a hero alongside Caprica Six, and both she and Six decide to try to persuade the Cylons to reduce hostility against humans. Later in the series, Boomer appears among the Cylons occupying New Caprica as a member of the Cylon governing council controlling the human puppet government. Relation to Hera Agathon and second death In \\"The Eye of Jupiter\\", Boomer attempts to care for Athena's hybrid child Hera on the Cylon base ship, where the child ended up after the New Caprica evacuation. In a conflict with the visiting Athena over whether the humans negotiated in good faith, Boomer is killed by Caprica Six for endangering the child. Second resurrection and relation with John Cavil After resurrecting again, Boomer develops a relationship with John Cavil, a Number One who embraces his machine nature and sees human traits as a weakness. Cavil enlists Boomer's support when the Cylon models become deadlocked in a vote over whether the Raiders should be lobotomized. Boomer also follows Cavil in his plan to destroy the opposing Cylons despite her doubts. Relation to Ellen Tigh and return to Galactica Boomer is the only other Cylon who knows that their creator, Ellen Tigh, is being held prisoner by Cavil. When Cavil threatens to cut open Ellen's brain in order to access her knowledge about Resurrection technology, Boomer helps Ellen escape, but is immediately imprisoned after disembarking on the Galactica. She escapes with the help of Tyrol, who is motivated by sentimentality. Kidnapping of Hera Agathon While fleeing the Galactica, Boomer impersonates Athena to kidnap Hera and bring her to Cavil for study. Final death On her way to Cavil, Boomer bonds with Hera, which leads to her turning against Cavil during the Colonial assault on the Cylon colony. After returning Hera to Athena and Helo, who were part of the boarding party, Boomer dies her final death when Athena shoots her. Dual personality mode Battlestar Galactica: The Plan reveals that the Cavil aboard the Galactica used an elephant figurine to trigger Boomer's sleeper nature. The self-aware Boomer reveals that her feelings for Tyrol and Admiral Adama were genuine and that she prefers her human personality. Some supporting characters believe that it was due to this conflict that when she shot Adama, she purposely aimed so that his death was not guaranteed. =Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon = Cylon- occupied Caprica A self-aware Number Eight first appears in the series on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where she impersonates the original Sharon and helps Karl 'Helo' Agathon to further a Cylon experiment that relies on having him fall in love with her. She eventually falls genuinely in love with Helo and tries to help him escape, during which he discovers her true identity. Sharon reveals that she is pregnant with his child, the first known successful attempt at a Cylon/human hybrid. While searching for a way off planet, the two encounter Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, who is on a mission to retrieve an important artefact. In a scuffle with Starbuck, Sharon flees in Starbuck's captured Cylon Raider, but later returns to help rescue Starbuck from a Cylon facility. Return to the Colonial Fleet Sharon uses her knowledge of the Tomb of Athena on Kobol as leverage to avoid immediate execution and consistently demonstrates her loyalty by defending the group from Cylon ambushes. Sharon's reunion with the Galactica personnel is tense due to Boomer's history with them, but she makes it clear that she is a separate consciousness and a different person from Boomer. Despite this, most of the crew still do not trust her. Sharon continues to act to defend the fleet against Cylon attacks, though she remains conflicted about her role in the destruction of her people. Pregnancy and birth Upon finding out about Sharon's pregnancy, President Roslin orders it terminated but rescinds her decision when the fetal blood successfully cures her terminal cancer. Sharon gives birth to her child prematurely and names her Hera. The Colonial administration decides it is too dangerous to let a hybrid child be raised by a Cylon mother, so they fake the child's death and rehome her with a human mother. Despite the strain this puts on Sharon's loyalty, she continues to help the Galactica.  Post-occupation of New Caprica  Sharon and Helo are married in the year-long gap in events between Season 2 and Season 3, and, having earned the full trust of Admiral Adama, Sharon is sworn in as an officer in the Colonial Fleet at Boomer's rank of Lieutenant JG. She is sent back to New Caprica as the liaison between the Galactica fleet and the resistance effort, and, due to the inability of the Centurions to recognize individuals within the humanoid Cylon models, is able to infiltrate the Cylon base and steal the keys for the civilian ships. After the successful rescue mission, Sharon receives a new call sign: Athena. During Colonial negotiations with the Cylons, Athena and Helo learn their daughter is still alive on a Cylon ship. Athena travels to the ship and retrieves her daughter, prompting a conflict with Boomer that results in Boomer being killed again. Visions of daughter Hera Sharon discovers that she, Hera, President Roslin, and Caprica Six are all sharing the same recurring vision in which they are chasing Hera, who is running away into the arms of a Number Six individual. The vision prompts Athena to kill an ambassador Number Six, Natalie, out of fear, nearly causing a diplomatic incident. Hera becomes \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\", meaning that all modern-day humans are descended from Athena. =Other Number Eight versions= * One of a group of Twos, Fives, and Sixes at Ragnar Anchorage after the fleet strands \\"Aaron Doral\\" * One wearing a white coat at the Spaceport at Delphi, whom Athena kills before the other Eight can shoot Helo ** One can assume that the Number Eight in the audience watching D'Anna Biers's documentary is the same one Athena shot, due to the visual cue of the same white coat * Multiple naked copies aboard the Kobol- orbiting basestar that Boomer was sent to destroy * Copies who act as \\"midwives\\" in the respective resurrections of Caprica Six and Boomer * Several copies on Cylon-occupied Caprica going through daily life in the episode \\"Downloaded\\" * Copies killed when Samuel Anders and Galen Tyrol detonate a bomb near a Cylon Heavy Raider * A copy sitting next to Boomer in a meeting on Colonial One (during the New Caprican occupation), when the suicide bombings are discussed. * Several on the basestar where Caprica Six and Baltar reside * Several copies dying aboard a diseased basestar, including one taken prisoner by the Colonial boarding party * Several who approach Athena on the rebel basestar, asking her to lead a rebellion against the Sixes (their allies) * One shot and killed by a Centurion while attempting to unplug the Hybrid * One who had downloaded Athena's memories and helped Helo bring back D'Anna.

They also have a propensity for fickleness and change loyalties to better suit their own desires, with the notable exception of Athena. Director Ron Moore has commented that the Eights are more likely to \\"shoot things they don't like,\\" and early in the series, they are implied to be the most militaristic of the models and the most likely to have combat training. Unlike some other Cylon models, the individual Eights do not automatically have access to each other's memories and consciousnesses, which gives them a stronger ability to form distinct identities. Caprica showrunner Kevin Murphy said that, had the prequel series Caprica continued, it would have revealed that the Eights' default personality was modelled after that of Tamara Adama. Call sign origins The call signs for both Sharons hail back to the original Battlestar Galactica series. Boomer was the name (not the call sign) of a Viper pilot character played by Herbert Jefferson, Jr., while Athena was the name of Commander Adama's daughter.

His father acquired l'Hotel des Quatre-Saisons in Toulouse, with his son as a chef – the beginning of an illustrious career. He apprenticed at the Grand Hôtel of Paris and the Hotel d'Angleterre of Cauterets, then worked at various restaurants in Paris and San Remo, and the Hôtel de Paris of Monte Carlo. In 1900, he returned to Paris and was chef of the Pavillon d'Armenonville, the Pavillon Ledoyen, and finally the Grand Hotel where he stayed for 10 years.

It is housed in the former United States pavilion constructed for Expo 67 located within the grounds of Parc Jean-Drapeau on Saint Helen's Island. The museum's geodesic dome was designed by Buckminster Fuller.  History  Biosphere at the sunset. In August 1990, Environment Canada purchased the site for $17.5 million to turn it into an interactive museum showcasing and exploring the water ecosystems of the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River regions. The museum was inaugurated in 1995 as a water museum, and is a set of enclosed buildings designed by Éric Gauthier, inside the original steel skeleton. The Biosphère changed its name in 2007 to become an environment museum. It offers interactive activities and presents exhibitions about the major environmental issues related to water, climate change, air, ecotechnologies, and sustainable development. = 1976 fire = In the afternoon of 20 May 1976, during structural renovations, a fire burned away the building's transparent acrylic bubble, but the hard steel truss structure remained. The site remained closed until 1990. Pavilion The museum is housed in the former pavilion built by the United States for Expo 67. The architect of the geodesic dome was Buckminster Fuller. The building originally formed an enclosed structure of steel and acrylic cells, in diameter and high. It is a Class 1 (icosahedral, as differentiated from Class 2 domes, which are dodecahedral, and Class 3 ones, which are tetrahedral), 32-frequency, double-layer dome, in which the inner and outer layers are connected by a latticework of struts. (There has occasionally been confusion in mistakenly referring to this as a 16-frequency dome due to the fact that there are 15 hexagonal polygons from each pentagonally polygonal vertex of this icosahedral polyhedron to the adjacent vertex. However, the standard for measuring dome frequency is the number of triangles from vertex to vertex. Since there are two triangles from one side to the opposite side of a hexagon, there are actually 30 triangles from the edge of each pentagonal vertex in this dome to the next, plus the triangle that comprises one-fifth of the pentagonal vertex at each end of the length from one vertex to the adjacent vertex: totaling 32 triangles from the center of each vertex to the center of the next vertex.) A complex system of shades was used to control its internal temperature. The sun-shading system was an attempt by the architect to reflect the same biological processes that the human body relies on to maintain its internal temperature. Fuller's original idea for the geodesic dome was to incorporate \\"pores\\" into the enclosed system, further likening it to the sensitivity of human skin, but the shading system failed to work properly and was eventually disabled. Architects from Golden Metak Productions designed the interior exhibition space. Visitors had access to four themed platforms divided into seven levels. The building included a escalator, the longest ever built at the time. The Minirail monorail ran through the pavilion.  In popular culture  The structure was used prominently in the original Battlestar Galactica television series episode \\"Greetings from Earth\\". Scenes for Robert Altman's post-apocalyptic ice age film Quintet were shot on site as well. The Biosphere appears in the 2003 animated Jacob Two-Two TV episode \\"Jacob Two-Two and the Notorious Knit Knapper\\", in which it is used as the headquarters for a group of seniors who plan on knitting a giant tea cosy to cover Montreal. The Biosphere made an appearance during the finales of The Amazing Race: Family Edition and The Amazing Race Canada 4. The Biosphere appears in the game Civilization VI (in the New Frontiers DLC) as a World Wonder, where it increases the appeal of marsh and rainforest tiles, and boosts power and tourism.

It is the second in the Ring series, and a film based on the book was released in 1998. The English translation of the book was published by Vertical Press in the United States and by Harper Collins in Britain. Plot The events in the story occur a day after the events of the first book. It introduces Ando Mitsuo, a coroner still struggling with his son's death, being assigned to do the autopsy of his old classmate, Ryūji Takayama. He and his colleague, Miyashita, find a tumor in Ryūji's heart, which is believed to be his cause of death. Puzzled as the tumor appears similar to smallpox (which was eradicated thirty years previously), Ando completes the autopsy and, upon finding newspaper poking through a suture, is reminded of Ryūji's cryptography hobby. Finding the newspaper numbers interesting, he decodes them and finds they spell \\"RING\\", perplexing Ando. In search for the message's meaning, Ando soon meets Ryūji's assistant and lover, Mai Takano. Mentioning a videotape Ryūji watched before dying, Mai believes it is connected to his death through a curse. Learning of Kazuyuki Asakawa, Ryūji's friend and the protagonist of Ring, Ando considers speaking to him, only to learn Asakawa and his family were involved in a car accident. Finding Asakawa is the sole survivor and catatonic, Ando investigates relevant evidence and learns that his wife and child were dead well before the car crashed, and that a tape recorder and word processor were in the vehicle. Trying to reach Mai, Ando finds her missing and investigates her seemingly abandoned condominium; he finds what he believes to be a copy of the supposedly cursed videotape, albeit almost entirely recorded over, and believes an unknown entity is hiding somewhere in the condo. Learning Asakawa's tape deck and word processor went to his next of kin, Ando retrieves the word processor from his brother and copies the files. Finding a document about the videotape, Ando reads that the curse spreads through a tape and can only be stopped by copying and sharing it with someone else; despite disputing the files as pseudoscientific, Ando and Miyashita continue reading into them, and discover that the Ring Virus started with the murder of psychic Sadako Yamamura. Additionally, Miyashita soon discovers a virus connects all the victims and comes in two forms: a ring-shaped virus which kills the host, and a broken version of the same virus (similar to a sperm cell) which is dormant. A week after Mai's disappearance, her corpse is found in the ventilation shaft of a barely used office building. Additionally, despite having given no physical indication that she was pregnant, Mai's corpse shows signs she gave birth prior to her death. Upon visiting the crime scene, Ando meets a beautiful woman named Masako who introduces herself as Mai's older sister. After having sex with Masako, Ando later receives a fax containing information on Sadako from Miyashita, only to realize Masako is identical to Sadako. Believing that Masako is Sadako reborn, Ando receives a note from her explaining that Mai was infected with the second \\"sperm\\" ring virus which targeted her womb; this allowed Sadako to conceive herself within Mai and control her, before birthing herself within a week and disposing of Mai's corpse. Also revealing the Ring Virus can also spread through literary descriptions, Sadako has ensured Asakawa's brother is able to publish a book on Kazuyuki's files, allowing the virus to spread internationally. She then concludes that Ando is infected with the dormant virus and, should he interfere in any way, she will activate it and kill him; conversely, in exchange for Ando's co-operation, Sadako will resurrect Ando's dead son. Finally learning Ryūji worked with Sadako to ensure her resurrection, Ando realizes Ryūji deliberately influenced himself and Mai. By supernaturally causing the paper code to appear to Ando and making Mai watch the tape when she was most fertile, Ryūji was the mastermind behind the plan, doing so to be spared and revived by Sadako. An epilogue shows Ando playing with his son, Takanori, whereupon Ryūji arrives and implies he acted for the greater good. Adaptations A film of the same title was released in 1998 which was based on the book. It was poorly received and later another sequel to the 1998 Ring film was made, Ring 2. A 13-episode TV drama was broadcast in 1999 on Fuji Television.

The island is about and the total population is about 5000, of which an unusual proportion are deaf (5 in 1,000). It is believed that the sign language emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century. Brief sociological studies have suggested that deaf people on the island are regarded as inferior in mental ability; hearing people do not discuss complex ideas with them, and they hold a marginalized social position. Perhaps consequently, PISL is rather simplistic in comparison to other sign languages. Another possibility for the state of the language is that few deaf people communicate directly, meaning that almost all signing is mediated by the hearing population.

A wool bale is a standard sized and weighted pack of classed wool compressed by the mechanical means of a wool press. This is the regulation required method of packaging for wool, to keep it uncontaminated and readily identifiable. A \\"bale of wool\\" is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets. Sign for the Woolpack public house, Fishbourne, West Sussex, showing the historic form of the modern wool bale The minimum weight of a bale is . Wool packs Packaging of wool has not changed much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from jute, prior to the use of synthetic fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia, In South Africa woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost. Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a label sewn onto the top flap of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale of wool packs contains 50 packs that measure x and have flaps. History Wool bales at the broker's store in 1900. Very early wool presses were made from wood boards and had a wire winch mechanism to compress the wool and also hollow logs where the wool was tramped into a pack. During the late 19th century various forms of wooden wool press became the standard. Most popular models were the Koerstz and the Ferrier. The Koerstz was a smaller press than the Ferrier. The Ferrier press was manufactured under license by Humble & Nicholson (later Humble & Sons), Geelong, Victoria, and they had sold 2,000 presses between about 1871 and 1918. These presses were distributed throughout Australia, but were also sent overseas to New Zealand, South America, and North Africa.Register of Ferrier wool presses manufactured between 1861 and 1963 The most popular wool press in New Zealand was the Donalds Wool Press which was manufactured under Patent. The steel Ajax wool presses were also used. Wool pressing with a manual wool press was hard, tiring work that required tramping the wool into a box and then pressing it further with a manually operated lever activated cable. Nowadays power operated, self-pinning wool presses with inbuilt scales have made a major contribution to shearing shed productivity. Wool bales have been transported by camel, horse teams, bullock wagons, paddle steamer, boats and later by rail and trucks. Method A hand operated wool press in action, circa 1900. Pressing and branding are typically carried out by a wool presser in the larger shearing sheds. In small sheds, the pressing may be done by the woolclasser, wool handler or sheep owner. A wool presser may perform the combined duties of wool pressing and penning up the sheep for the shearers. The latter arrangement means less interruption to the flow of the wool across the table and into the wool bins. The woolclasser oversees the duties of the wool presser during the entire shearing. The presser ensures that the wool pack is free of any contaminants before he places it into the wool press and secures it there. He then carries the wool from the selected wool bin, removing any contamination, before placing it into the press. It takes about 60 skirted fleeces to fill a wool bale, depending on the size and age of the sheep. The presser closes the bale with four internal and five external metal bale fasteners, before weighing the bale, if the press does not have an inbuilt scale. Bales should weigh between and , unless the wool is under 18.6 microns, in which case they may be a minimum gross weight of . Bales that weigh less than are known as a butt and those over will not be sold at auction without repacking at the vendor's expense. The maximum wool bale length is . Overlong bales may create problems with over wide loads when trucking, in brokers' stores and in the jamming of dumping equipment. The presser is responsible for completing the wool book and then branding the bale head and face with the owner's brand, contents description, number and wool classer ID. Purpose Wool for auction - traditionally displayed wool bales in the foreground, with samples in boxes at rear. Wool bales at Devon & Cornwall Wools Ltd, South Molton, Devon, England. Each bale contains of graded wool (approx. 110 fleeces), wrapped in plastic and tied by wire. Dimensions: x x Following shearing at the farm, woollen fleeces are placed together in \\"sheets\\", that is to say large sacks containing about 20 rolled fleeces each. These sheets are bulky yet are light (weighing about ) and convenient for the small farmer to transport to his local wool collection centre. Here they are opened for grading and sorting into one of several dozen different qualities, based on breed of sheep, which dictates fineness of wool, and physical condition of the wool, for example damp dirty or stained fleeces will be graded lowly. Once a sufficient volume of fleeces of a particular grade has filled a grading bin, the wool is compressed into a bale by a packing machine, producing a single bale equivalent to the capacity of some 5 1/2 wool sheets, a weight of . Such bales are most economical for shipping purposes, but clearly require mechanised lifting equipment. The collection process for wool in England has remained the same for many centuries. Shepherds brought their fleeces to a local collection point, for example Chipping Camden for wool from the Cotswolds, where it would be graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English Lord Chancellor to sit on the so-called Woolsack from which he presides over the House of Lords. This seat is therefore not in reality a \\"sack\\", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's \\"sheet\\", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises. Sale of wool Most Australian wool is sold at auction sales in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle which are conducted by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX). Renowned Australian Brands like Merino & Co. use specialist woolgrowers from the Australian Wool Network and are known for their high quality and taking care to grow and select wool to exacting standards and specifications. Their merino wool products cover a wide range of clothing, from men's thermal underwear to merino wool winter skirts. There are about 80 brokers and agents throughout Australia. Bales of wool in the Victoria, Australia, stand at the Paris Exhibition 1867. After transportation by rail or road to the woolbroker's store, each wool bale's brand is carefully inspected to see that it corresponds with the classer's report. It is then weighed by sworn weighers (this weight is marked on the bale and recorded and is the basis on which buyers are invoiced), and then core sampled. This sample will then be tested for micron, yield and vegetable matter as a minimum. Wool that is to be sold by sample has a minimum of one grab, of a specified weight, taken from each bale and a minimum of 20 grabs, from each lot. Speciality wool is often traditionally displayed in original wool bales with the test results displayed. Wool not sold by the traditional display system will be directed to various parts in the warehouse for stacking and storing. An index is maintained showing the location of all bales so that, when their turn of offering-which is based on the equitable method of order of receipt into store approaches, they may be easily found. The sale's programme in all centres is arranged, in the first place, by the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers after consultation with the buyers' organisations. Later, state allocation committees attend to details, such as individual sale dates and the quantity of wool to be offered by each broker in each series of sales at the centres concerned.\\"Wool and the Nation\\", Goldsbrough Mort & Co., 1955 The traditionally displayed bales of wool on the floor are opened for examination by the brokers, buyers and wool growers. The sale by sample lots will have their grab samples displayed in boxes across the show floor. Catalogues are prepared by the woolbroker which list all test and other details of each lot of wool. A valuation of every lot, based on current market rates, is also made by the brokers' staff, this being used by the growers as a guideline for the subsequent auction. The lots are sold by nominating each lot in turn and it is sold by open cry auction. After the wool is sold at auction the bales are usually “dumped”, i.e. compressed to a higher density, still in the original wool bale, for shipment to overseas mills in containers. Three bales that have been dumped and secured with a metal band are known as a “tri pack”.

During his stint at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1971 to 2004, he served as Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and held the position of President of the United Nations Security Council between January 2001 and May 2002. Between 2004 and 2017, he served as Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore. After stepping down, he served as a Senior Advisor at NUS during a nine-month sabbatical at various universities, including Harvard University's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. He is currently a Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute. In 2019, Mahbubani was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Early life and education Mahbubani, a Singaporean of Indian ancestry, was born in Singapore to a Sindhi-speaking Hindu family who settled in Singapore after being displaced from the province of Sindh in the erstwhile British India during the Partition of India. In his early years, he attended Tanjong Katong Technical School and completed his pre-university studies at St. Andrew's School. He was awarded the President's Scholarship in 1967 and graduated with a B.A. (first class honours) in philosophy from the University of Singapore in 1971. He received a M.A. in philosophy in 1976 and an honorary Ph.D. from Dalhousie University in 1995. Career =Public service= After his graduation in 1971, Mahbubani joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as a foreign service officer. His earlier postings included Cambodia, Malaysia and the United States. From 1993 to 1998, he held the position of Permanent Secretary at MFA. Later, he served as Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. In that role, he served as President of the United Nations Security Council in January 2001 and May 2002. =Academic career= Mahbubani's academic career began when he was appointed as the Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. He is also a Professor in the Practice of Public Policy. In addition, he was a fellow at the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University in 1991–92.

His latest book, Has China Won?, was published in 2020. In The Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One World, Mahbubani describes how the world has seen more positive change in the past 30 years than the past 300 years. By prescribing pragmatic solutions for improving the global order – including a 7-7-7 formula that may finally break the logjam in the United Nations Security Council – Mahbubani maps a road away from the geopolitical contours of the nineteenth century. The book was reviewed, including in the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The Great Convergence was selected as one of the Financial Times' books of 2013 and longlisted for the 2014 Lionel Gelber Prize. Mahbubani also writes regularly for Singapore's The Straits Times.

Vermehren converted to Roman Catholicism in 1939, shortly after his elder sister Isa, when he met the Countess Elisabeth von Plettenberg, a member of one of Germany's leading Catholic families. They married in October 1941. The Plettenbergs were also opposed to Hitler, and clandestinely distributed the banned anti-Nazi Papal encyclical Mit brennender Sorge in 1937. As a result of this, Elisabeth's parents were imprisoned by the Gestapo, but she was able to secure their release after three weeks. In addition, she herself was repeatedly questioned about her \\"subversive\\" activities.  As an Abwehr agent  Despite the Vermehrens' unwillingness to openly resist the Nazi regime, they inevitably found themselves in anti-Nazi circles, several of which centered on Vermehren's cousin Adam von Trott zu Solz,Coincidentally, von Trott had been Germany's 1931 Rhodes scholar. and both felt that their lives were at risk while they remained in Germany. Vermehren was excluded from military service due to a childhood injury, but managed to get himself assigned to the Abwehr late in 1943 with the help of Von Trott and Paul Leverkühn, the Abwehr station chief in Istanbul. At that time, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr, was making peace overtures to the Americans with the help of the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, who had been asked to meet Archbishop (later Cardinal) Francis Spellman. Von Papen was a cousin of Elisabeth Vermehren, and as a result of this family tie, Vermehren was assigned to Istanbul as a junior-grade agent after two weeks' training in secret inks. Elisabeth, however, was detained by the Gestapo as a hostage.  Defection  When Vermehren returned to Berlin on leave, the couple agreed they would defect to Britain. So that Elisabeth could travel to Istanbul, she procured an official assignment from the Foreign Office in connection with the Archbishop's visit to Turkey. They travelled by train to Istanbul, but at the border crossing into Bulgaria, Elisabeth was arrested by Gestapo agents and taken to the German embassy in Sofia, though Vermehren was permitted to continue to Istanbul. In Sofia, the ambassador was a family friend who (in cooperation with the Abwehr station chief) sneaked her on board a diplomatic courier plane to Istanbul. Meanwhile, Erich had made overtures to the British Secret Intelligence Service, which already had a file on him, through its counter-espionage representative Nicholas Elliott. The couple received word that a friend from the Foreign Office, Otto Carl Kiep, had been arrested on January 12, 1944, in connection with his attendance at the Frau Solf Tea Party. The Gestapo summoned them to Berlin in connection with the case, but anticipating what was in store for them, they refused, and defected in early February 1944. In the hope that their families would be protected from Sippenhaft (detention for the crimes of a family member) as a result of their defection, their defection was made to appear to be a kidnapping by the British. The Vermehrens were smuggled to England via İzmir, Aleppo, Cairo and Gibraltar. British propaganda organisations broke the news of the defection, knowing that it would cause havoc in Germany's intelligence services, especially since the invasion of Western Europe was imminent. Hitler was reportedly incensed, as it was believed that they absconded with the Abwehr's secret codes. This was untrue, but according to British records, Vermehren nevertheless gave much valuable information to the Allies about German intelligence operations.the British Security Service records at the U.K national archives Hitler now distrusted the Abwehr and Canaris and on February 18, 1944, the Abwehr was abolished and its intelligence functions taken over by the SS Security organisation (RSHA), under the jurisdiction of Heinrich Himmler. Several members of the couple's families were arrested and interned, including Erich's parents, his elder brother Michael and sister Isa, and Elisabeth's youngest sister Gisela. All of them survived the war.  In England  The Vermehrens were given accommodation in the South Kensington flat of the mother of Kim Philby, where they provided him with lists of personalities of the Catholic underground in Germany. As these Catholic figures were as equally opposed to Communism as Nazism, Philby, a Soviet spy, handed the list over to his handlers; when the British tried to contact the list of personages at the end of the war, it was found that most of them had been liquidated.Kim Philby, Spies, and the Dangers of Paranoia The couple also tried unsuccessfully to persuade the British Foreign Office to allow leading members of the German opposition to help in rebuilding the country. They then asked for their status as \\"Guests of the Foreign Office\\" to be annulled and to be left to their own devices. Elisabeth found employment as an assistant teacher in Worth Priory, a preparatory school run by the Benedictine Order while Erich founded a small export company, which had limited success, and later found employment with a firm of brokers with Lloyd's of London. They settled near the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Brompton Road, and changed their surname to Vermehren de Saventhem for genealogical reasons.  Later years  The de Saventhems settled in Zürich in the 1960s with Erich managing his firm's Swiss subsidiary until he was promoted as Director for Europe in 1964. They then lived in Paris before moving back to Switzerland in 1966. They became active in the Catholic Traditionalist Movement following the Second Vatican Council. Erich was one of the founding members of the Una Voce movement, becoming its first president. The couple returned to Germany in view of Elisabeth's failing health, and she died there in 2000. Erich died in Bonn in 2005.  Main source  Bassett, Richard. \\"A Lion of the Faith\\". Obituary of Erich Vermehren de Saventhem in The Independent, 3 May 2005.

The main facilities of the center are located on property adjoining Burholme Park. The center is part of the Temple University Health System (TUHS) and specializes in the treatment and prevention of cancer. The center was formed in 1974 by the merger of the American Oncologic Hospital, which was founded in 1904 as the first cancer hospital in the United States, and the Institute for Cancer Research, founded in 1927. The center was an independent, non-profit institution until it became part of TUHS July 1, 2012. Today it has almost 2,400 employees and an operating budget of $300 million. Research is conducted in more than 80 laboratories by a staff of more than 325 physicians and scientists who hold medical degrees, Ph.D.s or both. Fox Chase's 100-bed hospital is one of the few facilities in the country devoted entirely to cancer care. Annual hospital admissions average about 4,100 and outpatient visits to physicians exceed 69,000 a year. As of 2014, the Fox Chase Cancer Center was ranked as the 19th best cancer hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report. In 1995, Fox Chase also became a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 21 of the nation’s leading academic cancer centers. On December 15, 2011, Fox Chase Cancer Center and Temple University Health system signed an affiliation agreement. Under the agreement, Fox Chase has connected and extended its current operations into the adjoining 176-bed and 33-acre Jeanes Hospital, which is already a part of the Temple University Health System. Fox Chase is considered the \\"Cancer Hub\\" of the Temple University Health System.

Publication history Fictional character biography Angelo Espinosa was a former gang member from the east Los Angeles area who faked his own death to leave that part of his life behind. Skin was one of four young mutants (including M, Husk, and Blink) abducted by the Phalanx, a techno- organic alien race. The reason behind the abductions was so that the Phalanx could uncover the secret behind their inability to assimilate mutants into their collective. Through their combined efforts and those of Banshee, Emma Frost, Sabretooth, Synch, and Jubilee, the four young mutants managed to escape their confines; although, Blink sacrificed herself by using her powers to destroy the Phalanx that had captured them.Uncanny X-Men #317, X-Men #37 Afterwards, Skin accepted an invitation to enroll in the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants owned by Emma Frost. As a member of Generation X, Skin was joined by Synch, Jubilee, Husk, and M (and later by Chamber, Penance, and Mondo). During his stay at the Massachusetts Academy, Skin became close friends with Chamber because neither could pass for normal humans in public, and he always found time to playfully flirt with Husk, Jubilee (whom he nicknamed Jubecita), and M. Skin was also hunted by a mutant-killing vigilante known as the X-Cutioner who believed Skin responsible for the death of Angelo Espinosa. The X-Cutioner did not know that Skin, in fact, was Angelo Espinosa. Skin and Chamber succeeded in defeating the vigilante, but kept the secret. During Operation: Zero Tolerance, Skin and his teammates found themselves transported to his hometown by Glorian.Generation X #28 While searching for Skin's cousin Gil, they were captured by Skin's ex-girlfriend Tores, a gang leader who wanted to kill him for making her believe he was dead. Before she got the chance, Prime Sentinels attacked both Generation X and her gang, forcing them into a reluctant temporary truce. Skin and Tores acted as bait to lead the Sentinels into an ambush, and Gil completed the trap by starting a huge explosion, allowing Generation X to escape.Generation X #29-31 After the Academy closed due to the machinations of Adrienne Frost, Skin returned to Los Angeles with Jubilee in tow. Some time later, Skin and Jubilee, along with Magma, Bedlam, and a handful of other unknown mutants were found crucified on the lawn of the X-Mansion. This action was done by the Church of Humanity, a militant, religious anti-mutant organization.

Early life  Covici, known to his friends as \\"kai,\\" was born November 4, 1885 in Botoșani, Kingdom of Romania. He was the son of vintner Wolf Covici and Schifra Barish. At the age of twelve, his family immigrated to Chicago where his six brothers owned and managed a number of retail stores. He studied at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago, but he did not graduate from either school. Afterwards, he worked at his brothers' stores. = Early publishing career = For several years, he published a monthly newspaper in Bradenton, Florida. In 1922, together with partner Billy McGee, he started a publishing company and bookstore in Chicago. The store became a popular spot for writers, the company published special, limited edition books, often created for collectors. Ben Hecht's 1922 novel, Fantazius Mallare, published by the firm, was labeled obscene and was restricted and confiscated by post office officials. Hecht, the illustrator Wallace Smith, and the publishers were arrested, pleaded no contest, and had to pay a fine of $1,000. In 1928 he published The Wild Party by Joseph Moncure March. The poem was considered lewd and was banned in places like Boston. =New firm and controversy= When McGee left the company in connection to health issues in 1924, Covici continued to publish under Pascal Covici, Inc. Several years later, he began a firm with Donald Friede in New York City. The play The Front Page by Hecht and Charles MacArthur and the novel The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall garnered the company quick success. The Well of Loneliness was seized from Covici-Friede's offices after Friede sold a copy to John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice but the New York Court of Special Sessions cleared the book of charges of obscenity. In addition to writers like Gene Fowler, Wyndham Lewis, Clifford Odets, and Nathanael West, their key author was John Steinbeck whom they signed in 1934. They published Tortilla Flat in 1935 and other new and reprinted Steinbeck works. Covici-Friede failed in 1938; in 1943, Crown Publishing purchased the firm's assets. = Viking Press = In 1938, Covici moved to Viking Press, where he convinced Steinbeck to sign. Viking published The Grapes of Wrath (1939), which received a 1940 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\\"Novel\\" The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 8 September 2016. Overall, Covici's association with Steinbeck was long-lasting and highly honored by both sides.https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00028/hrc-00028.html Covici also worked on the Viking Portable Library and with authors like Joseph Campbell, Ludwig Bemelmans, Gilbert Highet, Lionel Trilling, Arthur Miller, George Gamow, Shirley Jackson, Willy Ley, Marianne Moore, and Saul Bellow. Bellow's novel Herzog, Steinbeck's East of Eden, and Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle are dedicated to Covici. =Death and legacy= Covici died October 14, 1964.

Here the version by Caterina Santoro, who had access to original documents of the time in the Trivulzio Library in Milan, has been preferred.) was Duchess of Milan from 1450 to 1468. Biography =Early years= Born near Settimo Pavese, Bianca Maria was the illegitimate daughter of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan and last of the Visconti rulers, and Agnese del Maino, the only person the shy, secluded Filippo ever loved. Agnese was the daughter of Ambrogio del Maino, a Milanese nobleman and ducal questore. Agnese served as Lady-in-Waiting to Filippo's wife, Beatrice di Tenda. The couple had a second daughter, called Caterina Maria or Lucia Maria, also born in Settimo in 1426, but she died shortly after her birth. When she was six months old, Bianca Maria and her mother were sent to a castle in Abbiate, where a rich residence had been established for the two of them. The Duke spent much of his time in Abbiategrasso, where he was impressed by Bianca Maria's strong character. Bianca Maria spent her childhood and adolescence in Abbiategrasso, where she received a humanist education. The Ducal library contained a wide variety of works: Latin classics, narrative texts in Provençal and French, scientific and didactical works, as well as texts in Italian and volgare, mainly by Tuscan authors. Both Bianca and her father were passionate hunters and lovers of horses. =Marriage= In 1430, at the age of five, Bianca Maria was betrothed to the condottiero Francesco I Sforza, a man twenty-four years older than she. In that year the condotta (contract) between Milan and Sforza came to an end, and the betrothal was a move to keep the powerful general tied with Milan. It has also been suggested that Visconti enticed Sforza with the promise of appointing him as legitimate heir to the duchy. Sforza probably also accepted because of the rich dowry, which included territories in the areas of Cremona, Castellazzo di Bollate and Bosco Frugarolo. The contract was signed on 23 February 1432 in the castle of Porta Giovia, the Visconti residence in Milan. Bianca Maria's official spokesperson was her godfather, Andrea Visconti, general of the Humiliates order. The presence of Bianca Maria and her mother at the ceremony is not certain; according to some sources, she visited Milan for the first time when she was already of marrying age. In the following years, the suspicious Filippo Maria tried twice to dissolve the betrothal with the ambitious Sforza: in 1434, after the latter had sided with Pope Eugene IV, who sent him to fight Milan, Carlo Gonzaga, the son of the Marquis of Mantua, was contacted. The later project of betrothing Bianca Maria with Leonello d'Este, marquis of Ferrara, Modena and Reggio, was only a political move to pressure Sforza to leave the alliance formed by the Republic of Venice against Milan. Bianca Maria's trip to Ferrara at that time (September 1440) was also her first confirmed trip outside Abbiategrasso. The attempt to force Sforza to change alliances was fruitless, and Bianca Maria returned to her castle in April 1441. In the same year Niccolò Piccinino, captain of the Milanese troops, created difficulties for Francesco; he asked Visconti for lordship of Piacenza in return for his capture of Sforza. Visconti then moved toward reconciling with Sforza, suspending hostilities and sending him peace proposals, together with the proxy for the marriage with Bianca Maria. Francesco Sforza. On 24 October 1441 Francesco Sforza and Bianca Maria Visconti were wed in the Abbey of San Sigismondo in Cremona, preferring that city's Cathedral for security reasons.Marcantonio Sabellico, in his Historiae rerum venetarum ab urbe condita, states that before the marriage, Francesco Sforza assured Bianca Maria that his wars against her father had not reduced his love for her. In the typical Italian Renaissance manner, feasts lasted for several days and included a sumptuous banquet, tournaments, a palio, allegorical carts and a huge cake reproduction of the Torrazzo, the city's main tower. It is probable that this cake is the origin of the torrone.Bernardino Corio, Mediolanensis Patria historia =First years after the marriage= On 7 November 1441, Filippo Maria issued a decree reducing the rights of his vassals, Francesco included. The latter preferred to establish himself in the safer territory of Venetia, in the hamlet of Sanguinetto. In the same years Francesco and Bianca Maria were invited to Venice by the doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari. Shortly thereafter, news that Piccinino was menacing Sforza's possessions in the Marche reached the city. Bianca Maria then accompanied her husband to Rimini, where they were guests of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, in Gradara and then in Jesi. Here she remained in the castle while Francesco led the military operations against Piccinino. In 1442 Bianca Maria (then 17 years old) was named regent of the Marche. This choice may seem surprising, but numerous contemporary chronicles state that Bianca Maria had repeatedly proven her skills in administration and diplomacy. As for the ducal couple's personal relationship, if it is certain that Francesco had strong feelings towards Bianca Maria, it is also true that he was frequently unfaithful to her. Bianca Maria usually reacted with nonchalance. On one occasion, however, in 1443, one of her husband's mistresses disappeared and was killed in dubious circumstances. In 1442 Francesco was excommunicated. Four years later, ill and declining, Filippo Maria Visconti approached Francesco for a reconciliation. The latter, however, remained distrustful, and, despite Bianca Maria's pleading, preferred to concentrate on the defense of his territories, menaced by Papal troops. In 1447 Sforza, feeling more confident, accepted the position of lieutenant of the Duchy of Milan, but Visconti, jealous and suspicious after the popularity of Sforza in Milan, soon changed his mind. At the same time the new Pope, Nicholas V, demanded the restitution of Jesi. It was a very difficult time for Francesco and Bianca Maria. Francesco Sforza gave back to the pope the town of Jesi in exchange for 35,000 florins, and moved towards Milan along with his wife. News of the death of Filippo Maria Visconti, who died in the night between 13 and 14 August 1447, reached Francesco in Cotignola. Bianca Maria was very angry when she heard about the depredations suffered by the Visconti properties in Milan after Filippo's death. Bianca Maria and Francesco were marching toward Milan, with 4,000 knights and 2,000 infantry, when the new- born Ambrosian Republic, under the menace of a Venetian invasion, offered Francesco the title of Captain General. Bianca Maria favored refusing, but Francesco accepted, starting three years in which he strove to reconquer the cities that had declared independence from the Duchy after Filippo Visconti's death. In May 1448, when Sforza was in Pavia, the Venetians attacked Cremona. According to the chronicles, Bianca Maria donned a suit of parade armor and, along with some troops and the populace, hurried to defend wards the city. She fought in the battle that ensued for the whole day. This episode gained her fame as a \\"warrior woman\\". After the Venetian danger had been repulsed, Bianca Maria settled in the Visconti Castle of Pavia, together with a large court. Her good relationships with her Visconti relatives gained popular support, as well as loans and funds, for the fragile new state created by her husband. On 24 February 1450, a revolt broke out in Milan. The Venetian ambassador was killed, as the Venetian Republic was deemed responsible for the famine that had struck Milan. A meeting of nobles and citizens recognized Francesco as lord. =Duchess of Milan= The date of the entrance of the new duke and duchess in Milan is disputed: 22 March or 25 March. Francesco and Bianca Maria refused the triumphal wagon (they called it superstizione da re, \\"kings' superstition\\"), instead reaching the Duomo riding on a couple of horses. It was the first time that a duke's title had been awarded by the citizens of the city. During the first years of their reign, Bianca collaborated with her husband in recovering her father's assets and restoring the Ducal Palace. Francesco was again entangled in a war against Venice. Remaining alone in Milan, Bianca Maria devoted herself to the administration of the Duchy, as attested by the correspondence with her husband, which gives precious insights on the education of their children, state affairs, the financial difficulties, and details of her daily life. The letters also show the assertive character of Bianca Maria, who did not hesitate to express her opinions even when they differed from her husband's. The letters include also accusations of his extramarital adventures. In 1453 in Pavia, Bianca Maria hosted René I of Naples, who was asked to go to Cremona with his army to fight alongside Sforza. She later showed him the construction site of the large new Castello Sforzesco in Milan. =Late years= After the Peace of Lodi in 1454, Bianca Maria devoted herself not only to diplomacy and the restoration and embellishment of the several Ducal residences, but also to public works. The ducal couple had a large hospital built in Milan, the Ospedale Maggiore, and often Bianca Maria offered direct help to numerous poor women. In 1459 Pope Pius II summoned a council in Mantua to prepare a crusade against the Ottoman Turks. Bianca Maria offered 300 knights, and Francesco was proposed as military leader of the expedition. The crusade never materialized, but Francesco and Bianca Maria's support of the papacy gained them bulls of indulgence for the Duomo and the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. In 1462 Francesco Sforza, who suffered from gout and dropsy, fell ill. During his absence from the government, Bianca Maria's political and administrative capabilities prevented the state from crumbling after some rebellions spurred by Venice. She acted effectively as co-regent of the Duchy. Bianca Maria also promoted a marriage between Jacopo Piccinino, the son of Niccolò, and Drusiana, Francesco's illegitimate daughter. Galeazzo as Saint Mary with the child Jesus Christ. The main problems for Bianca Maria in this period came from their eldest son, Galeazzo Maria, whose unstable and treacherous character created numerous troubles for her. On 13 December 1465, her mother, Agnese del Maino, died. Shortly afterward, on 8 March 1466, Duke Francesco Sforza died also. Bianca Maria quickly took the reins of the duchy and called back Galeazzo Maria, who was fighting alongside the king of France, to succeed as duke. The latter's behavior was initially one of gratitude and deference towards his mother, but soon greed and ruthlessness led him to act independently against Bianca Maria's advice. As time passed, the Duke relegated his mother to an increasingly secondary role and in the end forced her to leave Milan. She then moved to Cremona, her dower city. According to some sources, she was thinking of giving the control of the city to Venice, and she had frequent contacts with Ferdinand I of Naples, who was aiming to overthrow Galeazzo. =Last days= Against the advice of all her counsellors, Bianca Maria decided to take part in Galeazzo's marriage on 9 May 1468. At the end of the feasts she accompanied her daughter Ippolita to Serravalle, whence she set off to Cremona. However, when midway, in Melegnano, she fell ill. A high fever obliged her to stay in bed until August, but she kept up an intense correspondence. At the beginning of October, her condition worsened further. She died on 28 October of that year, after having recommended her younger children, Elisabetta and Ottaviano, to their brother Galeazzo. She was buried in the Duomo of Milan, next to her husband. The funeral oration, commissioned by Galeazzo, was written by the humanist Francesco Filelfo. Her death raised suspicions; Galeazzo Maria Sforza was accused by various men, including Bartolomeo Colleoni, of having poisoned her. It is certain that during her illness, there were in Melegnano certain men close to Galeazzo, some of whom were later involved in other cases of poisoning.One of the most intimate of the Ducal emissaries was one Ambrogio of the Grifi, podestà of Sartirana, who was later accused of having poisoned Ludovico il Moro. According to Bernardino Corio, Bianca \\"died of natural ungratefulness more than poison\\".

Life and career Grandson of confectionery manufacturer Charles Riley Maynard, founder of Maynards, Kenneth Wood was born on 4 October 1916 in Lewisham in London.Wood, Kenneth Maynard, 1916-1997, London Science Museum. A Kenwood Major. He was brought up in Chelsfield in Kent and was educated at Bromley County School before leaving home in 1930, aged fourteen to join the merchant navy for five years, after which, he studied electrical engineering and accountancy at night school. A year later, in 1936, he set up his own company, Dickson & Wood, selling, installing and repairing radios and televisions. In 1939, he sold the company and joined the Royal Air Force where he worked as an engineer at the Admiralty developing radar and electronic controls. After the war, he founded Woodlau Industries, with wartime colleague Roger Laurence, starting production in 1947 in Woking with the A100 turnover toaster, an appliance that was uncommon in the UK at that time, and then the A200 food mixer - the predecessor of the Kenwood Chef which was launched in 1950. When Roger Laurence left the company, Wood changed the name to Kenwood Manufacturing Company Ltd. The company moved to Havant in Hampshire in 1961, then employing a workforce of 700. Kenwood's products were successful because Wood identified household tasks that gave housewives most work and developed machines to do those jobs. Within a few years of setting up the company, he was one of Britain's youngest millionaires. However, in 1968, Wood parted company with Kenwood Manufacturing after a hostile takeover by Thorn Electrical Industries although he maintained an interest in the company until his death. On 31 May 1972, he was granted the Freedom of the City of London as a result of his membership of the Worshipful Company of Farriers. Between 1972–80, Wood was chairman and managing director of the Dawson-Keith Group of Companies, mostly a maker of generators. In 1984, he was appointed Fellow of the Institute of Ophthalmology. He founded Forest Mere Health Farm (now Champneys Forest Mere) and the keen golfer invested in Old Thorns Manor Hotel, his then-Hampshire home, with television commentator Peter Alliss, both in Liphook and was also chairman of the governors of Wispers School in Haslemere, Surrey (which closed in 2008).Liphook Herald: Lunch marks women's day, 21 March 2013.

He is portrayed by actor Jamie Bamber, and is one of the main characters in the series. Character biography =Early life= Lee Adama was born to William Adama, a veteran of the First Cylon War, and his wife, Carolanne Adama. He also had a younger brother, Zak Adama. Their father strongly encouraged both boys to enter the Colonial Fleet and become Viper pilots. Unfortunately, Zak was not a natural pilot like his brother and father, and was killed in an accident after being awarded flight status against the better judgment of his flight instructor and fiancée, then- Lieutenant Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace. Zak's death drove a wedge between Lee Adama and his father which would only be healed over two years later, after the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies. =After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies= By the time of the Cylons' devastating attack on the Twelve Colonies, Lee Adama is a Captain in the Colonial Fleet Reserve with the call sign \\"Apollo\\". He is a special guest at the decommissioning ceremonies for Battlestar Galactica, commanded by his father. After Major Jackson \\"Ripper\\" Spencer, the Galactica's CAG (Commander of the Air Group) is killed in battle, Lee Adama becomes senior surviving pilot, then joins the Galactica crew and becomes its CAG. Lee Adama's strained relationship with his father also causes him to become a strong supporter of Colonial President Laura Roslin, who often butts heads with William Adama. Roslin, unfamiliar with the military, appoints Lee Adama to be her personal advisor. Early in their relationship, President Laura Roslin often referred to Lee Adama as \\"Captain Apollo\\". Lee once corrected her, stating \\"Apollo\\" was his call sign, but President Roslin replied \\"'Captain Apollo' has a nice ring to it.\\" Upon joining Galactica's crew, Apollo was a bit of an outsider but after proving himself in several missions as more than just the \\"old man's son\\" he earned the respect of his fellow pilots and soon became one of the crew. When Kara Thrace goes missing after being shot down over an unnamed red moon, Lee is at the forefront of the search for the missing pilot. Lee and his father are ultimately compelled to abandon the search for Starbuck after President Roslin alerts them to how they are placing personal feelings above the good of the fleet. Fortunately, Starbuck is able to return to Galactica using a Cylon Raider she shot down. However, the incident cements the father-son bond between William Adama and his surviving son. Lee questions how long his father would search for him, were he missing, to which the elder Adama responds, \\"If it were you, we'd never leave.\\" Lee is part of the strike team sent by then-Commander Adama to Colonial One to terminate Laura Roslin's presidency after she encourages Kara Thrace to abscond with a captured Cylon Raider. On board Colonial One, Lee has a change of heart, declaring that it isn't worth it to sacrifice democracy. He puts his gun to Colonel Saul Tigh's head. Tigh calmly tells Lee, \\"This is mutiny, you know that.\\" Tigh takes control of the situation after Roslin surrenders and is able to take both Roslin and Lee into custody. Lee is present in the Galactica's CIC shortly thereafter, when the Cylon infiltrator known as Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii shoots Commander Adama twice in the chest; despite his disagreement with his father over deposing Roslin, he tries to comfort his father after being shot. On Tigh's orders, Lee is physically dragged from his father's side and thrown in the brig. Needing Lee's services as CAG, Tigh later releases Lee on parole. Lee will perform his duties as before, but \\"make no attempt to free [Roslin] or sow insurrection among the crew\\", and will return to the brig when not on duty. Nonetheless, Lee breaks his parole after Tigh's leadership takes a disastrous turn and results in civilian deaths. He helps Roslin to lead a breakaway fleet to Kobol. After Commander Adama and President Roslin make a personal effort to heal the divisions in the fleet, Lee returns to duty on Galactica. Lee is one of the five people who see firsthand the map to Earth in the Tomb of Athena on Kobol. After the Battlestar Pegasus joins the fleet, Lee is temporarily transferred to the Pegasus, given duties flying Raptors rather than Vipers, and even demoted to Lieutenant. All of these misfortunes are reversed after the successful attack on the Cylon Resurrection ship, the death of Rear Admiral Helena Cain, and his father's promotion to flag rank. However, Lee battles with depression at this time, confessing to Kara Thrace \\"he didn't want to make it back alive.\\" While on leave on the Cloud 9 luxury liner, Lee is accidentally shot by Kara Thrace during a hostage rescue. He takes almost a month to recover from this wound, during which time he is promoted to Major and consummates his long-simmering relationship with Petty Officer Second Class Anastasia Dualla. He is assigned to Pegasus to assist the new commanding officer, Commander Barry Garner. After he successfully commands the ship during a Cylon surprise attack in which Garner is killed, Lee is quickly promoted from Major to Commander, and given command of Pegasus. =New Caprica and the Second Exodus= Shortly before the Roslin-vs.-Baltar presidential election, the fleet discovers a somewhat habitable planet inside of a nebula, presumably safe from Cylon discovery, which is named New Caprica. After Gaius Baltar wins the presidential election, he orders the establishment of permanent settlements on the planet. The Galactica and Pegasus begin a monotonous orbital defense patrol. Months later, Lee and Kara Thrace both get drunk at a party celebrating the ceremonial first shovelful of earth being dug on New Caprica. They make love, declare their love for one another, and fall asleep together; however, Kara wakes first and leaves. When Lee wakes and returns to the settlement he finds Kara has married Samuel Anders. This betrayal causes a lot of bad feeling between Adama and Thrace. He takes to overeating and puts on a lot of weight; he also marries his new first officer, Anastasia Dualla, now a Lieutenant Junior Grade. Eight months later the Cylons find New Caprica, and take control over the colonists. With only a skeleton crew manning his ship, Lee is forced to flee with the rest of the fleet hoping to return again to fight off the Cylons and save the civilian population. Four months later still, as the Galactica and Pegasus lay plans to rescue the civilians trapped on New Caprica, the psychological impact of the past year is also obvious: after previously being in great physical shape, Lee has become overweight, sentimental and \\"soft\\", to the point where it interferes with his ability to command the Pegasus. When contact with the resistance movement on New Caprica is established, Lee is ordered by his father to take the Pegasus and continue the search for Earth while the Galactica attempts to liberate the planet. When Galactica is near destruction, Lee and Pegasus come to the rescue, giving his father's ship time to jump out. Under heavy fire from four Cylon Basestars, the Pegasus is heavily damaged, having left its Vipers to defend the rest of the fleet. Lee orders the crew to abandon ship, saying \\"Thank You\\" to his ship just as he departs. The Pegasus rams a Cylon basestar, instantly destroying both vessels, and a large piece of wreckage damages or destroys a second basestar. Lee's first role after the rescue of the civilian population appears to be connected to conducting some kind of head-count or census of the rescued civilians. It is in this capacity he notices certain confirmed survivors have gone missing, having been executed by The Circle for collaborating with the Cylons. He then returns to the role of Galactica's CAG, with the rank of Major. After much hard physical training, he loses the excess weight he gained over the previous year and asks Captain Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon to remind him to never let himself go like that again. Lee advocates using captured Cylons infected with a strain of lymphocytic encephalitis as biological weapons to exterminate the Cylon race. His plan is approved by President Roslin, but is thwarted by Captain Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon, the Galactica's executive officer at the time. The renewed strength of his bond with his father is shown when his father chooses to confess to Lee about his fears he may have inadvertently provoked the Cylon onslaught on the Colonies. =Resignation from Colonial Forces and legal aspirations= However, that father-son relationship sours following the death of Kara Thrace, whom Lee loved and whom Adama considered as close as a daughter. While both grieve, Lee is visibly shaken by the death, while Adama does his best to move past it. When Adama realizes his son has become unhinged by her death, he pulls him from flight duty, assigning Lee the task of heading up the security detail for the defense attorney of Gaius Baltar, whose trial Adama considers to be little more than a public relations exercise. Lee suspects his father is being overprotective, not wishing to lose him as he did Kara. After two assassination attempts on Baltar's latest lawyer, Romo Lampkin, the culprit is discovered. Adama then reinstates Lee as CAG, not wanting to expose him to the dangers of more potential assassination attempts. Lee, however, has become very interested in Colonial law at this point, after reading some of his grandfather's law books, and believes he could assist Lampkin prepare the case. Adama resists, but Lee refuses to resume his duties as CAG, and joins the legal team. As the trial begins, Admiral Adama is enraged to find that Saul Tigh, now a witness, is forced to admit he killed his own wife on New Caprica. He blames Lee, believing his son has given the information to Lampkin. Adama wants Lee to stop helping Baltar, but Lee refuses, ultimately resigning his commission after Adama openly states that Lee has no integrity, and that he is \\"a coward\\" for supposedly letting Romo question Saul. Putting the uniform behind him, Lee begins to see the trial more as an exercise of justice rather than as a trial of a specific man, and personally takes up the cross-examination of President Laura Roslin, confronting her with her renewed use of the hallucinogenic compound chamala-extract which she claims is a treatment for her relapse of cancer. This move, while justified in Lee's mind toward preserving justice in the fleet, further strains his relationship with both his father and Roslin, and motivates his wife to finally leave him. After Laura's deposition, Lee is the last witness called, following Felix Gaeta's perjury in stating President Baltar willingly signed a mass execution warrant. Lee proclaims in court nearly all those in positions of power throughout the Fleet, including himself, are guilty of murder and treason to some degree; because Baltar is broadly reviled in Fleet society, human civilization is scapegoating the ex-President in an effort to expunge its guilt and shame. Lee ultimately realizes he was being manipulated by Lampkin, who boldly predicted to Baltar he has no greater ally than a son trying to flee his father's shadow. After Baltar's acquittal, the Fleet is once again discovered by the Cylons. Despite having resigned his commission, Lee puts on a flight suit and pilots Viper 3 to help defend the fleet from the Cylons. While in flight he spots something on his wing, which he discovers to be a Viper, flown by Kara Thrace. She proceeds to tell him \\"It's okay, don't freak out, it's really me. I've been to Earth, I know where it is, and I'm gonna take us there\\". While reviewing his gun camera footage, Lee tells his father that since Baltar's trial, he feels he can do more outside the military, even as his father offers to return his wings. Adama is visibly upset but ultimately concedes to his son's wishes. At Lee's \\"mustering out\\" party, he drinks several toasts to the Galactica, his friends, Rear Admiral Adama, the Fleet and \\"to absent friends.\\" As he leaves the Galactica, the pilots and Command staff salute him while he boards the Raptor taking him off the ship. Dualla gives him his Viper wings in a frame and as he hugs her he says, \\"Well, looks like you get the house.\\" Lee begins his political career as the Caprica Delegate to the Quorum of Twelve. Following the disappearance of President Roslin aboard the defecting Cylon basestar, Lee searches for an alternative Presidential candidate to the still- divisive Zarek. After a tense confrontation with a despairing Romo Lampkin, during which he is informed of his nomination with a gun to the head, Lee accepts his candidacy. Aboard Colonial One, Lee Adama is inaugurated as the Acting President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. =Earth= After his father's return to Galactica, President Adama is faced with a hostage crisis instigated by the Cylon D'Anna. She demands the Four Cylons within the Colonial fleet reveal themselves and find their way to the Rebel baseship; until then, a Colonial hostage on the baseship would be killed every 15 minutes. His father's nervous breakdown in the light of Tigh's confession gave Lee the upper hand. Within short order, he had three of the final five standing in an airlock. D'Anna was backed hopelessly into a corner and prepared to nuke the civilian fleet; the confrontation seemed hopeless until Starbuck showed up with the co-ordinates to Earth. Lee felt withholding the information would only serve to prolong a pointless war, so shared the discovery with D'Anna. He saw to it Cylon and Human would travel to Earth and make a new home together. The Fleet's arrival at Earth was a bittersweet experience for Adama. Joy, elation and relief quickly turned to dismay and horror upon witnessing a devastated cityscape once the thirteenth colony. After returning to Galactica, Lee and his ex-wife Anastasia Dualla share a reconciliation and go on a \\"date.\\" After Lee departs, Dualla shoots herself, wishing to hold onto the reconciliation as her last memory. In the wake of Tom Zarek's failed coup, Lee is appointed Vice President of the Colonies by President Laura Roslin, and it is made clear while she will retain the title of President, Lee will handle the \\"heavy lifting.\\" When Admiral Adama decides to lead a possibly one-way rescue mission for Hera and asks for volunteers, Lee is the first to step forward. He leads one of the assault teams straight into the Colony to retrieve Hera and manages to return her safely to the Galactica. When the fleet reaches the second Earth, Lee is the one to propose the survivors abandon their ships and technology and take the chance to break the cycle of violence and start life with a clean slate. The survivors agree to the plan and willingly allow the fleet to be destroyed while they settle on Earth with nothing but the clothes on their back and the supplies they possess. With a new chance at life, Lee expresses interest in exploring the new planet. Relationships * William Adama: Lee's father and current commander of the fleet and Galactica. Although strained at the beginning, his relationship with his son has evolved into a mutual love and respect. Lee then quit his role as CAG to defend Baltar full-time and was on very bad terms with Bill Adama. Following the trial, the two reconciled; Lee being offered the opportunity to return to the service. * Kara Thrace: Although the extent of his relationship with Kara Thrace, callsign Starbuck, before joining Galactica has never fully been explained, they share one of the strongest bonds on the show. It is revealed in the series finale Lee met Kara while she was dating Zak Adama. The three had a dinner party in Kara's apartment, and a drunken Kara dared Lee to make love to her while Zak was passed out on the sofa. The two stopped themselves when Zak briefly woke, but it is clear the attraction between Lee and Kara existed from the beginning of their friendship. Aboard Galactica, the two often have a volatile relationship, both professionally and personally. They almost consummated their relationship in \\"Scar\\", and have often been known to be jealous of each other's lovers. While not on good terms since finally sleeping together on New Caprica, their relationship seems to have improved since facing off in an emotional boxing match in \\"Unfinished Business\\". In the beginning of season 3 Lee and Kara seem to be on the verge of a serious relationship until Kara suddenly gets married. This does not put a stop to the tension between the characters; however, Lee won't cheat on his wife, Dee, and Kara doesn't want to divorce her husband, Anders, saying divorce is a sin in \\"The Eye of Jupiter\\". After Kara returns from the dead at the beginning of season 4, Lee supports her claims she can lead the fleet to Earth. Aside from a brief kiss during the mutiny aboard Galactica, Lee and Kara's relationship is not explored much during the final season, although the two characters share a final scene together in the series finale, with Kara mysteriously disappearing when Lee briefly looks away from her. * Laura Roslin: President of the Colonies. Appointed Lee as her military advisor in Season 1. Over the course of the show Lee has consistently sided with Roslin over his father, most notably when he refused to arrest her for defying his father's orders and later when he defected with her and nearly a third of the fleet to go to Kobol. Since then, however, their relationship has deteriorated. Assigned to Gaius Baltar's security during his trial for the crimes committed on New Caprica, Lee takes an active interest in Baltar's defense to the point of questioning Laura Roslin himself when the President took the stand. In an attempt to undermine her credibility, Lee forced the President to confess she had resumed taking chamalla, the hallucinogenic alternative cancer therapy. While Lee's reasoning was the President had become addicted, a disappointed and betrayed Roslin was forced to reveal her cancer had in fact returned. In Season 4, Lee resigns his post as CAG and takes up a position as Quorum Delegate for Caprica, which finds his idealism conflicting with Roslin's more totalitarian and secretive approach to fleet politics. However, Lee gains Roslin's respect with his handling of the hostage situation created by D'Anna as the acting president, with her saying his duty to the fleet is not over and the human race will need people like Lee Adama to lead them in the coming days. * Anastasia Dualla: Former communications NCO on Galactica. She was Lee Adama's executive officer aboard Pegasus and after forming a relationship with Lee, she married him. Later, Dee left her husband after he took a job on Baltar's defense team and relentlessly attacked Laura Roslin on the stand, forcing her to reveal her chamalla use. After the discovery of the planet originally called Earth, Lee and Dee briefly reestablished their relationship. However, this does not stop the depressed Dee from committing suicide after Earth is found to be unsuitable for colonization. Lee is deeply shaken by her death, and knows that he will ultimately never understand her reasons for suicide. Although her decision was never explained onscreen, a deleted scene from the episode Unfinished Business indicated Dee was aware of Lee's 'love and connection' with Kara Thrace. * Romo Lampkin: Defense attorney (specifically a public defender) and protégé of Lee's grandfather Joseph (himself a public defender). Lampkin's approach in developing Gaius Baltar's defense intrigues Lee and causes him to become Lampkin's bodyguard. Later, Lampkin's philosophical prodding on the nature of justice, as well as stories about Joseph Adama's career and personality encourage Lee to resign from the Fleet and become the Caprican representative on the Quorum of Twelve. *Gianne: Lee's fiancée from Caprica who presumably died during the Cylon attacks. Lee holds residual guilt for leaving her behind, and for running out on her when he found out she was pregnant with his child prior to the Cylon attacks. *Shevon: A prostitute from Cloud 9 with whom Lee had relations. Lee tried to ease his guilt over what happened with Gianne by trying to save Shevon and her daughter Paya.

It is a single machine with a number of attachments that allow it to perform many functions. The Chef, based on the earlier A200, was introduced in 1950. Kenwood mixers, along with most other Kenwood products were originally manufactured in the UK by Kenwood Limited (not to be confused with the Japanese Kenwood Corporation which manufactures audio equipment). The Chef Mixer was an instant success in the UK and is still Kenwood's top seller .  Overview  1948 model Ken Wood began trading as Woodlau Industries Ltd in 1947. His aim was to produce luxury items that would quickly be seen as necessities. He began marketing a toaster and a food mixer with two beaters. The original mixer marketed as \\"The Kenwood Electric Food Mixer\\", designed in 1947 was very similar (possibly too similar) to the Sunbeam Mixmaster Model 3, an American mixer made between 1936 and 1939, and he faced serious competition and possibly objection. He completely redesigned the mixer, which was then launched at the Ideal Home Exhibition in London in March 1950. This mixer was no longer just a mixer, as he had added several other functions, and so he called it the Kenwood Electric Chef. It sold for £19 10s. 10d. (£19.54). Since it was first introduced the basic Kenwood Chef design has changed little, with most changes being cosmetic. The A700 was the first model, superseded by the A700D with minor cosmetic differences and internal updates. In 1960 the Chef was redesigned by Kenneth Grange. During the 1960s the familiarly shaped A701 series was introduced in white with grey trim. Other standard and special versions of the A701 had different colours. The A703C, of which few were made, was based on the A701 but looked similar to the later A901; it had electronic speed control instead of the centrifugal controller used since the A700. During the mid-1970s the A901 series replaced the A701. The shape was basically similar but with a slightly more streamlined appearance. The design of the machine was entirely new. The original A901 had a redesigned centrifugal speed controller, replaced in the A901P (Chef Deluxe) by the new electronic speed control first seen on the A703C. The standard A901 was white with black trim, the \\"Super Chef\\" orange with brown trim, and the \\"Chef Deluxe\\" in beige with brown trim costing about £10 more. These more expensive models came with a stainless steel bowl (also sold as an optional extra, specifically for pastry making) instead of the standard plastic bowl. In around 1983 a white with silver and maroon trim \\"Chef Excel\\" with slight changes in appearance was introduced. Later Excel models were white with light blue trim, and finally all white. In 1997, a Special Edition KM500 SE was launched, to celebrate 50 years of Kenwood. The model, based on a KM200 but with an all-metal top arm, was finished in Aubergine with a special 'limited edition' plate with unique number, and a stainless steel mixing bowl. The packaging also contained a special booklet detailing the history of Kenwood. In 2002 the redesigned KM001 series was introduced, different both mechanically and in appearance. Models in this series had an extra power outlet, which enabled them to use a wider range of over 20 attachments. Since this date, all models are of Chinese manufacture. The 2006 range consisted of six different Chef models, differing mainly in power. Recent model Kenwood Major, with stainless steel bowl The Kenwood Major (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \\"Chef Major\\"), a larger model of similar general appearance to the Chef models but with a 6-litre bowl of the same diameter but higher than the Chef's 4.6-litre bowl, has also been produced. The Kenwood Major has versions specially made for commercial use which include extra features as required by increased Health and Safety requirements, such as no-voltage dropout 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons in addition to the standard speed control/off dial, and a safety guard above the bowl. There also is a version which has a cook-and-stir function, that is called \\"Cooking Chef\\" but has the bowl size of a Major type machine. Both the Chef and Major have four attachment points: *High speed outlet (top rear) for liquidiser and soft foods mill. *Medium speed outlet (top middle) for juice separator. *Low speed outlet (front) for mincer, hard foods mills, pasta makers etc. *Orbital hub for beaters, potato peeler or ice cream maker. The newer Classic Chef and Chef Premier do not have the medium speed outlet. A much smaller model (which does not resemble the Chef or Major at all), the Kenwood Chefette, has also been produced. The Chefette is basically a hand- mixer on a stand, and for the A340 version the bowl rotates by the action of the tools and food rotation. Later versions may have a power driven bowl. Liquidiser and coffee grinder attachments are available for it.  Compatibility  The auxiliary outlets are standard for all A700 machines, and were then updated for the A901. Some attachments for the A701 look very similar to those for the A901 but have a different fitting: they are not compatible and cannot be adapted. Older attachments for the A701 that may be found second-hand say on the box that they are for \\"All Chef and Major Models\\", true at the time but no longer so. There are three designs of shaft fitting into the orbital hub : *Cross-cut slot at top (very old machines only). A700, A700D. A701. *Bayonet with circular spring (\\"circlip beater\\"). A701A, A901A/E/P, KM200/300 series. *Bayonet without circular spring (recent machines). KM0** series. Early A706 Major models had another fitting, whereby the tool slid into a groove on the socket on the planet hub, after which a metal sleeve would drop down over the socket ensuring the beater stayed in place. A further complication is that, due to its extra height, any accessory fitted to the orbital hub of the Major must be longer than its Chef counterpart, so Major and Chef attachments for this hub are incompatible. This includes beaters, which need to reach to the bottom of the bowl, potato peeler, ice cream maker and others.  Attachments  Many attachments (e.g. coffee grinder, slicer and shredder, cream maker, grain mill, liquidiser, tin opener, potato peeler etc.) are available. All models in the A700 and A900 series were supplied with the \\"K-Beater\\" (for standard mixing, beating, and folding), dough hook, and whisk as standard. Some models (particularly the \\"Super Chef\\" and \\"Chef Deluxe\\") included the liquidiser attachment (which in some models was made of glass and in others plastic). A much-needed splash- guard cover for the bowl was introduced for the Chef in the early 1980s; before this, there was a tendency for ingredients such as flour to be thrown from the open-top bowl, especially if too high a speed was used before they were mixed in. The contemporary Kenwood Cooking Chef includes all the following attachments in its purchase price as standard: K-Beater, power whisk, spiral dough hook, stirring tool, flexi beater, food processor, steamer basket, and blender.  Other brands  The kitchen machine remains very popular across the UK and Europe, and is slowly working into the US market where the KitchenAid, which is a similar kitchen tool, has a greater market share. In North America, the DeLonghi DSM5 and DSM7, and the Kenmore Elite Kitchen Machine (re-badged DSM5), are the same appliance as the Kenwood Chef and accessories are interchangeable between them.

This meditation is considered to be the first-known philosophical formulation that sets out the ontological argument for the existence of God. The original title for this discourse was to be Faith Seeking Understanding.Logan, Ian. 2009. Reading Anselm’s Proslogion: The History of Anselm’s Arguments and its Significance Today. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing. p. 85. The ontological argument The Proslogion marked what would be the beginning of Saint Anselm's famous and highly controversial ontological arguments for the existence of God. The first and most famous argument of his can be found at the end of chapter 2, followed by his second argument shortly after. While opinions concerning Anselm's twin ontological arguments widely differ—and have differed since the Proslogion was first conceived—there is a general consensus that the argument is most convincing to Anselm's intended audience, i.e. Christian believers who seek a rational basis for their belief in God. = First argument = There are various reconstructions of Anselm's first argument, such as Dr. Scott H. Moore's analyses, for example:Moore, Scott H. \\"Proslogion.\\" Scott Moore. Waco, TX: Bayler University. Archived 12 May 1997. Retrieved 21 May 2020. *Proposition 1: God is a being than which none greater can be conceived. *Proposition 2: If existence in reality is greater than existence in the mind alone, an imagined being who exists only in our mind is not a \\"being than which none greater can be conceived.\\" A being than which none greater can be conceived must also exist in reality, where failure to do so would be a failure to be such. *Conclusion: Thus a being than which none greater can be conceived must exist, and we call this being God.  Objection  Philosopher Immanuel Kant gave an objection to the argument, although it would be toward ontological arguments in general, rather than at Anselm specifically. In fact, it is actually unclear as to whether Kant had Anselm in mind at all. Kant's objection famously states that \\"existence is not a predicate.\\" If Kant were considering Anselm's work in his analysis, he certainly left it up to the reader to grasp the applicability of the objection. One possible interpretation is to say that, because existence is not a predicate, a being that exists could not be said to be greater than one that does not exist; they would be equal. = Second argument = Just as the first, Anselm's second ontological argument can be formulated in numerous ways. William Viney, for instance, renders the second argument as follows:Dowbrowski, Daniel. 2006. Rethinking the Ontological Argument: A Neoclassical Theistic Response. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . # \\"God\\" means \\"that than which nothing greater can be conceived.\\" # The idea of God is not contradictory. # That which can be thought of as not existing (a contingent being) is not as great as that which cannot be thought of as not existing (a necessary being). # Therefore, to think of God as possibly not existing (as contingent) is not to think of the greatest conceivable being. It is a contradiction to think of the greatest conceivable being as nonexistent. # Therefore, God exists. Chapters * CHAPTER I: Exhortation of the mind to the contemplation of God.

WLTL has won several national and local awards.About WLTL Rock88.1.net. Accessed August 31, 2012 WLTL Background WLTL launched in January 1968 as a 10 watt radio station on the third floor of the Vaughan Building at LTHS' North Campus, with a simple omnidirectional antenna. WLTL originally operated on an assigned frequency of 88.3 MHz, but by 1969 changed frequency to 88.1 to permit WHSD, Hinsdale to operate on 88.5 and avoid having the two relatively close stations operate on adjacent channels. While licensed to operate at 10 watts, with a transmitter capable only of 10 watts power output, and a single bay horizontally polarized antenna with inexpensive transmission line, it was estimated that the actual ERP of the station at that time was approximately 7 watts. The original studio furniture was donated by local La Grange station WTAQ. The station transmitted a monophonic signal until the mid-1980s. After a license upgrade in the mid-1980s to permit higher power utilizing a new, higher, circularly polarized directional antenna, WLTL now broadcasts at 180 watts, with the transmitter and antenna still at the original location, though with a newer taller tower. The directional pattern places the strongest signal to the south and south- east, while maintaining a null in the direction of WETN, Wheaton College, also operating on 88.1, and to a lesser extent, limiting the signal somewhat to the west to protect WDGC at 88.3 (first adjacent) and WHSD on 88.5 (second adjacent). The power increase also made stereophonic transmission practical. WLTL also moved its studios into Room 10 of the North Campus main building, then later, into its current studios in Room 9. During its early years, WLTL was entirely student run with only minimal faculty supervision. The station operated with limited broadcast hours, initially from 3pm to 6pm Monday to Thursday, and 3pm to 9pm on Friday and Saturday, later expanding to Noon to 7 Monday - Thursday, and Noon to 10pm Friday and Saturday. Early programming consisted of short student-produced recorded educational programs, educational programming supplied by several college stations, and student DJ programs featuring popular music. Student DJ programs dominated the evening and weekend hours, and many students strived to emulate local professional broadcasters both in style and content. There were even student-produced radio dramas featuring original scripts and sound effects. To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Lyons Township High School in 1968, the student staff of WLTL produced a commemorative record presenting audio highlights of key events at the school. The record was a 33 rpm 10\\" disc titled \\"We Are L.T.\\", and was sold to students, alumni and faculty. With encouragement from the staff at commercial station WTAQ La Grange (who also donated some older remote broadcast equipment), the station became involved with high-school sports broadcasting, and covered LTHS's winning of the Illinois State High School Basketball Championship in 1970, broadcasting live from Champaign, IL. Other early innovations included developing relationships with other area high school radio stations, who would on occasion exchange DJs to share in each other's radio experience. A relationship was also formed with WIND Chicago (Group W, Westinghouse Broadcasting) in order to supply news content to WLTL. WLTL is licensed to the Board of Trustees-School District District 204 and is operated by students of LTHS under the supervision of faculty advisers. The music of WLTL is organized in a variety rock music radio format, airing various types of music including rock, alternative, pop, ska, emo, and others. The station operates 24 hours a day. Alumni After graduation, alumni taking part in WLTL have moved on to various successful careers.

In 2015, the City of Chicago converted the former Bloomingdale Line into an elevated greenway, which forms the backbone of the linear park and trail network called The 606. This elevated park passes through the Chicago neighborhoods of Logan Square, Humboldt Park, and West Town. History The Bloomingdale in Bucktown in 2009 The Bloomingdale Line was constructed in 1873 by the Chicago and Pacific Railroad Company as part of the Elgin subdivision from Halsted Street in Chicago to the suburb of Elgin, Illinois. It was soon absorbed by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railway (also known as the Milwaukee Road), first via a 999-year lease in 1880 and later with a fee simple deed conveyance to the same in 1900. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, it became part of the Soo Line Railroad, a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had owned the right-of-way. The City of Chicago purchased the right-of-way from Canadian Pacific Railway in January 2013. The railroad was elevated approximately twenty feet in the 1910s as result of a city ordinance aimed at reducing pedestrian fatalities at grade crossings. The line had been a street- running railway within Bloomingdale Avenue, an east–west street running at 1800 north; creating the embankment reduced Bloomingdale Avenue's width in some cases, rendering it an alleyway in some portions. Steel-reinforced concrete embankment walls line the right-of-way, and there are 38 viaducts built into the railroad to accommodate cross traffic. The line was used for both passenger and freight trains and served several local industrial businesses, including a Schwinn Bicycle Company warehouse. The Bloomingdale Line was primarily used to reach the Lakewood Branch and industrial district on Goose Island. The last freight train ran on the line in 2001. Soo Line Caboose running on Central Park Ave. Chicago in 2006 The Bloomingdale Avenue embankment continues west of the Trail's terminus at Ridgeway Avenue. There, it intersects with Metra's commuter tracks of the Milwaukee Road, with northbound North Line trains continuing toward Fox Lake, using Canadian Pacific's C&M; Subdivision and West Line trains running along the Bloomingdale tracks west to Elgin via the CP's Elgin Subdivision. The tracks lower to surface-level on the western outskirts of the city. On average, 3,531 trips are made daily on the 606. Sixty percent of these trips during the week are used for the purposes of transit. =Conversion to a greenway or linear park= The August 2013 groundbreaking ceremony to convert the rail line into a park, with Rahm Emanuel speaking 265x265px 264x264px 264x264px 264x264px The City of Chicago first investigated converting the Bloomingdale Line into a greenway in a 1997 bicycle facilities plan, but it remained a freight line with occasional service for several more years. The city and community reintroduced the greenway concept as part of the Logan Square Open Space Plan in 2002-2004.Logan Square Open Space Plan This plan proposed a linear park or greenway with public access ramps every few blocks apart. At the east end, a trailhead would be created at the Chicago River. A grassroots, non-profit organization, Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail (FBT), was formed in 2003 to be the focal point for advocacy and community involvement in the conversion project. FBT has partnered with the City and The Trust for Public Land, a national non-profit land conservation group, in a collaboration that will lead the project management, design, and development of the park. Although the train tracks used to separate the communities it intersected, the new greenway acts to connect neighborhoods, restaurants, and schools with bikeshare and transit stations. At , Bloomingdale Trail is the longest greenway project of a former elevated rail line in the United States and the second longest in the world. Additionally, many obsolete surface railway rights-of-way throughout the world have become rail trails, including the Illinois Prairie Path which leads west from the Chicago Transit Authority's Blue Line. The Chicago Department of Transportation announced on July 15, 2009, that it had selected a design firm to lead a team for the initial design and engineering work.Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail: Firm selected for initial design and engineering! After the announcement, the City created and has updated a document that describes the background, the location, and the future of the project. Collins Engineers, Inc., a Chicago civil and structural engineering firm, was selected by the Chicago Park District to provide Phase II design for the Bloomingdale Park and Multi-Purpose Bicycle Trail project, otherwise referred to as \\"The Bloomingdale\\". The multi-disciplinary team led by Collins also includes sub-consultants Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates (MVVA) and Frances Whitehead. MVVA worked on the Phase I design for this project and served as the landscape and urban design architect. Frances Whitehead served as the lead artist for this project. Groundbreaking on the project was scheduled for late summer 2013, and occurred on August 27, 2013 at what would become the Milwaukee Avenue / Levitt Avenue connection to the trail. The trail's final design consisted of a paved path with a soft shoulder on either side. The Bloomingdale Trail is the backbone of a parks and trail network called \\"The 606\\". The system's numeric name is an homage to the city's ZIP Codes, the prefix for nearly all of which is 606. The intent is to symbolize the system tying together myriad diverse neighborhoods across the city. The trail runs from Ashland Avenue all of the way west to North Ridgeway Avenue. The trail follows along West Bloomingdale Avenue, hence the name \\"Bloomingdale Trail\\". There several entrances and exits all along the trail making it very accessible for local pedestrians to use the path for walking, biking, running, etc. In November 2013, The Alphawood Foundation offered a $2 million grant to finance the Bloomingdale Trail. The park officially opened on June 6, 2015. There have been various proposals to connect the Bloomingdale Trail to the former site of A.

Human faced-fish decorated bowl recovered at Banpo. A skull recovered at Banpo displayed at the Xi'an Banpo Museum. Banpo is an archaeological site discovered in 1953 and located in the Yellow River Valley just east of Xi'an, China. It contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements, like Jiangzhai, carbon dated to 6700-5600 years ago. The area of is surrounded by a ditch, probably a defensive moat, wide. The houses were circular, built of mud and wood with overhanging thatched roofs. They sat on low foundations. There appear to be communal burial areas. Banpo is the type site associated with Yangshao Culture. Archaeological sites with similarities to the first phase at Banpo are considered to be part of the “Banpo phase” (7th millennium ) of the Yangshao culture. Banpo was excavated from 1954 to 1957. The settlement was surrounded by a moat, with the graves and pottery kilns located outside the moat perimeter. Many of the houses were semisubterranean with the floor typically below the ground surface. The houses were supported by timber poles and had steeply pitched thatched roofs. According to the Marxist paradigm of archaeology that was prevalent in the China during the time of the excavation of the site, Banpo was considered to be a matriarchal society; however, new research contradicts this claim and the Marxist paradigm is gradually being phased out in modern Chinese archaeological research. Currently, little can be said of the religious or political structure from these ruins from the archaeological evidence. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.

Life Lange was born in Schwerstedt, near Erfurt, Prussian Saxony, in 1830. He received initial musical training from his father on the piano and organ, followed by conservatory studies in piano, organ, thorough bass, and composition – probably at the Royal Institute for Church Music in Berlin.It is not exactly clear at which conservatory he studied. Lange's article in the German Wikipedia mentions a conservatory at Erfurt, but this was not founded before 1911. The nearest to Erfurt would have been at Leipzig. The French Wikipedia mentions the following names of teachers, and these were all involved as teachers at the Berlin institute. His teachers included August Wilhelm Bach, Eduard Grell, and Albert Löschhorn. He lived for many years in Berlin and died at Wernigerode in 1889. Music Encouraged by the success of some 1860s compositions, Lange produced a large number of works, most of which were light and popular piano pieces of which he wrote around 500. Edelweiss op. 31 and Blumenlied op. 39 (alternatively known as Flower Song in English) are perhaps two of his best-known works today.

The company incorporated as Cushman Motor Works in 1913.Cushman Centennial website, Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved on July 10, 2009. Cushman began production of their four-stroke Husky engine in 1922. Cushman produced engines for farm equipment, pumps, lawn mowers, and boats. Cushman began making Auto-Glide scooters in 1936 as a means to increase the sale of Husky engines during the Great Depression. Cushman scooters were widely used by the United States Armed Forces in World War II and as an alternative to automobiles before and after the war. One famous Cushman was the model 53, a military model from the World War II era. Designed to be dropped by parachute with Army Airborne troops,Shattuck, Colin, Scooters: Red Eyes Whitewalls and Blue Smoke, pp. 17-18 it became known as the Cushman Airborne. Other models were used on military bases for messenger service. The most successful model of Cushman scooter, the Eagle, was in production approximately 16 years. It resembled a motorcycle with its exposed engine and top tank. Other Cushman models, like the post-war \\"turtle back\\" Model 50 and 60, or the economy Highlander, used a step-through design common for scooters. The step-through design and ease of operation made it popular with men and women alike. Some late-1950s Cushmans, designated Road King and Pacemaker, had \\"jet-age\\" body styling. Sears sold a version of these models under the Allstate brand. Cushman scooters featured an automatic centrifugal clutch, which allowed the rider to twist the right grip to accelerate. Oddly, the throttle twisted forward during acceleration, opposite the usual pattern in most other motorcycles and scooters. Cushman claimed 75 miles per gallon, and advertised penny-a-mile operating cost. Cushman scooters usually weighed about 250 to 335 pounds and had as much as .

After attending high school in Fort Worth, Texas, Williams played football at Oklahoma State University. He was a second-round draft pick by the Broncos in 2005. Williams was killed in a drive-by shooting the day after he finished his second season with the Broncos. High school Born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, Williams attended O. D. Wyatt High School, where he played cornerback and was also a punt returner. As a senior, he was named 7-4A Defensive Most Valuable Player after posting five interceptions that featured several long returns, including a best of 54 yards. As a punt returner, Williams averaged 30 yards per return with four touchdowns. Williams received little recruiting attention during high school, receiving offers only from Texas Christian University, Louisiana Tech University and Oklahoma State University. Reportedly, he was the last player signed of the 2001 class, and was only signed after an OSU coach's wife urged her husband to evaluate his talent further, as she was his school counselor. College Williams played college football for Oklahoma State University. He played ten games his first year, becoming a starter during the second half of the season. In Williams' freshman year, he returned two interceptions for touchdowns against Baylor. During the post-game press-conference, it was revealed that he had predicted he would do this in a statement to then head coach, Les Miles. As a sophomore, Williams started all of the team's thirteen games, recording 53 tackles and three interceptions, while breaking up 13 passes. During his junior year, Williams continued to start for the Cowboys. He posted 66 tackles and six interceptions (third in the Big 12 Conference). He also broke up 17 passes. His junior-year performance earned him first-team All-Big 12 Conference honors. Williams' played in only seven games in his last year at Oklahoma State. He missed the last three games because of injury and was limited before that because of an arm injury. Still, Williams totaled 21 tackles (18 solo), three pass breakups, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery, which he returned 53 yards. Williams finished his collegiate career tied for first place all-time in Division I college football in career interception returns for touchdowns. He had 11 career interceptions and scored 9 touchdowns on returns (5 interception returns, 3 punt returns and 1 blocked extra point return). Professional career =2005 NFL Combine= Williams was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round (56th overall) in the 2005 NFL Draft. He recorded his first career interception on November 13, 2005 versus the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders were driving to score, when quarterback Kerry Collins attempted a pass to wide receiver Jerry Porter. Williams jumped the route, intercepted the ball and took it 82 yards for the touchdown. The Broncos won the game, 31–17. Williams established himself as the Broncos' starting cornerback, recording 58 tackles and two interceptions. He also led the Broncos in punt and kick returns. His nine starts at cornerback in 2005 were the most for a Broncos rookie at that position since Louis Wright started 11 games in 1975. An injury kept Williams out of the Broncos' lineup for the last three games of the season. Williams was recognized as a first-team All- Rookie selection by Pro Football Weekly and the Pro Football Writers Association. Williams played in 15 games during the 2006 season, recording 86 tackles (77 solo) and four interceptions (returning one for a touchdown), as well as serving as the team's primary punt returner. His last game was a season-ending home loss to the San Francisco 49ers. In that game, played mere hours before his death, Williams had three tackles and returned two punts for 50 yards before leaving the game with a shoulder injury late in the second half. For his career, Williams had 1 sack, 2 forced fumbles, 6 interceptions, and 2 touchdowns. Death On January 1, 2007, Williams was killed during a drive-by shooting at approximately 2:10 A.M. Williams and two other passengers were shot when another vehicle pulled beside his rented Hummer H2 limousine in downtown Denver, Colorado.

The vehicle was registered to Brian Hicks, a 28-year-old Crips gang member, who was already incarcerated awaiting trial for attempted murder and drug charges. Associates of Hicks were questioned as potential material witnesses to the Williams shooting. Rumors persist that it was a gang-related event because many club-goers have attested to seeing Williams along with members of his group showing Bloods gang signs and verbally representing Bloods; however, there has not been any concrete evidence to suggest that. Williams' family and teammates also say that the scenario was untrue. Williams was survived by his seven-year-old son, four-year-old daughter and 24-year-old girlfriend, all of whom live in Fort Worth, Texas. A memorial fund was set up in their name. Denver Nuggets players Carmelo Anthony and Kenyon Martin, who were with Williams at the nightclub the evening of the shooting, planned to honor their friend by possibly setting up a college fund for Williams' children.

It is perhaps best known for its leading role in the design and manufacture of rigid airships, commonly referred to as Zeppelins due to the company's prominence. The name 'Luftschiffbau' is a German word meaning building of airships. The company was founded by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in 1908 as a formal entity to continue advancing his pioneering research into rigid airships. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin became the leading manufacturer in the field of large lighter-than-air vehicles; its products were used in both military and civilian capacities. The firm founded DELAG, the world's first airline to use an aircraft in revenue service, in 1909 on the back of public interest and using its own airships. During the First World War, Zeppelins were employed as the first long distance strategic bombers, launching numerous raids upon Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Following Count von Zeppelin's death in 1917, control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. Hugo Eckener, an enthusiastic proponent of the civil value of airships. However, Germany's zeppelins were claimed by the Allies as war reparations. The company continued to innovate during the Interwar period, constructing the largest rigid airship in history, the LZ 129 Hindenburg, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class. However, the company's fortunes soured during the Nazi era, particularly following the high-profile Hindenburg disaster. Its airships were grounded and scrapped in 1940 to produce fixed-wing combat aircraft for Nazi Germany's war machine. During the Second World War, the company became involved in the manufacture of the V2 rocket; its facilities were hit by Allied bombing raids and it all but ceased to exist in the final months of the conflict. During the 1980s, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH was revived from its residual assets, it has since become a major shareholder in the company ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, which developed and produces the Zeppelin NT, a next generation airship.  History  The LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin departing for DELAG, the world's first airline Graf Zeppelin above St. Paul's Cathedral in London =Formative years= During 1900, Count von Zeppelin's first airship performed its maiden flight. Initially, his research was being financed by the count himself, as well as by private donations, and even a lottery; public interest in Zeppelin's activities grew with the success of each flight. In 1908, the Zeppelin LZ 4 was destroyed during a high-profile test flight. However, this apparent setback proved fortunate in the long run since its loss caused a flood of public support; the ensuing donation campaign collected over six million German marks, which was used to set up both 'Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH' as well as the Zeppelin foundation. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin proceeded to design and manufacture a range of Zeppelin airships, which found use within both the civilian and military sectors. The company played a leading role in the field of large lighter-than-air vehicles, establishing numerous firsts and innovations over the following decades. One such innovation was the founding of DELAG in 1909, the world's first airline to use an aircraft in revenue service. At the time, orders from the German Army were not immediately forthcoming, thus Alfred Colsman, Zeppelin Luftschiffbau's business manager, suggested harnessing the German public's enthusiasm for airships via the establishment of a commercial passenger-carrying company.Robinson 1973, p. 52. By July 1914, DELAG's Zeppelins had transported 34,028 passengers on 1,588 commercial flights; the fleet had flown 172,535 kilometres in 3,176 hours.\\"Zeppelin-Wegbereiter des Weltluftverkehrs\\", 1966. =World War One= During the First World War, Imperial Germany decided to deploy Zeppelins as long-distance bombers, launching numerous attacks upon Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. While the direct military effect of these zeppelin raids has been seen as limited, their novelty generated widespread alarm and caused substantial resources to be diverted from the Western Front to address them. At the time, the impact of such raids was overestimated in terms of both the material and psychological effects of the bombing of cities.Fredette 1974, p. 245. One inadvertent consequence was the launch of a parliamentary inquiry under Jan Smuts, whose report led to the creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) on 1 April 1918.Fredette 1974, p. 212. Zeppelin technology improved considerably as a result of the conflict. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin came under government control and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist Paul Jaray and the stress engineer Karl Arnstein. Many technological advances originated from the firm's competitor, the Mannheim-based Schütte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Schütte's more scientific approach to airship design led to innovations such as the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions,University of Constance. Gefahren und Strapazen der Luftschiffeinsätze , upper platforms with machine- gun positions and gas ventilation shafts which transferred vented hydrogen to the top of the airship. New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.Robinson 1973, pp. 89-90. In 1917, Count von Zeppelin died; control of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin fell to Dr. Hugo Eckener, who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war and hoped to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; LZ 120 Bodensee {Scrapped July 1928}, which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship LZ 121 Nordstern, {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to Stockholm.Robinson 1973, pp. 257-258. However, in 1921, the Allied Powers demanded that these airships should be handed over as war reparations as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily resorted to the manufacture of aluminium cooking utensils.Robinson 1973, p. 259. =Interwar and Second World War= Between the mid 1920s and 1940, the company worked closely with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to manufacture a pair of Zeppelins in the United States; to cement this relationship, a joint venture company, the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, was created to handle such activities. The first airship to be produced under this initiative, the LZ 126, performed its first flight on 27 August 1924. However, the Goodyear-Zeppelin partnership was terminated following the outbreak of the Second world War. Despite this, the American company continued to produce blimps for several decades under the Goodyear name. During 1926, restrictions on airship construction were relaxed by the Locarno treaties, but acquiring the necessary funds for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin's next project proved problematic in the difficult economic situation of post–First World War Germany, requiring two years of lobbying and publicity work to secure the realization of Graf Zeppelin, christened in honour of the firm's founder. On 18 September 1928, when the completed Graf Zeppelin flew for the first time. In the following years, it was not only commenced transatlantic commercial passenger flights but performed several record-breaking flights, including a successful circumnavigation of the globe.Swinfield 2012, pp. 237-239. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin was keen to continue advancing the capabilities of its airships and begun design work on an even larger airship during the late 1920s.Robinson 1973, p. 283. Perhaps the single most famous airship was the LZ 129 Hindenburg, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class. It was a large commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, being the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume.\\"Hindenburg Statistics.\\" airships.net, 2009. Retrieved: 22 July 2017. Hindenburg was constructed by the company between 1931 and 1936, and performed its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on 4 March 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard.Lehmann 1937, p. 323. It subsequently performed propaganda flight around Germany in conjunction with other airships, in addition to transatlantic commercial passenger flights to destinations in both North and South America.Lehmann 1937, pp. 323–332, 341.\\"Hindenburg Begins First U.S. Flight.\\" New York Times, May 7, 1936.\\"Hindenburg Flight Schedules.\\" Airships.net. Retrieved 27 October 2010. The company's fortunes were greatly influenced by the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany during 1933. On the whole, Nazi Germany placed a greater value on 'heavier than air' aircraft over that of zeppelins due to their military superiority. Despite this, zeppelins were prominently used by the nation for a number of major propaganda campaigns, allegedly to great effect.Lehmann 1937, pp. 323–332. As a consequence of accepting 11 million marks from Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda and Göring's Air Ministry, the company was effectively divided, with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin making the airships and the Deutsche Zeppelin- Reederei company (affiliated with Lufthansa) operating them. Officially, Hugo Eckener was the head of both entities but, in practice, Ernst Lehmann, who was less opposed to the Nazi regime, ran the latter. As a result of Eckener's criticism of the Nazi regime, Goebbels had ordered his censoring across all forms of public media in 1936.Robinson 1973, p. 282. However, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin lose much of its favour amongst political circles following the high- profile Hindenburg disaster; the event compelled the firm to terminate Zeppelin manufacturing in 1938, while all operations of existing airships was ceased by 1940. In August 1939, the Graf Zeppelin II conducted a reconnaissance flight along Great Britain's coastline in an attempt to determine whether the 100 metre towers erected from Portsmouth to Scapa Flow were used for aircraft radio location.Robinson 1973, p. 295. The frames of Graf Zeppelin and Graf Zeppelin II, along with scrap material from the Hindenburg, were subsequently scrapped that same year for their materials, which were used to fulfil wartime demands for fixed-wing military aircraft for the Luftwaffe.Mooney 1972, p. 262. During the autumn of 1941, the company accepted contracts to produce elements of the V-2 rocket, specifically propellant tanks and fuselage sections. By 17 August 1942, the Allies had suspected that the Zeppelin Works in Friedrichshafen (as well as the Henschel Raxwerke) were involved in the supply chain of the V-2, and on 25 July 1943, British MP Duncan Sandys reported that Friedrichshafen photos depicted rocket firing sites like Test Stand VII at Peenemünde. During the previous month, Allied bombing during Operation Bellicose had hit the Zeppelin V-2 facility, leading to production being subsequently relocated to the Mittelwerk. During the final months of the conflict, the company effectively ceased to exist, disappearing sometime around 1945. =Re-emergence= Almost 50 years following its disappearance, the company was regenerated from its residual assets. During 1993, the parent group company of the current Zeppelin maker was re-established, while the operating company producing the current Zeppelins was created in 2001. The modern development and construction that is embodied by the Zeppelin NT had been financed by a long-standing endowment, which had been initially funded with money left over from the earlier Zeppelin company, that had been under the trusteeship of the Mayor of Friedrichshafen. A stipulation had been placed upon the endowment that limited the use of its funds to the field of airships. Over the many years, the investment value of the endowment grew to a point where it had become viable for the funds to be put to use for the purpose of designing, developing, and constructing of a new generation of Zeppelins. In 1988, the first considerations into the technological and economic feasibility of reviving the Zeppelin industry began; this included examinations of historic Zeppelin documentation as well as current designs for airships.\\"History: From first concept, to series production.\\" Zeppelin NT, Retrieved: 7 July 2016. In December 1990, a feasibility study and accompanying market research program found an initial sales potential for around 80 Zeppelin airships for purposes such as tourism, advertising, and scientific research. In mid 1991, the newly formed development team filed several patents on various technologies that would be later used on the subsequent airship, these included propeller arrangements, structure and girder design, and ballonet implementation. In March 1991, a flyable remote control proof of concept model was demonstrated, which is claimed to have revealed excellent flight characteristics from the onset. In September 1993, the Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH (ZLT) was founded in Friedrichshafen as a corporate spin-off of the original Zeppelin company to pursue development and production of the new generation of Zeppelins, later known as the Zeppelin NT (New Technology). By spring 1994, preparatory studies for a full-sized prototype were underway. In 1995, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt, Germany's civil aviation authority, officially recognized ZLT as a design organisation, and approved new construction regulations for airships. In November 1995, final assembly of the first airship prototype commenced, it was promoted as being the first rigid airship to be produced by the firm since the Second World War.\\"Zeppelin prototype enters final assembly.\\" Flight International, 22 November 1995. In July 1996, the under-construction prototype of the Zeppelin NT 07 was presented to the public and the media. In September 1997, the prototype performed its maiden flight at Friedrichshafen; piloted by US test pilot Scott Danneker, it flew for a total of 40 minutes.\\"Zeppelin flies NT airship prototype.\\" Flight International, 8 October 1997. On 3 May 2011, Goodyear confirmed their intentions to reinstate their historic partnership with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Accordingly, Goodyear placed an order for three Zeppelin NT LZ N07-101 models with plans to commence operation in January 2014. The Zeppelin NT is the successor to Goodyear's non- rigid airship, the GZ-20 in Goodyear airship advertising. The first of these airships, referred to as Wingfoot One, was introduced during mid-2014.

The group has about fifteen volunteers in addition to its most prominent members, Daryle Lamont Jenkins, its founder, and Joshua Hoyt, who joined the group in 2002. It has been called \\"the most mainstream and well-known anti-fascist or antifa\\" organization in the United States. Its motto is \\"Hate Has Consequences\\". OPP originated from a July 4, 2000 protest against a Nationalist Movement rally in Morristown, New Jersey that was billed as Independence from Affirmative-Action Day. The counter- demonstration was called the One People's Rally. Three hundred anti-racist protesters turned out to face nine supporters of the Nationalist Movement.ADL.org, Richard Barrett At the time, Jenkins was a member of the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based group New Jersey Freedom Organization (NJFO). Originally named One People's Coalition, with Jenkins as its spokesperson, the group researched and published information about the Nationalist Movement's awards ceremony at the Manville Veterans of Foreign Wars hall. This led to the cancellation of the event. Over the next year, the renamed One People's Project broadened their focus, to publish information on their website about American conservatives, in addition to those on the far right. In November 2001, OPP began focusing heavily on white supremacist groups that were attempting to take advantage of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The most notable of these groups was the Hillsboro, West Virginia-based National Alliance. OPP has published phone numbers, home addresses and workplace addresses of individuals they have identified as being far right and/or racist. While this practice has invited criticism by those who say that it can incite others to violence, the group has defended this practice as using the same free speech rights that anti-abortion extremists used to intimidate abortion providers. On July 28, 2007, when a rally was organized to support a plan by the mayor of Morristown, New Jersey, to deputize law enforcement officials to enforce immigration laws via the Immigration and Nationality Act, OPP posted a notice on their website calling the event an \\"anti-immigrant rally\\", although the organizer described it as a rally against illegal immigration. After the rally, the OPP website included the following statement: \\"[w]e don't think anyone is going to lose any sleep over people chanting during the anti-immigrant side's salute to the flag, Nazis getting slapped around a bit or the pain Robb Pearson & Co. feel over being called racist all the time.\\"One Peoples Project - Nazis, Nationalists, Know Nothings & Neo-Cons: It'S An Anti-Immigration Rally In New Jersey! According to the OPP website, all charges were dropped when one of those supporters was also charged for his role in the fight, and an agreement was reached.One People's Project - All Charges Dismissed from '07 Morristown Anti-Immigration Rally In 2011, writer David Yeagley filed a lawsuit against Jenkins and OPP for participating in actions that allegedly led to the cancellation of an American Renaissance conference in 2010, where he was supposed to speak. According to Yeagley's lawsuit, OPP and others contacted hotels hosting the conference, \\"threatening, murder, violence and other forms of retribution\\" should the event take place. The hotels have never confirmed that this happened, and no charges have been laid, but Yeagley, who died in March 2014, was awarded $50,000 in a default judgement that Jenkins has said cannot be enforced until the case is filed in Pennsylvania.http://www.metro.us/newyork/news/local/2014/03/16/philly- activist-ready-celebrate-death-midwest-racist-won-50k-judgement/ OPP has played a role in reforming several neo-Nazis, most notably Bryon Widner, a former member of the Vinlanders Social Club who left his beliefs behind with the help of Jenkins and, with further help from the Southern Poverty Law Center, was able to get a massive amount of tattoos removed from his face and hands.

The Capping Show is the name given to the University of Otago student revue. It has run since 1894 making it the world's second longest running student revue. Each year the Capping Show is roughly 2 hours long and made up of comedy sketches and musical numbers. It touches on many of the current and not so current events of the past few years, satirizing people and problems in an uncommonly brash manner. Since the University of Otago is located in Dunedin, a good section of the show makes fun of the Dunedin and the University. It is currently being performed at the College Auditorium at the University of Otago. Previous locations include the Regent Theatre and Castle lecture theatre. The Capping Show also features the comic talents of the Sexytet, the traditional Capping Sextet, the Selwyn Ballet and the Knox Farce.  Format  The show generally follows the same format since the late-1990s, although there have been minor alterations. 2008 Capping Show: The Capping Show Begins... Forever (returns) = Main Sketch = A main sketch was introduced by Roger Hall and Lisa Warrington in the late 80s to introduce structure to the show. The main sketch has a central theme that is followed through its various scenes. The theme is usually either based on a pop culture movie/book (Batman) or a general idea (e.g. The end of the world). The current format of the main sketch involves a video opening and three scenes in the first half. The second half also consists of three or four scenes. = Sketches = A majority of the show is made up of single sketches. These sketches are unrelated from the main sketch and usually resolved by the end of the scene. In rare occasions, the sketch may link with another sketch later on. The length of the sketches can range from very short (~10 s) to quite long (4–5 min). = Video = Since 2000, video sketches have been introduced to the show. Originally used only in the main sketch, they recently expanded to stand alone sketches as a way of covering scene changes. Now they are a vital part of both the main and stand alone sketches. They are displayed on a projector screen next to the stage. = Musical Numbers = The show usually contains a musical number at the opening and closing of the show. Both numbers are themed with the main sketch and involve the full cast. The lyrics of the songs chosen are changed to relate to the show. The music is usually played by a live band, though some years the music + lyrics have been pre-recorded. While it does not happen every year, other musical numbers can occur throughout the show and these don't relate to the main sketch. Some of the starring members of the 2009 Selwyn Ballet = Sextet = The Capping Sextet is a male voice ensemble consisting of six members who sing three songs during each half of the show. Earliest surviving records show a group called 'The Coons' appearing in 1903. Although it is not clear what they sang, the majority of material in the early concerts was topical. In 1905 the group was listed as the ‘Coon Tableau and Cake Walk’ and in 1906 they were called a ‘Character Quartette’. 1910 saw their number increase to a ‘Quintette’ and as early as 1911 the group was becoming famous for their topical songs. These were sometimes as long as 15 verses, with each verse commenting on a different local or campus based topic. The first time the name ‘Sextette’ was used was in 1912, however the group numbered five from 1913–1915. With the outbreak of war Capping Concerts from 1916–1918 were suspended. 1919 saw the return of the show and the return of a ‘Quintette’. It is in this year that we have the earliest known member of the group – Amos Robinson McKegg who was a member from 1919–1921. His son Robert was a member from 1956–1961. By the 1920s the responsibility of delivering topical verses during the show was now falling almost exclusively on the Sextet. From 1922–25 the group always had six members and this then fixed the name Sextet. A student at the university during this period, Arthur Porritt (later Queen’s surgeon and Governor General of NZ), recalled that, ‘they were always an excellent turn – topical, amusing, lively and energetic’. Originally the Sextet appeared in dinner suits and later tailcoats and from the 1930s they sang one half of the show in clown costumes. As during WW1, Capping Concerts were suspended from 1942–1944. Herbert ‘Barney’ G. Feltham was given the responsibility of resurrecting the Sextet in 1945. Among the members at this time was Bryan Drake who would go on to create various roles in world premieres of music by Benjamin Britten. Keith Monagan, a member 1948–1951 recalled in a letter ‘To attain membership of the Sextet was the height of ‘having arrived’ at university. It was tremendous fun, very much drunken fun, but we were serious in that we practised a great deal..’ This status was reflected in that the group was given the stars’ dressing room at the St James Theatre. In the 1960s the show was so popular that three long play records of the Sextet and other musical parts of the show were made. With the inclusion of women now standard a group of women decided it was time for a female Sextet. The ODT commented ‘year by year the male domination of the Capping Concert has been whittled away. This year comes the final blow to the tradition. The most exclusive of institutions, the all-male Varsity Sextet, has been joined by a Sextette. The girls do a good job, but their voices are not strong enough and most of their words are lost'. (ODT 3 May 1966). The female group did not survive at this time but the involvement of women with the Sextet continued in 1969 when Jane Faulkner became the Sextet pianist. She later went on to become Music Director of the group from 1970–1972. The Sextet and its equally long running companion Selwyn Ballet lapsed in 1973 as the Capping Committee decided to put on a play. The revue format of the show returned in 1975 and the Sextet and Selwyn Ballet resumed their traditional duties. The man given the job of resurrecting the Sextet was Simon Skinner. He contacted then music student Richard Madden. Richard and his brother Gerald, both from a musical family and members of the St Paul’s Cathedral Choir brought in friends who also had good musical and choral backgrounds. They were given free licence to do what they wanted with the format, but knew that songs of the topical nature were part of the history. It was at this time that the 4–6 part harmony developed through the arranging skills of Richard Madden and the influence of a visit to Dunedin by the Kings’ Singers in 1972. Thus, audiences began to enjoy the Sextet not only for their wit but also the arrangements that they performed. During the late 1970s Marama Singers was also a male group run by Dr Patrick Little, and eventually repertoire from the two groups began to merge. It was during this period (in 1975) that saw the introduction of pierrot make-up. This, along with the clown costumes immediately identifies the group to the public and of course continues today. Since the late 1970s the group has continued to go from strength to strength helped by the creative wit of the members, the famous arrangements done by Prof John Drummond, and lyrics supplied to them from the late Nigel Eastgate. Never a member of the group, Nigel penned the legendary ‘Sideways’ and ‘Tight Mistress’ and ‘Tired of Muldoon’ lyrics as well as dozens of topical songs for more than 40 years for the group. In the early days Keith Stronach, a member in the early 1930s kept sending lyrics to the group for more than 20 years. Similarly Bill Hilliker a member in 1929, 1933 and 1934 maintained a lifelong interested in the Sextet auditioning members until the early 1960s. Ian C. Robertson sang in the group in the early 1960s but continued to assist them musically until 1969. It is people such as these that, along with the dedicated members that has enabled the Sextet to survive. Notable former members include, Peter Chin, Sir William Southgate, Bryan Drake, Dr John Borrie, Geoffrey de Lautour, Roger Wilson, Piri Sciascia, Richard Madden, Martin Snell, Simon O'Neill, Jonathan Lemalu, and Tecwyn Evans, = Sexytet = The Sexytet is the female a cappella singing group, who joined the capping show in 2001. They perform in both the first and second half of the show. The group rewrites and arranges popular songs. Their now-traditional outfit echoes a 1950s housewife, with a new pattern every year. = Selwyn Ballet = The Selwyn Ballet is an all-male ballet company made up of students from the Selwyn College, Otago. Since starting in 1928 they perform a ballet number at the end of the first half.  Best of  Occasionally, usually every three years, a show is put on as part of the Dunedin Fringe Festival. Usually 40 minutes long, it consists of sketches from the previous three years of capping show. The most recent one was in the 2011 Fringe festival.  Controversies  In 2010 Rape Crisis Dunedin accused the Sextet of trivialising rape and sexual abuse. In response, the line within the offending sextet song was removed. Rape Crisis Dunedin declined to be the Otago University Students Association (OUSA) official Capping Show charity for that year. Rape Crisis Dunedin was the official Capping Show charity again in 2014.

The game was originally intended to be an Urusei Yatsura game, but for an unknown reason the license was not obtained for the arcade version - while the characters were changed, Lum's Love Song, the first opening theme of the TV series, still loops throughout the game. However, the Family Computer port retained the license and was titled Urusei Yatsura: Lum's Wedding Bell. The game was re- released for Mobile Phones in Japan on February 28, 2006. Three mobile phone sequels were released, Momoko 1200%, Momoko 1200% in Machigai Sagashi, and Momoko no Kasei Bowling ~La Mars Cup~, were released in Japan only in 2006. Gameplay Photo of arcade title screen This platform game features Momoko, a young Japanese girl who ages by several years each time the player reaches the next level. The goal for each level is to quickly climb several floors by escalator, ladder, or trampoline in the building she is in before the fire that is below her reaches her. These level settings start out from grade school settings to office type buildings. While jumping over obstacles, she must shoot various alien-like enemies that come after her on each floor. She can upgrade her weapon by destroying certain enemies as well as entering special hidden doorways which feature minigames which require you to jump obstacles. These doorways can also be used as a short-cut, and sometimes they are mandatory to be used in order to climb to the next floor. When Momoko reaches the top floor of a level, she must jump onto a small blimp flying above her to beat the level. Momoko begins as a four-year-old and ages through five levels. The final level is a bonus chance in which she is a twenty-year- old bride collecting items - the game concludes with her getting married, thus giving birth to a new Momoko and starting the cycle anew. Urusei Yatsura: Lum's Wedding Bell In , the player controls Lum as she grows up and has to avoid alien invaders while trying to reach her rescue UFO. The game's storyline involves a severe earthquake striking in Tomobiki-cho (the town where the Urusei Yatsura series takes place) and tearing the space-time continuum, forcing Lum to have to travel forward through time in order to be reunited with her \\"darling\\" Ataru Moroboshi. The player starts out at infant school, then works her way to elementary school, junior high school, high school, college, and finally the player marries a bridegroom (Ataru) in a white tie outfit. After that, the game starts over again. The game has never been released outside Japan.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Momoko 120% on their October 15, 1986 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

She was serving, by this time, as a courtesan to wealthy and powerful men of the day, and she chose her lovers carefully. She associated herself with Kaiser Wilhelm II, Prince Albert I of Monaco, King Edward VII, Kings of Serbia, and Kings of Spain as well as Russian Grand Dukes Peter and Nicholas, the Duke of Westminster and writer Gabriele D'Annunzio. Her love affairs made her notorious, and the envy of many other notable female personalities of the day. Six men reportedly committed suicide after their love affairs with Otero ended, although this has never been substantiated beyond a doubt. It is a fact, however, that two men did fight a duel over her. =Early film= In August 1898, in St-Petersburg, the French film operator Félix Mesguich (an employee of the Lumière company) shot a one-minute reel of Otero performing the famous \\"Valse Brillante.\\" The screening of the film at the Aquarium music-hall provoked such a scandal (because an officer of the Tsar's army appeared in this frivolous scene) that Mesguich was expelled from Russia.Jacques Rittaud-Hutinet (1990).

In 1929, Fellgiebel became head of the () cipher bureau of the Reichswehrministerium, which would eventually become the OKW/Chi. He was a signals specialist and was instrumental in introducing a common enciphering machine, the Enigma machine. However, he was unsuccessful in promoting a single cipher agency to coordinate all operations, as was demanded by OKW/Chi and was still blocked by Joachim von Ribbentrop, Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring until autumn 1943. It was not achieved until General Albert Praun took over the post. Military career Fellgiebel was born in Pöpelwitz (Present- day Popowice in Wrocław, Poland) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. At the age of 18, he joined a signals battalion in the Prussian Army as an officer cadet. During the First World War, he served as a captain on the General Staff. After the war he was assigned to Berlin as a General Staff officer of the Reichswehr. His service had been exemplary, and in 1928 he was promoted to the rank of major. Fellgiebel was promoted lieutenant colonel in 1933, and became a full colonel (Oberst) the following year. By 1938, he was a major general. That year, he was appointed Chief of the Army's Signal Establishment and Chief of the Wehrmachts communications liaison to the Supreme Command (OKW). Fellgiebel became General der Nachrichtentruppe (General of the Communications Troops) on 1 August 1940. In 1942, Fellgiebel was promoted to Chief Signal Officer of Army High Command and of Supreme Command of Armed Forces (), a position he held until 1944 when he was arrested. Adolf Hitler did not fully trust Fellgiebel; Hitler considered him too independent-minded, but Hitler needed Fellgiebel's expertise. Fellgiebel was one of the first to understand that the German military should adopt and use the Enigma encryption machine. As head of Hitler's signal services, Fellgiebel knew every military secret, including Wernher von Braun's rocketry work at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. Resistance activities Through his acquaintance with Colonel General Ludwig Beck, his superior, and then Beck's successor, Colonel- General Franz Halder, Fellgiebel contacted the anti-Nazi resistance group in the Wehrmacht armed forces. In the 1938 September Conspiracy on the eve of the Munich Agreement, he was supposed to cut communications throughout Germany while Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben would occupy Berlin. Fellgiebel was again involved in the preparations for Operation Valkyrie and during the attempt on the Führers life on 20 July 1944 tried to cut Hitler's headquarters at Wolf's Lair in East Prussia off from all telecommunication connections. He only partly succeeded, as he could not prevent the informing of Joseph Goebbels in Berlin via separate SS links. When it became clear that the attempt had failed, Fellgiebel had to override the communications black-out he had set up. Fellgiebel's most famous act that day was his telephone report to his co-conspirator General Fritz Thiele at the Bendlerblock, after he was informed that Hitler was still alive: \\"Etwas Furchtbares ist passiert! Der Führer lebt!\\" (\\"Something awful has happened! The Führer lives!\\"). Fellgiebel was arrested immediately at Wolf's Lair and tortured for three weeks, but did not reveal any names of his co-conspirators. He was charged before the Volksgerichtshof (\\"People's Court\\"). On 10 August 1944, he was found guilty by Roland Freisler and sentenced to death. He was executed on 4 September 1944 at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. Memorials The Bundeswehrs barracks, a signals and intelligence school (\\"Führungsunterstützungsschule\\") in Pöcking-Maxhof is named the General-Fellgiebel-Kaserne in his honour. Fictional portrayals Holger Petzold portrayed General Fellgiebel in the miniseries War and Remembrance in 1989. Vernon Dobtcheff portrayed him in the 1990 television film The Plot to Kill Hitler. Fellgiebel was portrayed by Harald Krassnitzer in the 2004 German TV film Stauffenberg. He was portrayed by actor and comedian Eddie Izzard in the 2008 Bryan Singer thriller Valkyrie.

His primary instrument is the guitar. He has played in various rock genres, including punk rock, roots rock and alternative country, and is most closely associated with the music scene in Austin, Texas. He comes from a well-known family of musicians. Biography The son of Mexican immigrants to Texas, Escovedo is from a family that includes several professional musicians, including his brothers (and percussionists) Coke Escovedo and Pete Escovedo, and Sheila E. (Pete's daughter and Alejandro's niece). Alejandro's brother Mario fronted the hard rock band the Dragons, and another brother, Javier, was in the punk rock band the Zeros. Escovedo began performing in the first-wave punk rock group the Nuns, with Jennifer Miro and Jeff Olener, in San Francisco, California. After Escovedo's departure, the Nuns recorded an album for Posh Boy Records but had little commercial success. In the 1980s Escovedo moved to Austin, Texas, where he adopted a roots rock/alternative country style in the bands Rank and File (with Chip and Tony Kinman) and the True Believers (with his brother Javier, Jon Dee Graham and the bass player Denny DeGorio). His first solo albums, Gravity and Thirteen Years, were released in 1992 and 1994, respectively. In 1997, Escovedo collaborated with Ryan Adams and the band Whiskeytown in recording sessions for their album Strangers Almanac. He sings on \\"Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight\\", \\"Dancing with the Women at the Bar\\", and \\"Not Home Anymore\\". As a salute to Escovedo, a cover of a True Believers song written by him is covered by Whiskeytown on the re-released Strangers Almanac (deluxe edition). In 1998 No Depression magazine named him Artist of the Decade. Escovedo was also involved in a side project that represents his hard-rocking tastes. Buick MacKane released the album The Pawn Shop Years in 1997, hearkening back to his musical roots in the 1970s. In 1999, Escovedo contributed to a tribute album to Skip Spence, a co-founder of Moby Grape, who was critically ill with cancer. The album, entitled More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album, was intended to raise funds to address Spence's medical bills. The title refers to Spence's only solo album, Oar (Columbia, 1969). On More Oar, Escovedo contributes his version of Spence's \\"Diana\\". The critic Rob Brunner commented, \\"The best contributions come from artists who realize that Spence's work is as much about atmosphere as words and chords. ...Alejandro Escovedo offers an appropriately bleary 'Diana', Spence's darkest song.\\" (Birdman Records, 1999), was produced by Bill Bentley, a Warner Bros. Records executive and Austin- referenced music producer. In 2003, after having lived with hepatitis C for many years, Escovedo collapsed onstage in Arizona as a result of the disease. In his long road to recovery, he faced substantial medical bills, which, lacking medical insurance, he could not pay. Friends and admirers around the country organized benefit shows to help him. This effort grew into the album Por Vida: A Tribute to the Songs of Alejandro Escovedo, a two-disc set whose proceeds benefit the Alejandro Escovedo Medical and Living Expense Fund. Contributing musicians included Steve Earle, Jon Dee Graham, Lucinda Williams, John Cale, Jennifer Warnes, Ian Hunter, the Jayhawks, Bob Neuwirth, Son Volt, and Escovedo's brothers Pete (with Pete's daughter, Sheila E.), Javier, and Mario (as a member of the Dragons). In 2005, it became known that Escovedo's song \\"Castanets\\" was included on the iPod playlist of President George W. Bush. Upon learning this, Escovedo announced that he would not play the song again as long it was on Bush's iPod or until he was out of office. After two \\"Castanets\\"-free years, as Bush was nearing the end of his term, Escovedo lifted the moratorium and began performing the song again. Boxing Mirror came out on May 2, 2006 and included many of the songs he had promoted with the Alejandro Escovedo String Quintet, including Jon Dee Graham. Escovedo went on a short tour with the Quintet, which included a date at Carnegie Hall's Zankel Hall in early December 2006. In April 2008, Escovedo changed managers, hiring managers Jon Landau and Barbara Carr. Escovedo released Real Animal, produced by Tony Visconti, on June 24, 2008. All of the songs were co-written with Chuck Prophet. In 2009, Escovedo was invited to contribute to a tribute album to the late Doug Sahm. He contributed his version of \\"Too Little Too Late\\" to Keep Your Soul: A Tribute to Doug Sahm (Vanguard Records). In June 2010, Escovedo released Street Songs of Love, also produced by Visconti but released on a new label, featuring songs that were originally presented during \\"Sessions on South Congress\\" at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas with his band, The Sensitive Boys. After starting out writing about nothing in particular, the record “ended up being an album about love, the pursuit of a feeling that is forever elusive, mysterious, and addictive,” said Escovedo. A New York Times \\"critic's choice\\" review of Street Songs of Love claimed that, \\"In another, less fragmented pop era, this would be the album of thoughtful but radio-ready love songs to finally get Mr. Escovedo the big national audience he deserves.\\"Pareles, Jon (July 4, 2010).\\"Straightforward, Straight- from-Texas Rock\\" New York Times. Nationally syndicated radio shows such as Little Steven Van Zandt's Underground Garage gave prominent attention to Escovedo and his album, continuing to play the song \\"Silver Cloud\\" in particular well into the following year. In 2014, Escovedo appeared in the movie and contributed to the soundtrack of the movie Veronica Mars, singing an acoustic version of \\"We Used to Be Friends\\". Also that year, he co-produced and co-hosted the SXSW Tribute to Lou Reed with Richard Barone.SXSW In 2016 Escovedo mentored the singer-songwriter Jeremy Nail and produced Nail's new record, \\"My Mountain\\". Escovedo (seated in center, wearing a Stetson), backed by (from left to right): Scott McCaughey, Peter Buck, John Moen, Kelly Hogan, and Kurt Bloch in 2017 In October 2016, Escovedo released the album Burn Something Beautiful, which had been recorded in April of that year with the Minus Five, in Portland, Oregon. In January 2017, Escovedo did a short tour supporting the album, backed by Minus Five members Scott McCaughey, Kurt Bloch, Peter Buck, John Moen, and sometimes Kelly Hogan, all of whom had performed on the album. All songs on Burn Something Beautiful were written by Escovedo, McCaughey, and Buck.

Overview Block programming involves scheduling a series of related shows which are likely to attract and hold a given audience for a long period of time. Notable examples of overt block programming were NBC's Thursday evening \\"Must See TV\\" lineup, which included two hours of sitcoms and one hour of ER, and Channel 4's \\"T4\\" program which often ran sitcoms like Friends back-to-back for an hour or more. Reruns on cable television are often assembled into similar blocks to fill several hours of generally little- watched daytime periods. A particularly long program block, especially one that does not air on a regular schedule, is known as a marathon. Block programming in radio also refers to programming content that appeals to various demographics in time blocks, usually corresponding to the top or bottom of the hour or the quarter-hour periods. For example, various musical genres might be featured, such as a country music hour, a three-hour afternoon block of jazz, or a four-hour Saturday night '70s disco show. Generally speaking, block programming is anathema to modern competitive commercial radio, which traditionally uses uniform formats, other than a handful of speciality shows in off-peak hours such as weekends (for instance, the infamous beaver hours in Canadian radio). The general rationale for not using block programming is that listeners expect a certain type of music when they tune into a radio station and breaking from that format will turn those listeners away from the station; likewise, a station that airs its programming in hodgepodge blocks will have difficulty building listener loyalty, as listeners' music will only be on for a few hours of the day. This argument for homogenized radio was also a driving force behind the effective death of freeform radio in the late 20th century. The case of talk radio is indicative of the decline of block programming: prior to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to mix various blocks of talk programming together on one station, but this has declined dramatically in the late 1990s and beyond. A listener to a conservative talk radio station will have little interest in a progressive talk radio, sports radio or hot talk block, which reaches a different demographic; stations that have attempted the block strategy have historically been unsuccessful. Block programming of this nature is alive and well on outlets like public radio (such as NPR, BBC, or the CBC) and in multicultural radio serving broad ethnic and cultural audiences, although even in this realm the idea of block programming is declining due to competition for donations. Some programming blocks have become so popular that they have been transformed to full-fledged 24-hour channels. Current channels which started as program blocks include TeenNick (originally a program block on Nickelodeon and Noggin);'Nick’ Of Time For Rebrand - N, Noggin To Adopt Parent Net's Family Name Multichannel News March 2, 2009 Disney Junior (which is still a program block on the Disney Channel); Nick Jr. (which still airs on Nickelodeon); Boomerang (which was once a program block on Cartoon Network); and PBS Kids, a 24/7 channel, which PBS member stations are able to provide in addition to their current children's programming on the primary PBS channel. In addition, TV Land airs older shows that were once aired on sister channel Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite program block. However, since the 2010s, new programming blocks have become rare due to airing programming in a regular format or with little or no brand reference within the programming block.SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior , Entertainment Weekly, May 26, 2010 See also * Lists of programming blocks * Strip programming * Broadcast programming * Dayparting * Marathon (television) References Broadcasting ","title":"Block programming"},{"id":"2836686","text":"The City Colleges of Chicago is a system of seven community colleges and six satellite sites that provide learning opportunities for residents of the Chicago area.

A public campaign against the closure involved nationally famous lawyer Clarence Darrow and several former students and faculty. Less than one year after Crane closed, the community college reopened with additional public and private support as Theodor Herzl Junior College (named in honor of the Jewish Zionist movement founder, Theodor Herzl). Later two new campuses of Herzl J.C. opened—Wilson Junior College established on the South Side, and Wright Junior College opened in northwestern Chicago. After the United States entered World War II the U.S. military began using the junior colleges as training locations.

Originally Truman was an evening program located at the city's Amundsen High School. Although it caused a lot of controversy, Wilson J.C. was later renamed Kennedy-King College in 1969 (for Robert F. Kennedy (1925–1968), and Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929–1968)), and Herzl J.C. was closed as a college and became an elementary school, with a new Malcolm X College at a different site (for Malcolm X, 1925–1965). In the 1970s, the former Fenger and Southeast Colleges were consolidated and renamed into Olive-Harvey College. In 1988, Nelvia M.

In November 2017, news stories broke that these improvements were largely an \\"illusion\\", and that for over 10 years, City Colleges had violated its own standard as to what constitutes a degree, watered-down its curriculum, manipulated statistics, and issued thousands of degrees to current and former students who neither requested them or wanted them. During this time, enrollment sharply decreased, while the number of degrees issued more than doubled. In 2015, City Colleges adopted a program where degrees were issued to deceased students who had accumulated three-quarters of the credits necessary for graduation, further artificially inflating their graduation rate.

Among the methods used are research, consciousness- raising, political advocacy and direct action. Most such activity is a response to recruitment by state armed forces, but may also target intelligence agencies, private military companies, and non-state armed groups. Rationale Counter-recruitment poster. The rationale for counter- recruitment activity may be based on any of the following reasons: * The view that war is immoral - see pacifism. * The view that some or all military organizations are a tool of imperialism - see anti-imperialism. * Evidence from Australia, Canada, France, the UK, and the US that abusive behaviour such as bullying, racism, sexism and sexual violence, and homophobia are common in military organizations - see, for example, Women in the military and Sexual orientation and gender identity in military service. * Evidence from the UK and US that military training and employment lead to higher rates of mental health and behavioural problems than are usually found in civilian life, particularly after personnel have left the armed forces. * Evidence from Germany, Israel, the UK, the US and elsewhere that recruiting practices sanitise war, glorify the role of military personnel, and obscure the risks and obligations of military employment, thereby misleading potential recruits, particularly adolescents from socio-economically deprived backgrounds. * Evidence from Germany, the UK, the US and elsewhereBrett, Rachel, and Irma Specht. Young Soldiers: Why They Choose to Fight. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2004. that recruiters target, and capitalise on the precarious position of, socio-economically deprived young people as potential recruits, in a phenomenon sometimes called the poverty draft. * The fact that military employment suspends certain fundamental rights and freedoms (such as freedom of association and freedom of speech) and introduces new offences with heavy penalties, such as absence without leave (AWOL) (see, for example, Offences against military law in the United Kingdom). * The fact that some armed forces rely on children aged 16 or 17 to fill their ranks, and evidence from Australia, Israel, the UK and from the Vietnam era in the US that these youngest recruits are most likely to be adversely affected by the demands and risks of military life. Armed forces spokespeople have defended the status quo by recourse to the following: * The view that military organizations provide a valuable public service. * Anecdotal evidence that military employment benefits young people. * The view that duty of care policies protect recruits from harm.  Activity  Examples of counter-recruitment activity are: * Research and analysis of military recruitment practices, and of the effects and outcomes of military employment. * Legal advocacy (aimed at changing legislation) and political advocacy (aimed at changing policy) to regulate or limit the scope of military recruitment. * Consciousness-raising to raise awareness and concern about military recruitment practices and the effects of military training and employment. * Providing information to potential recruits about the risks and obligations of enlistment, or discouraging enlistment. * Satirising the propagandistic glorification of military personnel.  In the United States  Counter-recruitment (which has long been a strategy of pacifist and other anti-war groups) received a boost in the United States with the unpopularity of the war in Iraq and brief recruitment difficulties of branches of the U.S. military, particularly the Army; although the Army has met, or exceeded, its recruitment goals year after year during that period. Beginning in early 2005, the U.S. counter-recruitment movement grew, particularly on high school and college campuses, where it is often led by students who see themselves as targeted for military service in a war they do not support. =Early history= The counter-recruitment movement was the successor to the anti-draft movement with the end of conscription in the United States in 1973, just after the end of the Vietnam War. The military increased its recruiting efforts, with the total number of recruiters, recruiting stations, and dollars spent on recruiting each more than doubling between 1971 and 1974. Anti-war and anti-draft activists responded with a number of initiatives, using tactics similar to those used by counter- recruiters today. Activists distributed leaflets to students, publicly debated recruiters, and used equal-access provisions to obtain space next to recruiters to dispute their claims. The American Friends Service Committee (A.F.S.C.) and the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors (C.C.C.O.) began publishing counter-recruitment literature and attempting to coordinate the movement nationally. These organizations have been continuously involved in counter-recruitment to the present day. =High schools= Most counter- recruitment work in the U.S. is focused at the policy level of public school systems. This work is generally done by parents and grandparents of school- aged children, and the most common activity is information and advocacy with school officials (principals, school boards, etc.) and with the general population in their local school area. CR at the K12 level is categorically different from other movements, since most of the students are underaged minors and parents are their legal custodians and guardians, not the schools. The most common policy goal is that the frequency of military recruiters' visits to public schools, their locations in schools, and their types of activities be controlled rather than unlimited. Many of the larger urban school districts have implemented such guidelines since 2001. Other goals have included \\"truth in recruiting\\", that counselors or curriculum elements be implemented to address the deficiency in high school students' understanding of war and the military life, rather than allowing military recruiters to perform that role. On high school campuses, counter-recruitment activists since 2001 have also focused around a provision of the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires that high schools provide contact and other information to the military for all of their students who do not opt out. Counter-recruitment campaigns have attempted to change school policy to ban recruiters regardless of the loss of federal funds, to be active about informing students of their ability to opt out, and/or to allow counter-recruiters access to students equal to the access given to military recruiters. These political campaigns have had some success, particularly in the Los Angeles area, where one has been led by the Coalition Against Militarism in Our Schools, and the San Francisco Bay Area. A simpler and easier, though perhaps less effective, strategy by counter-recruiters has been to show up before or after the school day and provide students entering or exiting their school with opt-out forms, produced by the local school district or by a sympathetic national legal organization such as the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Lawyers Guild. Organizations which have attempted to organize such campaigns on a national scale include A.F.S.C. and C.C.C.O., the Campus Antiwar Network (C.A.N.), and the War Resisters League. Code Pink, with the Ruckus Society, has sponsored training camps on counter-recruitment as well as producing informational literature for use by counter-recruiters. United for Peace and Justice has counter-recruitment as one of its seven issue-specific campaigns. Mennonite Central Committee is another resource on the subject. Some of these organizations focus on counter-recruitment in a specific sector, such as high schools or colleges, while the National network Opposing the Militarization of Youth, founded in 2004, deals with the larger issue of militarism as it affects young people and society. In Canada In response to the Canadian Forces' role as a member of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, an anti-war movement developed in Canada which has tried to utilize counter-recruitment as a part of its efforts. In particular, Operation Objection emerged as the umbrella counter-recruitment campaign in Canada. Operation Objection claimed to have active counter-recruitment operations in 8 to 10 Canadian cities. However, coordinated attempts at counter-recruitment activism in Canada have been fairly limited as of late, and for the most part, unsuccessful. In the 2005–06 academic year at York University, the York Federation of Students, a federation representing ten of the university's student unions, clashed with a Canadian Forces recruiter forcibly removing the recruiter and the kiosk from the Student Center. York University maintains that the Canadian Forces have the same right to recruit as any other employer participating in career fairs on campus. On October 25, 2007, an attempt by the student union at the University of Victoria to ban Canadian Forces from participating in career fairs on campus failed when the student body voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing the Canadian military to participate in recruitment and career development activities available to students. Approximately 500 students, five times the usual attendance, appeared at the Annual General Meeting of the University of Victoria Students' Society (UVSS), and voted to defeat the motion proposed to stop the Canadian Forces from appearing on campus at career development events, with an estimated 25 votes in favour of the ban. Those voting against the ban argued that the ban was a restriction on freedom of choice and an infringement of students' free speech, that it went beyond the mandate of student government, and that student union executives should not be advocating policy that does not reflect the views of the fee-paying student body. In November 2007, the Minister of Education for Prince Edward Island, Gerard Greenan, was requested by the Council of Canadians to ban military recruitment on PEI campuses. The Minister responded that military service \\"is a career and... we think its right to let the Armed Forces have a chance to present this option to students.\\"  See also  * Military recruitment * Recruit training * Military personnel * Women in the military * Children in the military * Sexual harassment in the military References External links *The 2004 Official US Military School Recruiting Program Handbook *Mennonite Central Committee *National Network Opposing the Militarization of Youth, founded in 2004, deals with the larger issue of militarism as it affects young people. * Activism Anti-war Military recruitment ","title":"Counter-recruitment"},{"id":"2836718","text":"Melaleuca quinquenervia, commonly known in Australia as niaouli, broad-leaved paperbark or the paper bark tea tree, is an invasive species in the Florida Everglades. There are a number of Australian species that have become invasive when introduced into outside Australia or outside Oceania. Animals The Australian magpie was introduced into New Zealand and are considered to be a pest because of attacks on humans and a possible effect on the native bird population. The common brushtail possum was introduced to New Zealand to start a fur industry, and spread nationwide. With no natural controls they have severe impact on native plant species and thereby endanger native animals species too. Possums have also been observed eating the eggs of nesting birds such as the kereru, tui, and kaka. They are a carrier of tuberculosis which they spread to pasture and hence livestock. Control of them has been an ongoing project of regional councils, the Department of Conservation, Forest and Bird, and various other wildlife preservation organizations. Plants = Melaleucas in the Everglades = Perhaps the best known example of an Australian plant becoming an invasive species is the problematic introduction of Melaleuca quinquenervia into Florida. As with all Melaleuca species, M. quinquenervia seeds prolifically. In the absence of natural predators, it spread throughout southern Florida; at one time it was estimated that it had colonised 12% of southern Florida. The colonised area included a substantial proportion of the Everglades, an important national park and World Heritage Site. Attempts were made to control the spread by burning, but this only exacerbated the problem as it encouraged seed dispersal while failing to kill the trees. The spread of Melaleuca is now managed by a combination of regular herbicide treatment and the introduction of an Australian beetle as a biological control. = Acacia in southern Africa = A number of Acacia species have become serious environmental pests after being introduced into southern Africa. The most troublesome species are Acacia cyclops and Acacia saligna. Both are Western Australian coastal wattles, introduced to help bind drifting sand dunes. They remain serious pests, but some controls have been introduced. In the case of Acacia saligna, the introduction of acacia seed weevils (Melanterius species) has achieved complete control. A lesser degree of control has been achieved for Acacia cyclops by the introduction of a gall rust fungus (Uromycladium species). = Other plant examples = *Acaena novae-zelandiae is declared a noxious weed in the American states of Hawaii, California and Oregon. * Cupaniopsis anacardioides, the tuckeroo, has become an invasive weed along the coastline of Florida. The plant there is known as carrotwood. * Eucalyptus globulus has spread rapidly as an invasive species since being introduced into California in the mid-19th century. Its colonization is reducing habitats for native species (often by type shift from grasslands or oak woodlands), and increasing the threats and spread of wildfires. * Hakea sericea has colonised much of the Table Mountain fynbos since its introduction into South Africa. * Imperata cylindrica * Melia azedarach *Pittosporum undulatum has become invasive in the Caribbean, Hawaii, southern Brazil and in the Azores. * Schefflera actinophylla References External links *Discussion of C. anacardioides as a weed in Florida Invasive plants of Australian origin Invasive species ","title":"Invasive species of Australian origin"},{"id":"2836732","title":"Anita Stewart"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",R]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/3.md","filePath":"drive/3.md"}'),x={name:"drive/3.md"},F=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{D as __pageData,F as default};
