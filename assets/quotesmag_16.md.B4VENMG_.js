It was the only place of Roman Catholic worship during the 16th century, when Bansk√° Bystrica was in the hands of the Protestants. The choir of the church In 1647 a few Jesuits settled here and started the Catholic reform of the town and its neighbourhood. During the years 1695‚Äì1701 they built their own college on the K√∂nigberger's site. They started the building of the church in 1702 as a copy of the Church of the Gesu in Rome. The construction came to a halt when in 1703 when the town was occupied by the anti-Habsburg troops of Francis II R√°k√≥czi. The building resumed in 1709 and on 24 September 1715 the church of St. Francis Xavier was consecrated. At that time, the church was a baroque building with a single nave and six chapels. The fa√ßade lacked a tower. In 1773 the Jesuits had to leave the church when in July 1773 the Order was suppressed by Pope Clement XIV. The cathedral has been the seat of the Diocese of Bansk√° Bystrica since 1776. The two onion-shaped towers were added in 1844 during an extensive rebuilding. The nave of the church and the side galleries were lengthened and a consistory was added to the church. Another modification was performed in 1880. The towers were rearranged and a romantic balustrade was added. In the 1970s the interior was refurbished and, together with the fa√ßade, was painted. The exterior was renovated in 1999.

Life and career  Mercedes Capsir was born in Barcelona, in the same house where another Spanish soprano, Maria Barrientos, had been born 12 years earlier. She studied (piano, composition, voice) at the Conservatori Superior de M√∫sica del Liceu, before making her debut in Genora, in 1913, as Gilda in Rigoletto, a role she will remain closely associated with throughout her career. In 1916, she made her debut at the Liceu in Barcelona, the Teatro Real in Madrid, the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos in Lisbon, the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, as well as at the Paris Opera in 1917. Gilda was her debut role at all these opera houses. Her Italian debut took place in Bologna, as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia, followed by Elvira in I puritani, in Venice, opposite Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, she also appeared in Rome, before reaching La Scala in Milan, in 1924, again as Gilda, opposite baritone Carlo Galeffi and tenor Miguel Fleta, and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Capsir sang mainly in Europe, and in a very limited repertory, other roles included: Amina in La sonnambula, Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor, and Violetta in La traviata. She took part in performances of Giordano's Il Re at La Scala in 1929. Capsir retired from the stage in 1949, her final performance took place at the Liceu in Barcelona, as Carolina in Il matrimonio segreto, and then turned to teaching. She died, aged 73, in Suzzara (Lombardy, Italy). Mercedes Capsir recorded in 1928, complete versions of Il barbiere di Siviglia and Rigoletto, opposite Riccardo Stracciari and Dino Borgioli. She also recorded the first ever complete Lucia di Lammermoor and La traviata. In Spain and also for the Columbia Record Co. she recorded the Spanish zarzuela \\"Marina\\" by Arrieta in a performance which also featured Hipolito Lazaro and Jose Mardones.

It stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend. The film premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Set in 1900s Belle √âpoque Paris, Ch√©ri tells the story of an affair between a wealthy, middle-aged retired courtesan, L√©a, and Fred, nicknamed Cheri (\\"Dear\\" or \\"Darling\\"), the flamboyant spoiled, neglected 19-year-old only son of another even wealthier courtesan. A famous beauty, L√©a has been successful at extracting large sums of money from her up-scale clients, never falling in love with any of them. At first L√©a takes Ch√©ri off her \\"friend\\" (and former rival) Charlotte's hands as a favor, as his dissipated lifestyle is irritating to Charlotte and unhealthy for Ch√©ri. Although L√©a only plans on keeping Ch√©ri around for a short while, their affair turns into a six-year relationship, in which L√©a pays for Ch√©ri's expenses, (although he has access to considerable wealth from his mother) and Ch√©ri wears L√©a's silk pajamas and pearls. Although they satisfy each other both sexually and emotionally, the two convince themselves that their affair is casual, but they are the only real friend the other has. Her status as a former prostitute and his as the son of one make them outsiders who can only be fully honest and relaxed together. L√©a learns Ch√©ri's mother has arranged for Ch√©ri to marry the daughter of another courtesan, an innocent barely 18-year-old named Edm√©e, as Charlotte has decided she wants grandchildren, largely to make up for her years of neglecting Ch√©ri. Although Ch√©ri does not wish to marry Edm√©e, whom he finds boring, he has no choice in the matter, as he stands to inherit a huge fortune from Charlotte. L√©a cheerfully kicks him out of her home, but makes Ch√©ri promise to always be gentle and kind with Edm√©e, and to try to give her a good life. After Ch√©ri agrees, the two part ways, both putting on an air of breezy unconcern, as much to convince themselves as the rest of the world that their affair had just been for amusement. L√©a does not attend the wedding, and Ch√©ri and Edm√©e leave for their honeymoon. It is only after Ch√©ri is on the train to Italy for his honeymoon that both he and L√©a realise they are in love with each other. Ch√©ri consummates his marriage with Edm√©e, but their lovemaking is perfunctory, and even though Edm√©e is in love with her husband, Ch√©ri can't summon any emotion for her. L√©a visits Charlotte one last time before running off on vacation, making up a story in which she is involved in with another suitor, when in fact the only man L√©a beds while on vacation is a young bodybuilder whom she has no feelings for and regards as a one-night stand. Meanwhile, Edm√©e accuses Ch√©ri of not caring about her, and says all he ever does is think of L√©a, \\"that old woman\\". While out on the town with a friend, Ch√©ri tries opium and cocaine, and on his way back he notices that L√©a's apartment is no longer empty and she has returned home. Comforted by the fact that L√©a has returned, Ch√©ri runs home to Edm√©e where he makes love to her properly and kindly, thinking that he can now live in peace with Edm√©e, juggling both women. He sends Charlotte the next day to investigate L√©a's homelife, whereupon L√©a claims she is madly in love with her new \\"suitor\\", and Charlotte tells her that Ch√©ri and Edm√©e are likewise madly in love and happier than ever. That night, jealous and wanting to confront L√©a about her new suitor, Ch√©ri breaks into her home and admits he loves her. They make love with all the pent up passion they have been suppressing for the sake of others, and plan on running away together. In the morning, however, Ch√©ri notices the wrinkles on L√©a's face in the harsh light of day, and she sees his doubt. She apologizes to Ch√©ri for \\"ruining him\\" and making life too easy on him when they first begun their affair. L√©a tells Ch√©ri to go back to Edm√©e, for their age difference would always prevent a true relationship blossoming between them. Tentatively, Ch√©ri leaves as L√©a watches, breathlessly hoping he will turn back. Both crestfallen and elated by a new sense of freedom, he walks on, as L√©a stares into her mirror at her aging face. The narrator reflects on the injustice of fate, that L√©a was born two decades before her only true love, Ch√©ri. The narrator also reveals that, while he went through World War 1 without a scratch, Ch√©ri later realises that L√©a was the only woman he could ever love, and he commits suicide.

Reception Ch√©ri was selected for the Berlin Film Festival official competition. The movie got mixed reviews: The Times of London reviewed the film favourably, describing Hampton's screenplay as a \\"steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one-liners\\" and Pfeiffer's performance as \\"magnetic and subtle, her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache.\\" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that it was \\"fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt.\\" Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times praised the \\"wordless scenes that catch L√©a unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world. It's the kind of refined, delicate acting Pfeiffer does so well, and it's a further reminder of how much we've missed her since she's been away.\\" At Rotten Tomatoes it has a 54% or 'Rotten' rating.

(Why is the force of gravity so weak compared to the electromagnetic force and the other fundamental forces?) The model tries to explain this problem by postulating that our universe, with its four dimensions (three spatial ones plus time), exists on a so called membrane floating in 11-dimensional space. It is then suggested that the other forces of nature (the electromagnetic force, strong interaction, and weak interaction) operate within this membrane and its four dimensions, while gravity can operate across all 11 dimensions. This would explain why gravity is very weak compared to the other fundamental forces.For a pedagogical introduction, see This is a radical theory given that the other 7 dimensions, which we do not observe, previously have been assumed to be very small (about a planck-length), while this theory asserts that they might be very large. The model was proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, and Gia Dvali in 1998. Attempts to test the theory are executed by smashing together two protons in the Large Hadron Collider so that they disperse and release elementary particles. If a postulated graviton appeared after a collision, for such a particle to disappear, and its disappearance be observed, that would suggest that the graviton had escaped into other dimensions beyond our universe's observable four. No experiments from the Large Hadron Collider have been decisive thus far. However, the operation range of the LHC (13 TeV collision energy) covers only a small part of the predicted range in which evidence for LED would be recorded (a few TeV to 1016 TeV). This suggests that the theory might be more thoroughly tested with advanced technology.  Proponents' views  Traditionally in theoretical physics the Planck scale is the highest energy scale and all dimensionful parameters are measured in terms of the Planck scale. There is a great hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale and explaining the ratio of strength of weak force and gravity G_F/G_N= 10^{32} is the focus of much of beyond-Standard-Model physics. In models of large extra dimensions the fundamental scale is much lower than the Planck. This occurs because the power law of gravity changes. For example, when there are two extra dimensions of size d, the power law of gravity is 1/r^4 for objects with r \\\\ll d and 1/r^2 for objects with r \\\\gg d. If we want the Planck scale to be equal to the next accelerator energy (1 TeV), we should take d to be approximately 1 mm. For larger numbers of dimensions, fixing the Planck scale at 1 TeV, the size of the extra-dimensions become smaller and as small as 1 femtometer for six extra dimensions. By reducing the fundamental scale to the weak scale, the fundamental theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory, might be accessible at colliders such as the Tevatron or the LHC. There has been recent progress in generating large volumes in the context of string theory. Having the fundamental scale accessible allows the production of black holes at the LHC, though there are constraints on the viability of this possibility at the energies at the LHC. There are other signatures of large extra dimensions at high energy colliders. Many of the mechanisms that were used to explain the problems in the Standard Model used very high energies. In the years after the publication of ADD, much of the work of the beyond the Standard Model physics community went to explore how these problems could be solved with a low scale of quantum gravity. Almost immediately there was an alternative explanation to the see-saw mechanism for the neutrino mass. Using extra dimensions as a new source of small numbers allowed for new mechanisms for understanding the masses and mixings of the neutrinos. Another huge problem with having a low scale of quantum gravity was the existence of possibly TeV-suppressed proton decay, flavor violating, and CP violating operators. These would be disastrous phenomenologically. It was quickly realized that there were novel mechanisms for getting small numbers necessary for explaining these very rare processes.  Opponents' views  In the traditional view, the enormous gap in energy between the mass scales of ordinary particles and the Planck mass is reflected in the fact that virtual processes involving black holes or gravity are strongly suppressed. The suppression of these terms is the principle of renormalizability in order to see an interaction at low energy, it must have the property that its coupling only changes logarithmically as a function of the Planck scale. Nonrenormalizable interactions are weak only to the extent that the Planck scale is large. Virtual gravitational processes don't conserve anything except gauge charges, because black holes decay into anything with the same charge. So it is difficult to suppress interactions at the gravitational scale. One way to do it is by postulating new gauge symmetries. A different way to suppress these interactions in the context of extra-dimensional models is the \\"split fermion scenario\\" proposed by Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz in their paper \\"Hierarchies without Symmetries from Extra Dimensions\\". In this scenario the wavefunctions of particles that are bound to the brane have a finite width significantly smaller than the extra-dimension, but the center (e.g. of a gaussian wave-packet) can be dislocated along the direction of the extra dimension in what is known as a 'fat brane'. Integrating out the additional dimension(s) to obtain the effective coupling of higher-dimensional operators on the brane, the result is suppressed with the exponential of the square of the distance between the centers of the wave-functions, a factor that generates a suppression by many orders of magnitude already by a dislocation of only a few times the typical width of the wave-function. In electromagnetism, the electron magnetic moment is described by perturbative processes derived in the QED Lagrangian: : \\\\int \\\\bar{\\\\psi} \\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi + {1\\\\over 4}F^{\\\\mu u}F_{\\\\mu u} +\\\\bar{\\\\psi} e\\\\gamma^\\\\mu A_\\\\mu\\\\psi \\\\, which is calculated and measured to one part in a trillion. But it is also possible to include a Pauli term in the Lagrangian: : A \\\\bar\\\\psi F^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sigma_{\\\\mu u} \\\\psi \\\\, and the magnetic moment would change by A. The reason the magnetic moment is correctly calculated without this term is because the coefficient A has the dimension of inverse mass. The mass scale is at most the Planck mass. So A would only be seen at the 20th decimal place with the usual Planck scale. Since the electron magnetic moment is measured so accurately, and since the scale where it is measured is at the electron mass, a term of this kind would be visible even if the Planck scale were only about 109 electron masses, which is . This is much higher than the proposed Planck scale in the ADD model. QED is not the full theory, and the standard model does not have many possible Pauli terms. A good rule of thumb is that a Pauli term is like a mass term in order to generate it the Higgs must enter. But in the ADD model, the Higgs vacuum expectation value is comparable to the Planck scale, so the Higgs field can contribute to any power without any suppression. One coupling which generates a Pauli term is the same as the electron mass term, except with an extra Y^{\\\\mu u}\\\\sigma_{\\\\mu u} where Y is the U(1) gauge field. This is dimension-six, and it contains one power of the Higgs expectation value, and is suppressed by two powers of the Planck mass. This should start contributing to the electron magnetic moment at the sixth decimal place. A similar term should contribute to the muon magnetic moment at the third or fourth decimal place. The neutrinos are only massless because the dimension-five operator \\\\bar{L} H H L does not appear. But neutrinos have a mass scale of approximately 10^{-2} eV, which is 14 orders of magnitude smaller than the scale of the Higgs expectation value of 1 TeV. This means that the term is suppressed by a mass M such that : \\\\frac{H^2}{M} = 0.01\\\\,\\\\text{eV}. \\\\, Substituting H \\\\simeq 1 TeV gives M \\\\simeq 10^{26} eV \\\\simeq 10^{17} GeV. So this is where the neutrino masses suggest new physics; at close to the traditional GUT scale, a few orders of magnitude less than the traditional Planck scale. The same term in a large extra dimension model would give a mass to the neutrino in the MeV-GeV range, comparable to the mass of the other particles. In this view, models with large extra dimensions miscalculate the neutrino masses by inappropriately assuming that the mass is due to interactions with a hypothetical right-handed partner. The only reason to introduce a right-handed partner is to produce neutrino masses in a renormalizable GUT. If the Planck scale is small so that renormalizability is no longer an issue, there are many neutrino mass terms which don't require extra particles. For example, at dimension-six, there is a Higgs-free term which couples the lepton doublets to the quark doublets, \\\\bar{L}L\\\\bar{q}q, which is a coupling to the strong interaction quark condensate. Even with a relatively low energy pion scale, this type of interaction could conceivably give a mass to the neutrino of size \\\\scriptstyle {f_\\\\pi}^3/TeV^2, which is only a factor of 107 less than the pion condensate itself at . This would be some of mass, about a thousand times bigger than what is measured. This term also allows for lepton number violating pion decays, and for proton decay. In fact in all operators with dimension greater than four, there are CP, baryon, and lepton-number violations. The only way to suppress them is to deal with them term by term, which nobody has done. The popularity, or at least prominence, of these models may have been enhanced because they allow the possibility of black hole production at LHC, which has attracted significant attention.  Empirical tests  Analyses of results from the Large Hadron Collider severely constrain theories with large extra dimensions. The Fermi/LAT collaboration, in 2012, published limits on the ADD model of Large Extra Dimensions from astrophysical observations of neutron stars. If the unification scale is at a TeV, then for n < 4, the results presented here imply that the compactification topology is more complicated than a torus, i.e., all large extra dimensions (LED) having the same size. For flat LED of the same size, the lower limits on the unification scale results are consistent with n ‚â• 4. The details of the analysis is as follows: A sample of 6 gamma-ray faint NS sources not reported in the first Fermi gamma-ray source catalog that are good candidates are selected for this analysis, based on age, surface magnetic field, distance, and galactic latitude. Based on 11 months of data from Fermi -LAT, 95% CL upper limits on the size of extra dimensions R from each source are obtained, as well as 95% CL lower limits on the (n+4)-dimensional Planck scale M_D. In addition, the limits from all of the analyzed NSs have been combined statistically using two likelihood-based methods. The results indicate more stringent limits on LED than quoted previously from individual neutron star sources in gamma-rays. In addition, the results are more stringent than current collider limits, from the LHC, for n < 4\\\\. Further details of the analysis are found in.

Life He was born Samy Kamel in Sers el- Lyan, Monufia Governorate, Egypt, in 1931. later moving to Damenhour where he received his early education. He went on to attend Alexandria University, and received his Bachelor of Science degree there in 1951. He started as a teacher in a local school, at the same time continuing his own studies. In 1954, he received an advanced degree in literature and was appointed as an instructor at the Alexandria University college of education. Five years later, in 1959, he was ordained a priest of the Coptic Orthodox Church. While a priest, he also taught Sunday school and offered free tutoring for children who needed it. He is also noted for going around to the needy of his congregation after evening services on Christmas, Epiphany, and Easter, because he thought it important to share with his congregation the meaning of the church's \\"feasts\\". Kamel founded the St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in Sporting, Alexandria, Egypt. As the church grew, he became convinced one priest would not be enough and sought to have associate priests at the church. Although he was initially advised against doing so, he persisted, and in time the church had five priests working there, all of whom remained overworked as well. Other churches he founded in Alexandria include St. George in Hadara, the Church of Archangel Michael in the Mustafa Kamel area, St. Takla Hemanout in the Ibrahimeya neighborhood, the church of St. Mary and St. Cyril in the Cleopatra neighborhood, and the church of St. Peter in the Sidi Bishr neighborhood.Billatos, Ehab S., \\"Father Bishoy Kamel: The Servant of Children\\", Mighty Arrows Magazine, July 2001 In 1969, Kamel was sent to minister to the needs of the Coptic faithful in Los Angeles. Initially, the church placed him in a building used by the Syriac Orthodox Church. Later, he was given the chance to buy a building which the Russian Orthodox Church congregation had earlier used on Robertson Boulevard which would cost $100,000. His church at the time had about $500 available. Father Bishoy Kamel managed to raise $23,000, some of which came from newer immigrants to the area. Kamel took a cab to a local bank, where he was prepared to pay the $23,000. and sign a mortgage for the church. Unfortunately, he left the unmarked envelope containing the money in the seat of the taxi he took to the bank. He didn't notice until entering the bank and being asked by the loan officer what had happened to the money. He left the bank and returned to his home near the church they were using without the mortgage or the money, convinced that at least some people would believe that he had himself stolen the money. Later that night, after midnight, he heard a knock on his door and asked his wife to answer it. The driver of the taxi was there. He confessed to having found the money in the cab and drove around for some time trying to decide whether to keep it or not. After deciding not to, determining that his fare had been some sort of minister, he had to find a way to locate him. He asked around, and finally managed to determine who his fare must have been, and arrived with the money. Final years and legacy Kamel would later go on to help establish the Coptic church in Denver and Houston, and areas of Europe and Australia. Although very interested in the spiritual welfare of others, Kamel was also very concerned with what he felt was his own salvation. He displayed an unusual degree of humility. Although married for several years to his wife, Angel, both of them remained celibate. As a preacher, he regularly cited examples from the Bible, Church history, tradition, and the life of the Saints. His voice is described as having been low, almost weak, but was very appreciated by his congregation. He wrote religious books, including Under the Feet of the Cross and With Christ Crucified. He died in 1979 and is buried in Alexandria. References External links *\\"Father Maximous El-Antony: Who cares about the icon?\\" Al-Ahram Weekly 2008-03-05. *The Arch-priest 'Abouna' Fr.

Plot Along with her husband the White King, she is one of the first characters to be seen in the story. She first appears in the drawing room just beyond the titular looking-glass as an animate chesspiece unable to see or hear Alice, the main character. The Queen is looking for her daughter Lily; Alice helps her by lifting the White Queen and King onto the table, leading them to believe they were thrown up by an invisible volcano. When Alice meets the Red Queen and joins the chess game, she takes the place of a white pawn, Lily being too young to play. She does not meet the White Queen as a human-sized character until the Fifth Square. The White Queen lives backwards in time, due to the fact that she lives through the eponymous looking glass. Her behaviour is odd to Alice. She offers Alice \\"jam to-morrow and jam yesterday - but never jam to-day.\\" She screams in pain until, rather than because, she pricks her thumb on her brooch, and tells Alice of the King's messenger who has been imprisoned for a crime he will later be tried for and perhaps (but not definitely) commit in the end. The White Queen, aside from telling Alice things that she finds difficult to believe (one being that she is just over 101 years old) says that in her youth she could believe \\"six impossible things before breakfast\\" and counsels Alice to practice the same skill. The meeting ends with the Queen seeming to turn into a bespectacled sheep who sits at a counter in a shop as Alice passes into the next square on the board. The Sheep is somewhat different from the Queen in terms of personality and gets \\"more like a porcupine every time [Alice] looks at her\\" because she knits with several knitting needles all at once. Two of these needles turn into oars when Alice appears in a boat, and then reappear in the Sheep's shop, where Alice purchases an egg, which becomes Humpty Dumpty as she moves to the next square. In Chapter 9, the White Queen appears with the Red Queen, posing a series of typical Wonderland/Looking- Glass questions (\\"Divide a loaf by a knife: what's the answer to that?\\"), and then celebrating Alice's promotion from pawn to queen. When that celebration goes awry, the White Queen seems to flee the scene by disappearing into a tureen of soup. Martin Gardner's The Annotated Alice points out that the White King is at the time in check from the Red Queen. Alice proceeds to \\"capture\\" the Red Queen and checkmate the Red King, ending the game. The White Queen is not seen again, except as one of Alice's white cats, who Alice speculates may have influenced the dream. In other media The White Queen has been portrayed in various TV and film productions by actresses including Carol Channing, Penelope Wilton, Nanette Fabray, Anne Hathaway and Brenda Bruce. In Sandra the Fairytale Detective, her name is Victoria because she is the Queen of Victory. =Alice in Wonderland (2010)= Anne Hathaway portrays the White Queen (renamed \\"Mirana of Marmoreal\\") in Tim Burton's 2010 adaptationMissy Schwartz, \\"Best Actress,\\" Entertainment Weekly 1032/1033 (Jan. 30/Feb. 6, 2009): 46. alongside Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth, the Red Queen; they are portrayed as sisters. The White Queen's soldiers appear in white armor inspired by chess pieces while The Red Queen's appear in armour made to resemble cards. Mirana's delicate exterior is reinforced by her habit of holding her hands gracefully at shoulder height in almost every scene in which she appears. But her black fingernail polish and the dark circles under her eyes, as well as her nonchalance about certain potion ingredients (\\"buttered fingers\\"), hint at a more complex character under the surface. Additionally, she is portrayed as a beautiful young woman with white blonde hair, a flawless complexion and air of elegance, grace and perfection. In the movie, Iracebeth has banished her sister from \\"Underland\\" out of jealousy; Mirana, having taken a vow never to harm another living thing, is helpless to fight back and must wait years for the \\"Frabjous Day,\\" when a \\"champion\\" will arrive and slay the Jabberwocky, Iracebeth's fearsome pet. That champion arrives in Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now a young woman, who initially thinks she is having a recurring dream. By the film's climax, however, Alice accepts her destiny and slays the Jabberwocky, restoring rulership of Wonderland to the White Queen. Mirana banishes her sister and bids Alice goodbye. After Alice remarks that Mirana cannot imagine the horror that goes on inside the Red Queen's castle, Mirana - whilst holding a knife - coldly replies, \\"Oh yes, I can.\\" Mirana apparently is not above cruel punishment such as having her sister exiled to the Outlands for the rest of her days where nobody is to show her kindness or say a word to her. Mirana also had the Knave of Hearts unwillingly kept in Iracebeth's company for the rest of his life. =Alice Through The Looking Glass (2016)= While the first film borrows elements from both of Lewis Carroll's novels, the sequel introduces characters not featured in those novels. The story is entirely different to Carroll's novel and centers on the origin of Mad Hatter and the feud between Mirana and Iracebeth. At the end of the film, the sisters make amends.

His accomplishments included: * developing in the 1880s a standardized balalaika made with the assistance of violin maker V. Ivanov.History of balalaika * reviving the domra, a three-stringed long-necked melody instrument with a melon-shaped body, which he developed in prima, alto, tenor, and bass sizes. * reviving the gusli, an autoharp chorded with piano-type keys. * arranging many traditional Russian folk songs and melodies for the orchestra * composing many tunes of his own. Biography Vasily Andreyev was born in Bezhetsk, Tver Governorate, Russia to the family of an honorary citizen of Bezhetsk and merchant of the first guild, Vasily Andeyevich Andreyev and his wife, the noblewoman Sophia Mikhaylovna Andreyeva. When the boy was one year old, his father died. The family moved to Saint Petersburg, where the boy was brought up by his stepfather, Nil Seslavin. At the age of ten, Vasily began playing the balalaika and other folk instruments. Initially, Andreyev was studying to play the violin and working as a musician in the various salons catering to European tourists to the Russian capital. On numerous occasions, he was asked about performing traditional Russian music, and he started collecting examples. He once came upon a peasant playing a balalaika and had the instrument copied. His solo performances were very popular, and a group of players developed around him. He also developed an ensemble playing different sized balalaikas that proved to be very successful. Ultimately, the group grew into a full orchestra. In 1887 Andreyev was inspired by Ginislao Paris' mandolin orchestra. Paris' orchestra was the first mandolin orchestra in Russia, and, similarly, Andreyev put together the first orchestra based on Russian instruments. The popularity of Andreyev's group grew significantly after their performance in Paris, France at the world Exhibition, where they became celebrities. The Great Russian Orchestra In 1881 Andreyev organized his Great Russian orchestra that included string instruments: four types of domras, six types of balalaika, gusli, woodwind instruments: zhaleikas; percussion instruments: makras (a sort of timpani), bubens. Many instruments were heavily customized to work in an orchestra setting. In a few years, the orchestra became famous, generating thousands of followers as well as causing an explosion of balalaika compositions. Criticism Still many members of the intelligentsia criticized the orchestra and its instruments for being not Russian (as the name implies) but Turkish. More recently, Iurii Boiko pointed out in 1984 that the orchestra's technique of playing a melody in the form of a sustained tremolo on one stringmuch copied and widely thought of as \\"Russian\\" in style (witness Maurice Jarre's film score for David Lean's Doctor Zhivago)is in fact not a Russian manner of playing at all; rather, it was a technique borrowed by Andreyev from the Neapolitan mandolin orchestra.cited by Olson (2004), p.17 This new form of folk music gained international popularity after Andreyev's many concert tours in Great Britain between 1900 and 1910.

The difference between the \\\\log\\\\log n and 2^{\\\\log^* n} terms, from a complexity point of view, is asymptotically in the advantage of F√ºrer's algorithm for integers greater than 2^{2^{64}}. However the difference between these terms for realistic values of n is very small. Improved algorithms In 2008 De et al gave a similar algorithm which relies on modular arithmetic instead of complex arithmetic to achieve in fact the same running time.A. De, C. Saha, P. Kurur and R. Saptharishi (2008). \\"Fast integer multiplication using modular arithmetic\\" Proceedings of the 40th annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 499‚Äì506, New York, NY, 2008, and SIAM Journal on Computing, Vol. 42 Issue 2, 685‚Äì699, 2013. It has been estimated that it becomes faster than Sch√∂nhage-Strassen for inputs exceeding a length of 10^{10^{4796}}. In 2015 Harvey, van der Hoeven and LecerfD. Harvey, J. van der Hoeven and G.

They also proposed a variant of their algorithm which achieves O(n\\\\log n \\\\cdot 2^{2\\\\log^* n}) but whose validity relies on standard conjectures about the distribution of Mersenne primes. In 2015 Covanov and Thom√© provided another modification of F√ºrer's algorithm which achieves the same running time. Published as .

Faded somewhat into the background as a painter, he is chiefly remembered today as the man responsible for the draining of the Mo√´res on the Franco-Belgian border. He is also one of the fathers of the Flemish Baroque style of architecture in the Southern Netherlands.  Life  Born in Antwerp, probably in 1560 (1557, according to one source), he was a natural child of Wenceslas Coeberger and Catharina Raems, which was attested by deed in May 1579. His name is also written as Wenceslaus, Wensel or Wenzel; his surname is sometimes recorded as Coberger, Cobergher, Coebergher, and Koeberger.  Painter  Before being known as an engineer, Cobergher began his career as a painter and an architect. In 1573 he started his studies in Antwerp as an apprentice to the painter Marten de Vos. Following the example of his master, Cobergher left for Italy in 1579, trying to fulfil the dream of every artist to study Italian art and culture. On his way there he stayed briefly in Paris, where he learned about his illegitimate birth from seeing the will of his deceased mother. He returned to Antwerp right away to settle some legal matters relating to this discovery. Later in the year, he set forth again to Italy. He settled in Naples in 1580 (as attested by a contract) and remained there till 1597. In Naples he worked under contract for eight ducats together with the Flemish painter and art dealer Cornelis de Smet. He returned briefly to Antwerp in 1583, buying goods with borrowed money for his second trip to Italy. He is mentioned again in Naples in 1588. In 1591 he allied himself with another compatriot, the painter Jacob Franckaert the elder (before 1551‚Äì1601). The entombment (1605) Ecce Homo He moved to Rome in 1597 (as attested in a letter to Peter Paul Rubens by Jacques Cools). During that time he had also been preparing a numismatic book in the tradition of Hendrik Goltzius. He must also have built up a reputation as an art connoisseur, since in 1598 he was asked to make an inventory and set a value on the paintings of the deceased cardinal Bonelli. After the death of his first wife Michaela Cerf on 7 July 1599, he married again, four months later and at the age of forty; his second wife was Suzanna Franckaert, 15-year-old daughter of Jacob Franckaert the younger, who was also active in Rome. He would have nine children with his second wife, while his first marriage had remained childless. During his stay in Rome Cobergher became much interested in the study of Roman antiquities, antique architecture and statuary. He was also much interested in the way in which Romans represented their gods in paintings, bronze and marble statues, bas-reliefs and on antique coins. He gathered an important collection of coins and medals from the Roman emperors. These drawings and descriptions were gathered in a set of manuscripts, two of which survive (Brussels, Royal Library of Belgium). He was also preparing an anthology of the Roman Antiquity (according to the French humanist Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc) that was never published.J. Van den Gheyn, Peiresc et Cobergher; Annales de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Belgique, 1905 Sometimes the \\"Tractatus de pictura antiqua\\" (published in Mantua, 1591) has been ascribed to Cobergher, but this was based on an erroneous reading of an 18th-century catalogue. At the same time he was witness to the completion of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in 1590. The architecture of several Roman churches made also a deep impression on him; among them most influential were the first truly baroque fa√ßade of the Church of the Gesu, Santa Maria in Transpontina and Santa Maria in Vallicella. He would use their design in his later constructions. During his stay in Italy he painted, under the name \\"maestro Vincenzo\\", a number of altarpieces and other works for important churches in Naples and Rome. His style is somewhat mixed, incorporating Classical and Mannerist elements. His composition is rational and his rendering of the human anatomy is correct. A few of his altarpieces still survive: a Resurrection (San Domenico Maggiore, Naples), a Crucifixion (Santa Maria di Piedigrotta, Naples), a Birth of Christ (S Sebastiana) and a Holy Spirit (Santa Maria in Vallicella, Rome). One of his best known paintings is the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, originally in the Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp), but now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Nancy. This painting was commissioned by the De Jonge Handboog (archers guild) of Antwerp in 1598, while Cobergher was still in Rome. His Angels Supporting the Dead Lord, originally in the Sint-Antoniuskerk in Antwerp, can now also be found in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Nancy, while his Ecce Homo is now in the museum of Toulouse.  Architect  Cobergher began his career as an architect in Italy, designing fountains and canals (not confirmed by surviving documents). He is reported to have overseen the construction of palaces and fortifications, but it is not exactly known which ones. His renown as an architect even reached the court of the Archduke Albert and Infanta Isabella, governors of the Southern Netherlands. In 1601 he was invited to Brussels to present himself at the court, arriving in September of that year. When his in-laws died in 1603, he had to return to Rome to settle family matters. On his return in 1604, he brought along a book from Cardinal Baronius for the printshop of Christoffel Plantijn. He settled in Antwerp where he was admitted as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke. In 1605 he was admitted in the Guild of Romanists. On 12 November 1604 Cobergher was appointed by the archdukes to the post of \\"architecte et ingeniaire\\" (architect-engineer). He moved to his final address in the Violetstreet in Brussels, where he would remain till his death. He was obviously more appreciated by the archdukes than were the court painters Peter Paul Rubens or Jan Brueghel the Elder, since his salary amounted to 1500 guilders (increasing to 1800 guilders in 1610), while Rubens' salary was only 500 guilders. The archdukes rightly considered him as an \\"uomo universale\\" (universal man) who had received a wide knowledge in Italy. Town hall of Ath Although from now on he would be mainly active as an architect, he did not abandon painting completely. In 1605 he painted two altarpieces, a Deposition(Brussels, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) and St. Helena with the Holy Cross (Saint James' Church, Antwerp). As an architect Cobergher promoted the Baroque style in the Southern Netherlands. He started with several alterations at the palace of the archdukes in Brussels and their castles in Tervuren, and worked on their hunting estate in Mariemont. In 1610 he designed, together with the French engineer Salomon de Caus, fountains for the ponds near the archducal palace in Brussels, using the Italian tempietto style. One of his most important commissions was the construction (1607‚Äì1611) of the church and the cloister for the Discalced Carmelites in Brussels. The fa√ßade of the church was based on the Roman churches of Santa Maria in Transpontina and Church of the Gesu. None of the previous works still survive. Basilica of Scherpenheuvel In 1607, Cobergher was ordered to redo a bastion of the Catholic Counter Reformation: the whole city of Scherpenheuvel, in Brabant, was to be redesigned as an allegoric homage to the Mother of God, with a layout based on a 7-pointed star. His first designs for the basilica date from 1606. This pilgrimage church would become his masterpiece. The construction began in 1609 and lasted until about 1624, with the belfry remaining unfinished. The space under the dome is equally heptagonal. This basilica is the first important church with a central dome in the Southern Netherlands. His later works evolved into his own style, more in harmony with the traditional Northern Renaissance in Flanders, but with additions of early Baroque elements. In 1614 he made the designs for the town hall of Ath, Hainaut (1614‚Äì1617) and the church of St. Augustine (1615‚Äì1618) in Antwerp (now a concert hall). In 1617 he built in the same mixed style the St. Hubertus chapel for the archducal palace at Tervuren . The volute fa√ßade of this chapel was later adopted by other architects, as in the Carmelite Church (Antwerp, 1623; destroyed), St. Barbara Church, Diest (1665‚Äì1667) and the Averbode Abbey (1164‚Äì1672).  Economist  In 1618 Cobergher was appointed to the rank of General Superintendent of the public pawn shops. As an economist, he was responsible for introducing this concept of public pawnshops to Flanders, after seeing the Monti di Piet√† in Italy. He is most probably the author of their set of rules with 500 articles. These pawnshops introduced the modern concept of allowing a credit loan against the deposit of a collateral. Between 1618 and 1633 he built fifteen Bergen van Barmhartigheid in towns with usurers and Lombard banking. Some of them he designed himself in his mixed style of traditional schemes with Baroque features : Ghent (1622), Tournai (1622, now the Mus√©e d‚Äôhistoire et d'arch√©ologie), Arras (1624), Lille (1628) and Bergues-Saint-Winock (1633). Two books about the public pawnshops are ascribed to Cobergher : * Cort verhaal van de oprechtinghe, ordre ende beleyt van de Bergen van Bermherticheyt (Brussels, 1619) (Short narrative of the true order and policy of the Mounts of Piety) * Apologia ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock de tegenraeders, van de Berghen van Bermherticheyt\\" (Mechelen, Henry Jaye, 1621) (Apology or defence against criticism by the unreasonable enemies and adversaries of the Mounts of Piety)  Engineer  Since 1615 he owned a small company, producing potash. In 1618 he obtained the monopoly for its production in the Spanish Netherlands. This patent was extended in 1627. Cobergher is perhaps best remembered as a hydraulic engineer. He planned several drainage works in the western and southern parts of the Campine (Dutch: Kempen), a region which then consisted mainly of moor or swamp, heath and sandy peat. In 1616 he made plans for the canalisation of the river Zenne between Brussels and Halle. This last project was only realised in the 19th century. In 1612, inspired by his observations of the Pontine Marshes southeast of Rome, he composed a report on the draining of Les Mo√´res (in Dutch : de Moeren), a marshy region of about 3500 ha. in the area of Dunkirk in France. This reclamation would become his most impressive achievement. These impressive works started in 1619 with the digging of a drainage channel with about twenty windmills, pumping water into the channel, discharging eventually into the sea. This colossal work came finally to end in 1627; so pleased was the archduke that in 1618 he made Cobergher a baron, master of the seignories of Cobergher, Sint-Antheunis and Groenlandt. By this ennoblement he became master of about half the territory of Les Mo√´res. This would prove to be a serious disadvantage as these properties drew him into a dire financial situation. Cobergher died in Brussels on 23 November 1634, leaving his family in deep financial trouble. His properties in Les Mo√´res had to be sold, as well as his house in Brussels. Even his extensive art and coin collection was auctioned off for 10,000 guilders.

On 1 January 2001 it was merged, together with the Queen's Life Regiment, into the Prince's Life Regiment. In 2018 it was announced that the regiment would be reestablished on 1 January 2019, as a light infantry battalion. History The Schleswig Regiment of Foot can trace its history back to 1778 when it was raised from personnel from existing Regiments. Until 1842 it was garrisoned in Schleswig, until 1854 in Fredericia, until 1923 in Copenhagen and thereafter in Haderslev. From 1960's to 1997 the regiment only had infantry battalions, in 1997 it was upgraded with one mechanised infantry battalion. The Regiment participated in the Napoleonic Wars (first as part of the Danish mobile auxiliary force, commanded by Prince Frederik of Hesse and under supreme command of Marechal L.N. Davout, and then as part of the Allied Forces against Napoleon under supreme command of Wellington), First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì1850) and Second Schleswig War (1864). The regimental flag has the battle honours Boden 1813 and Isted 1850. The fighting at Boden occurred near Oldesloe in Holstein in early December, less than a week before the 1813 Battle of Bornh√∂ved.Tre betydningsfulde slag ved bornhoved 798, 1227 & 1813 Since 26 March 1949 the flag carried the name Slesvigske Fodregiment.

He was the great-grandson of Michael Falkiner, originally of Brigart, Leeds, who had settled in Ireland in the 1650s, and represented Clonakilty and Castlemartyr in the Irish House of Commons. The fourth Baronet was a Captain in the Royal Navy. The fifth Baronet was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army and served throughout the Peninsular War.

This environment is stored as a texture depicting what a mirrored sphere would look like if it were placed into the environment, using an orthographic projection (as opposed to one with perspective). This texture contains reflective data for the entire environment, except for the spot directly behind the sphere. (For one example of such an object, see Escher's drawing Hand with Reflecting Sphere.) To use this data, the surface normal of the object, view direction from the object to the camera, and/or reflected direction from the object to the environment is used to calculate a texture coordinate to look up in the aforementioned texture map. The result appears like the environment is reflected in the surface of the object that is being rendered.  Usage example  In the simplest case for generating texture coordinates, suppose: * The map has been created as above, looking at the sphere along the z-axis. * The texture coordinate of the center of the map is (0,0), and the sphere's image has radius 1. * We are rendering an image in the same exact situation as the sphere, but the sphere has been replaced with a reflective object. * The image being created is orthographic, or the viewer is infinitely far away, so that the view direction does not change as one moves across the image. At texture coordinate (x, y), note that the depicted location on the sphere is (x, y, z) (where z is \\\\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}), and the normal at that location is also \\\\langle x, y, z \\\\rangle. However, we are given the reverse task (a normal for which we need to produce a texture map coordinate). So the texture coordinate corresponding to normal \\\\langle x, y, z \\\\rangle is (x, y).

Nothing of his background is known except his kinship to the English and Norman leadership and that his byname appears to be a Breton name, Wiomar'ch. He was brought to England by Edward and had a successful career, being rewarded with numerous lands in various parts of the country. He had a special interest in Essex and set up his main base at Clavering. It was to Clavering that many of Edward's Norman favourites fled when they were ousted from political power in 1052, before taking ship into exile. Despite being a Norman, Robert stayed in England and found further favour with Edward, and possibly with Harold Godwinson after him. Robert was later made Sheriff of Essex and was described as \\"\\" ‚Äì high officer or sometimes staller of the royal palace. When Edward died in January 1066, Robert was one of the four inner councillors present at his death bed, along with the Queen, Edith of Wessex, Earl Harold Godwinson and Archbishop Stigand, an event captured on the Bayeux Tapestry. Robert seems to have acquiesced with Harold's succession to the throne, but also seems to have kept in touch with his homeland. When William landed at Pevensey it was Robert who contacted him to advise a retreat back to France. The advice was, apparently, that William had neither the strength nor numbers to win a battle against Harold, particularly as Harold was buoyed by his victory against the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge. Robert clearly remained in favour with William after his victory at Hastings, and subsequent succession, as he retained his estates, and was further rewarded with others. He left his extensive estates to his son Suen (Swein of Essex), who went on to build Rayleigh Castle. Robert fitz Wimarc seems to have been a prudent man, with a fair degree of wisdom who helped to ease the transition from Saxon to Norman England. He is remembered in Rayleigh, Essex, where one of the town's secondary schools is named the FitzWimarc School.

He worked with former Beatles Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and John Lennon during the 1970s, and had a long collaboration with singer-songwriter James Taylor, producing Taylor's album Walking Man. Career Spinozza worked with McCartney during sessions for McCartney's Ram album during 1971. When the chance came to work with Lennon two years later, as Yoko Ono prepared her Feeling the Space album and Lennon his Mind Games, Spinozza discovered that Lennon was not aware he had previously worked with McCartney, and was afraid he would be fired if Lennon found out, given their recent feuding in the media. When Lennon did learn of it, his only comment was that McCartney \\"knows how to pick good people.\\" David sessioned on Tim Weisberg's 1972 Hurtwood Edge and Cashman & West's 1974 Lifesong. Spinozza contributed to Ono's album A Story, recorded during 1974 (but not released until 1998), served as her bandleader during a residency at Kenny's Castaways, and rehearsed Ono's band to tour her native Japan, but parted ways with her when the tour began. After no communication for several years, Ono contacted Spinozza late in 1980, for his permission to release \\"It Happened\\", a track from A Story, as a B-side to \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\", her tribute to the recently assassinated John Lennon and the last song they had recorded together. Spinozza gave his permission. The track appeared with a new coda, recorded by Lennon and Ono's band from Double Fantasy. Spinozza also appeared on Ringo Starr's 1977 album Ringo the 4th, earning him the distinction of having recorded with three of the four Beatles. Spinozza played acoustic guitar on the song \\"Honesty\\" on the 1978 Billy Joel album 52nd Street. In 1978 he released Spinozza on A&M; label, a jazz-oriented album with some vocal tracks.

Gift to National Portrait Gallery, London, by Gery Milner-Gibson-Cullum Sir Thomas Gargrave (1495‚Äì1579) was a Yorkshire Knight who served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1565 and 1569. His principal residence was at Nostell Priory, one of many grants of land that Gargrave secured during his lifetime. He was Speaker of the House of Commons and vice president of the Council of the North. Early life Gargrave was the son of Thomas Gargrave of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Levett of Hooton Levitt and Normanton, West Yorkshire.History of the Parish of Ecclesfield: In the County of York, Jonathan Eastwood, Bell and Daldy, London, 1862 Through his mother's Levett family, Gargrave was related to such Yorkshire clans as the Wickersleys and their descendants, the Swyfts (Swifts), the Reresbys, the Barnbys, the Wentworths, the Bosviles, the Mirfins and others. He received a legal education at either Gray's Inn or the Middle Temple, and by 1521 began his career as Steward of the Household of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy (often called Lord Darcy of the North), where Gargrave's ambition and drive were immediately apparent. Political career Nostell Priory With the help of Darcy's influence, Gargrave rose quickly, being knighted in 1549 and becoming Knight of the Shire for Yorkshire in 1553, 1554 and 1555 and again in 1563, 1571 and 1572, Deputy Constable for Pontefract Castle, Steward of York Minster, Receiver of the Exchequer for Yorkshire, Master in Chancery, and Recorder for Kingston upon Hull. Gargrave's rise was meteoric, from humble steward to Knight of the Realm and one of the most powerful men in England, serving frequently on Yorkshire business and at Court. Gargrave was elected speaker in Queen Elizabeth's first parliament in 1559 and widely known for his address to Parliament of 25 January 1559 in which he urged Queen Elizabeth I to take a husband and marry. He was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1565 and 1569. In 1567 he acquired Nostell Priory from James Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, for ¬£3560. In August 1568, Gargrave was named supervisor of the estate of William Swyfte of Rotherham, brother of Robert Swyfte, Esq., of Broom Hall, Sheffield. Private life Sir Thomas Gargrave married Anne, daughter of William Cotton and Margaret (Culpeper) Margaret Culpeper was the daughter of Sir John Culpeper who lived at Oxon Hoath, built by the Culpepers as a Royal Park for the Kingdom's oxen and deer. of Oxon Hoath, Kent, by whom he had his only child, Sir Cotton Gargrave, also High Sheriff of Yorkshire. He married secondly Jane, widow of Sir John Wentworth of North Elmsall, West Yorkshire. Legacy In Old Halls, Manors and Families of Derbyshire, author Joseph Tilley sums up the Gargrave legacy as follows: \\"The Gargraves were a knightly house, who came in for extensive grants of Abbey lands in Yorkshire, but who, within a century afterwards, sank into obscurity. The grandfather of the purchaser of One Ash was Speaker of Queen Elizabeth's first Parliament and President of the Council of the North. He was a favourite of Her Majesty and her minister Burghley; he had a grant from Bess, of the Old Park, Wakefield, but he adopted the glorious old Priory of Nostell for a residence. This was the gentleman who conducted poor Mary of Scots from Bolton to Tutbury.\\"Old Halls, Manors and Families of Derbyshire, Joseph Tilley, GENUKI The story of the Gargraves became an oft-cited tale of the rise ‚Äì and fall ‚Äì of ambition. Of the Gargraves, it is said, the poet Byron was moved to write: \\"'Twere long to tell, and sad to trace, Each step from splendour to disgrace.\\" The bulk of the Gargrave properties passed to Thomas Gargrave, eldest son of Sir Cotton Gargrave, who left them to his only daughter, who broke with the family's Royalist sympathies by marrying Dr. Richard Berry, physician to Oliver Cromwell. \\"Berry,\\" according to one early history, \\"contrived to make himself master of their fortune, and the whole family sunk into obscurity.\\" No less an authority than Sir Bernard Burke, in his Vicissitudes of Families, was moved by the Gargraves' precipitous fall. \\"The story of the Gargraves is a melancholy chapter in real life,\\" wrote Burke in the nineteenth century. \\"For full two centuries or more, scarcely a family in Yorkshire enjoyed a higher position.\\" Subsequently, Sir Thomas Gargrave's oldest son was hanged at York for murder; his half-brother Sir Richard Gargrave of Nostell Priory, once High Sheriff of Yorkshire, later wasted his estate, and was reduced to gambling for a cup of ale, plunging his family into penury. Sir Richard was eventually found dead in a London flophouse. \\"Not many years since,\\" Burke wrote, \\"a Mr. Gargrave, believed to be one of them, filled the mean employment of parish clerk at Kippax.\\" Sir Thomas Gargrave is interred in the south choir of St Michael and Our Lady Church, within the grounds of Nostell Priory. A monument on his tomb states: \\"Here lyeth Sir Thomas Gargrave, knight, who dyed the 28 of March, 1579, who served sundry times in the wars and as counsellor at Yorke xxxv yeare. He maryed Anne Cotton of Kent and Jane Appleton, widow of Sir John Wentworth of Elmesall.

The word badlah is an Egyptian Arabic for \\"suit\\". In Egyptian belly dancing clubs (), the term badlah refers simply to the costume that a dancer wears. Most commonly it is used to refer to the matched set of bra and belt that cabaret dancers use, but technically it encompasses all parts of the dancer's costume as well, such as the jewelry, headband, skirt, pants and veil. This is often referred to as a Complete Badlah. Occasionally it also refers to just one piece of the costume such as the highly ornate belt that tribal dancers wear which may or may not have a matching bra. The term Badlah hardwear refers to the more sturdy portions of the dancer's costume, the bra, belt and jewelry and the term Bedlah softwear includes the flowing fabric portions of the costume, the skirt, pants, vest, choli and/or veil. Badlah got in the Western imagination of Victorian painters and was adopted by dancers who catered to foreign audiences who expected the look.

It mandated the establishment of publicly funded, Church-supervised schools in every parish of Scotland. The act was a consequence of the Scottish Reformation, and was the basis of all future acts of the Parliament of Scotland related to school establishment. Summary The act stated: \\\\- in English. \\\\- in Scots. * the king (James VI) has a special care and regard that: ** Protestantism be everywhere fostered and promoted. ** everyone, especially the youth, be educated in civility, godliness, knowledge, and learning. ** 'Inglis' be universally established, and Gaelic be obliterated because it is a main cause for the barbarity and incivility of the people of the Isles and Highlands. * therefore a school will be established in every parish, based on the resources of the parish, and such that: ** it will be paid for by the parishioners. ** it will be supervised by Church bishops. ** letters will be published so that none can claim ignorance of these requirements. The act reflected the current status of the ongoing Episcopalian-Presbyterian power struggle by specifying school supervision by bishops (as per the Episcopalian view; the Presbyterian view was supervision by presbyteries). For the most part, the act was inspired by adherence to the principles of Knox's Book of Discipline. The objective that everyone, especially the youth, be educated is taken from the Preamble to the book, while the means of realising this objective (government establishment of Church-supervised schools) is also from that book. Those who were sympathetic towards Highland culture praised the objective of promoting universally available education, but noted that government efforts in the Isles and Highlands were anti-Gaelic and not pro-education. By itself, the act was not effective, as it provided no means of realisation. The act would be ratified by the Parliament's Education Act 1633, which would also provide a method of realising the objective. The privy council act remained in effect into the nineteenth century as one of the principal statutes for the management of schools under Scots Law.

Produced by Maximum Exposure Productions, the focus of the series will be on a driving expedition from Darjeeling, the spiritual home of tea in India, back to the UK, the drink's greatest importer. The journey, which covers some 10,000 miles (16,000 km), will use two modified Indian auto rickshaws and aims to achieve two world records: a) the longest journey ever completed in a tuk-tuk and b) the world's highest tea party - on top of Pakistan's Khunjerap pass (4693m).Caf√© Culture, March 2007  Route  The official route comprises seventeen different countries as follows: India, Pakistan, China (Xinjiang province), Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, France and finally Britain. The filming begins in July 2008 and will run until February the following year.  Programme content  In each country, the series will look at how tea is produced and consumed, and how over the centuries, particularly in traditionally Islamic societies, the consumption of tea has become not just a drink but an elaborate social institution. Tea producing countries to be covered: India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and even the UK (Devon). Concurrently, the documentary will present themes and sights on a wider theme, from Islamic Architecture in Iran and Turkish cuisine to nomadic sports in Central Asia. Central to all the above will be the 'reality' element, following the progress of the three presenters as they battle terrain, the elements and the mechanical implications of doing the journey in auto-rickshaws.

He was a recipient of the Hero of the Soviet Union award for flying a high-ranking delegation over the front line from Moscow to Washington, D.C. and back to negotiate the opening of the Western Front. Early life Endel's father Karl, a recipient of the Cross of St. George. Endel Puusepp was born into a family of Estonian peasants who had settled in Yeniseysk Governorate, Siberia, during the Stolypin land reform. Ever since early childhood, Puusepp dreamed of becoming a pilot. His parents, however, envisaged a different career for him: either a teacher or an agronomist. Having completed 7 grades of school, Puusepp moved to Leningrad to study at the Estonian-Finnish Teachers' College. Aviation career After completing one year of studies at the teacher's college, Puusepp transferred to a pilot's school, first in Volsk and later in Orenburg. He stayed at the latter as a flight instructor, having graduated. He was later transferred to a newly formed squadron specializing in instrument and night flying. =Polar aviation= By 1938, Puusepp was an established pilot, proficient in instrument flying. Even earlier, he participated in the operation to locate the plane of Sigizmund Levanevsky, which disappeared in the Arctic. The North captivated Puusepp so much that he decided to stay and work there. He flew to the ice station North Pole-1 on several occasions and visited other Soviet Arctic stations. He was also involved in creating optimal routes for ships and in observing the movements of ice. While on one of these missions over the Kara Sea, Puusepp learned about the onset of the Operation Barbarossa. Having landed, Puusepp requested a transfer to the front line. =World War II= Puusepp (left) on the cover of the Ogonyok magazine. On August 8, 1941, under the command of Mikhail Vodopianov, Puusepp participated in his first bombing mission. After a successful air raid on Berlin, his airplane was heavily damaged by anti-aircraft artillery and resulting in an emergency landing in Estonia, then occupied by the Nazis. Upon exiting the plane, the crew encountered a frightened shepherd boy. Puusepp, who did not forget his native Estonian was able to find out the location of the Nazi troops from him and avoid being captured, safely returning to Soviet-controlled territory. By April 1942, Puusepp completed 30 nighttime strategic bombing missions against Berlin, Danzig, and K√∂nigsberg. Soviet heavy bomber Petlyakov Pe-8. By that time, the Soviet Union was involved in negotiations with the Allies concerning the opening of the Western front. It was decided to send a Soviet delegation headed by the Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, first to Great Britain and then to the United States. Puusepp was chosen to be the pilot for this unprecedented and highly risky operation, involving flying over the front line and enemy-controlled territories. On May 29, 1942, after stopping in Tealing, Prestwick, Reykjav√≠k, and Goose Bay, the Petlyakov Pe-8 plane with the Soviet delegation on board landed in Washington. Returning home was even more perilous. Puusepp feared the Nazis were aware of the completed negotiations, and would intend to intercept the delegation on its way back. A ruse was employed involving reports published by the Soviet press, announcing the successful return of the Soviet delegation. It was only after this act of disinformation that the airplane set course for Moscow. For successful completion of the mission, Puusepp was given the honorary title Hero of the Soviet Union. He continued strategic bombing missions in Stalingrad, Kursk, Oryol, and Belgorod. During one of the missions, Puusepp sustained a shrapnel injury of his spine and had to undergo 5 surgeries. He never fully recovered and retired from the Soviet Air Force in 1946 at the rank of colonel. Later years After the war, Puusepp moved to Tallinn, where he was appointed head of the Central Board of Road Transport of the Estonian SSR. In 1950, he was elected Vice Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR and later worked as Minister of Social Insurance of the republic. Endel Puusepp died on 18 June 1996.

The programme starred Bill Wallis, David Jason, Denise Coffey, David Gooderson and Jonathan Cecil. The basic story revolved around a comedy factory, Allied British Comedy, with manager CMD (Wallis) and secretary/announcer Iris (Coffey). It was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the late night Friday slot, as a summer replacement for Week Ending. Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead occupied the slot as well. A running joke was that Cecil, an actor with a very distinctive voice, played many character parts, all the same apart from a slight twang, which the actors in the programme would discuss before the story resumed. Cecil often dropped the accents, Welsh, American and so on, after a few lines. Jason and Gooderson played most of the voice parts, and Jason had a recurring role as Charlie, the sound effects man. The series was not a success and was dropped, after 13 episodes being recorded, as too difficult, surreal and \\"clever.\\" Most editions are now thought lost though parts of one were broadcast on BBC 7, picked by late BBC producer David Hatch as one of his favourite programmes. The scripts were by Chris Langham, Peter Spence and David Renwick and most episodes were produced by Simon Brett. The piano was played by Peter Pontzen who has also written musical plays for children. The audience frequently had lines and, in one episode, the entire factory and audience went on a day trip to Gravel Hall, a stately home in England.

BBC Radio comedy programmes ","title":"The Next Programme Follows Almost Immediately"},{"id":"16115172","text":"Facebook is a social network service website launched on February 4, 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg. The following is a list of software and technology features that can be found on the Facebook website and mobile app and are available to users of the social media site.  Facebook structure  = News Feed = The news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as EdgeRank), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive. On September 6, 2006, Ruchi Sanghvi announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first. Initially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as \\"Facebook- Stalking\\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way. With the introduction of the \\"New Facebook\\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications. On March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed. = Friends = \\"Friending\\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \\"friend request\\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \\"Not Now\\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \\"Not Now\\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date. It is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \\"unfriending\\" by Facebook. Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \\"de-friending\\". \\"Unfriend\\" was New Oxford American Dictionary's word of the year in 2009.\\"Unfriend\\" is Oxford Dictionary's Word of the Year mashable.com 2009/11/16 Facebook does not notify a user if they have been unfriended, but there are scripts that provide this functionality. There has also been a study on why Facebook users unfriend, which found that differences, especially between ages, and few mutual friendships were the dominant factors correlated with unfriending, all of which mirrors the decline of physical-world relationships. Facebook profiles also have advanced privacy features to restrict content to certain users, such as non-friends or persons on a specific list. At one point, Facebook had introduced the \\"Friend Wheel\\" to visualize the connections a user's friends had with other friends. This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API. = Wall = The Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see their full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed. In July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only. In May 2008, the Wall- to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics. The concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter, began September 14, 2009. This meant putting the name of a user, a brand, an event or a group in a post in such a way that it linked to the wall of the Facebook page being tagged, and made the post appear in news feeds for that page, as well as those of selected friends. This was first done using the \\"@\\" symbol followed by the person's name. Later, a numerical ID for the person could be used. Visually, this was displayed with bold text. Early in 2011, tagging in comments was added. In addition to postings by other users, the Wall also displayed other events that happened to the user's profile. This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things. The Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011. = Timeline = In September 2011, Facebook introduced \\"Timeline\\" at its developer conference, intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. \\"Cover\\" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts. Timeline began gradually rolling out to users in New Zealand starting December 7, 2011, and was made officially available to all users worldwide on December 15. By January, the switch to Timeline became required for all users. In February 2012, Timeline became available for Facebook Pages. = Likes and Reactions = The \\"like\\" button on Facebook The like button, first enabled on February 9, 2009, enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos, links shared by friends, videos and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content appears in the News Feeds of that user's friends, and the button also displays the number of other users who have liked the content, including a full or partial list of those users. The like button was extended to comments in June 2010. After extensive testing and years of questions from the public about whether it had an intention to incorporate a \\"Dislike\\" button, Facebook officially rolled out \\"Reactions\\" to users worldwide on February 24, 2016, letting users long-press on the like button for an option to use one of five pre-defined emotions, including \\"Love\\", \\"Haha\\", \\"Wow\\", \\"Sad\\", or \\"Angry\\". Reactions were also extended to comments in May 2017. = Comments = To mark the 30th anniversary of the GIF, Facebook has introduced a new feature enabling users to add GIFs to comments. The eagerly-awaited feature can be accessed using the GIF button located beside the emoji picker. Users can choose from the available GIFs sourced from Facebook's GIF partners, but cannot upload other GIFs. = Messages and inbox = Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application. Originally developed as Facebook Chat in 2008, the company revamped its messaging service in 2010, and subsequently released standalone iOS and Android apps in August 2011. Over the years, Facebook has released new apps on a variety of different operating systems, launched a dedicated website interface, and separated the messaging functionality from the main Facebook app, requiring users to download the standalone apps. Facebook Messenger lets Facebook users send messages to each other. Complementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make voice calls and video calls both in one-to-one interactions and in group conversations. Its Android app has integrated support for SMS and \\"Chat Heads\\", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open, while both apps support multiple accounts, conversations with optional end-to-end encryption, and playing \\"Instant Games\\", which are select games built into Messenger. Some features, including sending money and requesting transportation, are limited to the United States. In 2017, Facebook has added \\"Messenger Day\\", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours; Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an emoji; and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification. In March 2015, Facebook announced that it would start letting businesses and users interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. It also announced that third-party developers could integrate their apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat. In April 2016, it introduced an API for developers to build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service, and in April 2017, it enabled the M virtual assistant for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money. Additionally, Facebook expanded the use of bots, incorporating group chatbots into Messenger as \\"Chat Extensions\\", adding a \\"Discovery\\" tab for finding bots, and enabling special, branded QR codes that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot. In August 2018, Facebook discontinued users' ability to post to their Timeline using SMS. = Notifications = Notifications tell the user that something has been added to his or her profile page. Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones. = Groups = Human billboard at the National Multicultural Festival advertising Canberra in the city news feed Facebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items. Groups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings: * \\"Open\\" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining. * \\"Secret\\" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group. Previously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups. Version 1 or \\"new\\" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an \\"open\\" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.  Applications  = Events = Facebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on). In February 2011, Facebook began to use the hCalendar microformat to mark up events, and the hCard microformat for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook pages to the iCalendar- format. = Marketplace = In 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace, allowing users to post classified ads within sale, housing, and jobs categories. However, the feature never gained traction, and in 2009, control was transferred to Oodle, the platform powering the functionality. The feature was then eventually shut down in 2014. In October 2016, Facebook announced a new Marketplace, citing the growth of organized \\"buy and sell\\" Facebook Groups, and gave the new version a higher prominence in the main Facebook app, taking the navigation position previously held by Facebook Messenger. According to Facebook‚Äôs internal data from 2019, the Marketplace used to only be a C2C platform but now there is a major B2C opportunity for US retailers. = Notes = Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, as a blogging platform offering users the ability to write notes, attach photos, and optionally import blog entries from external sources. The most known usage form of the Notes feature was the Internet meme \\"25 Random Things About Me\\", which involves writing 25 things about the user that their friends do not already know about them and using the tag function to ask 25 friends to do the same. The trend became popular in February 2009, with The New York Times discussing its sudden surge, noting that nearly five million notes were created for the purpose, a doubling of the feature's use in the previous week and larger than any other week in Facebook's history. In September 2015, the Notes feature received an update, bringing additional features, such as adding a cover photo and caption, the ability to resize photos, and text formatting options. = Places = Facebook announced Places on August 18, 2010. It is a feature that lets users check into Facebook using a mobile device to let a user's friends know where they are at the moment. In November 2010, Facebook announced \\"Deals\\", a subset of the Places offering, which allows for users to check in from restaurants, supermarkets, bars, and coffee shops using an app on a mobile device and then be rewarded discounts, coupons, and free merchandise. This feature is marketed as a digital version of a loyalty card or coupon where a customer gets rewarded for loyal buying behavior. On October 10, 2010, Places became available on BlackBerry, iPhone, and Android. Other users, including Windows Mobile users, must use an HTML5 browser to use Places via Facebook Touch Site. Facebook Places was reported discontinued on August 24, 2011, but was relaunched in November 2014, now including cover images, discovery sections, city/category landing pages, a deeper integration with the Location API, Graph Search queries and user generated content. = Platform = The Facebook Platform provides a set of APIs and tools which enable third- party developers to integrate with the \\"open graph\\", whether through applications on Facebook.com or external websites and devices. Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on Facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices. Facebook Platform Statistics as of May 2010: * More than one million developers and entrepreneurs from more than 180 countries * More than 550,000 active applications currently on Facebook Platform * Every month, more than 70% of Facebook users engage with Platform applications * More than 250,000 websites have integrated with Facebook Platform * More than 100 million Facebook users engage with Facebook on external websites every month On August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of applications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications, following criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who had installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly viral, yet useless applications. Tech blog Valleywag has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \\"cornucopia of uselessness\\". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook \\"user experience\\" is not degraded. Primarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. Stanford University even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: \\"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\\". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month. = Facebook Questions = In May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as Yahoo! Answers.\\"Are Questions The \\"Future Of Facebook\\"?\\". TechCrunch. Retrieved July 4, 2010. On March 24, 2011, Facebook announced that its new product, Facebook Questions, facilitates short, poll-like answers in addition to long-form responses, and also links directly to relevant items in Facebook's directory of \\"fan pages\\".Caroline McCarthy, cnet.com. \\"Facebook fine-tunes its Questions product\\". March 24, 2011. Retrieved March 25, 2011. = Photos = Facebook allows users to upload photos, and to add them to albums. In December 2010, the company enabled facial recognition technology, helping users identify people to tag in uploaded photos. In May 2011, Facebook launched a feature to tag specific Facebook pages in photos, including brands, products, and companies. On mobile, Facebook introduced photo filters in August 2011. In May 2016, Facebook started allowing users to upload and view 360-degree photos. Mobile users will move their device around to navigate the environment, while website users will have to click and drag. According to Facebook in 2010, there were over 50 billion photos stored on the service. = Videos = In May 2007, Facebook officially launched its video platform, allowing users to upload recorded videos or livestream videos from their webcams. The service supports the ability to \\"tag\\" friends in similar ways to photos. In December 2014, Facebook began rolling out functionality for business Pages to pin (\\"Feature\\") a video to the top of their Videos tab. In January 2015, Facebook published a report detailing a significant growth in video viewing on the platform, specifically highlighting the fact that Facebook has seen an average of one billion video views every day since June 2014. In September 2015, Facebook announced that it would begin showing view counts for publicly posted videos. A few weeks later, the company announced that users will be able to view 360-degree videos. On the website, users can click around to change the perspective, whereas mobile users can physically move their device to interact with the virtual space. The result is the work of a collaboration between Facebook and its Oculus division.  Live streaming  In August 2015, Facebook began to allow users to live stream video. Streams appear on the News Feed, and users can comment on them in real- time. Live broadcasts are automatically saved as a video post to the streamer's page. The feature was positioned as a competitor to services such as Meerkat and Periscope. The feature was initially available only to verified public figures through the Facebook Mentions app (which is also exclusive to these users). Live streaming began to roll out for public use in January 2016, beginning with the Facebook iOS app in the United States. In April 2016, Facebook unveiled a live-streaming API, aimed to allow developers to use any device, including professional video cameras and drones, to integrate with the live-video streaming platform. Facebook also updated its mobile app to provide a dedicated section for showcasing current and recent live broadcasts. To drive its adoption, Facebook provided incentives to publishers and celebrities to perform live broadcasts, including monetary rewards. In March 2017, Facebook extended live-streaming support to PCs. In May, Facebook Live was updated on iOS to let two users livestream together, and the following month, Facebook added support for closed captioning to live video. This is limited to the CEA-608 standard, a notable difference from the automatic closed captioning available for Page videos that are recorded and then uploaded, due to difficulties in adapting the same standard at scale on the low-latency real-time nature for live content. At the end of 2017, Facebook Live was updated to offer support for livestreaming Facebook Messenger games. Controversial use Facebook Live was used by the perpetrators of the 2017 Chicago torture incident, wherein four black young adults kidnapped and tortured a mentally disabled white male. All four were charged with hate crimes. Facebook Live was also used by the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand to broadcast the attacks on Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, which killed 51 people and injured 50 others. This video was viewed over 4,000 times and had 200 watching it live. Because of this, Facebook announced it would be considering restrictions on the service. The service was also used to broadcast the hostage taking in the Nakhon Ratchasima shootings. = Facebook Paper = During the same week as its tenth anniversary, Facebook launched the Paper iPhone app. The app consists of two major features: Firstly, Facebook's News Feed is more graphic, as the app uses technology such as full-screen photos and video footage. Content is organized under headings such as \\"Creators\\" and \\"Planet\\"; secondly, Paper allows users to post statuses, photos, and \\"stories\\" to Facebook that has been described as a different, more presentation-focused design. = Facebook Mentions = Facebook Mentions, initially an iOS-only app, was released by the company in 2014. It allows public figures with a verified account to engage with their respective fanbases in a more concentrated experience. The app had been in testing with select celebrities for nearly a year before its launch. In September 2015, Facebook expanded the availability of the Mentions app to journalists and other verified pages, and also gave users of the app the ability to post exclusively to their Facebook followers rather than both followers and friends. The update also enabled the first livestreaming functionality through Facebook Live. Facebook Mentions became available on Android in January 2016. In December 2016, Facebook Live on Mentions received several updates, including comment moderation tools, broadcasting appearance customization, and editing features to remove unnecessary footage at the beginning or end of a broadcast. = Facebook Moments = Facebook Moments was a private photo sharing app launched by Facebook in 2015 but discontinued on February 25, 2019. The app was powered by Facebook's facial recognition technology to group photos and let users easily share them. = Facebook Gaming = In 2018, Facebook launched Facebook Gaming officially on June 1, 2018 with a pool of gaming streamers including Darkness429, Stonemountain64, ThePoolshark, and Alodia Gosiengfiao. Facebook Gaming or fb.gg is Facebook's take on gaming livestreams where gamers and fans interact. Facebook launched it as a tab on the Facebook app and a standalone app. It also has an In-stream Rewards feature where viewers are gifted in-game rewards while watching streams with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang being a part of pioneering the feature as mentioned by Jack Li, a Facebook Gaming representative, on Moonton Epicon held last July 18, 2019. The service became successful in Southeast Asia and has produced internet celebrities like ChooxTv in the Philippines. It has been the official streaming partner for MSC 2019 and other Mobile Legends esports events. After its competitor Youtube gaming became the official partner for the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang World Championship M1, IGN SEA reported in an article that has now been taken down that Facebook Gaming did not allow its streamers to go to the event. In 2019, Jeremy \\"DisguisedToast\\" Wang was signed to Facebook Gaming in a surprise move from Twitch. Soon after, Facebook signed Super Smash Bros. star streamer Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios. On February 18, 2020, Ronda Rousey performed her first live stream on Facebook Gaming, announcing that she will stream once per week. The details of her contract were not disclosed. On April 20, 2020, Facebook launched its gaming app to more countries. This app was actually planned to release in June 2020, but released earlier upon witnessing the community demand. On June 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue its Mixer streaming service, and redirect users (including partnered streamers) to Facebook Gaming. In return, there would be integrations with Facebook Gaming and Microsoft's upcoming xCloud cloud gaming service.  General features  = Facebook dynamic text/type = In November 2015 Facebook made changes to their text-only status update on Timeline to allow for adjustable text sizes (dynamic text) on mobile apps. = Credits = Facebook Credits are a virtual currency users can use to buy gifts, and virtual goods in many games and applications on the Facebook platform. As of July 2010, users of Facebook can purchase Facebook credits in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Danish krone, Euro, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, Turkish lira, US Dollars, and Venezuelan Bolivar. Facebook credits can be used on many popular games such as Happy Aquarium, Happy Island, Zoo Paradise, Happy Pets, Hello City, It Girl, FarmVille, and Mafia Wars. = Feature phones = Although like all other website apps Facebook made its presence on the smartphones as mentioned but also is present for the feature phones. As the company said that the feature phones dominate the American cell phone markets hence an app was exclusively made for this purpose as well. = Graph Search = Released in July 2013, Graph Search allows users to search within their network of friends for answers to natural language questions such as, \\"Movies my friends who like The Hobbit liked\\" and receive direct answers, rather than the list of websites that search engines usually provide.Facebook ‚ÄòGraph Search‚Äô now available, July 12, 2013, by CNN Wire = IPv6 = According to a June 2010 report by Network World, Facebook said that it was offering \\"experimental, non- production\\" support for IPv6, the long-anticipated upgrade to the Internet's main communications protocol. The news about Facebook's IPv6 support was expected; Facebook told Network World in February 2010, that it planned to support native IPv6 user requests \\"by the midpoint of this year\\". In a presentation at the Google IPv6 Implementors Conference, Facebook's network engineers said it was \\"easy to make [the] site available on v6\\". Facebook said it deployed dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 support on its routers, and that it made no changes to its hosts in order to support IPv6. Facebook also said it was supporting an emerging encapsulation mechanism known as Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP), which separates Internet addresses from endpoint identifiers to improve the scalability of IPv6 deployments. \\"Facebook was the first major Web site on LISP (v4 and v6)\\", Facebook engineers said during their presentation. Facebook said that using LISP allowed them to deploy IPv6 services quickly with no extra cost. Facebook's IPv6 services are available at www.v6.facebook.com m.v6.facebook.com, www.lisp6.facebook.com and m.lisp6.facebook.com. In addition, Facebook enabled IPv6 on its main domain names during World IPv6 Launch. = Listen with Friends = Listen with Friends allows Facebook users to listen to music and discuss the tunes using Facebook Chat with friends at the same time. Users can also listen in as a group while one friend acts as a DJ. Up to 50 friends can listen to the same song at the same time, and chat about it. Every time a user begins listening to music with a friend, a \\"story will be posted to her/his friends\\" ticker and/or news feed. Users will have control over who will be able to see when they are listening with a friend through their App Settings page after installing the compatible music app. This feature was initially supported through Audizer.com, but as of August 2012, services were discontinued and the Facebook / Audizer splash page has been redirected to Facebook.com. = Mood faces = Facebook chat supports numerous emoticons, like (^^^) for a shark. Recently, it has also become possible to post larger, animated images through Facebook's built in emotion system. * At one time, entering the Konami Code followed by Enter at the home page caused a lensflare-style series of circles to display when clicking, typing, or scrolling. * Asking \\"how is babby formed?\\" with the Questions feature released September 23, 2010, will Rickroll the user. * A user can change his/her language to upside down English. * Entering @[x:y] resolves a user's name, where x is a positive integer and y is 0 or 1. For example, @[4:0] resolves to \\"Mark Zuckerberg\\". = Phone = At an event in April 2013, Mark Zuckerberg announced a new Android-based \\"Home\\" feature, which would show content from users' Facebook pages on the home page of their mobile phones, without having to open an app. = Poke and Greetings = Since Facebook's inception, users have had the ability to \\"poke\\" other users. The feature, its actual purpose never officially explained by the company, served as a quick way to attract the attention of another user. In a 2007 opinion article in The Guardian, Facebook explained to a question about the \\"poke\\" that \\"When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose. ... People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.\\" The feature was never removed from Facebook; in December 2017, the company gave the button a significantly more prominent placement on users' profiles, along with new forms of quick interactions, including \\"hug\\", \\"wink\\" and \\"high-five\\", collectively all referred to as \\"Greetings\\". = Smartphone integration = Many smartphones offer access to the Facebook services either through their respective web browsers or through mobile apps. The iPhone-compatible website was launched in August 2007, followed by a dedicated iOS app in July 2008. The early mobile website was severely limited in its feature set, only gaining the ability to post comments in late 2008, a year after launch. By 2009, other companies had developed Facebook mobile apps for Nokia, HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Windows Mobile devices, though a significant portion of Facebook's userbase was still using the original mobile website. During the early success of app stores, Facebook gambled on the idea of a universal webpage rather than specific operating systems, choosing to maintain its primary focus on its mobile site. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fortune that such a decision was \\"probably one of the biggest mistakes we've ever made\\". While the app was experiencing significant criticism for software bugs and crashes, Facebook began its \\"Facebook for Every Phone\\" initiative in January 2011, designing an app for a large number of feature phones. As Android and iOS rose in popularity, Facebook shifted its focus, creating dedicated apps for each platform. However, Facebook was still not entirely convinced, using a \\"hybrid\\" solution of native computing code as a sort of \\"picture frame\\" for its mobile website. Mashable described it as a \\"one-size-fits-all nightmare\\". In October 2011, Facebook updated its iOS app with support for iPad, adding larger photos and enabling more functionality, including the ability to post status updates and photos. Finally, in 2012, the company relaunched its Android and iOS apps, going mobile-first and putting all of its resources into making an optimized experience for smartphones, including significant speed improvements. In the years since, the company has increasingly expanded the feature set of its apps, dedicating more resources and seeing its userbase shifting from the mobile web to its apps. Third-party companies also created Facebook apps for their platforms. Microsoft developed a Facebook app for their Windows Phone 7 platform in February 2012, Nokia offered a Facebook app on its Ovi Store for Nokia S60 devices in June 2009, while BlackBerry also offered a Facebook application for its software platform in September 2012. = Fundraising = In December 2013, Facebook enabled a \\"Donate\\" button for charities and non-profit organizations to raise money. Approximately two years later, the company released a new fundraiser feature, exclusively allowing non-profits to set up campaign pages and collect payments. This was expanded in June 2016, when anyone could set up fundraisers on behalf of non-profit organizations, and again expanded in March 2017 to offer personal users in the United States the ability to raise money, as well as for Facebook Pages to add a \\"Donate\\" button to their Facebook Live video streams. In May, fundraisers were expanded with support for communities and sports teams, and subsequently, in September, expanded internationally for charities in Europe. = Status updates = \\"Status updates\\" (also called as a \\"status\\") allows users to post messages for their friends to read. In turn, friends can respond with their own comments, as well as clicking the \\"Like\\" button. A user's most recent updates appear at the top of their Timeline/Wall and are also noted in the \\"Recently Updated\\" section of a user's friend list. Originally, the purpose of the feature was to allow users to inform their friends of their current \\"status\\", including feelings, whereabouts, or actions, where Facebook prompted the status update with \\"Username is\\"... and users filled in the rest. This feature first became available in September 2006, though on December 13, 2007, the requirement to start a status update with is was removed. The is updates were followed by the \\"What are you doing right now?\\" status update question; in March 2009, the question was changed to \\"What's on your mind?\\" In 2009, Facebook added the feature to tag certain friends (or groups, etc.) within one's status update by adding an @ character before their name, turning the friend's name into a link to their profile and including the message on the friend's wall. Tagging has since been updated to recognize friends' names by typing them into a status while a list of friends whose names match the inputted letters appears. A large percentage of the updates that are posted are humorous and as a result, many apps, websites and books have sprung up to help users to update their own. = Subscribe = In September 2011, Facebook launched a \\"Subscribe\\" button, allowing users to follow public updates from people without requiring a Facebook friendship connection. The feature was expanded to Pages in July 2012, and to stories in the News Feed in August 2012. = Ticker = In September 2011, Facebook launched the \\"Ticker\\", a continually-updated feed on the right side of the screen showing friends' activities, including \\"likes\\", status updates, and comments. The feed was criticized by users for offering a quiet way to stalk users' every move, prompting the company to consider removing it in a March 2013 redesign, though never did. In December 2017, the company officially ended the \\"Ticker\\" feature, though quietly and without an announcement or explanation. = URL shortener = Starting June 2009, Facebook lets users choose a username specifically for their profile, enabling them to share links bearing their own www.facebook.com/username URL address. There are limitations, however, to what usernames can be used, including only alphanumerical characters (A-Z, 0‚Äì9), a length of over five characters, only one username that is unique to the profile, and must adhere to Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities agreement. The following December, Facebook launched its own URL shortener based on the FB.me domain name. = Verified accounts = TechCrunch reported in February 2012 that Facebook would introduce a \\"Verified Account\\" concept, denoting official pages for public figures. Such pages gain more prominence in the \\"People To Subscribe To\\" suggestions lists. Persons with established stage names, such as Stefani Germanotta known as Lady Gaga, can also choose to use their specific stage name for their profile, with the real name in the profile's \\"About\\" page. However, at the time, the feature did not show any visual signs of distinction from other pages. In May 2013, the concept was updated to include a blue checkmark badge to highlight the account's Verified status. In October 2015, Facebook introduced a \\"gray badge\\" verification system for local businesses with physical addresses, with the gray color intended to differentiate from its typical blue checkmarks assigned to celebrities, public figures, sports teams and media organizations. = Hash-tagging support = In June 2013, Facebook introduced its support for clickable hashtags to help users search for topics being actively discussed on the social network. = Impressum = In March 2014, some page administrators in Italy started being prompted to add an impressum to their Facebook page, described as \\"a legally mandated statement of the ownership and authorship of a document\\". =Tor hidden service= In October 2014, Facebook announced that users could connect to the website through a Tor hidden service using the privacy-protecting Tor browser and encrypted using SSL. Announcing the feature, Facebook engineer Alec Muffett said that \\"Facebook's onion address provides a way to access Facebook through Tor without losing the cryptographic protections provided by the Tor cloud. [...] It provides end-to-end communication, from your browser directly into a Facebook datacenter.\\" = \\"Say Thanks\\" = In November 2014, Facebook introduced \\"Say Thanks\\", an experience that lets user create personalized video greeting cards for friends on Facebook. = Call-to-Action button = In December 2014, Facebook announced that Pages run by businesses can display a so-called \\"call-to-action button\\" next to the page's like button. \\"Call to action\\" is a customizable button that lets page administrators add external links for easy visitor access to the business' primary objective, with options ranging from \\"Book Now\\", \\"Contact Us\\", \\"Use App\\", \\"Play Game\\", \\"Shop Now\\", \\"Sign Up\\", and \\"Watch Video\\". Initially only rolled out in the United States, the feature was expanded internationally in February 2015. = Snooze = In September 2017, Facebook began testing a \\"Snooze\\" button, letting users temporarily unfollow friends for 24 hours, 7 days or 30 days. The following December, the feature was enabled for all users, though the period of temporary unfollowing is specifically for 30 days. = \\"Did You Know?\\" social questionnaires = In response to decreased use of status updates on Facebook, the company began enabling \\"Did You Know?\\" social questionnaires in December 2017. The feature, which asks users to answer questions that are then shared as a status update, includes such questions as \\"The superpower I want most is...\\", \\"The first thing I‚Äôd do after winning the lottery is...\\", and \\"A guilty pleasure that I‚Äôm willing to admit to is...\\" = Sound Collection music archive = In December 2017, Facebook announced \\"Sound Collection\\"; an archive of copyright- and payment-free soundtracks and audio effects its users can use in their videos. = Off-Facebook Activity = In an August 20 blogpost, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan, and Director of Product Management David Baser, announced \\"Off-Facebook Activity\\", to be released in Ireland, South Korea, and Spain, before being rolled out globally. Egan and Baser outline that with the feature, \\"you can: * See a summary of the information other apps and websites have sent Facebook through our online business tools, like Facebook Pixel or Facebook Login * Disconnect this information from your account if you want to; and * Choose to disconnect future off-Facebook activity from your account. You can do this for all of your off-Facebook activity, or just for specific apps and websites.\\" A second blogpost on Facebook's Engineering website says that, while users will be able to \\"Choose to disconnect future off-Facebook activity\\" from their accounts, there will be a 48-hour window in which data from other websites will remain linked to the account.\\" During the 48-hour window when incoming off-Facebook data is still linked to your account, \\"it may be used for measurement purposes and to make improvements to our ads systems\\".  Security  On May 12, 2011, Facebook announced that it is launching several new security features designed to protect users from malware and from getting their accounts hijacked. Facebook will display warnings when users are about to be duped by clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks in which they think they are following a link to an interesting news story or taking action to see a video and instead end up spamming their friends. Facebook also offers two-factor authentication called \\"login approvals\\", which, if turned on, will require users to enter a code whenever they log into the site from a new or unrecognized device. The code is sent via text message to the user's mobile phone. Facebook is partnering with the free Web of Trust safe surfing service to give Facebook users more information about the sites they are linking to from the social network. When a user clicks on a potentially malicious link, a warning box will appear that gives more information about why the site might be dangerous. The user can either ignore the warning or go back to the previous page.  Removed features  = Email = In February 2010, TechCrunch reported that Facebook was working to rewrite its messaging service to turn it into a \\"fully featured webmail product\\", dubbed \\"Project Titan\\". The feature, unofficially dubbed a \\"Gmail killer\\" internally, was launched on November 15, 2010, and allowed users to directly communicate with each other via Facebook using several different methods. Users could create their own \\"username@facebook.com\\" email address to communicate, use text messaging, or through the Facebook website or mobile app's instant messaging chat. All messages were contained within single threads in a unified inbox. The email service was terminated in February 2014 because of low uptake. = FBML = Facebook Markup Language (FBML) was considered to be Facebook's own version of HTML. While many of the tags of HTML can be used in FBML, there were also important tags that could not be used such as HTML, HEAD, and BODY. Also, JavaScript could not be used with FBML. According to the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) Developer's page, FBML is now deprecated. No new features will be added to FBML and developers are recommended to develop new applications utilizing HTML, JavaScript and CSS. FBML support ended January 1, 2012, and FBML was no longer functioning as of June 1, 2012. = Lite = In August 2009, Facebook announced the rollout of a \\"lite\\" version of the site, optimized for users on slower or intermittent Internet connections. Facebook Lite offered fewer services, excluded most third-party applications and required less bandwidth. A beta version of the slimmed-down interface was released first to invited testers before a broader rollout across users in the United States, Canada, and India. It was announced on April 20, 2010, that support for the \\"lite\\" service had ended and that users would be redirected back to the normal, full content, Facebook website. The service was operational for only eight months. In June 2015, this feature was reintroduced as an app with a total size of less than 1MB, primarily focusing markets where internet access is slow or limited. = Deals = Facebook announced a pilot program called Deals, which offered online coupons and discounts from local businesses, at an event at its Palo Alto office on 3 November 2010. Deals launched on April 25, 2011, in five cities‚ÄîAtlanta, Austin, Dallas, San Diego, and San Francisco‚Äîwith the hope of expanding. This new offering was a direct competitor to other social commerce sites such as LivingSocial and Groupon for online coupons and deals-of-the-day. Facebook users were able to use Facebook Credits to purchase vouchers that could be redeemed for real goods and services. Deals expanded to Charlotte, St. Louis and Minneapolis in late June 2011. Facebook closed the Deals program on 26 August 2011, describing the product as a \\"test.\\"  References  Software features Facebook-related lists ","title":"List of Facebook features"},{"id":"16115178","text":"Mary Meyer Gilmore (born November 20, 1947) was a Democratic member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing the 59th district from 2003 until 2009.

The original station was replaced by a brick station building in 1878. It was demolished in the 1980s. Scheduled year-round passenger service was operated to Sandwich from 1848 until June 30, 1959 when the New Haven Railroad discontinued all passenger service on its Old Colony division. During the summers of 1961 to 1964 the New Haven Railroad operated weekend service between New York and Hyannis, with a scheduled stop in Sandwich. New Haven trains of the 1930s-1960s included the Day Cape Codder, Neptune and Night Cape Codder, in addition to several trains a day year round to Boston. The station also saw a restoration of seasonal service between 1984 and 1988 when the Cape Cod & Hyannis Railroad operated service between Braintree, Massachusetts and Cape Cod. The Sandwich station was also used from 1986 to 1996 for Amtrak's Cape Codder service. However, it has been eliminated from the schedule of the seasonal Cape Flyer train service initiated in 2013.

It is considered one of Colombia's best universities, receiving a high quality accreditation from the Ministry of Education for 4 years and offers sixty-seven degree programs at the undergraduate level and one hundred sixty-three postgraduates level programs. Since the original intention of this program was to offer the space for unbiased learning during a radical political period in the country, the proper translation would be Freedom University because it promotes the liberty of expression and political thoughts. The university is a member of the Association of Colombian Universities (ASCUN) and the Iberoamerican University Network Universia. History The Universidad Libre was established in 1890 as Universidad Republicana (Republican University of Colombia) by the Colegio Acad√©mico. In 1910, Universidad Republicana went through terrible economic mishaps. A group of investors determined to save the institution led by Don Eugenio Lopez, proceeded to try to amass the necessary funds to keep the institution alive. On April 13, 1912 Universidad Republicana S.A. was constituted as a society but its commercial name was Universidad libre. In 1913 after many legal battles, Universidad Libre became an independent entity from Universidad Republicana. Now constituted as a separate entity, Universidad Libre was once again facing economic issues with many of the contributors withdrawing their funds. Cesar J. Rodriguez was in charge of the dawning task of yet again raising capital for the institution. Mr. Rodriguez hired the seasoned and charismatic leader Benjamin Herrera as head of the project. Mr Herrera was in charge of Universidad Libre until 1921 when he ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign against Pedronel Ospina. The defeated Mr Herrera finally raised the desired amount of capital in 1922 and Julio Cesar Rodriguez announced on March 29, 1922 the beginning of activities. It was not until February 13, 1923 that Universidad Libre actually started classes, in the first faculty dedicated to Law and science.  Alumni  Libre's alumni include a vast range of prominent individuals in the history of the country and the region, with the following list representative: * Alejandro Galvis Galvis (1891-1981), founder the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal and Minister of War. * Dilian Francisca Toro, physician and politician. * Domingo Esguerra Plata (1875-1965), lawyer and politician. * Enrique Olaya Herrera (1880‚Äì1937), journalist and President of Colombia. * German Zea (1905-1989), lawyer, politician and occupied the Ministries of Government, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. * Gloria Stella D√≠az, lawyer and politician. * Gonzalo Correal Urrego, lawyer and scientist. * Jos√© Fernando Bautista Quintero, lawyer and politician. * Manuel Enr√≠quez Rosero, lawyer and politician. * Mauricio Pimiento, lawyer and politician. * Rodrigo Rivera Salazar, lawyer, diplomat, professor and journalist. * Ruth Stella Correa Palacio, lawyer and Minister of Justice and Law of Colombia.

The programme dealt with the history of Christianity in the modern world, focussing especially on how Christianity has responded to challenges such as scientific advances, political atheism and secularisation in general. Episodes * Episode 1, The Mechanical Universe - Copernican revolution. Blaise Pascal and Ren√© Descartes respond differently, faith and knowledge are set divided. * Episode 2, The Human Animal - Genesis account.

Ludwig Wittgenstein's austerity and rigor towards language, his suspicion of built-up religious theories. Production As far as possible, the programme aimed to give presentations in the place where the figures featured each week had actually lived and worked; for example, the programme about Jung was partially filmed in Zurich, and the programme on Kierkegaard was partially filmed near Copenhagen. Response Before the programme was first aired, an article on the religious views of Cupitt entitled \\"New Wave Believer\\" was published in the Radio Times. The article aroused considerable controversy, as was evident from the letters that soon appeared in Radio Times. A more positive set of letters appeared in the Radio Times after the programme had been aired. http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/media/offair%20010606a.pdf After the showings of the six episodes, the BBC broadcast a discussion of the series and of its reception. As well as featuring Cupitt, the discussion included Alfred Jules Ayer and the then Bishop of Birmingham, Hugh Montefiore.

The naming of the station proved to be a source of controversy with the railway company preferring \\"Broad Clyst\\" over the Post Office's insistence that a single word be used. The station attracted residential development in the immediate area and even today the area around the former station is known as Broadclyst Station. The station saw little change during its 106-year life, it had two short platforms - the Up one was capable of accommodating four carriages and the Down one only three; they were never extended as the station only served local trains. The station was lit by oil lamps until its closure. A small Chief Engineers' depot was located on the Up side and this was extended in 1929 with the laying of additional sidings. At the depot was based a small departmental engine used for shunting operations. The station saw mainly passenger traffic and goods traffic was fairly light, particularly as there was no resident coal merchant. Nevertheless, from the early 1960s a local manufacturer of three-wheel invalid cars began regularly sending his goods by rail. However, the decision was taken in 1963 to close the engineers' depot and, in 1965, to concentrate goods traffic on Exeter. At the same time, the Broad Clyst station itself was put forward for closure as part of the package of economies proposed by the Beeching Report. Goods traffic ceased in 1965, with passenger traffic ending the following year.

History 102.1 went on air in 1983 as \\"K-WES the HOT 102 FM\\". City of license was Monahans, Texas. The station went on air from a thousand-foot tower near Notrees, Texas. The CP was obtained by two Houston disk jockies Bruce Nelson Stratton and Ladd Joe Macha. They formed a company partly funded by the owners of KTRH and KLOL Houston (The Jones family d/b/a the Rusk Corporation). The project was overseen by Bill Cordell, P.E. of Houston. He supervised construction of studios in a double wide trailer, and of a transmitter in another large prefab. The studios were dropped into place in Monahans and hooked up and tested by Don Hackler (then KLLL chief engineer, now KCSM FM/TV) and Paul Easter (then KOYL/KUFO, now at Houston Christian Broadcasters and Fort Bend Broadcast Services). KWES raided 1410 KRIG of much of its air staff. KWES was a great success in its early years. The Midland/Odessa area is notoriously cyclical. During the mid and late 80s recession, format was changed to a more buyer friendly soft AC as KMGP (Magic in the Permian). Studios began in Monahans, additional studios were built in Odessa. After 1986 the Monahans studios were discontinued (change in FCC rules). Call letters changed to KCDQ in 1990 playing mainly a classic rock format. In 1998, KCDQ (along with sister stations KMRK, KCRS (AM and FM), and KCHX were bought by Clear Channel Communications and its call letters were changed to the present KFZX. Along with the purchase of the station came an affiliation agreement with The Bob and Tom Show and a change in format to a mix of more contemporary and alternative rock with a mix of classic fare and (for many years) going by the slogan \\"The Basin's Absolute Rock. 102.1 FZX\\" (similar to sister station KFMX. The city oflicense was changed to Gardendale in the early 2000s. In December 2007, the station's format began another overhaul with its format being changed back to a classic rock format shortly after being purchased by Gap Broadcasting that August. (Its slogan basically remained the same except for a slight change from \\"absolute rock\\" to \\"classic rock\\" FZX. On March 1, 2008, KFZX began another format change to Jack FM without much warning. With the change also drew an end to the affiliation deal with The Bob & Tom Show. On March 1, 2010, the station returned to a classic rock format. On October 11, 2009; it was announced that Gap Broadcasting was planning to sell its entire Midland-Odessa cluster to ICA Broadcasting for $3 Million, a sale finalized in February 2010. On March 1, 2010 KFZX dropped the JACK-FM format because of poor ratings performance and relaunched the Classic Rock format under the direction of former Program Director Steve Driscoll using the on air Brand Classic Rock 102. Since the relaunch KFZX has enjoyed ratings success. College basketball radio broadcasts In October 2008, Jack FM announced that Odessa College of the NJCAA had signed a deal with them transferring the Western Junior College Athletic Conference men's and women's basketball road broadcasts and the home game against Midland College from KCRS (AM) to Jack FM. All games would also be streamed online at no cost. The first matches on that agreement were broadcast December 6, 2008, when the OC teams visited South Plains College. The road game against Clarendon College was later moved off of the broadcast schedule due to broadcast difficulties during the previous two seasons. In 2009 Jack FM also acquired the right to air select NCAA Division II UTPB men's home conference basketball games. UTPB plays as part of the Heartland Conference. The first of these games was broadcast January 11, 2009. Home games against Lincoln University and Oklahoma Panhandle State University were not broadcast due to times clashing with the preexisting OC schedule. For the 2009-10 season Jack FM decided to drop the UTPB broadcasts and the OC road game against New Mexico Military Institute due to contractual obligations with Jack FM nationally. However they broadcast all other Wrangler road games, except for the previously mentioned game against Clarendon College. Midland RockHounds radio After a successful debut with basketball, Gap Broadcasting decided to move the 2009 Texas League Oakland Athletics affiliate Midland RockHounds radio network games to KFZX, a move which was criticized by some as News Talk 550 KCRS had been the broadcast home of the Midland franchise since their debut in 1972. Despite the move, the broadcasts would essentially remain the same. Bob Hards remains the play-by-play voice, a position he has currently held for 18 years, and sponsorships remain intact. Regular Jack FM broadcasts were not heard during the games, as the games were broadcast live with a pre-game usually 15 to 30 minutes before the opening pitch and then a post-game show, which usually lasted 10 to 20 minutes. The Jack FM feed resumed immediately after the post-game show. The contract lasted for one season, at which time the RockHounds home games were moved to sister station KMRK. In 2013 the RockHounds would return to KFZK for a partial schedule. KFZK served as the home for all weekday afternoon games and when the Houston Texans, Texas Tech Red Raiders, or Midland High and Midland Lee football was scheduled to air at the same time on sister station Newstalk 550 KCRS. Odessa Jackalopes radio During the 2009 Texas High School baseball playoffs, TSRN (the Texas Sports Radio Network) asked Jack FM if they would be interested in broadcasting the OHS baseball team playoff games. They replied that they had no interest in broadcasting high school sports at this time, but they announced that there sports programming would continue to increase as they began broadcasting the 2009-2010 Odessa Jackalopes CHL Hockey games. This marked the first time that Jack FM didn't get a sports broadcast from a current contract, instead acquiring the Jackalopes contract from rival station KMCM. The broadcast rights also allowed them to take over the Monday night talk show Hockey Talk. High School Football In 2016 KFZX acquired the rights to air the second half of Midland Lee/Midland High football games alongside NewsTalk 550.

Prince Jefri, the brother of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah was among those linked to the scandal, in which Ruffa Gutierrez, Vivian Velez, Lea Orosa, Aurora Sevilla, Sheila Israel, Rachel Lobangco, Tetchie Agbayani, Maritoni Fernandez, Gretchen Barretto, and Cristina Gonzales were alleged to be amongst the victims. The Philippine government downplayed the issue and described it as merely a \\"Senate affair\\" to safeguard relations between Brunei and the Philippines. =Shannon Marketic= In 1997 Shannon Marketic, a former Miss USA, sued Jefri Bolkiah, Prince of Brunei, claiming that she and other women were hired for promotional work but instead were held as \\"virtual prisoners\\", drugged and used as a sex slaves. The Sultan denied the claims. Marketic's lawsuit named Miss USA 1997 Brandi Sherwood as also being a victim, however Sherwood declined to file her own lawsuit. After 18 months of litigation, a judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that the sultan had sovereign immunity as head of state. Sex Trafficking Brunei is a destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Some migrants who transit Brunei become victims of sex trafficking upon arrival in Malaysia or Indonesia. Some Bruneian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking domestically. Retention of migrant workers‚Äô travel documents by employers or agencies remains a widespread practice, although the law prohibits it. In 2016 there were prosecutions against three Thai nationals for sex trafficking. Courts sentenced all three individuals to four years in prison and fines of US$22,250, US$14,836, and US$7,418, respectively, but all three accepted time added to their prison sentences ranging from 10 to 30 months in lieu of paying the fines.

Political career In the northern rebellion of 1569, Gargrave commanded a force of 200 men from the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was elected Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge in 1571 and 1572. In 1583 he was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire and knighted in 1585. He was Custos Rotulorum of the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1584 to 1588. In his later years, he was forced to mortgage many of the extensive properties left him by his wealthy father.

Ashton, 1 U.S. 4 (1760) is a decision of a Pennsylvania Provincial Court, issued when Pennsylvania was still an English colony. It is among the first decisions that appear in the first volume of United States Reports. Colonial and Early State Court Cases in the United States Reports None of the decisions appearing in the first volume and most of the second volume of the United States Reports are actually decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. Alexander Dallas, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania lawyer and journalist, had been in the business of reporting these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution.Cohen, Morris and O'Connor, Sharon H. A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, (Fred B. Rothman & Co, Littleton Colorado, 1995) This would come to be known as the first volume of Dallas Reports. When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new Federal Government, moved in 1791 to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports, and when the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, 2 Dallas Reports. Dallas would go on to publish a total of four volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter. In 1874, the U.S. government created the United States Reports, and numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of that series, starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports. The four volumes Dallas published were retitled volumes 1 - 4 of United States Reports.Hall, Kermit, ed. Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (Oxford 1992), p 215, 727 As a result, the complete citation to Lessee of Ashton v Ashton is 1 U.S. 4 (1 Dallas 4) (1760). The Decision According to Dallas's annotations, an unknown party known only as the \\"deviser\\" (the maker of a will by which real property is given as a gift after death), made a will by which he devised real estate to \\"the first Heir Male of I. S. when he shall Arrive to the Age of 21 Years\\" so long as that first male heir of I. S. paid the sum of 40 pounds to each of I. S.'s daughters, designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". When the deviser died, I. S. only had the two daughters. Some time later, I. S. had a son, who reached the age of 21 years and paid his two sisters their 40 pounds each. The issue before the court was whether the son of I. S. could take under the deviser's will. Dallas reported that the defendant made three arguments. First, since the son of I. S. did not exist either at the time the will was made, or at the time of the deviser's death, the son could not take under the will. Second, even if the devise might be construed as a \\"future devise\\", the interest was too remote under the rule that a future interest must take effect within the lifetime of a life in being at the time of the deviser's death, (or within 9 months thereafter, in the event of an unborn heir). Moreover, even if one of I. S.'s daughters, or grand-daughters, or an even later female descendant bore a son, who might arguably become I. S.'s male heir, that heir could not inherit under the rule against perpetuities. The third argument was that, since I. S. was apparently still alive, he could have no heir under the legal maxim \\"Nemo est Hares Viventis\\". (\\"No one is the heir of a living person.\\")Black's Law Dictionary 5th ed., p. 936 The plaintiff responded by arguing, first that this was not a \\"present Devise\\", because the devisor would have known at the time he made his will that I. S. did not at that time have a male heir. Second, the \\"Contingency\\" (that I. S. would have a son that reached the age of 21 and paid his two sisters their 40 pounds each), was not too remote for purposes of the rule against perpetuities, because it was clear that the devisor intended that the first son of I. S. take, not some more distant descendant, and that the deviser's intent should be respected. The court ruled that the deviser's clear intent was that first son of I. S. should take, and that his intentions should be enforced. It is not clear from the record of the decision or from Dallas's annotations what relationship \\"the deviser\\" or I. S. or the son of I. S. had to either Ashton or Ashton's Lessee, the parties to the proceeding before the court. Precedential Effect Over a century after Lessee of Ashton v. Ashton (or as it is sometimes cited, Ashton v. Ashton) was decided, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would cite it as precedent for the proposition that the word \\"heirs\\" means \\"children\\" in the case of Appeal of Porter 45 Pa 201 (1863) Notes References Hall, Kermit, ed.

The Poles tried to retake it, but their attacks failed. Later on, the Brigade retreated again, to the area of Przasnysz.

It initially involved the forces of Spain and Portugal, before the French and British intervened in the conflict on the side of their respective allies. The war was also strongly marked by a national guerrilla warfare in the mountainous country, cutting off supplies from Spain, and a hostile peasantry that enforced a scorched earth policy as the invading armies approached, leaving the invaders starving and short of military supplies. During the first invasion, 22,000 Spaniards commanded by Nicol√°s de Carvajal, Marquis of Sarria, entered the Province of Alto Tr√°s-os-Montes (northeast of Portugal) having Oporto as their ultimate goal. After occupying some fortresses they were confronted with a national uprising. Taking advantage of the mountainous terrain, the guerrilla bands inflicted heavy losses on the invaders and practically cut off their communication lines with Spain, causing a shortage of essential supplies. Near starvation, the Spaniards tried to conquer Oporto quickly, but were defeated in the battle of Douro and in the battle of Montalegre before retreating to Spain. After this failure, the Spanish commander was replaced by Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda. Meanwhile, 7,104 British troops landed in Lisbon, leading a massive reorganization of the Portuguese army under the Count of Lippe, the supreme allied commander-in-chief. During the second invasion of Portugal (Province of Beira), 42,000 Franco-Spaniards under Aranda took Almeida and several other strongholds, while the Anglo-Portuguese army stopped another Spanish invasion of Portugal by the province of Alentejo, attacking at Valencia de Alc√°ntara (Spanish Extremadura), where a third Spanish corps was assembling for invasion. The allies managed to stop the invading army in the mountains east of Abrantes, where the slope of the heights facing the Franco-Spanish army was abrupt but very soft on the side of the allies, which facilitated the supply and movements of the allies but acted as a barrier for the Franco-Spaniards. The Anglo-Portuguese also prevented the invaders from crossing the river Tagus and defeated them at Vila Velha. The Franco-Spanish army (which had their supply lines from Spain cut off by the guerrillas) was virtually destroyed by a deadly scorched earth strategy: peasants abandoned all the villages around, taking with them or destroying the crops, food and all that could be used by the invaders, including the roads and houses. The Portuguese government also encouraged desertion among the invaders offering large sums to all deserters and defectors. The invaders had to choose between stay and starve or withdraw. The final outcome was the disintegration of the Franco-Spanish army, which was compelled to retreat to Castelo Branco (closer to the frontier) when a Portuguese force under Townshend made an encircling movement towards its rearguard. According to a report sent to London by the British ambassador in Portugal, Edward Hay, the invaders suffered 30,000 losses (almost three- quarters of the original army), mainly caused by starvation, desertion and capture during the chase of the Franco-Spanish remnants by the Anglo- Portuguese army and peasantry. Finally the allied army took the Spanish headquarters, Castelo Branco, capturing a large number of Spaniards, wounded and sick ‚Äì who Aranda had abandoned when he fled to Spain, after a second allied encircling movement. During the third invasion of Portugal, the Spaniards attacked Marv√£o and Ouguela but were defeated with casualties. The allied army left their winter quarters and chased the retreating Spaniards, taking some prisoners; and a Portuguese corps entered Spain taking more prisoners at La Codosera. On 24 November, Aranda asked for a truce which was accepted and signed by Lippe on 1 December 1762. Background =Portuguese and Spanish neutrality in the Seven Years' War= During the Seven Years' War, a British fleet under Admiral Boscawen defeated a French fleet in Portuguese waters in front of Lagos, Algarve, in 1759. Three French ships of the line were captured and two were destroyed. Portugal, though an old ally of Britain, had stated her neutrality in this war and accordingly, the Portuguese prime minister Pombal demanded satisfaction from Great Britain. The British government apologized to the Portuguese king, Jos√© I, by sending a special delegation to Lisbon,\\"Boscawen had defeated the French fleet off the Portuguese coast. The French commander took refuge in Lagos after losing five of his ships on the coast of the Algarve. The French at once began to demand satisfaction, and Pitt sent Lord Kinnoull on a special mission to Lisbon to offer apologies.\\" In Livermore, H. V. ‚Äì A New History of Portugal, Cambridge University Press, London, 1969, p. 234. yet the captured vessels were not returned, as demanded by France (Pombal had previously informed Pitt that he did not expect it).Jos√© Hermano Saraiva (coordinator) ‚Äì Hist√≥ria de Portugal, vol. VI, Quidnovi, 2004, p. 63. The Portuguese government materially assisted the French garrisons that had taken refuge in Lagos after the battle. The French king, Louis XV, thanked Jos√© I for all the assistance given to the French sailors, although claiming for the navies. The case seemed settled, but Spain and France would use it as a pretext to invade Portugal four years later. Portugal was having increasing difficulties in maintaining its neutrality in the Seven Years' War because of outbreaks of minor incidents between British and French: on one occasion, the British consul in Faro instructed British frigates to enter the city's harbour and prevent a French warship from unloading; and in Viana do Minho, British businessmen armed themselves and boarded a boat, recapturing a captured British merchant ship from a French corsair. Despite these incidents, the king and government of Portugal were strongly committed to keep the country out of the war. On their part, the French were increasingly pressing a reluctant Spain to enter the war on their side (while beginning secret negotiations with Great Britain to end it).\\"France‚Äôs Foreign Minister, the Duc de Choiseul, had pressured Charles III of Spain to declare war against Britain, even as he was beginning secret negotiations with London to end the fighting\\". In York, Neil Longley ‚Äì Turning the World Upside Down: The War of American Independence and the Problem of Empire, Praeger, London, 2003, p. 33.

Confronted with the Franco-Spanish \\"ultimatum\\" of 1762 to betray his alliance with Britain, he said \\"it would affect him less, though reduced to the last extremity, to let the last tile of his palace fall, and to see his faithful subjects spill the last drop of their blood, than to sacrifice, together with the honour of his crown, all that Portugal holds most dear...\\"In Carnota, John Smith A. ‚Äì The Marquis of Pombal, 2nd edition, Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, London, 1871. p. 187. Both Bourbon powers decided to force Portugal to join their third Family Compact (the Portuguese king was married to a Bourbon, the Spanish king Charles's sister). Spain and France sent an ultimatum to Lisbon (1 April 1762) stating that Portugal had to:Carvalhosa, Manuel F. Barros (Viscount of Santar√©m) ‚Äì Quadro Elementar das Rela√ß√µes Pol√≠ticas e Diplom√°ticas de Portugal, Tome VI, Paris, 1850, p. XVI. * Terminate the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance replacing it with a new alliance with France and Spain. * Close her ports to English ships and to interrupt all commerce with Great Britain both in Europe and within the Portuguese empire. * Declare war on Great Britain * Accept the occupation of Portuguese ports (including Lisbon and Oporto) by a Spanish army. Thus Portugal would be both \\"protected\\" and \\"liberated\\" from its British \\"oppressors\\". Portugal was given four days to answer, after which the country would face an invasion by the forces of France and Spain. Both Bourbon powers hoped to benefit by diverting British troops from Germany to Portugal, while Spain hoped to seize Portugal and its empire.\\"One of the main aims of the two great Bourbon powers, in the making of the Family Compact, had been to attack Portugal, in order either to compel England to send a large part of its troops to that country, or to take possession of it‚Ä¶\\"; in Philippson, Martin ‚Äì The Age of Frederick the Great, vol. XV, Lea Brothers and & company, Philadelphia, 1905, p. 103. The Portuguese situation was desperate. The great Lisbon earthquake, tsunami and fire of 1755 had completely destroyed the Portuguese capital, killing tens of thousands and damaging most of the Portuguese fortresses. Rebuilding a new Lisbon left no money to sustain an army or navy; and even the military cadres who had died in the earthquake were not replaced by 1762. From 1750 onward the Brazilian gold supply (which made Portugal by far the largest gold owner on earth during the 18th century) started its irreversible decline, and the price of Brazilian sugar also fell as British and Dutch demand reduced.Livermore, H. V. ‚Äì A New History of Portugal, Cambridge University Press, London, 1966, p. 232. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake horrified Europe, sparking a debate about the nature of its causes among the main European philosophers, mainly between Voltaire and Rousseau: Providential or natural? The famous pamphlet A Spanish Prophecy, published in 1762 in Madrid, intended to prove that all the carnage suffered by the Portuguese during the earthquake, tsunami and ensuing fire, were divine punishment for their alliance with the British heretics.Clark, Edward ‚Äì Letters concerning the Spanish nation, London, 1763, p.353. British help included 6,000 barrels of meat, 4,000 of butter,1,200 sacks of rice, 10,000 quarters of flour and ¬£100,000 for relief (while Spanish and French money offers were refused)Livermore, H. V. ‚Äì A History of Portugal, Cambridge University Press, London, 1947, p. 359. The Portuguese navy ‚Äì which had been powerful during the 15th century, was reduced to only three ships of the line and some frigates. The general picture of the Portuguese \\"army\\" was calamitous: The regiments were incomplete, the military warehouses were empty, and there were no military hospitals. By November 1761, the troops had not been paid for a year and a half (they received 6 months payment on the eve of war), and many soldiers lived from robbery, or \\"assassinating for a livelihood\\".According to Dumouriez in An Account of Portugal, as it Appeared in 1766 to Dumouriez, Lausanne (1775), and London (1797), p. 103. Military discipline was a distant memory and the greater part of the troops was \\"without uniforms and without arms\\".According to Dumouriez in An Account of Portugal, as it Appeared in 1766 to Dumouriez, Lausanne (1775), and London (1797), p. 244. When French Ambassador O‚ÄôDunne delivered the ultimatum (1 April 1762), a party of sergeants with a captain knocked on his door, begging for alms.Azevedo, J. L√∫cio de ‚Äì O Marqu√™s de Pombal e a sua √©poca, 2nd edition, Annu√°rio do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, p. 237. Recruitment often included trapping vagrants and transients during popular gatherings. The Count of Saint-Priest, French ambassador in Portugal, reported: \\"It was impossible to find an army in greater disorder than in Portugal. When the Count of Lippe [the supreme allied commander, sent by England] arrived, the army had as Field Marshal the Marquis de Alvito, who had never learned to shoot a rifle or command a regiment, even in peacetime. The colonels, mostly great Lords, placed as officers in their regiments their valets. It was very common to see soldiers, mostly ragged, begging for alms [even the sentinels of the royal palace]. This state of disorder had just finished shortly before I arrived. We need to be fair. The Count of Lippe established discipline, forced officials to choose between the position in the regiment or his previous condition as valets. (‚Ä¶).With the aid of some foreign officials, military bodies were disciplined and when I arrived, were already trained.\\"In Dellon, Gabriel (and other authors)‚Äì Portugal nos S√©culos Dezassete e Dezoito: Quatro Testemunhos, Lis√≥ptima Edi√ß√µes, 1989, p. 157. (in Portuguese). To reinforce their ultimatum and press the Portuguese government, Spanish and French troops started gathering on the Portuguese northern frontiers since 16 March 1762, alleging it was merely a \\"preventive army\\". The Portuguese government declared its intention of defending to the last. As soon as news of the entry of Spanish troops into the North of the kingdom reached the Court, Portugal declared war both on Spain and France (18 May 1762), asking for British financial and military assistance. Spain and France declared war on 15 and 20 June, respectively. Invasions =First invasion of Portugal(Tr√°s-os-Montes)= On 30 April 1762 a Spanish force penetrated into Portugal through the province of Tr√°s-os- Montes and posted a proclamation entitled \\"reasons for entering Portugal\\", in which the Spaniards declared that they were coming not as enemies, but as friends and liberators who came to free the Portuguese people from the \\"heavy shackles of England\\",\\"Portugal refused [to submit to the ultimatum], whereupon Spain and France said they would invade Portugal to free her from 'the heavy shackles of Britanic dominion' \\".

On May 5, the Marquis of Sarria, leading an army of 22,000 men started the real invasion.\\"Madrid believed a show of force on the border might compel Oeyras [the Portuguese prime minister] to cave to Bourbon demands; so the army was given light provisions to hasten its arrival. It was a futile gesture. In May the under-supplied expeditionary army invaded and advanced towards Oporto. A column of 22,000 men under Commander-in-Chief Nicol√°s Carvajal y Lancaster, Marquis de Sarri√°, crossed into Northeast Portugal as 'friends' ‚Ä¶\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 438. Portugal declared war on both Spain and France (18 May 1762). The region of Tr√°s-os-Montes was the main theater of operations during the first Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal (May‚ÄìJune, 1762). Miranda, the only fortified and provisioned fortress of the province, was besieged on 6 May 1762, but an accidental and huge powder explosion (20 tons) killed four hundred and opened two breaches in the ramparts, forcing the surrender on 9 May 1762. Bragan√ßa (12 May), Chaves (21 May), and Torre de Moncorvo (23 May) were open cities without soldiers, and were occupied without firing a gun. There were neither fortresses with intact walls nor regular troops inside the entire province of Tr√°s-os-Montes (neither powder nor provisions).\\"The Province was absolutely defenceless without soldiers, arms, powder, ball or provisions, and it was impossible to paint the scandalous conditions of the defences.\\" In Francis, Alan David ‚Äì Portugal 1715‚Äì1808, Tamesis Books Limited, London, 1985, p.150. The Spanish general joked about the complete absence of Portuguese soldiers across the province: \\"I can not discover where these insects are.\\"Dumouriez, Charles ‚Äì An Account of Portugal, as it Appeared in 1766 to Dumouriez, Lausanne (1775), and London (1797), p. 249. At first, the relationship of the invaders with the civil population was apparently excellent. The Spaniards paid double for the provisions they acquired, and there wasn't a single shotgun.Francis, Alan David, Portugal 1715‚Äì1808, 1985, p. 150. But Madrid had committed a double error: since the Spaniards believed that the simple show of power would be enough to induce Portugal to submission, they entered the country almost without provisions, which would undermine the entire campaign. They also assumed that the country could provide them all the necessary food. When this proved an illusion, the Spanish army imposed forced requisitions of provisions to the populations. These were the trigger for a popular revolt, with war for food feeding war.\\"Lack of supplies slowed and then distracted them. Wishing to win over popular sentiment, Sarri√° at first paid the Portuguese double for provisions. He had assumed wrongly that Portugal could provide all that was required, thus allowing war to feed war. When the necessary supplies did not materialize he exacted forced contributions from the countryside, and this, along with a native hatred of the Spanish, triggered a general peasant uprising...\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark- The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 439. The \\"Portuguese ulcer\\" Victory seemed a matter of time, and in Madrid, it was confidently expected that the fall of Oporto was imminent, but suddenly the invaders were confronted with a national rebellion, which spread around the Provinces of Tr√°s-os-Montes and Minho. Francisco Sarmento, the governor of Tr√°s-os-Montes, posted a declaration ordering the people to resist the Spaniards or be branded rebels. The Spaniards were confronted by deserted villages with neither food nor peasants to build roads for the army. Together with some militias and ordnances (respectively a kind of Portuguese military institution of 2nd and 3rd line), gangs of civilians armed with sickles and guns attacked the Spanish troops, taking advantage of the mountainous terrain.\\"Both sides relied extensively on foreign troops and officers, though Portuguese popular opposition to the Spaniards proved decisive in places, especially in the North.\\" In Maxwell, Kenneth ‚Äì Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment, University Press, Cambridge, 1995, p. 113. The Spaniards suffered heavy losses and high rates of disease. Several reports on the ground (published in the British press in 1762) confirm this: \\"[Province of] Beira. Almeida, June 12, (...) the Enemy [Spaniards], to the number of eight thousand has entered the frontier‚Ä¶ several parties have rallied forth from the camp, and had pillaged the villages upon that frontier, and had not even spared the churches; but that these parties had been driven back by the Portuguese militia, who had killed and taken prisoners upwards of two hundred Spaniards (...).

IV, London, 1764, p. 904. According to a French contemporary source, more than 4,000 Spaniards died in the hospital of Braganza,See Dumouriez, Charles ‚Äì An Account of Portugal, as it Appeared in 1766 to Dumouriez, Lausanne (1775), and London (1797), p. 18. both from wounds and disease. Many others were killed by the guerrillas, taken prisoners, or died from starvation ‚Äì which was becoming a growing problem. The Portuguese nationalism and the atrocities committed by the Spanish army against peasant villages ‚Äì mainly during food expeditions ‚Äì were the fuel for the revolt. Even the King of Spain Charles III, in his declaration of war to Portugal (15 June 1762) ‚Äì one month and a half after the start of the invasion and almost one month after the Portuguese declaration of war on Spain ‚Äì complained that many Portuguese populations, conducted by undercover officers, had treacherously killed several Spanish detachments.Lafuente, Modesto ‚Äì Historia General de Espa√±a, tome XX, third part, 8th book, Madrid, 1858, p. 55. In another example, the Portuguese Corregidor of Miranda reported in August 1762 that the invading forces in the north had The invaders were forced to split their forces in order to protect conquered strongholds, find food, and escorting convoys with supplies. The food for the army had to come from Spain itself, which made it vulnerable to attacks. Unless the Spanish army could quickly take Oporto, starvation would make their situation untenable. Oporto: the decisive campaign A Spanish force of 3,000 to 6,000 men led by O'Reilly left Chaves, and advanced towards Oporto. This caused great alarm among the British in the city, where their community had many stores with provisions and 30,000 pipes of wine waiting shipment. Measures for evacuating them were initiated by the British Admiralty, while the Portuguese governor of Oporto was ordered to leave the city (which he did not).\\"Spain now controlled the entire province of Tras-os Montes... the way to Oporto lay open and a general alarm engulfed Portugal... the Governor of Oporto‚Ä¶received orders to retreat towards Lisbon if the Spanish advanced... English merchants there began to evacuate (...). All that was left to the Spanish was to cross the Douro River... Charles O‚ÄôHara led a rag-tag peasant band of 1,500 angry peasants, most of who wielded implements, and repulsed the 5,000-strong Spanish force. This action upset the Spanish plan to cross the Douro... similar partisan activity repulsed a Spanish advance on Almeida on 25 May. The rest of the Portuguese population simply deserted their villages and fled to the mountains.... the Spanish thrust had been parried. Sarria‚Äôs offensive grounded to a halt. 'Small war' had trumped the big battalions.\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 439. But when the Spaniards tried to cross the River Douro between Torre de Moncorvo and Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a, they met O‚ÄôHara and his Portuguese force of hundreds of peasants with guns and some Ordenances, helped by women and children in the hills of the southern margin (May 25). In the battle that followed, the Spanish assaults were completely beaten off with losses. * The British Chronologift: \\"Battle, at the river Douro, when the Portuguese defeated the Spaniards, May 25, 1762\\".

Spanish withdrawal In addition to these setbacks, and similarly to the Napoleonic soldiers a few decades later, the Spaniards were experiencing carnage. A contemporary document notes that it was impossible to walk in the mountains of the province of Tr√°s-os-Montes because of the nauseating odour of countless Spanish corpses, which the peasants refused ‚Äì motivated by pure hate ‚Äì to bury.Serr√£o, Joaquim Ver√≠ssimo ‚Äì Hist√≥ria de Portugal: O Despotismo Iluminado (1750‚Äì1807), vol.

Nevertheless the heterogeneous body of English, Germans, and Portuguese collected under La Lippe made a very good fight of it, and Burgoyne, now a brigadier at the head of 3,000 cavalry, mostly Portuguese, distinguished himself...\\", in Cook, John D. and others ‚Äì The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art, Vol. 41, John W.

He trained intensively the Portuguese army in a record time, and chose to use small units against the flanks and rear of the invader's big battalions (taking advantage of the mountainous terrain). He destroyed the enemy's will to fight by starvation, the bleeding of his forces in a guerrilla warfare, and by an exhausting war of marches and counter marches (the so-called \\"Fantastic War\\").\\"The [Anglo- Portuguese] allies won by adroit marches and counter-marches, so that although‚Ä¶the enemy, by superior numbers, could possibly have won, they were always confronted by defenders in a good position and never dared to risk an all-out attack. A Campaign won without the major casualties of battle [for the Anglo-Portuguese]\\". In Journal of the Society for Army Historical research, vol. 59, London, 1981, p. 25.\\"... The movements of the Anglo-Portuguese troops forced the Spanish army of General Aranda to withdraw.\\" In Mendes, J. Caria- John Hunter in Portugal, 1963, page 61 (originally published in Semana M√©dica, nr. 91, 22 January 1961 and translated by Dr. Guerra of the Wellcome Medical Library). Meanwhile, a British expeditionary force landed: the 83rd, 91st regiments of infantry, together with the major portion of the 16th light dragoons (all led by Major General George Townshend) arrived at Lisbon in May; while the 3rd, 67th, 75th, and 85th regiments of foot along with two Royal Artillery companies (the main force) only landed from Belle-Isle, in July 1762. The total number of this force is known with exactitude (from official documents): 7,104 officers and men of all arms. Great Britain also sent provisions, ammunition and a loan of ¬£200,000 to the Portuguese ally. There was some friction between both allies, caused by problems of language, religion and envy; the Portuguese officers felt uncomfortable with being commanded by strangers, and especially with the salaries of their British peers, which was double theirs (so that British officers could keep the salary they had in the British army). In addition to the difficulty of feeding British troops in Portugal, Lippe successfully faced another huge problem: the recreation of the Portuguese army and its integration with the British one. La Lippe selected only 7,000 to 8,000 men out of the 40,000 Portuguese soldiers who were submitted to him, and dismissed all the others as useless or unfit for military service.Azevedo, J. L√∫cio de ‚Äì O Marqu√™s de Pombal e a sua √©poca, 2nd edition, Annu√°rio do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, p. 239. Thus, the complete allied army in campaign was about 15,000 regular soldiers (half Portuguese and half British). The militias and ordnances (respectively a kind of Portuguese military institution of 2nd and 3rd line, around 25,000 men in total) were only used to garrison the fortresses whilst some regular troops (1st line) remained in the north of Portugal to face the Spanish troops of Galicia. These 15,000 men had to face a combined army of 42,000 invaders (of whom were 30,000 Spaniards led by Count of Aranda, and 10,000 to 12,000 French commanded by Prince de Beauvau). Lippe would eventually be successful both in the integration of the two armies as well as in the final action. As noted by historian Martin Philippson:\\"In 1762 he was chosen to command the united English and Portuguese army in a victorious war against the Spanish\\". In Radant, Friedhelm ‚Äì From Baroque to Storm and Stress, 1720‚Äì1775, Vol. IV of Literary History of Germany, Croom Helm, 1977, p. 137. \\"The new leader was able, in a short time, to reorganize the Portuguese army, and with it, re- enforced by the English, he drove the Spaniards, in spite of their superiority in numbers, across the frontiers, (...)\\"Philippson, Martin ‚Äì The Age of Frederick the great, vol. 15, Lea Brothers & Company, 1905, p. 103. =Aborted Spanish invasion (Alentejo)= The Franco-Spanish army had been divided into three divisions:\\"The Bourbons... planned the invasion in three divisions: the first, in the north of Portugal, between the Minho and the Douro; the second, in the middle, between the Douro and the Tagus; and the third, to the south of the Tagus, to co-operate on that side with the middle corps in its attempt upon Lisbon. The northern division... commenced hostilities; entered the Portuguese province of Tr√°s-os-Montes and...\\" in Bisset, Robert ‚Äì The History of the Reign of George III , Vol. I, Philadelphia, 1822, p. 188. the Northeast Division, in Galicia, invaded the northeast Portuguese provinces of Tr√°s-os- Montes and Minho with Oporto as its ultimate goal (first invasion of Portugal, May‚ÄìJune 1762); the central division (reinforced by French troops and the remnants of the northeast division) ‚Äì which afterwards invaded the Portuguese province of Beira (centre of Portugal) towards Lisbon (second invasion of Portugal, July‚ÄìNovember 1762); and finally a southern army's corps (near Valencia de Alc√°ntara), designed to invade the province of Alentejo, in the south of Portugal. The successes of the Franco-Spanish army in the beginning of the second invasion of Portugal (Beira) caused such alarm that Joseph I pressured his commander, Count of Lippe, for an offensive campaign. Since the enemy was gathering troops and ammunitions in the region of Valencia de Alc√°ntara, near Alentejo ‚Äì preparing a third Spanish invasion ‚Äì Lippe chose to take preemptive action by attacking the invader on his own ground, in Estremadura. The troops around Valencia de Alc√°ntara were the advanced lines of the Spanish third corps (southern division), and this city was a main supply dep√¥t, containing magazines and a park of artillery. The allies had the surprise factor on their side as the disparity of numbers and resources was so great that the Spaniards did not expect such a risky operation: they had neither barricades nor advanced piquets, or even guards, except in the city's great square. On the morning of 27 August 1762, a force of 2,800 Anglo- Portuguese under Burgoyne attacked and took Valencia de Alc√°ntara, defeated one of the best Spanish regiments (the Seville's regiment), killed all the soldiers that resisted, captured three flags and several troops and officers ‚Äì including the Major-General Don Miguel de Irunibeni, responsible for the invasion of Alentejo, and who had come into the city the day before (along with two colonels, two captains and seventeen subaltern officers). Many arms and ammunition were captured or destroyed. The Battle of Valencia de Alc√°ntara not only galvanized the Portuguese army at a critical phase of the war (in beginning of the second invasion), but also prevented a third invasion of Portugal by the Alentejo,\\"... this action disrupted the concentration of the third Spanish column that was to launch itself from Valencia into the Alemtejo, and therefore stalled the threat of a general engagement that Lippe so feared.\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 447. a plain and open province, through which the powerful Spanish chivalry could march towards the vicinity of Lisbon without opposition. Burgoyne was rewarded by the King of Portugal, Joseph I, with a large diamond ring, together with the captured flags, while his international reputation skyrocketed. =Second invasion of Portugal (Beira)= Province of Lower Beira was particularly devastated during the second Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal (July‚ÄìNovember, 1762). A self-destructive scorched earth strategy was the price of the Portuguese victory.\\"...

Sarria's shattered army returned into Spain by Ciudad Rodrigo and gathered with the centre's army. Here, the two Spanish corps were joined by a French army of 12,000 men, led by Prince de Beauvau, putting the total number of the Bourbon invaders at 42,000 men. Illusion of victory The original plan to converge on Oporto through Tr√°s-os Montes was abandoned and replaced by a new one:\\"[The initial victorious situation] began to change rapidly... In Madrid, the news that the Spanish troops had entered Oporto was expected; but the news that arrived was the complete opposite of this, and assumed a radical change in the conduct of military operations in Portugal. O'Reilly, who had reached to Vila Real and continued his advance [Towards Oporto], was checked ‚Ä¶by 5,000 Portuguese, organized by British officers, whereby Sarri√° ordered the 'general retreat' [back into Spain]‚Ä¶ with the intention of returning to the original plan of reaching Lisbon through Almeida [in Province of Beira].\\" In L√≥pez, Emilio Gonz√°lez ‚Äì Bajo las luces de la Ilustraci√≥n: Galicia en los reinados de Carlos III y Carlos IV, Edic. Del Castro, 1977, page 22, . this time Portugal would be invaded through the province of Beira, in the east centre of the country, and the target would be Lisbon. Sarria was replaced by the Count of Aranda, while the Spanish minister Esquilache went to Portugal to support and organize the logistic of the Spanish army so that it had food for 6 months.\\"Esquilache himself went to Portugal to reorganize Aranda‚Äôs logistical support.\\" In Stein, Stanley and Stein, Barbara ‚Äì Apogee of Empire: Spain and New Spain in the Age of Charles III, 1759‚Äì1789, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004, chapter Imperilled Colonies and Spain‚Äôs Response. Considering the complete unpreparedness of the Portuguese army, and the huge disparity of forces (30,000 Spaniards plus 12,000 French versus 7,000‚Äì8,000 Portuguese plus 7,104 British), the Marquis of Pombal assembled twelve ships in the Tagus estuary prepared, if necessary, to transfer the Portuguese king and court into Brazil. In the beginning of the second invasion, A British observer ‚Äì after describing the Portuguese soldiers as the \\"wretched troops\\" he ever saw, who were \\"often five days together without bread, and the horses without forage\\" ‚Äì wrote he was apprehensive that Lippe, overwhelmed by difficulties, ended up asking for resignation.Sir Charles Grey to Shelburne, cited in Nelson, Paul David ‚Äì Sir Charles Grey, First Earl Grey, Royal Soldier, family Patriarch, Associated University Presses, USA, 1996, p. 26. Indeed, at first the Franco-Spanish army occupied several fortresses with ruined walls and without regular troops:\\"Spanish successes in overrunning poorly defended Portuguese fortresses led to urgent Portuguese requests for British troops, and these helped to turn the side.\\" Cambridge illustrated Atlas, Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492‚Äì1792, vol. II, 1996, p. 127. Alfaiates, Castelo Rodrigo, Penamacor, Monsanto, Salvaterra do Extremo, Segura (17 September 1762), Castelo Branco (18 September), and Vila Velha (2 October) surrendered practically without firing a gun, as lamented by the allied commander, Lippe. After the war, several fortresses governors would be tried and convicted for treason and cowardice. Almeida, the main fortress of the Province, was in such a state that O‚ÄôHara,\\"Almeida, a key frontier town whose possession could open up the route to Lisbon, was in chaos. Its fortifications were second rate and its inhabitants terrified of Spanish aggression.\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 437. the British officer who led the guerrilleros and militias at the battle of Douro, advised the stronghold 's commander to take his garrison out of the fortress and put it in nearby country where defence could be much more easily sustained.Francis, Alan David, Portugal 1715‚Äì1808, 1985, p. 150. (The commander responded that he could not do that without superior orders). Its garrison, consisting only in two regular regiments and three militia regiments (totalling 3,000 to 3, 500 men), experienced a drastic reduction in their numbers for desertion, during the enemy's approaching and siege.\\"The garrison had... almost 3,000 men; but consisted of new recruits, and much of it deserted in the beginning of the siege, due to carelessness or connivance of the governor.\\" In Lippe, Count of ‚Äì M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762, 1770, page 6.This huge desertion rate is abundantly corroborated by the testimony of several officers during the council of war of 25 August (the day of surrender); Manuel Rebelo de Sousa: \\"Given the great consternation in this fortress‚Ä¶ and the fact that the garrison is small and of poor quality because of much desertion, I am in favor of surrender...\\" Or Domingos de Frias de S√£o Payo: \\"The garrison [is] so tiny of infantry troops and auxiliary... because most of them left the garrison and defected...\\", in Costa, Fernando Dores ‚Äì Nova Hist√≥ria Militar de Portugal , C√≠rculo de Leitores, Vol. II, Coordinator: Ant√≥nio Hespanha, 2004, p. 339.

According to Dumouriez, the garrison had fired only 5 or 6 artillery shots ‚Äì disobeying Palhares's prohibition of firing on the enemy ‚Äì and had suffered only two dead. Having capitulated on condition of not serving against Spain for six months, they were allowed to go free, carry their guns and luggage, and join the Portuguese garrison of Viseu: The Bourbon allies were so amazed with such a hasty proposal for surrender (Palhares would die in a Portuguese prison), that they conceded all demanded. The capture of Almeida (with 83 canons and 9 mortars) was publicly celebrated in Madrid as a great victory and represented the peak of the initial Spanish predominance. This auspicious beginning led to the impression that the Bourbons were winning the war, but in reality, the occupation of these strongholds would prove to be not only useless, but also harmful to the invaders, as pointed by historian George P. James: In addition to this, a new popular revolt exponentially worsened the situation of the invaders. Like Napoleon during the Peninsular War, the Franco-Spaniards of Aranda would learn in 1762 ‚Äì at their own expense ‚Äì that the (brief) occupation of several strongholds, although greatly praised by Spanish historiography, was irrelevant to the ultimate outcome of a war of guerrilla and movements.

Painting by Allan Ramsay People in arms The initial Franco-Spanish success in Beira benefited from the strong popular opposition to the regime of the Marquis of Pombal,\\"Although this war was undertaken entirely in the national interests, nay, in defence of the very existence of Portugal, it was viewed with disfavour by an influential if not a large portion of the population‚Ä¶Colonel Anderson, belonging to the British contingent, and serving on the staff of the Count of Santiago, writes to Burgoyne: -'you may depend upon receiving the best of intelligence of the enemy‚Äôs motions; but hitherto the Conde de Santiago has found it very difficult to get good intelligence. It‚Äôs odd, you‚Äôll say, when every peasant might reasonably be supposed to be a spy for him. These do not look on the Spaniards as their enemy; they think their cause the cause of the Jesuits and the cause of God. The people of condition, the Excellencies and the hidalgos have so insuperable a hatred to the minister, as to sacrifice their king, their country, and even their honour, to feed it. I have, however, the happiness here to be under as honest a man as ever lived [Portuguese commander Count of Santiago], with as good a heart as it is possible to imagine.'\\" In Edward Barrington de Fonblanque ‚Äì Political and military episodes in the latter half of the nineteenth century, Macmillan and Co., London, 1876, pp. 36‚Äì37. the ruthless Portuguese prime minister; but the massacres and plunder perpetrated by the invaders ‚Äì especially by the French ‚Äì soon incurred the peasants' odium. Having penetrated so deeply into the mountainous interior of Portugal, the Franco-Spanish rows find themselves harassed and decimated in ambushes by guerrilleros, who cut their lines of communication and supplies behind them. As Napoleonic general Maximilien S√©bastien Foy put it: Several French participants in the campaign stated that the most feared fighters were the guerrilleros of Tr√°s-os-Montes and Beira.In Azevedo, J. L√∫cio de ‚Äì O Marqu√™s de Pombal e a sua √©poca, 2nd edition, Annu√°rio do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, p. 241. The inhabitants of the province of Beira wrote to the Portuguese prime minister informing him that they did not need regular soldiers, and were going to fight alone.Francis, Alan David, Portugal 1715‚Äì1808, 1985, p. 150. As explained by Spanish prime minister Godoy: Sometimes the guerrilleros tortured their numerous prisoners, which in turn generated retaliations upon the civilians, in an endless spiral of violence.\\"These peasants they [the Spaniards] hanged and shot whenever they fell into their hands; and their incensed comrades committed, in return, the most merciless barbarities on their prisoners\\". In Cassel, John; Smith, John and Howitt, William ‚Äì John Cassel‚Äôs Illustrated History of England, vol. 5, London, 1861, p. 17. But while the peasant's casualties could be absorbed by their inexhaustible numbers, the same was not true for the invaders. Even in the occupied cities and villages, the populations defied and rebelled against the Franco-Spaniards, according to a letter sent by D\`Aranda to Lippe, asking him to put a stop to it.Academia Portuguesa da Hist√≥ria- Anais, 1986, p. 401. Many of them were executed. Abrantes: turning point Instead of trying to defend the extensive Portuguese frontier, Lippe retreated into the mountainous interior to defend the line of the River Tagus, which was equivalent to a forward defence of Lisbon. Lippe‚Äôs main goals consisted in avoiding at all cost a battle against such a superior enemy (disputing instead the gorges and mountain passes, while attacking the enemy flanks with small units),\\"Outnumbered, he planned to attack where opportunities arouse and to harass the Spanish on the flanks and rear, while avoiding a general engagement against superior forces.\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 446. and also preventing the Franco- Spaniards from crossing the formidable barrier represented by the river Tagus. If the Bourbon armies could cross this river, they would reach the fertile province of Alentejo, whose plains would allow their numerous cavalry to reach easily the region of Lisbon. Indeed, immediately after the capture of Almeida, Aranda marched with the intention of crossing the Tagus into the Alentejo at the most propitious point: Vila Velha, where the Spanish army of Philip V of Spain had crossed the river, during the war of the Spanish succession some years before. Lippe, however, anticipated this movement and moved faster. He got to Abrantes and posted a detachment under Burgoynne at Niza and another one under the Count of Santiago near Alvito, to obstruct the passage of the river Tagus at Vila Velha; so that when the invading army came up, they found all these strategic positions occupied (and all boats taken or destroyed by the Portuguese). Therefore, and as Lippe had predicted, the invaders had only two options: return into Spain, to cross the Tagus at Alc√°ntara (which they considered dishonourable since this would imply to withdraw before inferior forces), or go straight to Lisbon through the mountains at the north of the capital, in the \\"neck\\" of the \\"peninsula\\" containing this city (defined by the river Tagus and the Atlantic).See Lippe, M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762, 1770, pp. 25‚Äì28. In order to induce the enemy to choose the second route, Lippe placed some forces in these mountains but left some passages open. Since Lisbon was the main goal, Aranda advanced, while the allied forces fortified their excellent positions on the heights that cover Abrantes, halfway between Lisbon and the border (the region among the rivers Tagus, Z√™zere and Codes). These mountains presented steep slopes on the side of the invaders (acting as a barrier for them), but were very soft on the side of the allies ‚Äì which allowed them great freedom of movement and facilitated the reinforcements.Lippe ‚Äì M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762. 1770, pages 44‚Äì45. Finally, the Anglo-Portuguese army managed to halt the advance of the Bourbon armies toward Lisbon.\\"... Portugal concentrated 15, 000 men [the complete Allied army consisted of 7,000 to 8,000 Portuguese plus 7,104 British] at the city of Abrantes and effectively barred the Spanish thrust. Then... the Spaniards\` supply system failed, causing the troops to go hungry.\\" In Santiago, Mark ‚Äì The Red Captain: The Life of Hugo O'Conor, Commandant Inspector of the Interior Provinces of New Spain, Arizona historical Society, 1994, p. 14.

In order to break this deadlock, the Spaniards went on the offensive towards Abrantes, the allied Headquarters. They took the little castle of Vila Velha (north bank of the Tagus, 3 October 1762) and forced the defiles of St. Simon, near the River Alvito, launching a large force in pursuit of the detachment of Count of Santiago through the mountains. This detachment was very near being entirely cut off, with two Spanish bodies marching upon their front and rear. But la Lippe sent an immediate reinforcement to Count de Santiago, and the combined allied force under Loudoun defeated the chasing Spanish troops at the River Alvito (3 October 1762), and escaped to Sobreira Formosa.Letter from the Allied commander (Earl of Loudoun) to the Earl of Egremont, Ma√ß√£o, 9 October 1762: \\"As soon as the enemy perceived our intention of drawing back, they pushed a corps over the river Alvito, to harass our rearguard, which was composed of the four English regiments, six companies of Portuguese grenadiers, a few of our light dragoons, and a regiment of Portuguese cavalry, with the four British field-pieces‚Ä¶but upon my ordering one of the guns to be brought up, which Major M. Bean conducted so effectually that hardly any shot was fired that did not take place among the enemy, they thought proper to retire‚Ä¶the country-people report, that they have buried 40 of the enemy. I can not omit mentioning to your Lordship that the Portuguese grenadiers showed upon this occasion, not only a very good countenance, but the utmost readiness and alertness in forming upon all the different occasions where it was necessary.\\" In Boswell, James ‚Äì The Scots Magazine, vol. XXIV, Edinburgh, 1762, p.551. But while, the Spaniards were chasing the Count of Santiago's force through the mountains, they weakened their force in Vila Velha. On 5 October 1762, the Anglo-Portuguese commanded by Lee attacked and completely routed the Spaniards at Vila Velha.\\"The attack was led by Lt. col. Charles Lee of the Dragoons of whom some, perhaps the majority, were Portuguese.\\" In Francis, Alan David ‚Äì Portugal 1715‚Äì1808, Tamesis Books Limited, London, 1985, p.158. Several Spaniards were killed (including a general, who died trying to rally his troops), and among the prisoners there were 6 officers. 60 artillery-mules were captured, the artillery and magazines destroyed. Moreover, in the very some day (5 October 1762) the Portuguese of Townshend defeated a French force escorting a convoy at Sabugal, capturing a large quantity of precious supplies. The invaders did not pass and the offensive was a failure. The tide of the war had reversed and Abrantes proved to be \\"the key of Portugal\\" in the River Tagus,\\"Abrantes: (...) In 1762, the Spaniards were defeated there by the Portuguese.\\" In Encyclop√©die du dix-neuvi√®me si√®cle, vol I, Paris, 1858, page 106. for its strategic position. Scorched earth tactics Both armies remained immobilized at Abrantes, facing each other. But while the Anglo- Portuguese continuously reinforced their positions and received provisions,Lippe ‚Äì M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762. 1770, pages 46- 47. the Bourbon armies had their line of supply and communication virtually cut off by the armed peasants, militia and ordinances in their rear. Worse than this, they were being starved by a deadly tactic of scorched earth. This tactic would be used again in 1810‚Äì11 against the French of Mass√©na, who, similarly to the invaders of 1762 were stopped in their march on Lisbon, being starved and attacked by guerrillas. As noted by the eminent British military historian Sir Charles Oman: \\"Throughout Portuguese history the summons to the levy en masse had always been combined with another measure, from which indeed it could not be disentangled-the order to the whole population to evacuate and devastate the land in face of the advancing enemy. The use of the weapon of starvation... the plan for defeating the enemy by the system of devastation‚Ä¶was an ancient Portuguese device, practised from time immemorial against the Castilian invader, which had never failed of success. (...) When Spain had made her last serious assault on Portugal in 1762... the plan had work[ed] admirably...\\"Oman, Charles ‚Äì A History of the Peninsular War, vol III, Clarendon Press, 1908, p.183, p.184 and p. 185. Indeed, the Portuguese soldiers and peasants turned the Province of Beira into a desert: populations abandoned villages, bringing with them everything that was edible. The crops and all that could be useful to the enemy was burned or taken. Even the roads and some houses were destroyed.\\"Lippe had directed the Count St. Jo√£o to drive the country during his retreat to the Lower Beira, and every thing that could not been carried off was destroyed: so that the enemy now found himself in a desert, without being able to procure either provisions, care, or peasants to assist them; the inhabitants had abandoned their villages, and carried off every thing (...)\\", in The Royal Military Chronicle, vol V, London, 1812, pp. 50‚Äì51.\\"... lower Beira could not provide for the enemy neither food, nor chariots nor peasants to build roads: the Count of Santiago had been ordered... to make disappear from this province everything that could be eaten or used as road; but what mainly contributed to the scarcity in the province was the cruel procedure of the enemy against the inhabitants, many of whom were killed, and their villages were looted and torched in revenge for the deaths caused by the peasants... thus, many inhabitants in order to escape the atrocities of the enemy, had left their homes, taking with them their cattle, food and whatever they could carry...\\", in Lippe, Count of ‚Äì M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762, 1770, pp. 39‚Äì41. Thus, the exhausted Franco- Spanish army was forced to choose between staying in front of Abrantes and starve, or withdraw, while still possible, closer to the border.\\"Lippe executed forty years before Lord Wellington, a similar manoeuvre to that in which the distinct English General took shelter behind the Lines of Torres Vedras, thereby opposing an invincible barrier to the army of Massena. Count of Aranda found himself in the same position as Marshal Prince d'Essling, or perhaps in an even more critical situation. In fact, as the Napoleon‚Äôs general, Aranda was forced to retreat or starve in Beira. (...) \\", In Chagas, Pinheiro- Hist√≥ria de Portugal, vol. VII, Lisboa, 1902, pp. 46‚Äì47. The allied plan proved almost perfect as it was based in two realities. First, to conquer Portugal the Franco-Spaniards had to take Lisbon. Second, Lisbon could only be attacked from the mountainous North (prevented by the allied defensive system of Abrantes) since Lisbon is protected by the Atlantic Ocean at the West and by the great River Tagus at the South and East, being inside a kind of \\"peninsula\\".\\"The second zone [Lower Beira] is the one that leads most directly to the peninsula of Lisbon; but it is also the most difficult. Those travelling for the first time in the Beira railway line before reaching the Tagus, are impressed by the great picture of a cordillera rising steeply like a great wall (...). It is a formidable defensive position against which the two Spanish invasions of 1704 and 1762 were checked. During the first one, the Duke of Berwick quickly gave up forcing it. In the second, Count of Aranda managed to penetrate the mountains, but was quickly forced to retreat.

The invading army was suffering terrible losses inflicted by the guerrillas, hunger, desertions, and disease; its situation becoming more and more untenable. Sooner or later, the Franco-Spanish army would have to retreat in a very shattered condition: Then Lippe, seeing that the enemy's situation was desperate, completed it with an audacious move,Count of Lippe in his own words: \\"The Count Marshal, in order to embarrass the enemy... and to force its retreat back into Spain, risked ordering Townshend... to join the troops commanded by Lord Lenox... and after the junction‚Ä¶to take Penamacor in order to cut off the communication of the enemy army with...

There were additional losses during the retreat and third invasion. Dumouriez, who traveled into Portugal and Spain, collecting testimonies from participants in the invasion of 1762, reported to Madrid and Paris, in 1766, that the Spaniards had lost 15,000 men during the second invasion of Portugal (province of Beira),\\"‚Ä¶ Spain ordered 40,000 men to march into Portugal (page 247) ‚Ä¶ The Spanish forces, when they arrived at the frontier, were reduced to 25,000 men, (...).

This chronicler makes no estimate of the Spanish casualties in the third invasion of Portugal (province of Alentejo). The Franco-Spanish disaster was summarily captured in these much quoted contemporary words: Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia, a painting by Adolph Northen. The Russians in 1812, similarly to the Anglo-Portuguese in 1762, did not need to win one single battle to defeat the invading army -Indeed, they lost all the battles and all the main cities of the Russian empire (including Moscow).Yet, and again like the Anglo-Portuguese in 1762 and 1810,\\"The Russian strategy 'was learned from British military leader Wellington, who, in alliance with Portuguese guerrilla forces' had resisted French invasion in the Peninsular War in a similar manner two years earlier.\\" In Hough, Peter ‚Äì Environmental Security, Routledge, New York, 2014, p. 58.\\"... his 'Grand Army' of French and allied troops was annihilated by the terrible winter, disease (typhus), and the stamina of the Russian guerrillas, using 'tactics similar' to those of Spain and Portugal.\\" In Greer, Thomas; Lewis, Gavin ‚Äì A Brief History of the Western World, 9th edition,Thomson wadsworth, 2004, p. 470. the Russians, using a scorched-earth policy and the guerrillas to disrupt the enemy's supply lines, compelled Napoleon to retreat with an even greater proportional loss than that experienced by Aranda in Portugal in 1762. Comparatively, during the Napoleonic campaign to conquer Portugal a few years later, in 1810‚Äì1811, the French army of Massena lost 25,000 men (of whom 15,000 dead from starvation and disease plus 8,000 deserters or prisoners) to the Anglo-Portuguese of Wellington and guerrillas.\\"For the next four months, the [French] army of Portugal maintained its vigil at a cost of more than twenty five thousand men. Of these, only two thousand were killed in action, and nearly eight thousand were captured or deserted, while the rest fell to disease and starvation.\\" In Moon, Joshua ‚Äì Wellington‚Äôs Two- Front War: The Peninsular Campaigns, at Home and Abroad, 1808‚Äì1814, University of Oklahoma Press, USA, 2012, p. 73. The similarities between the two invasions of Portugal (respectively in 1762 and 1810‚Äì11) go far beyond the coincidence of the number of casualties suffered by the invaders in both situations.\\"... Wellington did not attempt to hold the Portuguese border. Instead, he ordered the entire countryside between the border and Lisbon to be laid waste and the inhabitants to take refuge in the mountains... Meanwhile, he had completed the construction of two formidable lines of fortification, the Lines of Torres Vedras, across the neck of the Lisbon peninsula‚Ä¶Mass√©na advanced deep into Portugal. At Bussaco he came upon the retreating Anglo-Portuguese army, attacked it, and was repulsed with heavy losses. Nevertheless, Wellington continued to retreat‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶slipped through the Lines of Torres Vedras, accompanied by most of the population of the Portuguese Province of Northern Estremadura‚Ä¶Mass√©na reached the Lines... For four months... the two armies remained in that position, facing each other without fighting. Yet whereas Lisbon was well supplied, the French were starving. Their marauding columns either found no food or were ambushed... Mass√©na ordered a retreat; one month later, his army reached its starting point, ciudad Rodrigo, reduced by one-third of its strength. Hunger, disease, and the guerrillas had taken at least twenty thousand French lives. As for the victors, their army had suffered no losses, but their victory had been won at the price of whole provinces destroyed and thousands of civilians starved, tortured, killed, or destitute. No phase of the Peninsular War was waged with more ferocity, and yet not a single major battle was fought.\\" In Herold, J. Christopher ‚Äì The Age of Napoleon, Mariner books, 2002, p. 226. Historian Esdaile wrote that Wellington's \\"...plan [of 1810‚Äì11] was one of the most perfect schemes of defence that have ever been devised... It exploited both the Portuguese capital‚Äôs geographical situation and the poverty of the Portuguese countryside to the full, whilst at the same time bringing into play traditional responses to invasion in the Form of the ordinances and the devastation of the countryside in a scorched- Earth policy (a similar tactic had actually been Employed against the Spaniards as recently as 1762).\\"Esdaile, Charles ‚Äì The Peninsular War: a New History, Penguin Books, London, 2003, chapter 12. Only in the first days of July 1762, the total number of Spanish deserters who had entered the Portuguese army allowed creating 2 new full regiments, besides the many who boarded British and Dutch ships. This suggests a brutal defection rate, since the bulk of defections would only occur from mid-October onwards, during the retreat of the invaders, and most of the deserters who survived the Peasants were not incorporated into the Portuguese army, merely being used as informants or scouts. The Bourbon losses were simply devastating.Historian Lawrence H. Gipson uses the expression \\"the disintegration of the Spanish army\\" (see The British Empire before the American Revolution: the great war for the Empire: the culmination, 1760‚Äì1763, Knopf, 1954, p. 260); while Portuguese historian Fernando Dores Costa wrote about the Spanish army‚Äôs \\"spectrum of decomposition\\" (see Nova Hist√≥ria Militar de Portugal, vol. II, C√≠rculo de Leitores, Coordinator: Ant√≥nio Hespanha, 2004, p. 358, footnote 280.). Also Portuguese historian Nuno Monteiro wrote that \\"... although there have been no battles in this strange war, severe losses occurred [on the Spanish side]\\" (see D. Jos√©: na sombra de Pombal, Temas e Debates, 2008, p. 198). Comparatively, the British losses were vastly inferior: fourteen soldiers were killed in combat and 804 men died from other causes, especially disease. The tactic of destroying the opponent without fighting and attacking only when he withdraws was the key to victory. Fall of Spanish headquarters Portrait of Count of Aranda, by Francisco Jover y Casanova. A brilliant Spanish statesman, whose experience as ambassador in Lisbon and writings about the inevitability of invading Portugal would grant him the command of that disastrous invasion: \\"The autumnal rains now setting in, D'Aranda found himself harassed on all sides by the peasantry, his provisions exhausted;‚Ä¶he dismantled the few fortresses that he had taken, and made a hasty retreat into Spain. This campaign was humiliating enough...\\"Cassel, John; Smith, John and Howitt, William ‚Äì John Cassel‚Äôs Illustrated History of England, vol. 5, London, 1861, chapter I (Reign of George III), p. 20. Nothing better symbolizes the Anglo-Portuguese victory than the final conquest of the Spanish headquarters in Castelo Branco itself.See The Annual Register, Burke, Edmund, London, 1784 (General Index): \\"Castel Branco, defeat of the Spaniards in the Territory of,\\" When the allied army began a second encirclement movement to cut off the Spanish forces inside and around Castelo Branco, they fled to Spain, abandoning to their fate all their countless wounded and sick, accompanied by a letter addressed to Townshend, commander of the Portuguese force, in which the Count of Aranda demanded human treatment for their captured men (2 November 1762). The number of Spaniards taken can be deduced from a letter sent by the Secretary of the Portuguese army to the Portuguese prime minister (six days before the fall of Castelo Branco, 27 October), stating that according to Spanish deserters, the total number of sick men laying in Spanish hospitals was 12,000. By the ends of October, the invading army was concentrated almost entirely in the region around Castelo Branco (out of it, there were only little garrisons in the cities of Almeida and Chaves). This number was exceptionally high, since besides the wounded, there were also many sick: the Spanish army, concentrated around Castelo Branco, was suffering a terrible epidemic. This epidemic was transmitted to the Portuguese population itself, when it returned to the city, shortly after the flight of the Spaniards. Thus, the joy of victory was overshadowed by the grief and mourning of many residents.\\"With the joy of victory, the fugitives [inhabitants] scattered over the fields were able to return home, and, after the withdrawal of the foreign army, the village of Castelo-Branco was hit by plague, and a lot of people died.

Gipson (winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History): The defeat of Spain in Portugal was accompanied and aggravated by setbacks in her empire and in the sea: \\"In one short year the unfortunate Spaniards saw their armies beaten in Portugal, Cuba and Manila torn from their grasp, their commerce destroyed, and their fleets annihilated\\".Prowse, D. W. ‚Äì A History of Newfoundland: from the English, Colonial and Foreign Records, Heritage Books Inc., 2007, p. 311. Meanwhile, admirers of Aranda anticipated his victory -taken for granted-, such as the humanist and reformer Stanislaw Konarski, who, writing from distant Poland, and ignoring the Franco-Spanish disaster, composed an ode in Latin in his honor, praising the generosity and humanism of the winner of Portugal towards the inhabitants of Lisbon surrendered to his feet.√örda√±ez, Jos√© Luis G√≥mez ‚Äì V√≠ctimas Ilustradas del Despotismo.

The city of Castelo Branco, used by the Bourbons as Headquarters and Hospital site. Fleeing before an inferior enemy, and leaving behind all their many wounded and sick in the hands of the Anglo-Portuguese, represented a severe blow in Spain's prestige, as well as the end of the second invasion of Portugal. The remnants of the invading armies were expelled and chased to the border, and even within Spain itself, as would happen in Codicera, where several Spanish soldiers were imprisoned: \\"Portugal had not accepted the invitation to join France and Spain in this alliance and the latter powers... invaded Portugal. England sent a fleet promptly to Lisbon with 8,000 soldiers who helped drive the invaders back and followed them into Spain herself...The blows she had received were staggering...\\"Hart, Francis Russel ‚Äì The Siege of Havana: 1762, Houghton Mifflin, 1931, p. 52. At the end of the war, La Lippe was invited by the Portuguese prime minister Pombal to stay in Portugal, in order to reorganize and modernize the Portuguese army (which he accepted).\\"Lippe deserves far more than the eight miniature gold cannon mounted on silver carriages [or six, according to other sources], 80,000 gold moidares, and numerous diamonds given to him by the Portuguese King upon his departure. So impressed was Oeiras that he retained Lippe‚Äôs services so he could reform the Portuguese army and modernize the kingdom‚Äôs defenses.\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 457. When Lippe eventually returned to his own country ‚Äì praised by Voltaire in his famous Encyclopedia, and covered with prestige in Britain, and all Europe ‚Äì the King of Portugal offered him six cannons of gold (each weighing 32 pounds), a star studded with diamonds, among other gifts, as a sign of gratitude for the man who had saved his throne. The King determined that, even absent of Portugal, La Lippe retained nominal command of the Portuguese army, with the rank of Marshal General. And he was also given the title of \\"Serene Highness\\" (25 January 1763). On the other hand, British government rewarded him with the title of \\"honorary Field Marshal\\". =Third invasion of Portugal (Alentejo)= The third invasion of Portuguese territory was stimulated by the peace negotiations between France and Great Britain and rumours of a general peace (the preliminary Treaty of Fontainebleau was signed on 3 November, one day after the fall of the Spanish Headquarters in Portugal). Indeed, after her defeat in the last invasion, Spain felt compelled to reorganize her troops in order to conquer a portion of Portuguese territory that could be changed by her huge colonial losses at the hands of the British.\\"The Spaniards proved far worse prepared than they had assured the French and lost Havana and Manila [13 August and 6 October, respectively] to British amphibious expedtions in 1762. Charles III hoped that gains in Portugal would compensate him for losses elsewhere, regaining colonial losses in Portugal, but his army was not in a position to repeat Frederick II's successes in Silesia\\". In Black, Jeremy ‚Äì America or Europe? British Foreign Policy, 1739‚Äì63, University of Exeter, UCL Press, 2002, pp. 26‚Äì27. This would reinforce her position and bargaining power during the peace talks, which would culminate in the Treaty of Paris, on 13 February 1763. Surprise Factor High Alentejo, where the third failed Bourbon invasion occurred. Since the remnants of the Bourbon troops were settled into winter quarters inside Spain (after crossing the river Tagus at Alc√°ntara), the allied army did the same in Portugal. By then, the French army was practically out of action because in addition to the many dead, deserters and prisoners, there were 3,000 French lying in the hospital of Salamanca.\\"In September [this number increasing during the Bourbon retreat, in October], 3,000 French soldiers lay sick at Salamanca. (...)\\", in Danley Mark and Patrick Speelman ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, Brill, 2012, p. 452. Yet Aranda correctly assumed that if he attacked first (before next year's spring, when the new campaign was supposed to start), Portuguese garrisons would be completely taken by surprise. This time, the flatness of the terrain in the province of Alentejo, would give full advantage to the Spanish cavalry, instead of what happened in the two previous invasions. He knew that the Portuguese fortresses were only manned by second line troops (militia), and recent experience proved that siege operations were their Achilles' heel. Besides, the poor state of the Portuguese fortresses in the Alentejo was almost an invitation for invasion: during an inspection to the strongholds of Alentejo, British Brigadier-General Charles Rainsford recommended to remove some of their larger guns to prevent their capture.See Journal of the Society for Army Historical research, vol. 59, London, 1981, p.40. However, Lippe had taken preventive measures by strengthening the garrisons of the Alentejo's fortresses near the border (Elvas, Marv√£o, Ouguela, Arronches, Alegrete and Campo Maior), while transferring some regiments from North to South of the riverTagus, in Alentejo, where they continued in winter quarters (but closer to the gravity center of the next campaign). He also created a reserve force consisting in all the British regiments and some Portuguese troops, near Sardoal. At last, some British officers were sent to command Portuguese garrisons in key strongholds: Field Marshal Clark into Elvas, Colonel Wrey into Alegrete, Colonel Vaughan into Arronches, Captain Brown into Marv√£o, keeping the Portuguese commanders of Ouguela (Captain Br√°s de Carvalho) and Campo Maior (Governor Marquis do Prado). This set of measures would prove decisive. Offensive For this campaign, the Spaniards assembled three big divisions around Valencia de Alc√°ntara. This time, unlike the two previous invasions, the Spaniards split their army in several corps, with each one attacking one target. A Spanish force of 4,000 or 5,000 attempted to take Marv√£o with a frontal attack. The terrorized population pressed for surrender, but the firmness of Captain Brown prevailed and he opened fire against the attackers. The Spaniards were defeated with many losses and fled. Another Spanish force of four squadrons attacked Ouguela (12 November 1762), whose walls were ruined. Its tiny garrison, formed by some armed irregulars and fifty riflemen, routed the enemy, who fled leaving many dead behind. The King of Portugal promoted Captain Br√°s de Carvalho and the other Ouguela's officers to a higher rank. The assault on Campo Maior also failed because the Spanish unit from Badajoz was not supported by the Spanish unit of Albuquerque. The latter fled to Spain when part of the Portuguese garrison of Campo Maior tried to intercept it. Third retreat, second chase 16th Light Dragoon (British). The British decisively stiffened the resistance of the Portuguese army: \\"The Count of Lippe, assisted by the energy of the Portuguese Minister, quickly formed the Portuguese troops into a disciplined army\\".Stephens, Henry ‚Äì The History of Portugal, G. P. Putnam's sons, 1891, p. 363. Eventually Lippe mobilized the entire allied army ‚Äì finishing its winter quarters (12 November 1762) ‚Äì and moving all units into south of the river Tagus (near Portalegre), as soon as news of the enemy's offensive became known. The Spaniards were demoralized by these failures: during the two previous invasions not even one stronghold had resisted (a success rate of one hundred percent); while this time not even one fortress had been taken,\\"In November the enemy attacked two small places, Marv√£o and Ouguela, but the long record of shameful capitulations at last ended. Ouguela was successfully held by a Portuguese commander, and Marv√£o... was defended by captain Brown of Armstrong‚Äôs with a British detachment and some Portuguese. He replied to the summons with a reminder of the recent fall of Havana and dispersed the assailants with a burst of shellfire.\\" In Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, vol. 59, London, 1981, p. 40. giving the Portuguese time to assemble troops. The Portuguese army was now disciplined and well commanded. This renewed army ‚Äì which initial unpopularity led some men to mutilate themselves to avoid conscription ‚Äì saw their prestige and numbers skyrocket with volunteers.\\"A new wind swept the military [Portuguese] forces... Volunteers showed up to fight under his [Lippe‚Äôs] command, and the Portuguese forces increased both quantitatively and qualitatively (page 129) ... In November... the [Franco-Spanish] allies had lost most of their infantry men and artillery, [while] Portuguese forces continued to grow up (page 131)\\". In Daehnhardt, Rainer- Segredos da Hist√≥ria Luso-Alem√£, Publica√ß√µes Quipu, Lisboa, 1998, . On the Contrary, the Franco-Spanish army was greatly diminished after the losses suffered during three failed invasions. Once again ‚Äì for the third time ‚Äì the Spanish army was compelled to retreat (15 November 1762) and for the second time, it was chased by Anglo-Portuguese detachments, which took many prisoners.\\"Our detachments pursued their rear-guard and took several prisoners. (...)\\", the allied commander Count of Lippe in M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762. 1770, page 65. A few more prisoners were even taken inside Spain, when the Portuguese garrison of Alegrete, led by colonel Wrey, made a successful raid on La Codosera (19 November).\\"‚Ä¶ Colonel Wrey, who commanded Alegrette, made a raid at Codiceira in Spain; he took away some people [prisoners], (‚Ä¶)\\" In Lippe, M√©moire de la Campagne de Portugal de 1762, 1770, pp. 65‚Äì66. Spain seeks a truce On 22 November 1762, seven days after the beginning of the definitive Spanish retreat from Portugal, and three days after the Portuguese incursion in Spain (Codicera), the commander-in- chief of the Franco-Spanish army (Count of Aranda) sent Major-General Bucarelli to the Anglo-Portuguese Headquarters at Monforte, with a Peace proposal: the suspension of hostilities. It was accepted and signed 9 days later, on 1 December 1762.\\"This German officer [La Lippe], who had learned the war in the school of Frederick the Great of Prussia, repelled the invasion and forced the [Bourbon] allies to sign an armistice on the 1st December 1762. (...) \\", in Legrand, Th√©odoric ‚Äì Histoire du Portugal (in French), Payot, 1928, p. 82. However, the Bourbon commander would try one last move to save his face: on the very same day Aranda sent a proposal to the Portuguese for the suspension of hostilities (22 November), he also sent a force of 4,000 men to seize the Portuguese town of Oliven√ßa. But the Spaniards withdrew as soon as they discovered that the garrison had just been reinforced shortly before. Lippe informed Aranda that such behaviour was odd for someone well-intentioned and eager for peace. (The Spanish commander answered that there had been an error of communication with the leader of that expedition). A preliminary peace treaty had been signed at Fontainebleau, but the definitive treaty was only signed on 10 February 1763 in Paris, with the presence of the Portuguese representative, Martinho de Melo e Castro, among all the other. By this treaty, Spain was obliged to return to Portugal the small cities of Almeida and Chaves (in the Hispano-Portuguese frontier), and Colonia del Sacramento in South America (which had been taken to the Portuguese together with part of the Rio Grande do Sul in 1763), besides large concessions to the British: \\"The Spaniards, having failed the campaign of Portugal, had to return Colonia del Sacramento, renounce claims on their fishing rights in Newfoundland, recognize the legality of the British settlements on the coast of Honduras, cede Florida to England, and confirm all the privileges that British commerce held before the war started.\\"Tandeter, Enrique (coordinator): Germ√°n Carrera Damas- Historia General de Am√©rica Latina: processos americanos hacia la redefinici√≥n colonial (in Spanish), vol. 4, UNESCO, 2000, p. 22. Meanwhile, Portugal also captured Spanish territories in South America (1763). The Portuguese won most of the valley of the Rio Negro, in the Amazon Basin, after dislodging the Spaniards from S.

Gabriel (1763),\\"During its progression [through the Rio Negro valley, the Spanish] advancement was beyond San Carlos, since the Spaniards had managed to occupy the posts of Marabitanas and San Gabriel, from which they were dislodged by the Portuguese, who fortified them, under the German captain Felipe [Phillip Sturm].

The Portuguese then withdrew from the left shore.\\" In Southern, Robert ‚Äì History of Brazil, part third, London, 1819, p. 584. The besieging Spanish army, reduced to less than half by disease, starvation and desertions, had to retreat, leaving the Portuguese in possession of the disputed territory and all its artillery (both the outcome and strategy resembling the misfortunes of the Spanish army in Portugal).\\"... disease [caused by tropical conditions and the use of biological warfare by the Portuguese, according to the Spanish commander] and desertion had trimmed Verdugo [the Spanish Governor of Santa Cruz de la Sierra]‚Äôs levies from 610 to 303 by the time they reached San Pedro [head of the missions in Moxos, Bolivia, to where the Spanish remnants retreated].

He had advanced to the Guapor√© [and beyond it, occupying Spanish territory in the left bank of this river until the end of the war: the territory of the Missions of S. Miguel and S.

This way, the confrontation between Portugal and Spain in South America, during the Seven Years' War, ended in a tactical stalemate.

Aftermath =Reasons for Spanish failure= The Spanish Prime-Minister Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace (1767‚Äì1851), credited the Franco-Spanish defeat of 1762 mainly to the peasant uprising, caused by the excesses of the invaders: \\"The war of 62 alternated between defeats and disgraces; forty thousand Spanish soldiers and twelve thousands French only managed to take Almeida and penetrate some leagues inland, and then were defeated in the mountains with very little honour to the Spanish and French arms... the country was trampled, the people subjected to violence and repression. And the peasantry rebelled.\\"Godoy, Manuel ‚Äì Memorias, Emilio La Parra L√≥pez, Elisabel Larriba (editors), Publicaciones Universidad de Alicante, 2008, pp. 781‚Äì782. It was a war without formal battles, of marches and counter-marches, and that is why it is called the Fantastic War in Portuguese historiography. It represented a victory of strategy over numbers, since the Bourbon armies failed to reach all their stated goals and had to retreat ‚Äì with huge casualties ‚Äì before an advancing and inferior enemy, who chased them out of Portugal. The mountainous nature of the terrain and the collapse of logistic lines, respectively, well used and caused by the allies, were determinant. Eventually, the genius of Count Lippe,\\"... What lessons can be drawn from the campaign? The effectiveness of the Portuguese forces was in large part due to Lippe‚Äôs basic plan bolstered by the nascent hatred and ineptitude of the Spanish invader. By remaining on the strategic defensive and occupying the important towns and passes that guarded the advance on Lisbon, the Allies were able to frustrate and upset Spanish advances time and again. It was his appreciation of the little war that mattered, not the war of big battalions. That he accomplished his task with such a rag task force is a testament to his capabilities as commander-in-chief. He understood how to use the scant Portuguese resources to their fullest. 'I think it very necessary frequently to engage the Portuguese', he wrote Lord Townshend, 'with the enemy by small detachments in order to use them to serious duty'. Thereby, he turned a liability into an asset\\" In Speelman, Patrick and Danley, Mark ‚Äì The Seven Year‚Äôs War: Global Views, 2012, p. 457. and the discipline of British troops, whose officers managed to reorganize the whole Portuguese army in record time while taking advantage of its bravery,\\"... the Portuguese were also quite good soldiers.

Moderate in their physical requirements [For example, during the Allied Peninsular campaign of 1813, which culminated with the expulsion of the Napoleon‚Äôs army from Spain, the average daily ration of a Portuguese soldier was ‚Äìliterally‚Äì half of the British soldier.

The Spaniards also made several errors, such as changing plans three times (the main objective being successively Oporto, Lisbon, and Alentejo, during the three invasions) and replacing the army's commander at a critical moment. Their relationship with the French was poor: Aranda even wrote to the Spanish court, complaining of the atrocities committed by French troops against the Portuguese villages. In addition, the large Spanish fleet sent to America not only diverted resources and logistics from the army aimed to conquer Portugal, but also prevented Spain from attacking Portugal by sea. Besides, the Bourbon numerical superiority was mainly apparent as they had to split their forces in order to sustain the conquered strongholds, look for food, chase the guerrillas, escort supply convoys from Spain, and build roads.Spanish Chief minister Ricardo Wall in a letter to Tanucci, 12 October 1762: \\"the circumstance of having to make war on a sterile country, and where each civilian is an enemy, makes it necessary to bring the supplies from Castile [Spain]... employing many troops to keep the conquered and to protect the [food] convoys...thus, the army possibly will not reach Lisbon before the Winter... contrary to what was planned [this prediction would prove prophetic since three days later the Franco-Spanish army initiated its disastrous retreat]\\".

The Count of Aranda was the President of this council. The punishments were generally very severe, and Aranda was particularly active asking inclusively the death sentence for the former Viceroy of Peru, Count of Superunda‚Äì whose only crime had been to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (he was returning to Spain after serving the Crown in Peru for 16 years, when he was caught in the Havana's siege).

Adam Smith, in its turn, considered the invasion a biased economical tactic, since it was based on the premise that England would not survive without the gold of Portugal. The devastating defeat caused great commotion in the Spanish public opinion,Abbot B√©liardi, the agent of Choiseul at Madrid, writing on 18 October 1762: \\"(...) news of the taking of Havana has gravely upset the Spanish nation... there is no consolation for the irreparable loss of one third of Spain‚Äôs naval forces, surrendered without a cannon shot.\\" In Stein, Stanley and Stein, Barbara ‚Äì Apogee of Empire: Spain and New Spain in the Age of Charles III, 1759‚Äì1789, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004, chapter \\"Imperiled Colonies and Spain‚Äôs Response\\". who demanded scapegoats.

Spanish historian Jos√© de Urda√±ez pointed out that: =Stalemate in South America= The Spanish invasion of Portugal in Europe (main theater of the war, which absorbed the lion's share of the Spanish war effort) was followed by a Spanish invasion of Portuguese territories in South America (a secondary theater of the war).

This huge territory would be completely retaken by the Portuguese during the so-called \\"deaf war\\" (1763‚Äì1777). * Rio Negro (Amazonia, North Brazil): Portugal conquered the valley of the Rio Negro (1763), in the Amazon Basin, after dislodging the Spaniards from Marabitanas and San Gabriel (1763). There they raised two fortresses, using Spanish cannons. * Mato Grosso (western Brazil): the Portuguese, commanded by Rolim Moura, also successfully resisted a Spanish army sent from Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bol√≠via) to dislodge them from the right bank of the Guapor√© River (Fortress of S. Rosa or Concei√ß√£o), the gate for the gold-rich Province of Mato Grosso (1763), which the Spanish crown intended to recover. The Portuguese not only used biological warfare (according to the Spanish commander, the Governor of Santa Cruz de la Sierra) but also captured and occupied ‚Äì until the end of the war ‚Äì the reductions of S. Miguel and S. Martin, which were main sources of Spanish supply and were located on the Spanish side of the river Guapor√© (left bank). Thus the besieging Spanish army, reduced to less than half by disease, starvation and desertions, had to retreat, leaving the Portuguese in possession of the disputed territory and all its artillery. Rolim de Moura would be rewarded for his victory with the Viceroyalty of Brazil. A second Spanish attack 3 years after the end of the seven years' war, failed again (1766). This way, if the confrontation between Portugal and Spain in South America, during the Seven Years' War, ended in a tactical stalemate, it represented also a Portuguese strategic victory in the short run: the Spaniards would lose to the Portuguese nearly all the territory they had conquered during the conflict (Colonia do Sacramento was given back by the treaty of Paris, which ended the war, and Rio Grande do Sul would be retaken from the Spanish army during the undeclared war of 1763‚Äì1777), while Portugal retained all its conquests in the Rio Negro Valley (S. Jos√© de Marabitanas and S. Gabriel) and the Guapore‚Äôs right bank/Mato Grosso.The only lands that Portugal conquered and returned to Spain were the territories of San Martin and San Miguel missions (whose Spanish property had always been recognized by the Portuguese). =Invasion in literature= Curiously, the Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal is almost a forgotten episode in Portuguese History text books. And for Portuguese literature, it is like a blind spot (with a few exceptions: H√©lia Correia's \\"Lillias Fraser\\" and M√°rio de Carvalho's \\"A paix√£o do conde de Fr√≥is\\"). However, in English literature, there is at least a book on the subject: Absolute honour, whose hero is an Englishman (Jack Absolute) that lives adventures during the Bourbon invasion of Portugal in 1762. Naturally, and for understandable reasons, this campaign is also almost absent from Spanish literature. There is, nevertheless, a high qualified exception -the great Novelist and Dramaturge Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, who wrote a tale about the battle of Bail√©n, where a personage, D. Santiago Fern√°ndez, describes sarcastically his participation in the campaign of 1762, fiercely defending his master, the marquis of Sarria: \\"... There was no other Sarria born after Alexander the Macedonian (...). That was a great campaign, yes sir; we entered Portugal, and although we had to withdraw shortly after, because the English appeared before us (...). The Marquis of Sarria was a supporter of the Prussian tactic, which is to be quiet and wait for the enemy to advance wildly, thus rapidly being tired and defeated. In the first battle fought with the Portuguese villagers, everyone began to run when they saw us, and the general ordered the cavalry to take possession of a herd of sheep, which was achieved without bloodshed.\\"Gald√≥s, Benito ‚Äì Guerra de la Independencia, vol I, Algaba Ediciones, Madrid, 2008, pp. 427‚Äì428.

M. smithii has a coccobacillus shape. It plays an important role in the efficient digestion of polysaccharides (complex sugars) by consuming the end products of bacterial fermentation. Methanobrevibacter smithii is a single-celled microorganism from the Archaea domain. M. smithii is a methanogen, and a hydrogenotroph that recycles the hydrogen by combining it with carbon dioxide to methane. The removal of hydrogen by M. smithii is thought to allow an increase in the extraction of energy from nutrients by shifting bacterial fermentation to more oxidized end products. Importance in the human gut The human gut microbiota consists of three main groups of hydrogen-consuming microorganisms or hydrogenotrophs: methanogens including M. smithii; various acetogenic bacteria; and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The different roles of these microorganisms are helpful in understanding how hydrogen metabolism affects the efficiency of dietary fermentation. Accumulation of hydrogen in the gut reduces the efficiency of microbial fermentation as well as the yield of energy. Methanogenic archaea are therefore particularly significant for the human gut, because they are pivotal in the removal of excess hydrogen. M. smithii is the most common methanogenic archaeon in the human gut microbiota. M. smithii is paramount in digestive processes, and has a high prevalence in human feces.Bedis, D., Mireille, H. (2009). \\"High Prevalence of Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae Detected in the Human Gut Using an Improved DNA Detection Protocol.\\" PLOS One 4(9) e7063. The gut microbiota is dominated by gram- negative Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes (mostly gram-positive). Archaea are most prominently represented by the methanogenic M. smithii. M. smithii is believed to be a therapeutic target for manipulation and an adaptation to the gut ecosystem.Buck, S., Hansen, E., (2007). \\"Genomic and metabolic adaptations of Methanobrevibacter smithii to the human gut.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104, 10643-10648. M. smithii has significant enrichment of genes involved in the utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen gas (H2), and formate for methanogenesis. It also has an intact pathway to allow for CO2 utilization gene cluster for the methanogenic consumption of B. thetaiotaomicron-produced metabolite. M. smithii supports methanogenic and nonmethanogenic removal of diverse bacterial end products of fermentation. The dominant archaeon in the human gut ecosystem affects the specificity and efficiency of bacterial digestion of dietary polysaccharides. This influences the person‚Äôs calorie harvest and body fat. Researchers have sequenced M. smithii genome, indicating that M. smithii may be a therapeutic target for reducing energy harvest in obese humans. Cell wall and cell membrane compared to bacteria The cell wall and cell membrane of Methanobrevibacter smithii determine susceptibility to antibiotics and statins. The cell wall is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan (and not peptidoglycan as in bacteria) which makes archaea resistant to lysozyme and many antibiotics that interfere with cell wall synthesis. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer or monolayer, the backbone of which is composed of isoprene units that are linked to glycerol by ether bonds. In contrast, the lipid bilayer of bacteria consists of a fatty acid backbone that is linked to glycerol by an ester bond. The presence of statin-sensitive isoprene units in the cell membrane of archaea allows statins to selectively interfere with the growth of archaea while leaving the cell membrane of bacteria unaffected. While bacteria do not use isoprene units in their cell membrane they are still required elsewhere. These bacterial isoprene units are, however, synthesized by the mevalonate pathway (MEP) that is not inhibited by statins. Gottlieb, K., Wacher, V., Sliman, J., & Pimentel, M. (2015). Review article: inhibition of methanogenic archaea by statins as a targeted management strategy for constipation and related disorders. Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics. In anorexic patients In 2009, the largest human study concerning obesity and gut microbiota to date was conducted. Obesity disorders are the result of an imbalance and have serious consequences such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer. The gut microbiota and environment contributes to the energy imbalance because of its involvement in energy intake, conversion and storage. Culture-independent methods have shown that high proportions of methanogens can comprise up to 10% of all anaerobes in the colons of healthy adults. The quantification average of M. smithii for the anorexic group was much greater than the lean and obese group. Thus, higher amounts of M. smithii were found in anorexic patients than lean patients. The development of Methanobrevibacter in anorexia patients may be associated with an adaptive attempt towards optimal exploitation of the low caloric diet of anorexic patients. Hence, an increase in M. smithii leads to the optimization of food transformation in low caloric diets. M. smithii could also be related to constipation, a common condition for anorexic patients. M. smithii and constipation Observational studies show a strong association between delayed intestinal transit and the production of methane. Experimental data suggest a direct inhibitory activity of methane on the colonic and ileal smooth muscle and a possible role for methane as a gasotransmitter. Statins can inhibit archaeal cell membrane biosynthesis apparently without affecting bacterial numbers as demonstrated in livestock and humans. This opens the possibility of a therapeutic intervention that targets a specific etiological factor of constipation while protecting the intestinal microbiome. While it is generally believed that statins inhibit methane production via their effect on cell membrane biosynthesis, mediated by inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase, there is accumulating evidence for an alternative or additional mechanism of action where statins inhibit methanogenesis directly. It appears that this other mechanism may predominate when the lactone form of statins, particularly lovastatin, is administered.  References  Further reading External links * Paul B. Eckburg, Paul W.

The 393rd Bomb Squadron, sometimes written as 393d Bomb Squadron, is part of the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. It operates Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit nuclear-capable strategic bomber aircraft. Constituted in 1944 as the 393rd Bombardment Squadron, the unit was the only United States Army Air Forces squadron trained for nuclear warfare during World War II. It is the only unit to have used nuclear weapons in combat, when its aircraft dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and Nagasaki, Japan on 9 August 1945. After the end of WWII, the squadron was involved in the U.S. military atomic bomb testing on Bikini Atoll, and has continued to operate nuclear-capable aircraft since then. History Activated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress squadron in early 1944; trained under Second Air Force. Due to a shortage of B-29s, the squadron was initially equipped with former II Bomber Command Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses previously used for training heavy bomber replacement personnel as engineering flaws were being worked out of the B-29. The squadron was then reassigned for advanced training and received B-29s at Fairmont Army Air Field, Nebraska during the late spring and summer of 1944. =509th Composite Group= In December 1944 reassigned as the only operational B-29 squadron to 509th Composite Group at Wendover Field, Utah in December. Aircraft were refitted to Silverplate configuration becoming atomic bomb capable under a highly classified program. Deployed to North Field (Tinian) in late May 1945, flying non-combat missions practicing atomic bomb delivery techniques. The squadron was the only unit in the world to ever carry out and deliver nuclear weapons in combat, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on 6 August 1945, and the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, on 9 August 1945. Reassigned to the United States in November 1945, it became part of Continental Air Forces (later Strategic Air Command). The unit was deployed to Kwajalein Atoll in 1946 to carry out Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests on Bikini Atoll in July. =Strategic Air Command= Began upgrading to the new Boeing B-50 Superfortress, an advanced version of the B-29 in 1949. The B-50 gave the unit the capability to carry heavy loads of conventional weapons faster and farther as well as being designed for atomic bomb missions if necessary. Squadron deployed to SAC airfields in England, and also to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam on long-term deployments in the 1950s. By 1951, the emergence of the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 interceptor in the skies of North Korea signaled the end of the propeller-driven B-50 as a first-line strategic bomber. Received new, swept wing Boeing B-47 Stratojets in 1955 which were designed to carry nuclear weapons and to penetrate Soviet air defenses with its high operational ceiling and near supersonic speed. The squadron flew the B-47 for about a decade when by the mid-1960s it had become obsolescent and vulnerable to new Soviet air defenses. The squadron began to send its stratojets to AMARC at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona for retirement in 1965. Was scheduled for inactivation however instead received Boeing B-52D Stratofortresses in 1965. It rotated aircraft and crews to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam in support of Southeast Asia Operation Arc Light operations between 1966 and 1969. Not operational, Nov 1969‚ÄìJun 1971. Re- equipped with General Dynamics FB-111 nuclear capable medium bomber in 1970; operated until retirement in 1990.

History Around 2005 the district had a $3 million surplus. It had plans to increase enrollment by allowing out of district students to attend the district schools, so it would get increased state funding due to higher enrollment. In a two-year period ending in 2009, the district lost over 250 students and therefore about $3 million in state funding. Because of the decreased revenues, the district planned to close two schools. In a school funding system enacted in 1994, Michigan school funding entirely originates from the state, so despite the fact that Bloomfield Hills has a property rich tax base, the decrease in enrollment forced the district into an operating loss.Linebaugh, Kate. \\"Detroit's Pain Begins to Spread Into Wealthy Suburbs and Schools.\\" The Wall Street Journal.

It is an unbound resonance and nominally an isotope of beryllium. It decays into two alpha particles with a half-life on the order of 10‚àí16 seconds; this has important ramifications in stellar nucleosynthesis as it creates a bottleneck in the creation of heavier chemical elements. The properties of 8Be have also led to speculation on the fine tuning of the Universe, and theoretical investigations on cosmological evolution had 8Be been stable.  Discovery  The discovery of beryllium-8 occurred shortly after the construction of the first particle accelerator in 1932. British physicists John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Walton performed their first experiment with their accelerator at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, in which they irradiated lithium-7 with protons. They reported that this populated a nucleus with A = 8 that near- instantaneously decays into two alpha particles. This activity was observed again several months later, and was inferred to originate from 8Be.  Properties  Triple-alpha process Beryllium-8 is unbound with respect to alpha emission by 92 keV; it is a resonance having a width of 6 eV. The nucleus of helium-4 is particularly stable, having a doubly magic configuration and larger binding energy per nucleon than 8Be. As the total energy of 8Be is greater than that of two alpha particles, the decay into two alpha particles is energetically favorable, and the synthesis of 8Be from two 4He nuclei is endothermic. The decay of 8Be is facilitated by the structure of the 8Be nucleus; it is highly deformed, and is believed to be a molecule-like cluster of two alpha particles that are very easily separated. Furthermore, while other alpha nuclides have similar short-lived resonances, 8Be is exceptionally already in the ground state. The unbound system of two Œ±-particles has a low energy of the Coulomb barrier, which enables its existence for any significant length of time. Namely, 8Be decays with a half- life of 8.19 seconds. 8Be also has several excited states. These are also short-lived resonances, having widths up to several MeV and varying isospins, that quickly decay to the ground state or into two alpha particles. = Decay anomaly and possible fifth force = A 2015 experiment by Attila Krasznahorkay et al. at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences's Institute for Nuclear Research found anomalous decays in the 17.64 and 18.15 MeV excited states of 8Be, populated by proton irradiation of 7Li. An excess of decays creating electron- positron pairs at a 140¬∞ angle with a combined energy of 17 MeV was observed. Jonathan Feng et al. attribute this 6.8-œÉ anomaly to a 17 MeV protophobic X-boson dubbed the X17 particle. This boson would mediate a fifth fundamental force acting over a short range (12 fm) and perhaps explain the decay of these 8Be excited states. A 2018 rerun of this experiment found the same anomalous particle scattering, and set a narrower mass range of the proposed fifth boson, MeV/c2. While further experiments are needed to corroborate these observations, the influence of a fifth boson has been proposed as \\"the most straightforward possibility\\".  Role in stellar nucleosynthesis  In stellar nucleosynthesis, two helium-4 nuclei may collide and fuse into a single beryllium-8 nucleus. Beryllium-8 has an extremely short half-life (8.19 seconds), and decays back into two helium-4 nuclei. This, along with the unbound nature of 5He and 5Li, creates a bottleneck in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and stellar nucleosynthesis, for it necessitates a very fast reaction rate. This impedes formation of heavier elements in the former, and limits the yield in the latter process. If the beryllium-8 collides with a helium-4 nucleus before decaying, they can fuse into a carbon-12 nucleus. This reaction was first theorized independently by √ñpik and Salpeter in the early 1950s. Owing to the instability of 8Be, the triple-alpha process is the only reaction in which 12C and heavier elements may be produced in observed quantities. The triple-alpha process, despite being a three-body reaction, is facilitated when 8Be production increases such that its concentration is approximately 10‚àí8 relative to 4He; this occurs when 8Be is produced faster than it decays. However, this alone is insufficient, as the collision between 8Be and 4He is more likely to break apart the system rather than enable fusion; the reaction rate would still not be fast enough to explain the observed abundance of 12C. In 1954, Fred Hoyle thus postulated the existence of a resonance in carbon-12 within the stellar energy region of the triple- alpha process, enhancing the creation of carbon-12 despite the extremely short half-life of beryllium-8.Hoyle, F. (1954). \\"On Nuclear Reactions Occurring in Very Hot STARS. I. the Synthesis of Elements from Carbon to Nickel\\". Astrophysical Journal Supplement. 1: 121‚Äì146, The existence of this resonance (the Hoyle state) was confirmed experimentally shortly thereafter; its discovery has been cited in formulations of the anthropic principle and the fine-tuned Universe hypothesis.  Hypothetical universes with stable 8Be  As beryllium-8 is unbound by only 92 keV, it is theorized that very small changes in nuclear potential and the fine tuning of certain constants (such as Œ±, the fine structure constant), could sufficiently increase the binding energy of 8Be to prevent its alpha decay, thus making it stable. This has led to investigations of hypothetical scenarios in which 8Be is stable and speculation about other universes with different fundamental constants. These studies suggest that the disappearance of the bottleneck created by 8Be would result in a very different reaction mechanism in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the triple-alpha process, as well as alter the abundances of heavier chemical elements. As Big Bang nucleosynthesis only occurred within a short period having the necessary conditions, it is thought that there would be no significant difference in carbon production even if 8Be were stable. However, stable 8Be would enable alternative reaction pathways in helium burning (such as 8Be + 4He and 8Be + 8Be; constituting a \\"beryllium burning\\" phase) and possibly affect the abundance of the resultant 12C, 16O, and heavier nuclei, though 1H and 4He would remain the most abundant nuclides. This would also affect stellar evolution through an earlier onset and faster rate of helium burning (and beryllium burning), and result in a different main sequence than our Universe.

It is a docufiction, his first ethnofiction, a genre he is considered to have created. Historical background The subject of the film was the Hauka movement. The Hauka movement consisted of mimicry and dancing to become possessed by British Colonial administrators. The participants performed the same elaborate military ceremonies of their colonial occupiers, but in more of a trance than true recreation. The Hauka movement, according to some anthropologists was a form of resistance that began in Niger, but spread to other parts of Africa. According to some anthropologists, this pageant, though historic, was largely done to mock their authority by stealing their powers. Hauka members were not trying to emulate Europeans, but were trying to extract their life force ‚Äì something \\"entirely African\\". This stance has been heavily criticized by anthropologist James G. Ferguson who finds this imitation not about importing colonialism into indigenous culture, but more a way to gain rights and status in the colonial society. The adoption of European customs was not so much a form of resistance, but to be \\"respected by the Europeans.\\"Ferguson Les ma√Ætres fous offended both colonial authorities and African students alike. Indeed, the film was so controversial that it was banned first in Niger, and then in British territories including Ghana. The film was considered offensive to colonial authorities because of the Africans' blatant attempts to mimic and mock the \\"white oppressors\\". On the other hand, African students, teachers, and directors found the film to perpetrate an \\"exotic racism\\" of the African people.

Her whereabouts has been unknown since then. Petros and Aster had four children. Early life Petros Solomon, her husband Aster Yohannes was doing her Electrical Engineering in Addis Ababa University. During her second year of graduation, she joined the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) in 1979. She underwent training for six months and was deputed in combatant. During 1982, she married Petros Solomon, a lead member of the front. The pair had four children Simon, the twins Zerai and Hanna, and Meaza. The pair fought the independence struggle with Ethiopia, which the nation obtained on 1993. During 1995, she was working with the ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources. She enrolled in Phoenix University during January 2000 to complete her graduation. Back home, in an initiative named G-15, Solomon along with 15 other ministers were arrested by the ruling front and detained in unknown location ever since. The ministers were criticizing the border war of the then president, Isaia and signed an open letter. He was fired along with other opposing members and was detained on 18 September 2001. He was considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. On account of the political situation in Eritrea, she obtained visa for her children from the US and sought the Eritrean government to grant them exit to the US. The government denied her pleas. Arrest She was detained by security personnel at Asmara International Airport in the capital Asmara on 11 December 2003, when she returned after a three-year period study at the University of Phoenix in Arizona, USA. She had returned to Eritrea with a newly issued Eritrean passport, to be with her four children aged between 6 and 13 at the time of her arrest. During her absence her children had been cared for by her mother. She has been in prison held in an undisclosed place by the Eritrean government since December 2003. Prior to her departure to Eritrea from the US, she was reportedly given assurances of safety by the then Eritrean Ambassador to the United States Girma Asmerom The Eritrean authorities have given no reason for her arrest or said where she is held. She was not permitted to meet her family. Amnesty International feared that she could be subject to torture or ill-treatment.

She is the first woman Chief Electoral Commissioner in the country's history. She was also a Deputy Minister of Education in the 1990s. In March 2016, she was appointed a Deputy Minister of Education, Science and Technology, though one source states that Parliamentary approval was still pending. Early life Thorpe grew up in one of Freetown's poorest communities. In 1952, she and a younger sister went to live with their grandmother Christiana (for whom she was named) in the poor neighbourhood of Kroo Bay because their parents were overburdened with a large family (eventually eight children). The elder Christiana was a washerwoman and herbalist who was to have a great influence on her. She and her sister were the only girls in the neighbourhood who went to school. She used to teach what she had learned to other girls, discovering that she loved teaching. After she completed secondary school, she left for Ireland, where she studied in a convent and became a nun. She attended University College Dublin and obtained a degree, followed by a master's and a Ph.D. in the British West Indies. Career in education and government She returned to Sierra Leone and became the principal of St. Joseph's Secondary School for girls in Makeni, a village north of the capital city of Freetown. After 20 years as a nun, she found that following convent rules and regulations conflicted with her teaching, and she made the painful decision to leave the convent. When Captain Valentine Strasser seized power in 1992, Dr. Thorpe was the only woman in his cabinet of 19 ministers, serving as Deputy Minister of Education. In 1995, she formed and chaired the Sierra Leone branch of the Forum for African Women Educationalists. In 2005, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of Sierra Leone, asked her to head the National Electoral Commission. She served as Chief Electoral Commissioner for two consecutive five-year terms, although when then-President Ernest Bai Koroma nominated her for her second term, the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party raised concerns about the neutrality of the commission and walked out of Parliament in protest. She introduce the Biometric Voter Registration system, which combats voter registration fraud. After the end of her second term, in 2016, she was appointed one of two Deputy Ministers of Education, Science and Technology in a cabinet reshuffle, though one source states that Parliamentary approval was still pending as of April. Honours Thorpe has received one of the 2006 Voices of Courage Awards from the Women‚Äôs Commission for Refugee Women and Children. On November 3, 2014, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems presented to her the Joe C. Baxter Award.

This character initially had his own book, then was with the Sentinels of Justice. Character Biography Charlie Starrett was a ranch hand back in the 19th century who was secretly the heroic masked gunslinger known as the Latigo Kid. In the early 20th century, a secret organization called the Paragon Foundation enhanced Starrett's latent psionic abilities and transformed him into the super-powered, blue and red-costumed Captain Paragon. He fought the forces of evil until the Fifties when he was apparently killed by his archenemy the Black Shroud. His body, however, was stolen by the evil Proxima and her alien warrior women and taken to the planet Rur where he was revived even more powerful than he was before so he could be used as weapon against their enemies the Krotons. Escaping with the aid of the stellar-powered scientist Stardust, he returned to Earth only to find that thirty years had passed and that, stricken with amnesia, he no longer had any memory of who he was behind his mask.The Bill Black/Captain Paragon Interview, Back Issue #94 (2017), TwoMorrows Publishing Hiring a private detective to dig into his past, he turned his attentions to the more important matters at hand and helped found the Sentinels of Justice with Stardust, Nightveil, Commando D and the Scarlet Scorpion in Captain Paragon and Sentinels of Justice #1 to battle super- villains and alien invasions. Later, the Sentinels were disbanded by the military and were replaced with other heroes which did not sit well with the original members. With Jennifer Burke chosen to lead the New Sentinels of Justice under the name of Paragon, the original Paragon objected. This led the original Sentinels members to be named advisers to the new team. Captain Paragon is married to Femforce leader Miss Victory. He is a frequent ally of the team. Inspiration Bill Black first attempted to revive the original Captain Marvel written and drawn in a more realistic Marvel Comics style in his 1969 fanzine Paragon Golden Age Greats, Vol. 1, #2.

Democratic-NPL nomination Former state senator Joe Satrom defeated North Dakota House of Representatives minority leader Merle Boucher for the Democratic-NPL nomination. Satrom began campaigning for the nomination almost a year before the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Convention would choose the parties candidate for Governor. Boucher announced his candidacy in December 2003 but struggled to make up ground against Satrom. The two candidates debated at the University of North Dakota, just before the convention, with education and the future of the state's youth the main topics. The Democratic-NPL Convention voted by 632 to 341 to endorse Satrom as their candidate for Governor. Campaign The two candidates met in three debates during the campaign, during the final debate on 9 October 2004 they clashed over a smoking ban, outmigration and a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Satrom called for North Dakota to introduce a one thousand dollar donation limit, for individuals and political action committees, to avoid any perception of conflict of interest. Hoeven named education, growth and jobs as his priorities but faced anger from some hunting groups over changes to hunt seasons. Opinion polls gave Hoeven a strong lead over Satrom with one in October 2004 showing Hoeven on 70% as against 22% for Satrom.

Design and development The Fiat CR.30 was a new design by Celestino Rosatelli for a single-seat fighter. Four prototypes were built with the first flight occurring in March 1932. The CR.30 was a biplane with W-form interplane struts and a fixed tailwheel landing gear. The aircraft was powered by a 447 kW (600 hp) Fiat A.30 R.A. V-12 piston engine. Two prototypes were entered into an international meeting in Zurich in July 1932 and won the speed circuit contest at average speeds of 340 km/h (211 mph) and 330 km/h (205 mph). The impressive performance led to orders from the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) for 121 aircraft. Two of the prototypes were converted into two-seaters designated CR.30B for use as refresher trainers and liaison aircraft. A large number of single-seaters were converted into two-seaters as they were replaced with more modern equipment. The air force later ordered an additional 20 new-build CR.30Bs. Two aircraft were converted to seaplanes with the designation CR.30 Idro. The aircraft was also operated by other European air forces with the Hungarian Air Force being the largest foreign operator, using two CR.30s from 1936 and one single-seater and ten CR.30bs from 1938.

Founded in 1997 by Beaumont. FREELANG is free but is under copyright of the authors, and it is collaborative.  History  FREELANG Dictionary has it roots in the Dutch Dictionary Project, started in 1996 by Frits van Zanten and his friend Tom van der Meijden. The project initially consisted of electronic wordlists from Dutch to other languages, but with a team of volunteers around the world, they started to build web sites to distribute the program and some word lists based on their language expertise. In August 1997, the French version was hosted under the name of FREELANG, headed by the French Dutch Dictionary Project lead, Beaumont. From 1998 to 2000, Frits and Tom progressively stepped out of the project. By the summer of 1998, the Dutch Dictionary Project team consisted of six members‚ÄîDario (Italy), Peter (Sweden), Vladimir (Russia), Tom (Norway), Gustaf (Denmark) and Beaumont (France)‚Äîwho decided to continue with the venture. Vladimir, the Russian Dutch Dictionary Project lead, wrote new scripts to simplify the creation of new dictionaries. The Translation Help Service was created, offering free translations courtesy of a growing team of volunteer translators. In October 2001, both the English and Dutch versions of the Dutch Dictionary Project were brought under FREELANG. The current FREELANG site is managed by Beaumont, based in Bangkok, Thailand since October 2002. In April 2003, the Spanish version was brought under FREELANG.

Life and career  Jean-Blaise Martin began singing publicly as a child, before his voice broke. He made his professional operatic debut in 1789, at the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, in Paris, in a parody called Le Marquis de Tulipano. He then studied with Madame Dugazon, and made his debut at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1794, and sang there until 1823. He became a member of the administrative comity of this theatre in 1801. He also taught at the \\"Conservatoire de Musique\\" of Paris, from 1825 to 1837. He composed one op√©ra comique, Les oiseaux de mer, produced at the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau in 1796. During his career, he created some 15 roles in operas by Nicolas Dalayrac, Fran√ßois Devienne, Andr√© Gr√©try, √âtienne M√©hul, Nicolas Isouard, Ferdinando Paer, etc. Martin's voice was described as a \\"t√©nor grave et sombre\\", meaning a deep-voiced dark tenor, or as a \\"baryton aigu et clair\\", meaning a clear-voiced high baritone; the compass was E flat to a, with a falsetto extension to a'. His vocal type became known as \\"baryton-martin\\", most often found in French operetta. Modern example of this voice type were French baritone Michel Dens, or closer to us Bernard Sinclair, who can be heard in a few operetta recordings such as La fille de Madame Angot, Les cloches de Corneville, and Valses de Vienne. In the operatic repertoire, the most famous role for baryton-martin is Pell√©as in Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Camille Maurane and Jacques Jansen are widely recognized as having been the best exponents of the role.

Prophet was one of Jamaica‚Äôs most popular roots reggae singers and had several prominent hits during his 40-year career. Biography Michael George Haynes was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 3 March 1957, the only child of Caroline Smith, a housewife, and Lloyd Haynes, a painter and decorator who worked for the beverage company Desnoes & Geddes (Lloyd fathered 13 other children). Educated at Greenwich Farm High School, Kingston, he lived nearby with his paternal grandmother Gladys, a market trader. The impoverished Greenwich Farm district had long been a hotbed of musical activity, and during the late 1970s Michael Haynes began singing on local sound systems. In 1978 he recorded his first singles, The Woman I Love, Super Star and True Born African, but they made little impact. Haynes then formed a vocal trio with friends from the neighbourhood, but when they auditioned for the visionary producer Vivian ‚ÄúYabby You‚Äù Jackson, Jackson convinced him to ditch the other vocalists, renamed him Michael Prophet and shifted the focus of his lyrics to Rastafari philosophy and the harshness of ghetto life. Prophet‚Äôs first release with Jackson, a remake of The Heptones Fight It To The Top, was a strong seller, as were the originals Praise You Jah Jah and Love and Unity. Their popularity led to an acclaimed debut album, Serious Reasoning, released beyond Jamaica by Island Records in 1979. In 1980 Prophet joined forces with the rising ghetto producer Henry ‚ÄúJunjo‚Äù Lawes and released the autobiographical Gunman, about an armed robbery that took place at the singer‚Äôs home. A reggae adaptation of Here Comes the Bride was also a big hit. The widespread popularity of this material, and the Lawes-produced albums Righteous are the Conqueror and Michael Prophet, led to Prophet travelling frequently to London during the mid-1980s. He then brought out the self-produced albums Love is an Earthly Thing and Blood Stain which were recorded in Jamaica and released in Britain on independent labels. By the time his rendition of Nancy Wilson‚Äôs How Glad I Am (issued as Loving You) became an underground dance hall hit, Prophet had moved to London, though material for Jamaican producers such as Winston Riley, Niney the Observer, King Tubby and King Jammy continued to surface. In 1990, as dance hall morphed into the more up-tempo ‚Äúbashment‚Äù style, based on stripped-down electronic rhythms, Prophet scored significant hits recorded in London in combination with the ragga rapper Daddy Freddy on a re-cut of Michael Scotland‚Äôs Hypocrites, and then with Ricky Tuffy on Your Love and Get Ready. Though his output subsequently slowed, Prophet continued to release noteworthy material, including Lead Us O Jah in 2006, while a collaboration with the Brixton-based Soothsayers band yielded the moving single Love Fire in 2008; other fine work was subsequently cut for Joe Ariwa, Vibronics, Reggae Roast, Tuff Scout, and Sip-A-Cup. In the live arena, Haynes performed at Rototom Sunsplash, Europe‚Äôs largest reggae festival, in 2011 and headlined the Lambeth Country Show in both 2014 and 2017. Prophet's first recordings were for producer Yabby You in 1977, debuting with the single \\"Praise You Jah Jah\\", which had actually been written five years earlier. He cites Bob Andy as his main influence as a singer. He had his first Jamaican hit with a version of The Heptones' \\"Fight It To The Top\\". His 1980 album Serious Reasoning was released by Island Records in the United Kingdom, establishing his reputation internationally. After working with Yabby You, he also recorded for Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes, adapting to the prevailing dancehall sound and having his biggest hit with \\"Gunman\\". During the first half of the 1980s he recorded for producers such as Don Mais, Al Campbell, Sugar Minott, Winston \\"Niney\\" Holness, and Winston Riley, cementing his status as one of Jamaica's most popular singers. After living in Miami for a time, he moved to England, where he recorded \\"Your Love\\" which reached number one in the UK reggae chart in 1990. It was followed in 1991 by the album Get Ready, which also sold well. Prophet‚Äôs distinctive voice‚Äîhe had a wide vocal range with an unusual \\"crying\\" tenor style‚Äîand the success of songs such as Gunman (1981) meant that his energetic live performances were in high demand on the international festival circuit. He was still performing live even in the last months of his life; his final shows came in September and October of 2017, at the Mekudeshet Fesitval, Jerusalem (14 September), Dub Club @Echoplex, LA (4 October), and at the Music Box, San Diego (6th October).

Christ says farewell to his mother Mary, often blessing her, before leaving for his final journey to Jerusalem, which he knows will lead to his Passion and death; indeed this scene marks the beginning of his Passion.John Oliver Hand, Catherine A. Metzger, Ron Spronk: Prayers and Portraits: Unfolding the Netherlandish Diptych, p.66, 2006, Yale University Press, In early versions just these two figures are usually shown, at half-length or less. After D√ºrer the subject usually has a landscape setting and includes attendants (usually the Three Marys) to Mary, who often swoons with distress and is held by them. Saints Peter, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalen and other apostles may be shown. It is probably more common in prints than paintings.Langmuir, Erica, The National Gallery companion guide,pp. 102-3. 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, Subject matter Christ taking Leave of his Mother, by Albrecht Altdorfer c. 1520, one of the treatments with a landscape background. The subject does not illustrate any Biblical passage, but derives from one of the Pseudo-Bonaventura's \\"Meditations on the life of Christ\\" (1308), and the \\"Marienleben\\" (; about 1300) of , also known as Bruder Philipp, der Kart√§user ().The National Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue, National Gallery Publications, p.2, 1995, The scene became used in Passion plays and other religious dramas.Langmuir, pp. 102-3. It may be depicted in Christ Blessing with the Virgin in Prayer, a work by Robert Campin of the early 15th century (Philadelphia),Philadelphia Campin image This derives from Byzantine images, according to Hand, Metzer & Spronk op & page cit. and is painted several times by Gerard David at the end of the century (Dublin, Basel, Munich, Metropolitan New York);In a type used for the Munich, Basel and New York examples, a diptych has a half-length Madonna and Child on the left wing, and a Christ taking leave of his Mother on the right wing. MMA, New York - the other wing of this is in England. See Hand, Metzer & Spronk op & page cit., an exhibition catalogue entry for the Basel work. many lesser artists were painting the subject by then, especially in Germany. Awareness of the subject was further spread by prints, by Albrecht D√ºrer in his very popular woodcut series the on the Life of the Virgin (ca. 1505),Image and again in his woodcut Passion series (1509), and also by Lucas van Leyden. As was by then often the case, many provincial painters used the compositions of the prints directly as a basis for their paintings, for example a version from his eponymous altarpiece by the Nuremberg painter known as the \\"Master of the Schwabach Altarpiece\\"(1506, Compton Verney House), who uses his fellow-townsman D√ºrer. The first third of the 16th century was the period of peak popularity for the subject;Most of the works mentioned here date very close to 1520. to the Danube School in particular the opportunities for expressiveness and a landscape background made the subject attractive. Versions include very intense ones by Albrecht Altdorfer, and Wolf Huber (both about 1520 and in the National Gallery, London). The Huber is a cut-down fragment with just the group around the Virgin, and Christ's arm coming in from the right. Both of these works have a lush forest background, a swooning Virgin, and show the female figures in largely contemporary dress.Langmuir, Erica, The National Gallery companion guide, pp. 102-3 and 334-6, 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, One of the earliest of the few Italian depictions, an early Correggio of about 1514 (National Gallery, London) clearly (under x-rays) used D√ºrer's composition as a starting point, before changing it around.Gould, Cecil, The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, National Gallery Catalogues, London 1975, Lorenzo Lotto (1521, Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin) also painted the subject, and there is a Lucas Cranach the Elder (ca 1520) in Vienna. After 1550 the subject is seen less often, though the Pitti Palace has a work that is at least from the school of Paolo Veronese.

To supplement the outreach and pipeline efforts by UCLA and the other California medical schools to train more Hispanic and English/Spanish bilingual physicians, the UCLA Department of Family Medicine (DFM) developed the IMG program to address the state's changing demographics and impending physician shortage. The program seeks to provide bilingual English/Spanish IMGs, who are committed to the care of underserved populations, with a comprehensive program to pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Examinations (USMLE) and compete for Family Medicine Residency program positions in California. The paramount objective of the UCLA IMG Program is to place well-trained family physicians in rural and urban underserved communities.American Medical Association news article  Participants  Today the program has participants from Argentina, Belize, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Spain, Mexico and Peru.  Directors  The program was implemented in 2006 by Patrick Dowling MD, MPH, Chair of the Department of Family Medicine and by Michelle Bholat MD, MPH, Vice Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.UCLA IMG Program Non Profit Organization  Components  * Program A - USMLE Step 1 Preparation - Pasadena, CA Entails a time commitment of at least 50 hours per week.

She was sunk in a collision with HMS Mermaid on 20 September 1976 whilst en route to Hamburg for an official visit. Twelve naval service personnel (eleven from the Royal Naval Reserve along with one from the Royal Navy) lost their lives, making this the worst peacetime accident involving the Royal Naval Reserve. History The ship ran aground at the entrance to Shoreham harbour, West Sussex on 25 May 1954, but she was refloated the next day. Curzon was part of the Reserve Fleet based at Hythe from 1955 until 1959. In March 1959 she had her Mirrlees engines replaced with Napier Deltic engines at Portsmouth, prior to being commissioned into the Royal Naval Reserve as HMS Curzon on 16 November 1960. She replaced HMS Bickington and docked at Maxwell's Wharf, Shoreham, home of Sussex Division RNR. She was refitted in January‚ÄìMay 1965 and again in January‚ÄìMay 1967, both at Chatham Dockyard. She was renamed HMS Fittleton on 1 January 1976 and reassigned to the Channel Group of the Royal Naval Reserve. Sinking Regularly manned by a combination of Sussex and London Division RNR personnel (from HMS President), she sailed from Shoreham on 11 September 1976 with a crew largely drawn from London Division RNR to take part in Operation Teamwork, a NATO exercise in the North Sea. Following the exercise, on 20 September the ship proceeded in company with six other British minesweepers towards Hamburg for a three-day official visit to the port, after which she was to return to Shoreham. She was detailed to carry out a mail transfer with HMS Mermaid, a considerably larger ship at five times the displacement, north of the island of Texel. This required HMS Fittleton to steam close behind and to the side of Mermaid at about 3:30pm to pick up a line. Fittleton was caught in a low pressure area that exists near to the hull of a ship under way and was drawn close to the frigate HMS Mermaid by hydrodynamic forces. A minor collision ensued and the Fittleton moved forward to try and exit the situation but instead was hit amidships by the bow of the much larger Mermaid and turned over within a minute. Thirty-two survivors were picked from the sea and the upturned hull by the accompanying ships, and German and Dutch vessels joined Royal Navy ships in searching for survivors, with divers entering the floating upturned hull. Attempts to keep Fittleton afloat by passing minesweeping cables underneath her propellor shafts failed when the lines parted. The ship sank several hours later, between 9 and 10 pm, in of water. Aftermath The following day, 21 September 1976, a marine crane, Magnus lifted the wreck of the Fittleton from the seabed and the ship was taken to Den Helder in the Netherlands where she was made watertight. She was then towed back to Chatham Dockyard. Five bodies were found on the ship but seven were missing, presumed drowned. Naval police were called in when the ship arrived at Chatham on 11 October to investigate the theft of cash following the salvage of the vessel. Fittleton's crew had been paid just an hour before the sinking, with seamen receiving ¬£50 or ¬£87 depending upon rank, and large amounts of sodden money were scattered around the wreck when it was raised. However, when the ship reached Chatham only ¬£174 could be found, and six of the ten wallets also recovered were found to be empty. Fittleton was sold to Liguria Maritime Ltd for scrapping and scrapped the following year. HMS Mermaid was later sold to the Malaysian Navy. An enquiry into the disaster took place between 24 September 1976 and 13 October 1976, and the full report was made public in 2005 under the Thirty-year rule. A memorial window was commissioned for the church at Fittleton in Wiltshire.

In Southern Nigeria, the activities of pimps or madams, underage prostitution and the operation or ownership of brothels are penalized under sections 223, 224, and 225 of the Nigerian Criminal Code. Even though Nigerian law does not legalize commercial sex work, it is vague if such work is performed by an independent individual who operates on his or her own accord without the use of pimps or a brothel. The Nigeria criminal system prohibits national and trans-national trafficking of women for commercial sex or forced labour. Nigeria is a signatory to the 2000 United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. History =Pre-Independence: Lagos= Starting in the early 1900s, the rising economic importance of Lagos as a seaport and capital city changed the political and economic landscape of the city and contributed to the arrival of Nigerians from the hinterland. The demographic and commercial changes also expanded to commoditization of sex and by 1910, commercial sex services had become prevalent in Lagos. In 1916, the colonial government enacted a law prohibiting solicitation by women but the law did not define prostitution. The law was implemented discretionarily by the government and commercial sex work was tolerated as long it did not lead to public nuisance. In a country steeped with a religious and traditional moralist sentiments, sex work was not tolerated by some women in the community. In 1923, the Lagos Women League, an elite women organization wrote a petition to the police chief seeking the cancellation of restrictions placed on the recruitment of women as police officers. The petition was written partly to curb a rise in prostitution and also the patronage of prostitutes by male officers. Public opinion was also critical of the sex trade linking it with juvenile delinquency. In 1932, Tijani Omoyele, a musician released an album, Asewo/ Omo j aguda (prostitutes are thieves or criminals). By the 1930s, prostitutes were linked with notorious delinquents‚Äô groups like the Jagudas and Boma boys in Lagos and they were beginning to be called Ashewo or people who change money into lower denominations. During the pre-World War II period commercial sex workers solicited clients in brothels, cinemas and hotels bars in the Lagos Island districts of Broad St, Breadfruit, Labinjo, Martins, Porto Novo Market- and Taiwo In Lagos, commercial sex work was majorly practiced by non-Lagos natives and were called names like Ashewo (Yoruba word), Karuwaci (Hausa), Akwunakwuna (Igbo word) and Asape. Many of the workers sometimes returned to their native land with enough money to earn the wrath of men who were not used to women being wealthier than them. After the onset of World War II, British officials became apprehensive about any link between high venereal disease rates in West African Frontier Force soldiers and promiscuous sexual affairs with prostitutes. During this period, forced prostitution of teenagers was becoming common. In 1943 Abidjan, a Nigerian born child prostitute, Mary Eforghere was killed by her older handler or madam for refusing to have sex with a European.Aderinto, S. (2015). Journey to work: Transnational prostitution in colonial British West Africa. Journal of the History of Sexuality, 24(1), 99‚Äì124 The combination of the fear of venereal diseases, child prostitution and controlling juvenile delinquency created a new impetus to prohibit prostitution. In 1941, an anti-vice squad was formed to prosecute offenders based on two newly created laws, the Unlicensed Guide (Prohibition) Ordinance and the Venereal Disease Ordinance. The former was also known informally as the loitering law which was designed to limit the link between foreign sex tourists and prostitutes. The law required tour guards to obtain license guards in order to perform their work. The law targeted both young delinquents who were considered the pimps and the prostitutes. In addition, prostitutes who loiter on the street and make advances towards tourists were arrested by the anti-vice squad. In 1942, a hostel was built to rehabilitate child prostitutes in Lagos and a year later, the Children and Young Persons Ordinance was passed prohibiting child prostitution. The colonial government also established a welfare and social services department to manage the hostel and rehabilitation of child prostitutes. By 1946, a set of law was enacted that clearly defined prostitution and its prohibition. =20th century: Tolerance and rise in sex trafficking= After independence in 1960, brothels and prostitution that had been prohibited in the middle 1940s began to spring up again. The welfare and social services department created to rehabilitate child prostitutes started scaling down on its investigations of child prostitutes. By the early 1980s, street prostitution became a common sight on Allen Avenue, Ikeja and in some areas of Oshodi and later Kuramo Beach. In 1987, the Women's Center in Nigeria wrote a press release about the harassment, assault and rape of prostitute by law enforcement members.Nigeria: Prostitutes' problems. (1987, Nov 30). Off our Backs, 17, 10. Retrieved from Proquest Trans-national commercial sex work which started during British colonial West Africa began to grow into a transcontinental business in the 1980s. Starting in the mid-1980s, the trafficking of Women to European countries such as Italy began to gain traction. In many of the cases, there were examples of coercion. Coercion happened in situations whereby the women or adolescents to be trafficked were asked to swear an oath that was administered by an African religion or juju priest. Some personal items such as bodily fluids were taken by the priests for keeping or used to administer the oath and seal the agreement. When the women reach the country of destination they are immediately indebted to the trafficker for transport and lodging fees and will have to pay off the debt before they are freed, if ever. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Nigeria as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country. Some scholars have stated that prostitution in Nigeria increased as a result of the adverse economic effect of the drop in oil price in the early 1980s followed by the implementation of structural adjustment programs in the middle 1980s. In the 1980s, brothels began to spring up in the cities and prostitutes who move into the city were charged daily rent for accommodation. The 1980s also contributed to the beginning of call-ups or part-time prostitution by young graduates and students. In Lagos during the early 1980s, politicians accommodated in housing estates such as 1004 requested the services of young students as call girls and spent lavishly on these students with trips abroad. In Benin City, the red-light district is around Ugbague Street. This started to be an area of prostitution in the 1940s when young Esan women came to the area. The women are known locally as asewo. =21st century= Commercial sex work and human trafficking continues to thrive in Nigeria. Based on the estimates of the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, about 8,000 ‚Äì 10,000 women of Nigerian descent practiced prostitution in Italy between 2000‚Äì2009. Cross-border commercial work also resorted to re-instating child trafficking for sex. A Nigerian envoy in C√¥te d'Ivoire noted the frequency of adolescent girls among Nigerian commercial workers in Abidjan. Within Nigeria, the most common form of sex work is found within brothels or residences of sex workers. A steady rise in young students and unemployed graduates who use sex to earn income and acting as part-time prostitutes or call girls or sometimes called Aristo girls are changing the strategies used by sex workers. These young graduates and students use the services of pimps and call-ups as a modus of operation, while some frequent bars and restaurants. In some cases, porters or hotel staff acts as pimps and links between upper class Nigerians and the call girls. The aristo girls mostly serve upper class citizens and foreigners are better paid than the sex workers in brothels. Almost two thirds of brothel and street sex workers are traders, bar girls, hair dressers or have a second type of job. Brothels are in virtually every major city in Nigeria and offer the cheapest form of service. The brothels are located in highly populated districts and slums within the city. In 2003, the Trafficking in Person Prohibition Act was passed into law and an agency, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficked Persons was formed to handle human trafficking in the country. Corporate prostitution A different form of prostitution known as corporate prostitution, a relatively new phenomenon and mostly limited to financial institutions began to gain notability in the 2000s. In 2004, a bankers‚Äô union threatened to go on strike due to allegations that some female staffers sleep with men for accounts. Though most financial institutions do not force women to engage in sexual activities in order to meet financial targets it is implied that many banks are not against such actions. In 2010, hearings were held on the floor of the House of Representative about the Bill for an Act to Prohibit Corporate Prostitution and Exploitation of Women and for Other Matters Connected Therewith. Statistics on commercial sex workers In a survey of commercial sex workers, almost two thirds or about 63% mentioned that they started commercial sex work before the age of 19. A majority of them (63%) work from brothels. Due to the negative public perception of commercial sex work, 88% of workers operate in cities far from their childhood home. A majority came from households within the low income bracket. The sex workers are trained by an older professional or pimp prior to commencement on the job. Training lessons concern how to deal with a difficult man, STD's and self-defence. A large number of sex workers had limited information about STD's and a majority mentioned that they did not utilize a clinic for treatment. UNAIDS estimate there to be 103,506 prostitutes in the country.

Built in 1767‚Äì1771, it has served a variety of civic institutional functions, including notably as a prisoner of war facility operated by British forces during the American Revolutionary War. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. It is now a museum operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Description The Old Exchange is located on the east side of Charleston's historic downtown area, at the northeast corner of East Bay and Broad Streets. It is a two-story masonry building, capped by a hipped roof with cupola and set on a high brick basement. The main facade faces west, and has a projecting three-bay gabled section at its center with entrances recessed in three round-arch openings on the first floor, and sash windows set in bays articulated by Ionic pilasters on the second. The flanking walls each have a Palladian window set on a brick base with balustrade. and History The Exchange was built from 1767‚Äì1771 by South Carolina's provincial government, and was used during the 18th century for a variety of civic functions, including as a custom house, public market, public meeting place, and jail. During the American Revolution, confiscated tea was stored here in 1774, and it is where South Carolina's revolutionary leadership councils were held. After the British captured the city in 1780, it was used as a barracks, and its basement was used as a military prison. In 2012, a study was completed of the building's use as a British prison during the Revolutionary War. Soon after taking control of Charleston in 1780, the British started housing prisoners in the Exchange, but not exclusively in the \\"dungeon\\". The investigation was able to document at least 120 prisoners held in the Exchange, but there were many more whose identities could not be discovered. The facility was not exclusively used for Colonial prisoners, and at least some British soldiers were held there too. The building housed the South Carolina convention to ratify the United States Constitution in 1788, and was the site of many of the events in George Washington's week-long stay in Charleston. He was greeted by a crowd on the balcony. The building continued as an Exchange until the 19th century, when it also became a post office. During the 19th century, the postmaster defended the Exchange's shipment of abolitionist pamphlets from angry Charlestonian rioters. In the American Civil War, the building remained a Confederate post office, but was hit by several shells during the war, and thus abandoned. In 1913, the building was granted to the Daughters of the American Revolution, who have preserved it ever since. In World War I, the building served as the army headquarters of General Leonard Wood and the United States Lighthouse Service‚Äîthe latter having been in the building since the late 1800s. In World War II, the building not only served as a USO facility and canteen for troops, but served as the Coastal Picket Station for the Sixth Naval District of the United States Coast Guard. In 1965, the Half-Moon Battery, a 1698 fortification, was discovered underneath the building. The Customs House, seen here in 2013, stands at the foot of Broad Street in Charleston, South Carolina. The building's first cupola was damaged by a hurricane in the early 1800s. The second deteriorated before the great earthquake of 1886, and the third was not placed until 1981 when the building opened as a museum. The building is owned by the South Carolina Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, who operate guided costumed tours that include all three floors of the building. The Provost Dungeon once had animatronic figures that tell stories of pirates and colonial days, but these animatronics have been supplanted by personal dungeon tours by docents.

The sections of polypeptide that occur between two of them form a loop through which a third disulfide bond passes, forming a rotaxane substructure. The cystine knot motif stabilizes protein structure and is conserved in proteins across various species. There are three types of cystine knot, which differ in the topology of the disulfide bonds: * The Growth Factor Cystine Knot (GFCK) * Inhibitor Cystine Knot (ICK) common in spider and snail toxins * Cyclic Cystine Knot, or cyclotide The growth factor cystine knot (GFCK) was first observed in the structure of Nerve Growth Factor, solved by X-ray crystallography and published in 1991 by Tom Blundell in Nature.; The GFCK comprises four superfamilies. These include nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, platelet-derived growth factor, and glycoprotein hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin. These are structurally related due to the presence of the cystine knot motif but differ in sequence. All GFCK structures that have been determined are dimeric, but their dimerization modes in different classes are different. * The vascular endothelial growth factor subfamily, categorized as part of the platelet-derived growth factor superfamily, includes proteins that are angiogenic factors. The presence of the cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif was discovered when cyclotides were isolated from various plant families. The CCK motif has a cyclic backbone, triple stranded beta sheet, and cystine knot conformation. There are currently novel proteins being added to the cystine knot motif family, which are called the C-terminal cystine knot (CTCK) proteins. They share approximately 90 amino acid residues in their cysteine-rich C terminal regions. Inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) is a structural motif with a triple stranded antiparallel beta sheet linked by three disulfide bonds, forming a knotted core. ICK motif can be found under the category of phylum, such as animals and plants. It is usually found in many venom peptides, which is in the venoms of snails, spiders, and scorpions. Peptide K-PVIIA that contains an ICK can undergo a successful enzymatic backbone cyclization. The disulfide connectivity and the common sequence pattern of ICK motif provide the stability of the peptides that supports cyclization.  Drug Implications for Cystine Knot Motif  The stability and structure of the cytosine knot motif implicates possible applications in drug design. The hydrogen bonding interactions between the disulfide bonds of the motif and beta-sheet structures gives rise to highly efficient structure stabilization. In addition, the size of the motif is approximately 30 amino acid residues.Kolmar, Harald. ‚ÄúBiological Diversity and Therapeutic Potential of Natural and Engineered Cystine Knot Miniproteins.‚Äù Current Opinion in Pharmacology, vol. 9, no. 5, 2009, pp. 608‚Äì614., doi:10.1016/j.coph.2009.05.004. These two characteristics make it an attractive biomolecule to be used for drug delivery as it exhibits thermal stability, chemical stability, and proteolytic resistance. The biological activities of these molecules are partially due to Its unique interlocking arrangement and cyclized peptide backbone which contains a conserved sequence shared among circulins. Circulins have previously been identified in a screen for anti-HIV activity.K.R. Gustafson, R.C. Sowder II, L.E. Henderson, I.C. Parsons, Y. Kashman, J.H. Cardellina II, J.B. McMahon, R.W.

Soc., 116 (1994), pp. 9337-9338 Studies have shown that cystine knot proteins can be incubated at temperatures of 65 ¬∞C or placed in 1N HCl/1N NaOH without loss of structural and functional integrity.Craik, David J., et al. ‚ÄúThe Cystine Knot Motif in Toxins and Implications for Drug Design.‚Äù Toxicon, vol. 39, no. 1, 2001, pp. 43‚Äì60., doi:10.1016/s0041-0101(00)00160-4.

Elected on 4 March 1990 for a period of five years, it was dissolved (without constitutional authority) by presidential decree during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 and ended de facto when the Russian White House was attacked on 4 October 1993. The Congress played an important role in some of the most important events in the history of Russia during this period, such as the declaration of independence of Russia from the USSR (December 1991), the rise of Boris Yeltsin, and economic reforms. Main functions The Congress had the power to pass laws by majority, which must then be signed by the President (with no right to veto until July 1991). The Congress held the ultimate power in the country (that is, power to decide on \\"any questions within jurisdiction of the Russian Federation\\") and some of the most-important powers (passage of and amendment of the Constitution, approval of the Prime Minister of Russia and the holders of the highest public offices, selection of the members of the committee of constitutional supervision (judges of Constitutional Court since 1991), declaration of referendums, impeachment of the president, etc.) were exclusive powers of Congress, exercised solely by it. Composition The Congress officially consisted of 1068 deputies, most of whom were elected in the general election on 4 March 1990, but the actual size varied due to several reelections and structural changes. 900 deputies were elected from the territorial regions, proportional to population; 168 more from the national- territorial regions: 64 from the 16 Autonomous Republics (four from each), 10 from the five autonomous regions (two from each), 10 from the 10 autonomous area (one from each), 84 from krais, oblasts, and the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. A total of 1,059 deputies were elected by the beginning of the first session of the Congress on 16 May 1990. 1037 deputies were present on 21 September 1993; 938 on 4 October 1993. Two thirds of the deputies had to be present for the Congress to meet the quorum. Sessions Constitutionally the Congress was required to meet every year, but actually due to the turbulent events during these years it met from two to three times a year. The Congress gathered in the Grand Kremlin Palace (except the Xth congress that gathered in the White House) and held a total of ten sessions. Its last session was held after the presidential dissolution decree, and was interrupted by armed attack on the White House by forces loyal to the president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin. * First: 16 May 1990 ‚Äì 22 June 1990 * Second (extraordinary): 27 November 1990 ‚Äì 15 December 1990 * Third (extraordinary): 28 March 1991 ‚Äì 5 April 1991 * Fourth: 21 May 1991 ‚Äì 25 May 1991 * Fifth (extraordinary): 10 July 1991 ‚Äì 17 July 1991; 28 October 1991 ‚Äì 2 November 1991 * Sixth: 6 April 1992 ‚Äì 21 April 1992 * Seventh: 1 December 1992 ‚Äì 14 December 1992 * Eight (extraordinary): 10 March 1993 ‚Äì 13 March 1993 * Ninth (extraordinary): 26 March 1993 ‚Äì 29 March 1993 * Tenth (emergency): 23 September 1993 ‚Äì 4 October 1993 Supreme Soviet The Supreme Soviet of RSFSR (later Supreme Soviet of Russian Federation) was a legislative body elected by the Congress to govern between the Congressional sessions. It consisted of 252 deputies, divided into the Council of the Republic (126 deputies) elected proportionately to the population size, and another 126 deputies from the Council of Nationalities, representing the federal subjects of Russia. =Functions= The Supreme Soviet was entrusted with the power to pass laws, ratify treaties, assign cabinet members (until 1991) and judges, declare amnesty, and approve presidential decrees. The laws passed by Supreme Soviet were to be signed by the Chairman of the Presidium with no right to veto until July 10, 1991. Afterwards the president gained the right to a delaying veto, which could be bypassed by the Supreme Soviet through a simple majority vote. During its sessions the Supreme Soviet passed a total of 333 federal laws. =Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet= The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was elected by the Congress. He was the Head of State in Russian SFSR until the creation of the post of President of Russia on 10 July 1991. He signed treaties (without the right to veto), nominated candidates for the Head of Government, conducted diplomacy and signed international agreements. From 10 July, the Chairman of the Presidium was demoted to the head of the legislative branch of government, a parliamentary speaker. He was also the fourth in line of succession to the Presidency, after the Vice President and the President of the Council of Ministers. Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russian SFSR: * 29 May 1990 to 10 July 1991 ‚Äì Boris Yeltsin * 10 July 1991 to 29 October 1991 ‚Äì Ruslan Khasbulatov (acting) * 29 October 1991 to 4 October 1993 ‚Äì Ruslan Khasbulatov Boris Yeltsin ran for the post of Chairman as a CPSU member twice unsuccessfully, gaining 497 and 503 votes respectively, out of 531 required to be elected. The CPSU then nominated a more moderate candidate, the President of the Council of Ministers, Alexander Vlasov. President of USSR Mikhail Gorbachev publicly spoke out against Yeltsin at the Congress session. After that, Yeltsin ran again on 29 May 1990 and gained 535 votes (50.52%), consequently becoming the leader of Russian SFSR. On 17 March 1991 a national referendum was held in Russia in which 54% voted for the introduction of the post of President of RSFSR. On 12 June 1991, Boris Yeltsin won the election with 57% and became the first president. After he took office on 10 July, six election rounds in the Congress were unable to elect a new Chairman of the Presidium. On October 29, Ruslan Khasbulatov was elected with 559 votes (52.79%). Brief history * 27 October 1989 ‚Äì Constitution of the RSFSR is modified (amended), Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR is created. * 4 March 1990 ‚Äì Nationwide election determines the composition of the Congress. * 16 May 1990 ‚Äì Congress starts the first session (opening of the I Congress of People's Deputies). * 29 May 1990 ‚Äì Boris Yeltsin is elected as Chairman of the Presidium by a narrow majority (50.52%) * 12 June 1990 ‚Äì The Congress passes the declaration of sovereignty of Russia. This initiates the struggle for power in Moscow between the Russian and the Union governments. * 1 December 1990 - The Democratic Russia bloc suffers its first split over the question of committing Soviet troops in the UN-mandated war against Iraq. The supporters of Soviet involvement are overruled by the left wing, and resolution is passed against commitment of Soviet forces. * 17 March 1991 ‚Äì A nationwide referendum introduces the post of President of RSFSR. Constitution was subsequently amended by Congress on 24 May 1991 to provide fundamental legal framework for the Russian presidency. * 12 June 1991 ‚Äì Yeltsin is elected President of RSFSR with 57% votes. On 10 July 1991 he is sworn into office at Fifth [session of the] Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR. * 17 July 1991 ‚Äì The Congress fails to elect the new Chairman, consequently Vice-Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov becomes the acting Chairman of the Presidium. * 29 October 1991 ‚Äì Ruslan Khasbulatov is elected as Chairman with 52.79% votes. * 1 November 1991 ‚Äì The Congress delegates extraordinary powers to President Yeltsin, expiring in 13 months. * 10 November 1991 - The deputies fail to pass a resolution declaring martial law in Chechen-Ingush ASSR, thus prolonging the Chechen conflict. * 18 April 1992 - Sixth [session of the] Congress approved overall course of ongoing constitutional reform and basic provisions of Constitutional Commission-backed draft Constitution of the Russian Federation. * 21 April 1992 - the Congress made gradual revision of then-current Constitution of 1978, which had reflected some of decisions, already passed by the Russian Supreme Soviet, such as: ** November 1991 adoption of the Declaration of Rights and Freedoms of Man and Citizen - completely new rights & duties provisions was written in Chapter II of the 1978 Constitution ** 12 December 1991 independence of RSFSR from USSR (but no explicit decision for ratification of Belavezha Accords was adopted; moreover, USSR Constitution & laws formally remains binding per art. 4 and 102 of the 1978 Russian Constitution, until abrogation of latter in December 1993) ** 25 December 1991 ‚Äì Renaming of the Russian SFSR to Russian Federation - old name of the Republic was written out of Constitution (replaced by the \\"Russian Federation - Russia\\" in title, preamble, art. 1 and by the \\"Russian Federation\\" elsewhere in the Constitution). * 10 December 1992 ‚Äì First major clash between the President and the Congress takes place over the Congressional refusal to approve Yegor Gaidar as the Head of Government and to prolong the President‚Äôs extraordinary powers. A compromise is achieved and a referendum was scheduled to be held on March 12, 1993. * 10 March 1993 ‚Äì An extraordinary session of the Congress cancels the referendum and nullifies the extraordinary powers granted to the president in November 1991. * 20 March 1993 ‚Äì The president declares a ‚Äúspecial regime‚Äù, unilaterally schedules a referendum of confidence, and refuses to obey the Congress until the referendum is held. * 28 March 1993 ‚Äì 617 out of 1033 deputies in the Congress vote to impeach Yeltsin. This is 60%, lower than the 2/3 required for a successful impeachment. * 29 March 1993 ‚Äì The Congress schedules a referendum on approval of president Yeltsin‚Äôs policies (especially economic policies) and early presidential and legislative elections. * 23 April 1993 ‚Äì In the nationwide referendum the population expresses support for Yeltsin and his policies. * 5 June 1993 ‚Äì The Constitutional Convention begins. The Congress delegates applaud Khasbulatov, while the presidential security grab one deputy and pull him out, pushing aside the Prosecutor General. * 18 September 1993 ‚Äì The president gathers representatives of executive and legislative power of the federal subjects, but they refuse his suggestion to proclaim a new supreme governing body ‚Äì the Federal Assembly. * 21 September 1993 ‚Äì Presidential decree ‚Ññ 1400 declares the Congress to be dissolved and schedules elections for the Federal Assembly. This move infringes the \\"Law on the President\\" (passed at the Fourth R.S.F.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies on May 24, 1991), and leads to the Congress dismissing president Yeltsin and the power formally passes to Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy. * 22 September 1993 ‚Äì Congress approves Rutskoy as the new Head of State and designates a new cabinet. Dual power leads to street fighting in Moscow. * 4 October 1993 ‚Äì Pro-presidential forces storm the White House and dissolve the Congress. =After dissolving= * 12 December 1993 ‚Äì A new constitution is passed in a referendum (58.4% in favor). Federal Assembly is elected. Nationalist LDPR takes the plurality of the votes. * 23 February 1994 ‚Äì Federal Assembly closes investigation of 1993 armed conflict and declares amnesty. * 26 February 1994 ‚Äì Prosecutor General agrees to amnesty despite Yeltsin‚Äôs protests. * 9 March 1994 ‚Äì Presidential administration writes a ‚Äúblack list‚Äù of 151 former deputies who defended the Congress. These deputies were deprived of their social privileges, until they were restored on 22 April by a presidential decree. * 4 March 1995 ‚Äì the most resistant of the former Congressmen celebrated the official end of their delegated powers. Political parties During the first session of the Congress, 86% were card-carrying members of the CPSU. This number declined steadily as more people resigned from the party, however new major parties were not quick enough to form, leaving a large percentage of the Congress non-partisan. CPSU was banned by president Yeltsin in November 1991 due to the attempted August Coup. The party collapsed completely during the collapse of Soviet Union, and in Russia it was replaced by CPRF.

Dual membership was allowed, so the fraction membership numbered 200% of the entire Congress. Two major blocs quickly formed in opposition to each other ‚Äì the Communist Bloc, and the Democratic Russia Bloc. The ‚ÄúDemocratic Russia‚Äù and its allies were initially in the majority, which allowed Yeltsin to be elected as the Chairman of the Presidium. During the fifth session, dual membership in fractions was outlawed, ‚Äúone deputy ‚Äì one fraction‚Äù law was passed. However, dual membership still remained an issue and in April 1992 there were 30 deputies with membership in several fractions. By 1993, a total of 14 fractions remained and 200-210 deputies still haven't declared membership in any fractions. The Democratic Russia Bloc collapsed, and resulted in formation of two new blocs ‚Äì ‚ÄúReform Coalition‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemocratic Centre‚Äù. A new bloc called ‚ÄúRussian Unity‚Äù formed by the conservative communists and their sympathizers and centre-left ‚ÄúCreative Forces‚Äù bloc was formed by the moderate left. Together they constituted majority and voiced opposition to Yeltsin and many of his policies. However, as of March 1993, they still lacked supermajority required for impeachment.

The village is approximately 55 kilometres southwest Limerick City and roughly 45 kilometres east of Tralee. Templeglantine is often simply referred to as 'Glantine' by natives and other West Limerick locals. History The Irish for Templeglantine is \\"Teampall an Ghleannt√°in\\", which means \\"the church of the little glen\\". Templeglantine is historically known locally as 'Inse B√°n' or \\"Inchabaun\\", which, when translated, means 'the White River meadow'. Templeglantine is a chapel village, having grown up around the church, which was built in 1829. A community centre was officially opened in 1977 by Bishop Jeremiah Newman. In the same year, the village received the Gl√≥r na nGael trophy from the then President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery. This is an award for the place in Ireland that does the most to promote the use of the Irish language throughout the previous year. The O'Macasa family ruled the area until the twelfth century when the Norman invasion brought the Fitzgerald family to rule over the area. The Fitzgeralds held the more auspicious title of 'The Earls of Desmond'. After the defeat of the Desmonds in 1583, the area came under the control of Sir William Courtenay who planted most of West Limerick. The de Lacy family were also landlords in the area. In 1985 a cist grave was discovered on the lands of James Leahy in the townland of Rathcahill West. These graves are box-like slab structures, which are just below ground level. They are believed to date from between 2000 BC to 500 BC. Amenities The village currently has a church, a school, a shop and post office, a pub, a community hall named Halla Inse B√°n, the Devon Inn Hotel and a small housing estate called Ascaill Inse B√°n. There are two playing pitches in the parish; Glantine F.C.'s pitch is located in the village, opposite the Devon Hotel. Templeglantine GAA's playing pitch is located just outside the village, at an area known locally as 'Dores Cross'. Sport =Templeglantine GAA Club= Templeglantine GAA Club (formed in 1898) is solely a Hurling club which currently competes at Junior A level in Limerick GAA. It currently plays in the West Limerick Junior A Hurling Championship. The club originally played as 'Templeglantine Owen Roes' or 'Eoin Ruas' at various times in the past. The club colours are Green & Gold hoops. The crest features the parish church, from which the village grew, the scenic Tullig Wood in the western end of the parish and the famous Barnagh Tunnel in the eastern side of the parish. The club's facilities include a playing pitch, clubhouse/dressing rooms, viewing stand and viewing bank and a team gymnasium. The playing pitch is due to be upgraded in 2016. The club does not field any Gaelic Football teams. The club has previously been amalgamated at Minor and U21 level with neighbours Tournafulla GAA as Allaughan Gaels (currently only joined at U21 level as of 2015). Allaughan Gaels won 3 West Limerick Minor titles in a row from 2009 to 2011, adding a County Minor B Hurling title in 2009. They also won West U21 A Hurling titles in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Templeglantine GAA have won County Limerick Junior Hurling titles in 1937, 1993, 2007 and 2013. The club reached the Munster Junior B Hurling Championship Final in February 2014, drawing with Holycross/Ballycahill of Tipperary in the final played at 'The Bog Garden' in Rathkeale. Holycross/Ballycahill subsequently defeated Templeglantine in the All-Ireland Junior B Hurling Final Replay at Raheenagh in March 2014. =Glantine F.C.= The local soccer club is called Glantine F.C. (formerly Glantine Rovers) whose club colours are Red & Yellow. Former professional Footballer John McGrath played his underage football with the club. The club was formed in 1982. It currently competes in the Limerick Desmond League Division 1 (as of 2015). Traditional Music There is a rich tradition of Irish culture, especially Irish Traditional Music in Templeglantine. The parish is part of the Sliabh Luachra area of traditional music around the border areas of Kerry, Cork, and Limerick. The local Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann branch is called CC√â Teampall an Ghleannt√°in. They teach traditional music to students from 'Glantine' and the surrounding area. They have competed successfully at Limerick, Munster and All-Ireland Fleadhanna and have won several All-Ireland titles in c√©ilidhs and Gr√∫pa√≠ Ceoil. The branch also compete in wrenboy competitions. The Templeglantine C√©il√≠ Band is very well known and frequently perform at c√©ilidh and concerts in the Sliabh Luachra area. C√©ilithe are also frequently held at the Devon hotel in the village.

He went on to open one of the largest drapery houses in Northeast England, was a founder member of a daily provincial newspaper and served as Mayor of Sunderland. Early life Thomas Scott Turnbull, the son of saddler John Turnbull, was born in Newcastle on October 28, 1825. After being educated at St Mary's School, Newcastle, he went to work for \\"Dunn and Bainbridge\\" - then the largest drapery firm in Newcastle. Turnbull soon rose to a \\"high position\\", later gaining further experience of the trade by working in several large commercial houses in London, before moving to Sunderland in 1850 and starting his own business.Sunderland Daily Echo, March 23, 1880 Business life Turnbull was extremely forward-thinking, introducing a system of \\"small profits and quick returns\\" at a time when established drapers gave long credit. From humble beginnings, he built up his Sunderland-based business \\"Albion House\\" into one of the largest drapery houses in Northern England. At his death, it occupied 122-126 High Street West, Sunderland, and the premises included sleeping and dining accommodation for 160 assistants, plus a library of nearly 2,500 volumes for their use. A second, smaller, Albion House drapery was also operated in Silver Street, Durham.Sunderland Weekly Times, March 26, 1880Sunderland Times, September 22, 1868 Political life Politically, Turnbull was a Liberal. He was elected to Sunderland Town Council, representing Bridge Ward, in 1866, but retired three years later rather than standing for re-election on account of his business commitments.Sunderland Times, September 22, 1868 It was Turnbull's interest in politics which led to his friendship, and future business partnership, with Samuel Storey. Storey, a former teacher and future MP for Sunderland, was aware of a gap in the market for a local daily newspaper, and was also keen to find a method of publicising his Radical points of view. Storey and Turnbull were two of the original seven founders of the Sunderland Echo in 1873. Each of the seven invested ¬£500 towards the project and the paper is still published today.Sunderland Daily Echo, March 23, 1880 Turnbull returned to politics following a seven-year break, after taking his son, Edward, into partnership. He was elected to the council in 1876, this time for Bishopwearmouth Ward, and became Mayor of Sunderland in November 1880. He died of typhoid fever, however, in March of the following year and was succeeded as Mayor by Samuel Storey.Sunderland Weekly Times, March 26, 1880 Private life The Turnbull mausoleum, Bishopwearmouth Cemetery. Turnbull was a member of the Established Church and warden of St Mark's Church, Sunderland. He was survived by a widow, four sons and three daughters. He was laid to rest in the Turnbull family mausoleum at Bishopwearmouth Cemetery.Sunderland Daily Echo, March 23, 1880Sunderland Daily Post, April 27, 1881 His son, Thomas Strover Turnbull, became the youngest winner of the boat race in 1873 with Cambridge, at the age of 18 years and 12 days, a record that stands to this day.

Biography Cassidy was born in Covington, Kentucky on November 10, 1869 as Ira Dymond Gerald Cassidy. He studied art at the Institute of Mechanical Arts under Frank Duveneck, and the Art Students League in New York. At the same moment that Cassidy was first finding success he contracted a life-threatening case of pneumonia and was moved to a sanitarium in Albuquerque in 1890. It was here that he first saw the people and places of the American Southwest, the subject matter that he would dedicate his entire life's work to after this point. His first work using American Indian and Western subjects was heavily art deco, and a deco edge would remain in his work even as it developed into a more solidly realist style. Cassidy moved from Albuquerque to Denver to work as a lithographer. In 1912 he moved and settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico where he met Edgar L. Hewett, founding director of the Museum of New Mexico. Hewett commissioned him to paint his first mural at the Panama-California International Exposition. He painted the Navajo in works that were primarily transferred to postcards or posters. At the 1915 Panama-California International Exposition in San Diego Cassidy was awarded the gold medal for his murals, the largest award he would win in his lifetime. Cassidy also created the mural Dawn of the West and the Parfet Park memorial in Golden, Colorado, where he was an honorary member of the Golden Kiwanis Club. During the mid-twenties Cassidy traveled in Europe, and his pieces were well thought of by the European public. Pablo Picasso chose one of Cassidy's pieces from a show for inclusion in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. He died on February 12, 1934 as a result of turpentine and carbon monoxide poisoning from a newly installed natural gas heater in his studio while working on a mural art project for the dome of the federal building at Santa Fe. Art collections Cassidy's art can be seen at the New Mexico Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, UC Berkeley Bancroft Library, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the El Paso Museum of Art. His work is also in Santa Fe at the main post office, Bishop's Lodge, and Hotel La Fonda.

M'Dowell, 1 U.S. 5 (1762) is a decision of a Pennsylvania Provincial Court, issued when Pennsylvania was still an English colony. It is among the first decisions that appear in the first volume of United States Reports. Colonial and state court decisions in the United States Reports None of the decisions appearing in the first volume and most of the second volume of the United States Reports are actually decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. Alexander Dallas, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania lawyer and journalist, had been in the business of publishing and selling these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling and selling these cases in a bound volume, which he called \\"Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution\\".Cohen, Morris and O'Connor, Sharon H. A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, Fred B. Rothman & Co, Littleton Colorado, 1995 This would come to be known as the first volume of \\"Dallas Reports.\\" When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new Federal Government, moved in 1791 to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports, and when the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, \\"2 Dallas Reports\\". Dallas would go on to publish a total of 4 volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter. In 1874, the U.S. government created the United States Reports, and numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of that series, starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports. The four volumes Dallas published were retitled volumes 1 - 4 of United States Reports.Hall, Kermit, ed. Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (Oxford 1992), p 215, 727 As a result, the complete citation to Lessee of Hewes v M'Dowell is 1 U.S. 5 (1 Dallas 5) (1762). The decision According to Dallas's annotations, the case involved the description of a tract of land within the Pennsylvania colony. The issue was whether the Book of Memorandums of the Secretary of the Land Office, which bore the Warrant of Survey conducted by the Surveyor General, was admissible into evidence. Dallas reports that the Court noted that the Book was \\"of Consequence\\" and that the Court urged \\"the other side\\" (which side, is not revealed) to consent to the Book's being given in evidence. The \\"other side\\" agreed, and the Book was given into evidence. Beyond that, the Court purportedly made no decision regarding its admissibility into evidence. However, the language of the decision itself suggests that the Court did in fact make a determination that the Book was admissible, and allowed it to be presented to the jury. The seeming lack of agreement between Dallas's notes of the case, and the purported language of the Court's decision has apparently never been reconciled. Precedential effect A year later, the Pennsylvania Supreme Provincial Court would cite M'Dowell as precedent for the admission of an Order for a land survey in Fothergill's Lessee v. Stover, another case involving irregularities in the processing of land grants. Notes References Hall, Kermit, ed.

Its founders intended the club to meet their residential, recreational, and entertainment needs in one building. The original building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 23, 2003. It is considered significant as a rare local example of an apartment hotel, a distinctive urban housing option of American cities in the 1920s. History Construction of the building began in 1928, but it was delayed for approximately 18 years due to the Great Depression. After World War II construction was completed, and it became a lively social club. Financial hard times in the early 1950s forced the club into bankruptcy. The building was converted to a hotel in 1954 and was marketed as a place for social events such as proms, parties, luncheons, banquets, and wedding receptions. The upper floors were converted into fashionable apartments. WTCN (now KARE television and WWTC radio) moved its radio and TV studios to the second and third floors around that time. Staples of WTCN programming, such as the children's program Lunch with Casey with Roger Awsumb, Matinee Movie with Mel Jass and All Star Wrestling with Verne Gagne, aired live in the building. From 1963 to 1972, the property was renamed Calhoun Beach Manor, operating as a home for the elderly. In 1977 the building was restored to its intended use as a sports and social club. The handball and squash courts and the swimming pool were restored, and the club installed tennis courts, steam rooms, saunas, sunrooms, and a jogging track. At that time, the lobby was restored in an Art Deco style. Later, in the 1980s, the club added more facilities, such as an aerobics studio, volleyball and basketball courts, and additional exercise equipment. In 1997 a tower addition was designed by KKE architects and subsequently constructed. In 2001 the property was renovated and converted to luxury apartment homes. The original building ‚Äì the oldest high-rise residential building outside of downtown Minneapolis' core ‚Äì was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 23, 2003. On June 24, 2020, Aimco announced its intent to remove \\"Calhoun\\" from the name of the building. This follows the decision of the Minneapolis Park Board to rename Lake Calhoun to Bde Maka Ska. As of June 30, the new name has not yet been selected.

In its place is left a stub file with offline bit set and a matching reparse point. Access to the file is transparently provided by DMAPI drivers. The purpose of this migration is to allow rarely used or sufficiently aged files to be stored on lower cost media, while retaining transparent access as if the file were stored locally. Features In general, IBM TSM HSM for Windows is similar to many other HSM products. This section discusses the semantics of how this particular HSM implementation operates. Administrators can set up archiving policies, and HSM for Windows automatically executes the policies at predefined times, without requiring any end-user knowledge or intervention. Running in default mode HSM f/Win replaces each archived file by a stub containing a pointer to the archive in which this object is stored. Retention can be specified within TSM to meet any legal or business requirements. The product can keep any number of versions of a file in the repository and provides administrator functions to retrieve any of these versions. Selected files or complete file spaces can be searched using SQL-like criteria and selected files or the complete results of a search can be retrieved either to their original location in the file system or to a different location in the file system. The basic functionality of user transparency is not affected by this added value as a user-initiated recall of a file is always directed to the latest version. An administrator may also override migration for specific archiving jobs by specifying that the original data is either kept on disk or completely deleted. This can be useful in particular in a Content Management environment, where files and other types of content are organized by business-related item groups or index classes, and users have access to this repository via a specific client or application. The administration of HSM for Windows does not require knowledge of the backend repository. The administration tool for OpenStore for File Server provides Windows administrators with these abilities: * Archives can be organized as logical groups of files from directories and subdirectories * File groups and file types (extensions) may be included and/or excluded * Files may be included and excluded based on the date of creation, modification and last access * Files may be included and excluded based on the size of files. * Archives may refer to a complete disk volume or any part of a directory structure History Prior to 2004, and through 2008, IBM TSM HSM for Windows was known as OpenStore for File Servers,OpenStore for File Servers on Archive.Org a.k.a. OS4FS. The product was (and still is as of 2011-07-20) developed by Intercope GmbH. In addition to TSM as a backend, OS4FS supported IBM Content Manager and IBM Content Manager On Demand. Since 2010-06-28, the product pages were removed from InterCope's website, with a small page InterCope - What happened to OS4FS? referring back to International Business Machines, Inc. for sales and support.

Maurer conducted the orchestra until 1817 when he toured as a performer in Germany and Paris. In 1819 Maurer began using Hanover as a base for directing and conducting, while touring and composing. During this period Maurer also maintained a composing partnership with Aleksey Nikolayevich Verstovsky in the opera-vaudeville form.

Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal in Honduras, prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government. UNAIDS estimate there to be 22,771 prostitutes in the country. Lack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty. Prostitution poses risks to these sex workers, especially in terms of mental, physical, and sexual health effects. There are also worldwide effects due to prostitution out of Honduras and similar countries in Central America. Honduras has tried to curb these effects but has yet to find a stable solution, despite numerous policy recommendations.  Effects of adult prostitution  = Mental and physical = According to a study, many commercial sex workers in cities, both men and women, are exposed to sexual and physical violence. 71.4% of street workers were exposed to violence/physical danger and almost 90% were exposed to sexual violence.Rio Navarro, Javier, Julien Cohen, Eva Rocillo Arechaga, and Edgardo Zuniga. 2012. ‚ÄúPhysical and sexual violence, mental health indicators, and treatment seeking among street-based population groups in Tegucigalpa, Honduras‚Äù Revista Panamericana De Salud Publica 31, no. 5: 388-395. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed 2 March 2017) On top of this, 73.5% of victims were physically abused in their childhood, which shows the origins of such mental and physical effects. For some workers, a lifestyle of abuse and exploitation is all they know. Another important aspect is the correlation between prostitution and drug use amongst sex workers. In the same study, nearly 1 in 4 commercial sex workers abuse cocaine, which as a recreational drug, has its own physical effects. In terms of mental effects, 63.3% of Commercial sex workers have reported having suicidal behavior in life; this percentage was even higher amongst the women. It is clear that prostitution in Honduran urban centers has created negative mental health issues among those who work in the field. = Sexual = Contrary to the belief that prostitution equates to high levels of HIV/AIDS, a medical reportDitmore, M. H. (2006). Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. from 2006 states that only 2.4% of its sample size of 790 female sex workers had HIV. They attribute this low number to the increase in the use of protection among sex workers. In fact, government STI prevention programs have been implemented since the early 2000s in cities across Honduras. Because prostitution is prolific in cities, these programs have proven extremely effective in reducing numbers of HIV incidents.  Child prostitution  Honduras has unsuccessfully tried to curb child prostitution. Lax laws have turned child prostitution into a business that has created prostitution rings both within the country and trafficking to other countries, including the US. The business continues to grow as children participate in sex work as a means of surviving. Although this article is specific to Honduras, child prostitution can be viewed in Central America as a whole, because of the networks of prostitution rings from as north as southern Mexico to as south as Costa Rica.Beyer, N. (2001). The Sex Tourism Industry Spreads to Costa Rica and Honduras: Are These Countries Doing Enough to Protect Their Children from Sexual Exploitation. Ga. J. Int'l & Comp. L.Guinn, David E., and Elissa Steglich. 2003. In modern bondage: Sex trafficking in the americas : National and regional overview of Central America and the caribbean : Belize, costa rica, dominican republic, el salvador, guatemala, Honduras, = Causes = The first cause is poverty. Prostitution becomes a source of economic opportunity where there is a space of economic regression. Surprisingly, many children who go into prostitution are forced by the parents in order to provide for the family, hence there were high levels of reported abuse in sex workers' childhoods. In a country where there are low literacy rates in rural areas, there is little opportunity to gain economic prosperity through education. Exploiting this reality, sex-tourist agents go to the countryside to find these children and contract them out for work. The agents pay the parents large sums of money up front in exchange for contractual labor done by their children, a form of modern-day slavery. Another cause is the promise for a better lifestyle. Some children willingly participate in the child prostitution industry because they believe the quality of life will be better than before. There have even been reports of some sex workers believing they would get trafficked into a better country where they could start anew. Unfortunately, some children are homeless or surrounded by gang activity and find similar outlets to survive. Another large issue that is rarely mentioned is the influence gender roles play in prostitution. Women in Honduras are seen as sexual objects and treated as such. This is why violence levels are so high against sex workers, especially women. Because these women are fundamentally seen as passive objects for a man's pleasure, they are dehumanized and treated as less than human. = Effects of sex work on children = There are dangerous physical and mental effects of sex work on children. They live in terrible conditions, are poorly fed and are often physically abused by their contractors if they do not deliver well on their jobs. Children suffer from mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, but also a lack of confidence and self-worth because they are used as tools. Children have been found to struggle from Complex post-traumatic stress disorder as adults due to their experiences when younger. In terms of health effects, children are more likely to suffer from life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis and HIV due to the amount of exposure to others in the work, and the immaturity of their bodies. Additionally, they are more susceptible to transferring STDs due to the ease with which their genitals can break. = Sex tourism = Sex tourism is an issue that is tied to child prostitution because of the large demand by older, adult men. Individuals from developed countries come to major Honduran cities like Tegucigalpa in order to have sex with minors because it is legal and cheap. The demand of these individuals further spurs the business, and is the reason for the creation of the sex work contractors. Although pimping is considered illegal, it is commonplace and an industry has arisen through illegal tourism.  Sex trafficking  Because of a low-cost and available population, trafficking has occurred both in and out of Honduras. These rings have extended their reach to even the United States. Here are a few reasons why sex trafficking occurs. The first reason is deceit. Sex workers are lured with the promise of a better life, and are sold to wealthy people in the United States.Golob, T. A. (2014). Human trafficking from southern mexico, Honduras, el salvador, and guatemala: Why these victims are trafficked into modern day florida (Order No. 1555111). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (1530474424). On top of this, those already in the industry voluntarily go to the United States because there is the opportunity for better.Trafficking in Honduras. (September 2010). Retrieved 9 March 2017, from http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Honduras.pdf Another reason is government corruption. Although trafficking is illegal, countries have reported government officials helping to smuggle persons and drafting fake documents to facilitate such smuggling. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Honduras as a 'Tier 2' country.  Current Government Action / Policy  Honduras has struggled to make effective government policy to combat this issue. The country planned to implement a National Plan of Action to Eradicate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, but the plan never came to fruition.UNICEF. (2015). Prevention of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: Contributing to a Sustainable Tourism in Central America. Panama City, Panama: Child Protection Section. The United Nations, the United States, and other international bodies have recommended policy to end child prostitution and sex trafficking. The number one policy to be put in place is ensuring safe and viable routes to economic prosperity, which means increasing access to education. Other Central American countries such as Costa Rica have put in educational measures to ensure their young citizens have access to academic and career opportunity. There is also the need for child protection services. This means a legal and societal framework to stop traffickers from recruiting these children - support through laws and the community. This policy is outlined in a report on child prostitution in Honduras by the United Nations Human Rights Council. Honduras has taken these policies into consideration, but whether they are realized remains to be seen. Additionally, non-governmental organizations like Casa Alianza and the International Labour Organization's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour have created programs working alongside the Honduran Government to tackle this problem.Maalla M‚Äôjid, N.

Black Rod leads the Speaker's Parade at the beginning of each sitting of the Senate and oversees protocol and administrative and logistical details of important events taking place on Parliament Hill, such as the opening of parliament and the Speech from the Throne. The office is modelled on the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod of the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Upon the appointment of the first woman to the position of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod on 20 October 1997, the title was changed to Usher of the Black Rod. The Rod The usher carries an ebony and gold staff of office modelled on that used in the House of Lords. Canada's original Rod is believed to have been made in the 1840s in Montreal for the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and then transferred to the Senate after Confederation in 1867, but it was lost in the 1916 fire that destroyed Centre Block. The current rod was crafted the same year by then-Crown Jeweller Garrard & Co.. The rod was snapped in half in 1967, and underwent only amateur repairs at the hands of then-Senator Henry Davies Hicks in his personal workshop; over the years it has additionally suffered scratching, cracking, and loss of pieces. Accordingly, on the occasion of Canada‚Äôs 150th birthday in 2016, Her Majesty bestowed a restoration by artisans and craftspeople at Windsor Castle under the direction of Adrian Smith, L.V.O., which went as far as to replace the central ebony Rod itself with a 20th Century ebony walking cane. The top consists of a lion on its hind legs displaying a shield decorated with a royal cypher George IV of the United Kingdom, the reigning monarch of the time, and bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense. Its middle knob is made of silver with maple leaf engravings (in contrast to the oak leaves used in its UK counterpart, which is made of gold), and is currently engraved with the name of Queen Elizabeth II, inscribed during its restoration. The base is set with a 1904 Gold Sovereign, displaying St. George slaying the Dragon.

For an estate to be a freehold, it must possess two qualities: immobility (property must be land or some interest issuing out of or annexed to land) and ownership of it must be of an indeterminate duration.

She was the daughter of composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and his wife Jessie (n√©e Walmisley). Biography She was born in South Norwood, London, the daughter of composer Samuel Coleridge- Taylor and his wife Jessie Walmisley. They had met as students at the Royal College of Music. She had an older brother Hiawatha. Gwendolyn wrote her first composition, Goodbye Butterfly, at the age of twelve. Later, she won a scholarship for composition and piano at Trinity College of Music in 1915, where she was taught by Gordon Jacob and Alec Rowley.Sadie, Julie Anne and Rhian Samuel. Eds. The Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers. Macmillan: New York, 1995. In 1924 Coleridge-Taylor married an Englishman, Harold Dashwood, in the Croydon parish church. She composed and conducted using her maiden name. After their divorce she dropped her first name, thereafter going by Avril professionally. In 1933, Coleridge-Taylor made her debut as a conductor at the Royal Albert Hall. She was the first female conductor of H.M.S. Royal Marines and a frequent guest conductor of the BBC Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. She was the founder and conductor of both the Coleridge-Taylor Symphony Orchestra and its accompanying musical society in the 1940s, as well as the Malcolm Sargent Symphony Orchestra. In 1939, she moved to Buxted in East Sussex where she had views over the South Downs. Her compositions include large-scale orchestral works, as well as songs, keyboard, and chamber music. They include a Piano Concerto in F minor, To April (1929), the Spring Magic suite (1933), Sussex Landscape, op 27 (1936), From the Hills, In Memoriam R.A.F., Wyndore (Windover) for choir and orchestra, and the Golden Wedding Ballet Suite for orchestra.Manuscripts held at the Royal College of Music, Rcm.ac.uk Sussex Landscape was revived in 2019 by the Chineke!

Operated by the Virginia Department of Corrections (VADOC), it houses about 800 inmates.Red Onion State Prison, Commonwealth of Virginia, accessed 7 November 2012. The prison opened in August 1998. It was the primary model for Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, its second supermax facility, that opened in 1999. Background Plans were announced in 1992 to build a prison on Red Onion Mountain, with cost of construction estimated at $52 million. 375 acres of land were donated by the Pittston Coal Company, which reserved some rights to mineral extraction. Many residents of Wise County supported constructing the prison because of jobs it would provide and because it would remain relatively isolated. One official said: \\"It's off the beaten path. You won't even know it's there.\\"Business Journal of Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia 5(11), December 1992. The prison was designed by Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall, a subdivision of AECOM since 1984.Gordon Wright, \\"Maximum security\\", Building Design and Construction 42(2), February 1999; accessed via ProQuest. The final cost of construction was over $70 million, with ground broken in 1995. As of 1999, the prison employed almost 800 people. Many of the corrections officers arrived at Red Onion after being laid off from jobs in nearby coalfields.\\"Miners' New Prospect Is Prison Guard Jobs\\", The Washington Post, 16 March 1998. Accessed via ProQuest. \\"The state employment office has received more than 3,000 applications for the 403 guard jobs, paying $20,000 a year, at Red Onion State Prison, which will open in July. Many of the applications come from laid-off miners.\\" Red Onion is one of six new prisons built in Virginia between 1995 and 2000. It thus contributed an increase in capacity to the Virginia Corrections system that allowed the state to contractually accept inmates from outside the state.Judith A. Greene, \\"Entrepreneurial Corrections: Incarceration As A Business Opportunity\\", in Invisible Punishment, ed. Marc Maurer and Meda Chesney-Lind; New York, The New Press, 2002. In 1999, the District of Columbia Department of Corrections was paying the Virginia Department of Corrections to house 69 prisoners at the Red Onion State Prison. These contracts were substantially reduced in 2004, when VADOC announced that it needed more supermax space for Virginians.Maria Glod, \\"Va. to Send Out-of-State Inmates Packing; State Says It Needs Space Used by 1,000 Prisoners from Conn., D.C., Elsewhere\\", The Washington Post, 28 February 2004. In 2011, VADOC reported only 15 out-of-state inmates at Red Onion: two from Pennsylvania and thirteen from the U.S. Virgin Islands. Population Red Onion is a \\"supermax\\" prison, intended to incarcerate \\"the worst of the worst.\\" Critics of the prison have alleged that many inmates are sent to Red Onion not because they have committed severe crimes but because they broke rules at other facilities. Some 55% of Red Onion's prisoners have sentences longer than 15 years, and 12% have life sentences. The prisoners at Red Onion are disproportionately black compared to the overall Virginia population. The creation of Red Onion and Wallens Ridge during the 1990s led to a threefold increase in the black population of Wise County, as reported by the 2000 Census.Patricia Allard and Chris Muller, \\"Incarcerated People and the Census: Painting a Distorted Picture of Virginia\\", Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, 1 November 2005.Christopher Muller, \\"How the census gives Wise County a break\\", Roanoke Times, 30 January 2005.

It also used to hold convicted murderer and activist Joseph Giarratano, who for some time was allowed to teach a course on nonviolence.Colman McCarthy, \\"Teaching peace from prison\\", National Catholic Reporter, 29 July 2005. Conditions More than two-thirds of prisoners at Red Onion are held in solitary confinement, or \\"segregation\\". They are confined to their cells 20 hours per day in 8‚Äô x 10‚Äô cells with 6‚Äù x 24‚Äù windows for light. Length of confinement ranges from two weeks to fourteen years.Anita Kumar, \\"Va. prisons‚Äô use of solitary confinement is scrutinized\\", The Washington Post, 7 January 2012.Peter Finn, \\"Two New Prisons Rise for Virginia's Toughest Convicts; Abolition of Parole Results In \`Super-Maximum' Facilities\\", The Washington Post, 23 June 1997; accessed via ProQuest. Food and medicine are served through trays in the cell door. Opportunities for education and work are more limited than in most prisons due to the higher security level; however, Red Onion offers janitorial work, a GED program, and a literacy program.

(Archive)James Careless, \\"Red Onion State Prison improves inmate video education system\\", Government Video 18(6), May 2007; accessed via ProQuest The facility was designed to minimize contact between corrections officers and prisoners as well as among prisoners. =Human rights criticisms= A 1999 report by Human Rights Watch raised concerns over conditions in Red Onion. The report states that \\"Virginia Department of Corrections has failed to embrace basic tenets of sound correctional practice and laws protecting inmates from abusive, degrading or cruel treatment\\"Jamie Fellner, \\"Red Onion State Prison: Super- Maximum Security Confinement in Virginia\\", Human Rights Watch, April 1999. and claims that \\"racism, excessive violence and inhumane conditions reign inside.\\" In 2001, Amnesty International released another report citing human rights violations at Red Onion.\\"United States of America: Abuses continue unabated? Cruel and inhumane treatment at Virginia supermaximum security prisons\\", Amnesty International, 1 May 2001. Critics note that Red Onion's solitary confinement rate is the highest in the Virginia prison system. A reported 173 of the prisoners in solitary confinement have been diagnosed with mental illnesses, and some contend that isolation exacerbates their conditions and limits their ability to get treatment. \\"Control Unit Torture\\", art created by Red Onion inmate Kevin \\"Rashid\\" JohnsonKevin \\"Rashid\\" Johnson\\", \\"Abuse Reports Culminate In Hair-Raising Assault By Red Onion State Prison Guards\\", 10 January 2012. The reports also cite the use of firearms with live ammunition by guards (an unusual practice in American prisons), which has led to inmate injuries. They also object to the use of electroshock weapons by guards. Critics also point to \\"five point restraints\\" as an instance of cruel punishment. These are devices that guards use to physically restrain inmates. They are officially used to limit movement of prisoners who threaten themselves or others, but critics such as Amnesty International have argued that guards use them for punishment and torture. Mac Gaskins, a prisoner at Red Onion for fourteen years, reported: \\"having your fingers broken inside of these places, being bitten by dogs, being strapped to beds for days, as we've talked about many times, being forced to defecate on yourself ‚Äì I mean all of this has led to these men demanding to be treated as human beings. It's like if you are put inside prison, you forfeit that right to be treated as a human being.\\" Gaskins also reported that prisoners were denied access to soap, toothpaste, and books. Kevin \\"Rashid\\" Johnson, prison artist and organizer for the New Afrikan Black Panther Party‚ÄìPrison Chapter (not to be confused with the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense), has for years reported multiple instances of brutality and mistreatment from officers.Kevin \\"Rashid\\" Johnson, \\"From bad to worse\\", San Francisco Bay View, 29 January 2012. Advocates for Red Onion prisoners also note that the majority of those incarcerated are African Americans from Richmond or Northern Virginia, whereas most of the corrections officers are whites from Appalachia. It is suggested that this racial disparity leads to active racism which exacerbates the human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch complained that much was still unknown about the prison, as a result of the difficulty of seeing inside or communicating with prisoners. Mother Jones reported that inmates were required to wear electroshock \\"stun belts\\" while meeting with outside investigators.\\"Shocking Discipline\\", Mother Jones, March/April 2000. Inmate Kawaski Bass died after being attacked by another prisoner in his cell on September 9, 2011. His family accuses the warden and guards on duty of ignoring screams for help, and has filed a lawsuit against them, Red Onion State Prison, and the state of Virginia.Michael Owens, \\"Family suing state, Red Onion Prison for death of inmate\\", Bristol Herald-Courier (TriCities.com), 15 July 2012. =Response to criticisms= Prison officials confirm that isolation is normal at Red Onion, but argue that they do not engage in the cruel practice known as \\"solitary confinement\\". They also disagree with complaints about access and say that prisoners can receive visits from attorneys, and from family and friends for four hours a month. Governor Bob McDonnell stated: \\"People behind bars have civil rights. At the same time, we have a duty to promote public safety. If people show, even in prison, that they can't get along with other prisoners, then they are treated accordingly.\\" Former VADOC director Ronald J. Angelone, during whose term (1994‚Äì2002), Red Onion was designed and opened, defended the supermax system as necessary to avoid violence, saying: \\"There is no Department of Corrections magic wand that makes them decent human beings while in prison. They have to be housed appropriately so that the employees and the other inmates aren't subjected to violent behavior.\\"Craig Timberg, \\"Virginia Rethinking Hard-Core Prisons; Effect on Inmates Could Backfire\\", The Washington Post, 27 April 1999, accessed via ProQuest. Former Virginia state senator Kenneth W. Stolle, who served as chairman of the Virginia State Crime Commission, has argued that rehabilitation at Red Onion is less important because so many prisoners serve life sentences, saying: \\"If they're getting out, obviously we have a responsibility to make sure they at least have an opportunity to be functioning members of society. Most people envisioned that Red Onion and Wallens Ridge were going to be dedicated to people with life sentences.\\" The state announced that it would restrict the use of restraints as punishment in response to the report from Human Rights Watch.Bill Miller, \\"Va. Alters Prison Policy to Cut Use of Restraints\\", The Washington Post, 9 February 2001; accessed via ProQuest. =Department of Justice investigation= Responding to the report from Human Rights Watch, with attendant media coverage, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that in October 2000 that it would open an investigation.Maria Glod, \\"U.S. Investigates Virginia Prison; Red Onion Inmates' Allegations Involve Excessive Force\\", The Washington Post, 3 October 2000; accessed via ProQuest. The Virginia Department of Corrections announced plans in March 2012 to review solitary confinement policies at Red Onion. A Washington Post report suggested that this announcement would continue to postpone action by the Department of Justice.Anita Kumar, \\"Virginia plans changes in prisoner isolation process\\", The Washington Post, 30 March 2012. =Hunger strike= On May 22, 2012, inmates in Red Onion began a hunger strike to bring \\"abusive prison conditions to light\\". The prisoners said: \\"Regardless of sexual preference, gang affiliation, race and religion, there are only two classes at this prison: the oppressor and the oppressed. We the oppressed are coming together. We're considered rival gang members, but now we're coming together as revolutionaries. We're tired of being treated like animals.\\"Mary Ratcliff, \\"Prisoners at Virginia‚Äôs Red Onion State Prison on hunger strike\\", San Francisco Bay View, 27 May 2012. Inmates issued ten demands including \\"fully cooked food\\", \\"unrestricted access to complaint and grievance forms\\", \\"an adequate standard of living\\", and \\"adequate medical care\\". Red Onion officials stated that the hunger strike ended within a week.Anita Kumar, \\"Hunger strike at Red Onion prison has ended, state officials say\\", The Washington Post 29 May 2012.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Description and history The city of Charleston was founded in 1670, with its main historic colonial heart laid out in 1680 on the peninsula at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers. Since that time, the city has been a major commercial and trade center on the southeastern seaboard of North America. Its architecture reflects numerous significant periods of development, with high- quality examples of different architectural styles resulting from the city's continued importance through more than 300 years of history. Significant among these are the many Charleston \\"single houses\\", which are typically a single room in depth, and oriented with the short access toward the street, with the entrance area on a long side. These types of houses are built using all types of building materials, including wood, brick, and stucco. In Ansonborough, there are blocks of fine Greek Revival houses, built in the wake of an 1838 fire. Broad Street, a major east-west thoroughfare since the early days, is home to a fine collection of Federal period houses, many of which have been converted to commercial uses. It is also where a number of important early civic and institutional buildings are located, including the 1752 St. Michael's Episcopal Church, the 1767 Exchange, and the 1792 Charleston County Courthouse. The city of Charleston legislatively established the \\"Old and Historic District\\" as a local historic district. In 1960, a portion of this district was designated a National Historic Landmark District for its architectural significance. When initially listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, the district was defined as \\"An area roughly bounded by Broad, Bay, S. Battery and Ashley and an area along Church bounded by Cumberland and Chalmers\\". Significant boundary enlargements of the National Register district in 1970 and 1978 have resulted in it now coinciding with the locally legislated district, extending in parts as far north as Calhoun Street. The district was enlarged to add individual buildings in 1984, 1985 and 1986.

He was a military man by training and rose to being commander of the colonial regular troops.  Life  Claude de Ramezay was a son of Timoth√© de Ramezay and Catherine Tribouillard, daughter of Hilaire Tribouillard, intendant in charge of the extensive stables of the Prince de Cond√©. He came to Canada in 1685 as a lieutenant in the colonial regular troops and was promoted to the rank of captain two years later. In 1690, Ramezay married the daughter of Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1631 - 1708) and thus was joined to one of the elite families of New France. He then bought the position of governor of Trois-Rivi√®res from the widow of Ren√© Gaultier de Varennes and became governor there in 1691. In 1699, Ramezay left Trois- Rivi√®res to become the commander of the Canadian troops. He served satisfactorily and was awarded the cross of Saint-Louis for his efforts. In 1704 he succeeded his rival Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil as governor of Montreal. Ramezay was also the acting governor of New France from 1714 to 1716 while governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil was on leave in France. 1705-1776  Legacy  Ramezay was survived by two sons and at least five daughters. In 1711 his eldest son, 19-year-old Claude junior, an ensign in the French navy, lost his life in an attack on Rio de Janeiro. His second son, Louis, Sieur de Monnoir, was killed by the Cherokees during the campaign of 1715 against the Fox Indians. In 1712 Ramezay's third son, Charles-Hector, Sieur de La Gesse, was presented to the French court by Madame de Vaudreuil. La Gesse, the elder of the surviving sons, died on 27 Aug. 1725 in the wreck of the Chameau off √éle Royale. The younger, Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas-Roch, entered the military and is perhaps best remembered as the man who surrendered Quebec to the British in September 1759. Of the five daughters, two became nuns and two others married officers of the colonial regular troops.

Background Byers was born in Wallasey, Cheshire. He was the son of Charles Cecil Byers (1888‚Äì1957), a Lloyd's underwriter, who was Liberal candidate for Westbury at the 1935 general election. He moved with the family to Potters Bar and was educated at Westminster School, followed by Christ Church, Oxford, where he won a Blue for athletics. At Oxford he was president of the Union of Liberal Students and president of the University Liberal Club. His treasurer was Harold Wilson, later Labour Party prime minister. Byers was also an exchange scholar at Milton Academy, Massachusetts. While at the University of Oxford, where he gained his degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, he met Joan Oliver, whom he married in 1939. They had a son and three daughters. Joan Oliver was a committed Liberal in her own right and was a constant help to her husband during his political career. Byers was admitted to Gray's Inn after university, but broke off his legal education to enlist. During the Second World War, Byers served in the Royal Artillery, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and for a time serving on Field Marshal Montgomery's staff. He was mentioned in dispatches three times, was created a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1944 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In the 1945 general election, Byers gained the formerly Conservative seat of North Dorset, with the absence of a Labour candidate being a key factor in this success.

UNAIDS estimate there to be 70,000 prostitutes in the country. Law enforcement is generally lax. The country used to be a premier destination in the 1970s for sex tourism for adults, including gay men. Sex tourism declined because of HIV fears but has returned, including child sex tourism. Haiti suffers from extreme poverty, with much of the population living on less than a dollar a day; those with no other resources often turn to prostitution. After the 2010 earthquake, many prostitutes from the Dominican Republic crossed over the border, searching out clients amongst the aid workers and UN personal. Dominican women command a premium because of their lighter skin. Allegations of sexual misconduct by UN and Oxfam staff =UN Peacekeeping Mission= Several hundred Sri Lankan troops, part of the UN mission, were expelled from the country in 2007. They were involved in trafficking Haitian girls to Sri Lanka and also being involved in child prostitution locally. It was reported in 2010 that trafficked Dominican women had been found in brothels allegedly frequented by UN personnel. In 2015 the UN reported that between 2008 and 2014, members of its peacekeeping mission had sexually abused more than 225 Haitian women in exchange for food, medication, and other items. The UN has a zero-tolerance policy towards its personnel visiting the local sex trade, but this is virtually unenforceable. =Oxfam= In February 2018 an investigation by The Times newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A confidential report produced by Oxfam in 2011 found that there had been ‚Äúa culture of impunity‚Äù among some staff in Haiti and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. According to the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, Dame Barbara Stocking, offered Hauwermeiren ‚Äúa phased and dignified exit‚Äù because of concern that sacking him risked ‚Äúpotentially serious implications‚Äù for the charity's work and reputation. Oxfam did not report any of the incidents to the Haitian authorities, on the grounds that ‚Äúit was extremely unlikely that any action would be taken‚Äù. Although Oxfam disclosed details of the incident to the Charity Commission, following the investigation by The Times the Commission revealed that it had never received the final investigation report and Oxfam ‚Äúdid not detail the precise allegations, nor did it make any indication of potential sexual crimes involving minors‚Äù. In light of the information revealed by The Times, a spokesperson for the Commission commented that: \\"We will expect the charity to provide us with assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents\\". In response to the revelations, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, described the reports as ‚Äúshocking, sickening and depressing‚Äù. Following the publication of the Times' report, Oxfam issued a statement in which it asserted \\"Oxfam treats any allegation of misconduct extremely seriously. As soon as we became aware of a range of allegations ‚Äî including of sexual misconduct ‚Äî in Haiti in 2011 we launched an internal investigation. The investigation was announced publicly and staff members were suspended pending the outcome.‚Äù The statement also added that the allegations ‚Äúthat under-age girls may have been involved were not proven‚Äù. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said Oxfam had failed in its \\"moral leadership\\" over the \\"scandal\\". Mordaunt also said that Oxfam did \\"absolutely the wrong thing\\" by not reporting the detail of the allegations to the government. HIV Haiti has the highest cases of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region estimated to be at about a 1.8 percent prevalence as of 2013. An analysis of the causes of death, which started when hospital death certificates began to be collected in 1997, shows that AIDS was the leading cause of death in the country, but as of 2010, this has been reduced to only a 1 percent cause of death, as disaster-related issues has been the leading cause at 66 percent. Sex Trafficking According to the US Department of State, Haiti is a source, transit and destination country for human trafficking. Women and children, particularly from Venezuela and the Dominican republic are trafficked into the country for Forced prostitution. Penalties for those convicted of human trafficking are jail sentences from 7 to 15 years plus hefty fines. If there are aggravating factors, such as trafficking minors, the sentence may be interlaced to life imprisonment. Similar sentences may be imposed on those obtaining, or attempting to obtain, sexual services from a victim of trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Haiti as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

It is twinned with the commune of Cl√©cy, in Normandy, France and had a parish population of 824 at the 2011 census. It is known well for its crooked church spire, which a pub has been named after. It was home to Edmund Lockyer, who went to Australia and named a town, Ermington, in New South Wales.

It appeared in the Domesday Book as a royal manor. Near the boundary of the parish there is a place, called Penquit, which has probably been continuously inhabited since the Celtic times of Dumnonia. Penquit was recorded in 1238 and is Celtic for \\"end of the wood\\". From the early 13th century a mansion at nearby Strashleigh was the seat of the Strashleigh family, until the family died out in 1583. Nearby Strode was inhabited by the Strode family from 1238 and probably earlier. Although, since the 15th century, their principal residence has been in Plympton. In the 14th century, its church, named after Saint Peter, was constructed and was later enlarged in the 15th century.  Education  Ermington's only school is Ermington Community Primary School. It is a state-funded primary school (ages 5‚Äì11) following the National Curriculum.

During her visit with Bowles, she asked him to sign a copy of a recently published biography on him, An Invisible Spectator, which prompted Bowles to state: \\"Does this book have anything to do with me?\\" As a result of this comment, and the later suggestion by Gore Vidal to postpone her work on Williams' biography and instead write one on Bowles, Carr shifted gears and began work on what would become Paul Bowles: A Life. Bowles agreed to offer Carr his no-strings-attached cooperation on the work. The result - after 12 years, and 13 trips to visit him in Morocco, and arrangements she made for his medical treatment in Atlanta - was that Bowles gave her in person and in letters tantalizing revelations about his life and the people with whom he had associated. It was understood by Carr that she could not publish any of this information until he had died. She was able to read aloud to Bowles her completed work shortly before he died in 1999.Virginia Spencer Carr, \\"How I Came to Write Paul Bowles: A Life\\", September 25, 2004.Philip Weiss, \\"Bowles' Detached Life, Lonely, Artistic, but Satisfied\\", The New York Observer, November 8, 2004.

They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the N-point functions of affine primary fields and can be derived using either the formalism of Lie algebras or that of vertex algebras. The structure of the genus-zero part of the conformal field theory is encoded in the monodromy properties of these equations. In particular, the braiding and fusion of the primary fields (or their associated representations) can be deduced from the properties of the four-point functions, for which the equations reduce to a single matrix-valued first-order complex ordinary differential equation of Fuchsian type. Originally the Russian physicists Vadim Knizhnik and Alexander Zamolodchikov derived the equations for the SU(2) Wess‚ÄìZumino‚ÄìWitten model using the classical formulas of Gauss for the connection coefficients of the hypergeometric differential equation. Definition Let \\\\hat{\\\\mathfrak{g}}_k denote the affine Lie algebra with level and dual Coxeter number . Let be a vector from a zero mode representation of \\\\hat{\\\\mathfrak{g}}_k and \\\\Phi(v,z) the primary field associated with it. Let t^a be a basis of the underlying Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}, t^a_i their representation on the primary field \\\\Phi(v_i,z) and the Killing form. Then for i,j=1,2,\\\\ldots,N the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equations read : \\\\left( (k+h)\\\\partial_{z_i} + \\\\sum_{j eq i} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{a,b} \\\\eta_{ab} t^a_i \\\\otimes t^b_j}{z_i-z_j} \\\\right) \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Phi(v_N,z_N)\\\\dots\\\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\\\right \\\\rangle = 0. Informal derivation The Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equations result from the Sugawara construction of the Virasoro algebra from the affine Lie algebra. More specifically, they result from applying the identity : L_{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{2(k+h)} \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\sum_{a, b} \\\\eta_{ab}J^a_{-k}J^b_{k-1} to the affine primary field \\\\Phi(v_i,z_i) in a correlation function of affine primary fields. In this context, only the terms k=0,1 are non-vanishing. The action of J^a_{-1} can then be rewritten using global Ward identities, : \\\\left( \\\\left(J^a_{-1}\\\\right)_i \\\\+ \\\\sum_{j eq i} \\\\frac{t^a_j}{z_i-z_j} \\\\right) \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Phi(v_N,z_N)\\\\dots \\\\Phi(v_1,z_1)\\\\right\\\\rangle = 0, and L_{-1} can be identified with the infinitesimal translation operator \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}. Mathematical formulation Since the treatment in , the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equation has been formulated mathematically in the language of vertex algebras due to and . This approach was popularized amongst theoretical physicists by and amongst mathematicians by . The vacuum representation H0 of an affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra at a fixed level can be encoded in a vertex algebra. The derivation acts as the energy operator L0 on H0, which can be written as a direct sum of the non-negative integer eigenspaces of L0, the zero energy space being generated by the vacuum vector Œ©. The eigenvalue of an eigenvector of L0 is called its energy. For every state a in L there is a vertex operator V(a,z) which creates a from the vacuum vector Œ©, in the sense that :V(a,0)\\\\Omega = a. The vertex operators of energy 1 correspond to the generators of the affine algebra : X(z)=\\\\sum X(n) z^{-n-1} where X ranges over the elements of the underlying finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. There is an energy 2 eigenvector which give the generators Ln of the Virasoro algebra associated to the Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra by the Segal‚ÄìSugawara construction : T(z) = \\\\sum L_n z^{-n-2}. If a has energy , then the corresponding vertex operator has the form : V(a,z) = \\\\sum V(a,n)z^{-n-\\\\alpha}. The vertex operators satisfy :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dz} V(a,z) &= \\\\left [L_{-1},V(a,z) \\\\right ]= V \\\\left (L_{-1}a,z \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left [L_0,V(a,z) \\\\right ] &= \\\\left (z^{-1} \\\\frac{d}{dz} + \\\\alpha \\\\right )V(a,z) \\\\end{align} as well as the locality and associativity relations :V(a,z)V(b,w) = V(b,w) V(a,z) = V(V(a,z-w)b,w). These last two relations are understood as analytic continuations: the inner products with finite energy vectors of the three expressions define the same polynomials in and in the domains |z< |w|, |z> |wand |z ‚Äì w< |w|. All the structural relations of the Kac‚ÄìMoody and Virasoro algebra can be recovered from these relations, including the Segal‚ÄìSugawara construction. Every other integral representation Hi at the same level becomes a module for the vertex algebra, in the sense that for each a there is a vertex operator on Hi such that :V_i(a,z)V_i(b,w) = V_i(b,w) V_i(a,z)=V_i(V(a,z-w)b,w). The most general vertex operators at a given level are intertwining operators between representations Hi and Hj where v lies in Hk. These operators can also be written as : \\\\Phi(v,z)=\\\\sum \\\\Phi(v,n) z^{-n-\\\\delta} but Œ¥ can now be rational numbers. Again these intertwining operators are characterized by properties : V_j(a,z) \\\\Phi(v,w)= \\\\Phi(v,w) V_i(a,w) = \\\\Phi \\\\left (V_k(a,z-w)v,w \\\\right) and relations with L0 and L‚àí1 similar to those above. When v is in the lowest energy subspace for L0 on Hk, an irreducible representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}, the operator is called a primary field of charge k. Given a chain of n primary fields starting and ending at H0, their correlation or n-point function is defined by : \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\\\Phi(v_2,z_2) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left(\\\\Phi \\\\left (v_1,z_1 \\\\right ) \\\\Phi \\\\left (v_2,z_2 \\\\right ) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi \\\\left (v_n,z_n \\\\right ) \\\\Omega, \\\\Omega \\\\right ). In the physics literature the vi are often suppressed and the primary field written Œ¶i(zi), with the understanding that it is labelled by the corresponding irreducible representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}. =Vertex algebra derivation= If (Xs) is an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathfrak{g} for the Killing form, the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equations may be deduced by integrating the correlation function :\\\\sum_s \\\\left \\\\langle X_s(w)X_s(z)\\\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle (w-z)^{-1} first in the w variable around a small circle centred at z; by Cauchy's theorem the result can be expressed as sum of integrals around n small circles centred at the zj's: :{1\\\\over 2}(k+h) \\\\left \\\\langle T(z)\\\\Phi(v_1,z_1)\\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle = - \\\\sum_{j,s} \\\\left \\\\langle X_s(z)\\\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(X_s v_j,z_j) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}. Integrating both sides in the z variable about a small circle centred on zi yields the ith Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equation. =Lie algebra derivation= It is also possible to deduce the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamodchikov equations without explicit use of vertex algebras. The term may be replaced in the correlation function by its commutator with Lr where r = 0, ¬±1. The result can be expressed in terms of the derivative with respect to zi. On the other hand, Lr is also given by the Segal‚ÄìSugawara formula: :\\\\begin{align} L_0 &= (k+h)^{-1}\\\\sum_s\\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{2}X_s(0)^2 + \\\\sum_{m>0} X_s(-m)X_s(m)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{\\\\pm 1 } &=(k+h)^{-1} \\\\sum_s\\\\sum_{ m\\\\ge 0} X_s(-m\\\\pm 1)X_s(m) \\\\end{align} After substituting these formulas for Lr, the resulting expressions can be simplified using the commutator formulas : [X(m),\\\\Phi(a,n)]= \\\\Phi(Xa,m+n). =Original derivation= The original proof of , reproduced in , uses a combination of both of the above methods. First note that for X in \\\\mathfrak{g} : \\\\left \\\\langle X(z)\\\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Phi(v_1,z_1)\\\\cdots \\\\Phi(Xv_j,z_j) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\\\right \\\\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}. Hence : \\\\sum_s \\\\langle X_s(z)\\\\Phi(z_1,v_1) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(X_sv_i,z_i) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(v_n,z_n)\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j\\\\sum_s \\\\langle\\\\cdots \\\\Phi(X_s v_j, z_j) \\\\cdots \\\\Phi(X_s v_i,z_i) \\\\cdots\\\\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}. On the other hand, :\\\\sum_s X_s(z)\\\\Phi \\\\left (X_sv_i,z_i \\\\right ) = (z-z_i)^{-1} \\\\Phi \\\\left (\\\\sum_s X_s^2v_i,z_i \\\\right ) + (k+g){\\\\partial\\\\over \\\\partial z_i} \\\\Phi(v_i,z_i) +O(z-z_i) so that :(k+g)\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\Phi(v_i,z_i) = \\\\lim_{z\\\\to z_i} \\\\left[\\\\sum_s X_s(z)\\\\Phi \\\\left (X_sv_i,z_i \\\\right ) -(z-z_i)^{-1}\\\\Phi \\\\left (\\\\sum_s X_s^2 v_i,z_i \\\\right )\\\\right]. The result follows by using this limit in the previous equality.  Monodromy representation of KZ equation  In conformal field theory along the above definition the n-point correlation function of the primary field satisfies KZ equation. In particular, for \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2 and non negative integers k there are k + 1 primary fields \\\\Phi_j(z_j) 's corresponding to spin j representation (j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2,\\\\ldots , k/2). The correlation function \\\\Psi(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n) of the primary fields \\\\Phi_j(z_j) 's for the representation (\\\\rho,V_i) takes values in the tensor product V_1\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes V_n and its KZ equation is : (k+2)\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i}\\\\Psi=\\\\sum_{i,j e i}\\\\frac{\\\\Omega_{ij}}{z_i- z_j}\\\\Psi, where \\\\Omega_{ij}=\\\\sum_a\\\\rho_i(J^a)\\\\otimes\\\\rho_j(J_a) as the above informal derivation. This n-point correlation function can be analytically continued as multi-valued holomorphic function to the domain X_n \\\\subset \\\\Complex^n with z_i e z_j for i e j. Due to this analytic continuation, the holonomy of the KZ equation can be described by the braid group B_n introduced by Emil Artin. In general, A complex semi-simple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} and its representations (\\\\rho,V_i) give the linear representation of braid group :\\\\theta \\\\colon B_n \\\\rightarrow V_1\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes V_n as the holonomy of KZ equation. Oppositely, a KZ equation gives the linear representation of braid groups as its holonomy. The action on V_1\\\\otimes\\\\dots\\\\otimes V_n by the analytic continuation of KZ equation is called monodromy representation of KZ equation. In particular, if all V_i 's have spin 1/2 representation then the linear representation obtained from KZ equation agrees with the representation constructed from operator algebra theory by Vaughan Jones. It is known that the monodromy representation of KZ equation with a general semi-simple Lie algebra agrees with the linear representation of braid group given by R-matrix of the corresponding quantum group.

Conclusive evidence proving or disproving them has never been presented and there is no consensus amongst scholars on whether or not such links exist. =Yuezhi and Wusun= Yuezhi and Wusun are Chinese exonyms for two separate Indo-European peoples, who lived in western China and Central Asia, during ancient times. Before the end of the 4th Century BCE, the Yuezhi and Wusun were located in areas that were later part of the Chinese provinces of Gansu and Xinjiang.G. Haloun, \\"Zur √úe-ts√Ø-Frage.

In about 200 BCE, the Xiongnu leader Modu Chanyu ‚Äì a vassal of the Yuezhi ‚Äì rebelled, attacked the Yuezhi, and subjugated several other peoples. The Yuezhi subsequently attacked the Wusun, in about 173 BC, and killing their king, Nandoumi (). According to a Wusun legend, Nandoumi's infant son Liejiaomi was left in the wild, but was miraculously saved by a she-wolf, which allowed him to suckle, and ravens, which fed him meat.Shiji „ÄäÂè≤Ë®ò¬∑Â§ßÂÆõÂàóÂÇ≥„Äã Original text: ÂåàÂ•¥ÊîªÊÆ∫ÂÖ∂Áà∂ÔºåËÄåÊòÜËé´ÁîüÊ£ÑÊñºÈáé„ÄÇÁÉèÂóõËÇâËúöÂÖ∂‰∏äÔºåÁãºÂæÄ‰π≥‰πã„ÄÇ This pivotal myth shared similarities with the founding myths of many other peoples in Central Asia.

In 162 BC, the Yuezhi suffered a further, more decisive defeat at the hands of the Xiongnu and retreated from Gansu.

The Wusun settled afterwards in Gansu, in the Wushui-he (Chinese: \\"Raven[-Black] Water River\\") valley, as vassals of the Xiongnu. According to the Chinese chronicle Hanshu, in 49 BCE the Xiongnu ruler, Zhizhi defeated three small states. Zuev reads the names of these states as the Hujie (ÂëºÊè≠) or W≈´jiƒì (ÁÉèÊè≠), Jiankun (Â†ÖÊòÜ) (i.e. Kyrghyz) and Dingling (‰∏ÅÈõ∂). While other scholars have regarded the Hujie ~ Wujie as most likely an offshoot of the Wusun, Zuev considers it possible that they were a remnant of the Yuezhi.

Earlier lighthouses St Bees head and lighthouse, engraving 1842 by WH Bartlett The first lighthouse on the site began its life in 1718 on land bought by Trinity House, one of the UK's general lighthouse authorities. It was constructed by Thomas Lutwige, who paid a lease of ¬£20 per year for the site. It stood 9 metres tall and was 5 metres in diameter topped with a large metal grate on which the lighthouse keeper would burn coal. To make money Lutwige levied charges of 3¬Ω pence per tonne of cargo carried by vessels to nearby ports.{cite web |url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/st_bees.html |title=In depth look at the lighthouse |website=Trinity House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306214941/http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/st_bees.html |archivedate=6 March 2008}} In 1822 it was the last coal-powered lighthouse in Britain, when it was destroyed by a fire in which the keeper's wife and five children perished by suffocation. In its place a circular tower, high, with 15 oil-powered Argand lamps set within parabolic reflectors, was built by engineer Joseph Nelson at a cost of ¬£1,447; it was operational from 1823. In 1866 this was in turn replaced by a new, higher round tower, built (along with two new dwelling houses for the keepers) further inland. The current lighthouse The foundation stone of the current tower was laid in a ceremony on 10 May 1865, with construction by builder John Glaister of Whitehaven. Civil engineer Henry Norris supervised the construction as resident engineer on behalf of Trinity House. Beneath the foundation stone a zinc box was laid containing a dated scroll signed by Henry Norris & John Glaister as well as by the others present at ceremony together with newspapers and coins of the realm. The tower is high and stands an average of above sea level. It was built of local sandstone topped by a lantern that was originally destined for Gibraltar It was provided with a large (first-order) catadioptric optic, supplied by Chance Brothers & Co., with a single lamp, supplied by Messrs. W. Wilkins & Co. of Long Acre. The optic included a 'dioptric mirror' (i.e. a set of double-reflecting prisms) which redirected light from the landward side of the lamp back out to sea. The new lighthouse was still under construction in late November 1866 when Henry Norris was sued by a painter in court in Whitehaven who had not been paid for lettering a notice board at the lighthouse; but it was operational by the end of the year. By the 1890s it was displaying a group-occulting light, on the following pattern: visible for 24 seconds, eclipsed for 2 seconds, visible for 2 seconds, eclipsed for 2 seconds; the light could be seen up to out to sea. From 1913 an explosive fog signal was sounded from the lighthouse; it remained operational into the second half of the century.Admiralty Chart, 1925, 1955 In the interwar period the lighthouse was used as a turning marker in the London to Isle of Man air races.Details from a St Bees website During World War II the local Home Guard used it to practise defence/attack strategies although there is no record of ammunition being fired at it.Details from the BBC's \\"People's War\\" website The light was electrified in the mid-1950s. In the early 1960s a triple-frequency Tannoy electric fog signal was provided, in a detached building very close to the edge of the cliff. In 1987 the light was fully electrified, giving a beam of 134,000 candela which can be seen away. It was also de-manned and automated at this time: the light was then one of five to be remotely monitored from the Trinity House depot at Holyhead. In 1999 the light was further modernised, after which it was monitored from the Trinity House Planning Centre in Harwich. It flashes twice every 20 seconds. The fog signal has been discontinued; it used to sound two blasts every 45 seconds.

He worked primarily in the films of John Waters, designing the costumes and make-up for every John Waters film from 1972 to 2004. Because of his work with Waters, he is considered one of the Dreamlanders, Waters' ensemble of regular cast and crew members. The first John Waters film Smith worked on was Pink Flamingos (1972), for which he designed the costumes and make-up for the film's star, female-impersonating actor Divine, as well as the rest of the cast. In this film Smith, along with Waters, created the famous look for Divine which included a white clown face base and a shaved-back hairline with the eyebrows drawn on the upper forehead. Waters said he wanted Divine's make-up to look like a cross between Jayne Mansfield and Clarabell the Clown. This was followed by Smith's work on Female Trouble (1974), which featured a cast of flamboyant criminals and hairdressers whose costumes are overtly tacky and whose make-up is extreme. For Divine's wedding scene in the film, Smith designed a see-through wedding dress for the 300 lb. bride. Smith went on to create the look for the grotesque citizens of Mortville in Desperate Living (1977). In Waters' next seven films, Smith demonstrated the ability to create interesting looks for characters with big personalities but more conventional appearances as Waters' movies became more mainstream. Smith died of a heart attack in Marianna, Florida on December 5, 2006.

Vehicle recycling is the dismantling of vehicles for spare parts. At the end of their useful life, vehicles have value as a source of spare parts and this has created a vehicle dismantling industry. The industry has various names for its business outlets including wrecking yard, auto dismantling yard, car spare parts supplier, and recently, auto or vehicle recycling. Vehicle recycling has always occurred to some degree but in recent years manufacturers have become involved in the process. A car crusher is often used to reduce the size of the scrapped vehicle for transportation to a steel mill. Approximately 12-15 million vehicles reach the end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill. The shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials. Currently, 75% of the materials can be recycled, with the remaining 25% ending up in landfill.End- of-Life Vehicle Recycling in the European Union As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel. Process Scrap vehicles at Barry Docks The process of recycling a vehicle is extremely complicated as there are many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove. Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts. The wheels and tires, battery and catalytic converter are removed. Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed. Certain high value parts such as electronic modules, alternators, starter motors, infotainment systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold on; either in \\"as-is\\" used condition or to a remanufacturer for restoration. This process of removing higher value parts from the lower value vehicle body shell has traditionally been done by hand. A labour intensive process, that has meant it is uneconomical to remove many of the parts. A technique that is on the rise is the mechanical removal of these higher value parts via machine based vehicle recycling systems (VRS). An excavator or materials handler equipped with a special attachment allows these materials to be removed quickly and efficiently. Increasing the amount of material that is recycled and increasing the value the vehicle dismantler receives from an end-of-life vehicle (ELV). Other hazardous materials such as mercury, and sodium azide (the propellant used in air bags) may also be removed. After all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner evaporator and heater core, and wiring harnesses. The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal. Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling. Benefits Recycling steel saves energy and natural resources. The steel industry saves enough energy to power about 18 million households for a year, on a yearly basis. Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent less energy than making metal. Thus, recyclers of end-of-life vehicles save an estimated 85 million barrels of oil annually that would have been used in the manufacturing of other parts. Likewise, car recycling keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of landfills and back in consumer use. Before the 2003 model year, some vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock braking systems. Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the environment. In 2007, over 2100 pounds of mercury were collected by 6265 recyclers. Policies Car scrapyard in Grimsby, UK =European Union= In 1997, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Directive which aims at making vehicle dismantling and recycling more environmentally friendly by setting clear targets for the recycling of vehicles. This proposal encouraged many in Europe to consider the environmental impact of end-of-life vehicles. In September 2000, the End of Life Vehicles Directive was officially adopted by the EP and Council. Over the next decade, more legislation would be adopted in order to clarify legal aspects, national practices, and recommendations.Waste - Environment - European Commission A number of vehicle manufacturers collaborated on developing the International Dismantling Information System to meet the legal obligations of the End of Life Vehicles Directive. In 2018 the EC published a study Assessment of ELV Directive with emphasis on the end of life vehicles of unknown whereabouts. This study demonstrates that each year the whereabouts of 3 to 4 million ELVs across the EU is unknown and that the stipulation in the ELV Directive are not sufficient to monitor the performance of single Member States for this aspect. The study proposed and assessed a number of options to improve the legal provisions of the ELV Directive. =United States= On 2 July 2009 and for the next 55 days, the Car Allowance Rebate System, or ‚ÄúCash for Clunkers‚Äù, was an attempt at a green initiative by the United States Government in order to stimulate automobile sales and improve the average fuel economy of the United States. Many cars ended up being destroyed and recycled in order to fulfill the program, and even some exotic cars were crushed.Ten Most Exotic Cars Destroyed By Cash For Clunkers Ultimately, as carbon footprints are of concern, some will argue that the ‚ÄúCash for Clunkers‚Äù did not reduce many owners‚Äô carbon footprints. A lot of carbon dioxide is added into the atmosphere to make new cars. It is calculated that if someone traded in an 18 mpg clunker for a 22 mpg new car, it would take five and a half years of typical driving to offset the new car‚Äôs carbon footprint. That same number increases to eight or nine years for those who bought trucks.Critics Say 'Clunkers' Program Isn't Very Green : NPR If a vehicle is abandoned on the roadside or in empty lots, licensed dismantlers in the United States can legally obtain them so that they are safely converted into reusable or recycled commodities.

During the first year of the campaign, the Japanese Army (with aid from Thai Phayap Army and Burmese insurgents) drove British Empire and Chinese forces out of Burma, then began the Japanese occupation of Burma and formed a nominally independent Burmese administrative government. Background =British rule in Burma= Before the Second World War broke out, Burma was part of the British Empire, having been progressively occupied and annexed following three Anglo-Burmese wars in the 19th century. Initially governed as part of British India, Burma was formed into a separate colony under the Government of India Act 1935. Under British rule, there had been substantial economic development but the majority Bamar community was becoming increasingly restive.Allen, pp.13‚Äì15 Among their concerns were the importation of Indian workers to provide a labour force for many of the new industries, and the erosion of traditional society in the countryside as land was used for plantations of export crops or became mortgaged to Indian moneylenders.Allen, p.9 Pressure for independence was growing.Bayly and Harper, pp.81‚Äì96 When Burma came under attack, the Bamar were unwilling to contribute to the defence of the British establishment, and many readily joined movements which aided the Japanese. British plans for the defence of British Far Eastern possessions involved the construction of airfields linking Singapore and Malaya with India. These plans had not taken into account the fact that Britain was also at war with Germany, and when Japan entered the war, the forces needed to defend these possessions were not available. Burma had been regarded as a military \\"backwater\\", unlikely to be subjected to Japanese threat.Jackson, pp.387‚Äì388 Lieutenant General Thomas Hutton, the commander of Burma Army with its headquarters in Rangoon, had only the 17th Indian Infantry Division and 1st Burma Division to defend the country, although help was expected from the Chinese Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek. During the war, the British Indian Army expanded more than twelve-fold from its peacetime strength of 200,000 but in late 1941 this expansion meant that most units were undertrained and ill-equipped. In most cases, such training and equipment as the Indian units in Burma received was for operations in the Western Desert campaign or the North West Frontier of India, rather than jungles. The battalions of the Burma Rifles which formed most of the 1st Burma Division were originally raised as internal security troops only, from among minority communities in Burma such as the Karens. They also had been rapidly expanded, with an influx of Bamar soldiers, and were short of equipment and consisted mainly of new recruits. =Japanese plans= Japan entered the war primarily to obtain raw materials, especially oil, from European (particularly Dutch) possessions in South East Asia which were weakly defended because of the war in Europe. Their plans involved an attack on Burma partly because of Burma's own natural resources (which included some oil from fields around Yenangyaung, but also minerals such as cobalt and large surpluses of rice), but also to protect the flank of their main attack against Malaya and Singapore and provide a buffer zone to protect the territories they intended to occupy.Allen, pp.6‚Äì7 An additional factor was the Burma Road completed in 1938, which linked Lashio, at the end of a railway from the port of Rangoon, with the Chinese province of Yunnan. This newly completed link was being used to move aid and munitions to the Chinese Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-Shek which had been fighting the Japanese for several years. The Japanese naturally wished to cut this link.Bayly and Harper, pp.3, 8, 14 The Southern Expeditionary Army Group under overall command of Hisaichi Terauchi was responsible for all military operations in the South-East Asia. The Japanese Fifteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Shojiro Iida, was initially assigned the mission of occupying northern Thailand, which had signed a treaty of friendship with Japan on 21 December 1941, and attacking the southern Burmese province of Tenasserim across the Tenasserim Hills. The army consisted of the highly regarded 33rd Division and the 55th Division, although both divisions were weakened for several weeks by detachments to other operations. =Burmese insurgents= As the threat of war grew, the Japanese sought links with potential allies in Burma. In late 1940 Aung San, a Burmese student activist, made contact with Suzuki Keiji in Amoy and was flown to Japan for talks. He and several other volunteers (the Thirty Comrades) were later given intensive military training on Hainan Island. The Burma Independence Army was officially founded in Bangkok, Thailand on 28 December 1941. It consisted initially of 227 Burmese and 74 Japanese personnel.Bayly and Harper (2005), p.174 but was rapidly reinforced by large numbers of volunteers and recruits once they crossed into Burma as part of the main Japanese invasion. Japanese capture of Rangoon View of bomb damage in Rangoon after the Japanese aerial attack in December 1941 The first Japanese attack on 14 December 1941, against Victoria Point, almost the most southerly point of Burma, was expected and was not contested. The second attack was a small probing raid directed at a police station in southern Tenasserim, which was repulsed. The Japanese 143 Infantry Regiment (from 55th Division) then launched overland attacks on the airfields at Tavoy and Mergui in Tenasserim. The airfields were difficult to defend and reinforce, but Burma Army HQ had been ordered to hold these outposts because of their importance to the defence of Malaya. The Japanese forced their way over the steep jungle-covered Tenasserim Range, and attacked Tavoy on 18 January. The defenders, the 3rd and 6th battalions of the Burma Rifles, were overwhelmed and forced to evacuate the town in disorder. Mergui was evacuated before it was attacked. Rangoon was initially defended relatively successfully against Japanese air raids, by small RAF detachments reinforced by a squadron of the American Volunteer Group, better known as the \\"Flying Tigers\\". The majority of the airfields were between Rangoon and the Axis advance and as the Japanese gained use of the airfields in Tenasserim, the amount of warning the Rangoon airfields could get of attack decreased, and they became more and more untenable. On 22 January 1942, the main body of the Japanese 55th Division began the main attack westward from Rahaeng in Thailand across the Kawkareik Pass. The 16th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 17th Indian Division guarding this approach retreated hastily westward. The Japanese division advanced to Moulmein at the mouth of the Salween River which was garrisoned by the 2nd Burma Infantry Brigade. The position was almost impossible to defend, and had the River Salween, almost wide, behind it. The 2nd Burma Brigade was squeezed into a progressively tighter perimeter, and eventually retreated over the river by ferry on 31 January after abandoning a large amount of supplies and equipment. Part of the force was left behind in Moulmein and had to swim the river.Allen, pp.24‚Äì35 =Sittang Bridge= The 17th Indian Division fell back northward. They attempted to hold the Bilin River and other fallback lines as they did so, but had too few troops to avoid being continually outflanked. The division eventually retreated toward the bridge over the Sittang River in general disorder. The retreat was delayed by incidents such as a vehicle breaking through the bridge deck, air attacks (including, allegedly, accidental attacks by the RAF and AVG), and Japanese harassment.Allen, pp.648‚Äì650 The delays allowed Japanese parties to infiltrate to the bridge itself, and the poorly organised defence of the bridge was in danger of collapsing. Fearing that the bridge would fall intact to the Japanese who would use it to advance on Rangoon, the divisional commander, Major-General \\"Jackie\\" Smyth, VC, ordered it to be blown up on the morning of 23 February 1942, with most of the division stranded on the enemy-held side.Allen, p. 3 Many of the men of the 17th Division who were trapped on the Japanese-held side of the river made their way across to the west bank by swimming or on improvised rafts, but had to abandon almost all their equipment, including most of their small arms. This later led some to question the decision to blow the bridge, arguing that the river itself did not offer much of an obstacle to the Japanese, and that more harm than good was achieved, as it resulted in the stranding of two brigades and delayed the Japanese capture of Rangoon by ten days at most. =Fall of Rangoon= Though the Sittang River was in theory a strong defensive position, the disaster at the bridge left the Allied forces too weak to hold it. General Archibald Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the ABDA Command, nevertheless ordered Rangoon to be held. He was expecting substantial reinforcements from the Middle East, including an Australian infantry division. On 28 February, he formally relieved Hutton (although Hutton had officially already been superseded in command by General Harold Alexander), and on the following day he sacked Smyth, who was in any case very ill.Allen, pp.48‚Äì49 Although the Australian government refused to allow its troops to be committed to Burma, some British and Indian reinforcements, including the British 7th Armoured Brigade (equipped with new M3 Stuart tanks)Zaloga, Steven. \\"M3 and M5 Stuart Light Tank 1940‚Äì45\\". Osprey Publishing, 18 Nov 1999. p. 14. and the 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade, landed in Rangoon. Alexander ordered counter-attacks against the Japanese at Pegu, northeast of Rangoon, but soon realised that there was no hope of defending Rangoon. On 7 March, the Burma Army evacuated Rangoon after implementing a scorched earth plan to deny the Japanese the use of its facilities. The port was destroyed and the oil terminal was blown up. As the Allies departed, the city was on fire. The remnants of the Burma Army faced encirclement as they retreated north from the city, but broke through the Taukkyan Roadblock as the result of an error on the part of the local Japanese commander. Colonel Takanobu Sakuma, commanding the Japanese 214th Infantry Regiment, had been ordered to block the main road north from Rangoon to Prome while the main body of the 33rd Division circled round the city to attack from the west. The retreating British and Indian troops were thrown back when they attempted to break through Sakuma's road block. Alexander ordered another attack but found the Japanese had gone. Not realising that the British were evacuating Rangoon, Sakuma had withdrawn the road block, as ordered, once the 33rd Division reached its intended positions.Allen, pp.54‚Äì56 Had he not done so, the Japanese might have captured General Alexander and much of the rest of the Burma Army. Japanese advance to the Salween and Chindwin Electrical equipment and oil installations at Yenanguang being destroyed as part of the \\"scorched earth\\" policy, in the face of the Japanese advance After the fall of Rangoon, the Allies tried to make a stand in central Burma. It was hoped that the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma, commanded by Luo Zhuoying and consisting of the Fifth Army (commanded by Du Yuming) and the Sixth and Sixty- sixth Armies, could hold a front south of Mandalay. The Chinese armies each had approximately the strength of a British division but comparatively little equipment. Meanwhile, the newly created Burma Corps which had been formed to relieve Burma Army headquarters of the day-to-day responsibility for operations and consisted of 1st Burma Division, 17th Indian Division and 7th Armoured Brigade, defended the Irrawaddy River valley. Supplies were not immediately a problem, as much war material (including material originally meant for shipment to China) had been evacuated from Rangoon, rice was plentiful and the oilfields in central Burma were still intact, but no proper land routes from India existed and only the recapture of Rangoon would allow the Allies to hold Burma indefinitely. The Allies hoped that the Japanese advance would slow down; instead, it gained speed. The Japanese reinforced their two divisions in Burma with the 18th Division transferred from Malaya and the 56th Division transferred from the Dutch East Indies after the fall of Singapore and Java. They also brought in large numbers of captured British trucks and other vehicles, which allowed them to move supplies rapidly using southern Burma's road network, and also use Motorised infantry columns, particularly against the Chinese forces. The Royal Air Force wing operating from Magwe was crippled by the withdrawal of the radar and radio-intercept units to IndiaBayly and Harper, p.174 and the Japanese soon gained supremacy in the air. Unopposed Japanese bomber fleets attacked almost every major town and city in the Allied-held part of Burma, causing widespread destruction and disorder. The rapidly expanding Burma Independence Army harassed the Allied forces, while many Bamar soldiers of the Burma Rifles were deserting. The Allies were also hampered by the progressive breakdown of the civil government in the areas they held, and the large numbers of refugees. The flow of refugees began soon after the bombing of Rangoon in late December 1941 and increased to a \\"mass exodus\\" in February 1942 as the Indian (and Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese) population of Burma fled to India, fearing both the Japanese and hostile Burmese. Middle-class Indians and mixed-race refugees could often afford to buy tickets on ships or even planes, while ordinary labourers and their families in many cases were forced to make their way on foot.Bayley and Harper (2004), p.168 The commander of Burma Corps, Lieutenant General William Slim, tried to mount a counter-offensive on the western part of the front, but his troops were repeatedly outflanked and forced to fight their way out of encirclement. The corps was gradually pushed northward towards Mandalay. The 1st Burma Division was cut off and trapped in the blazing oilfields at Yenangyaung, which the Allies themselves demolished to deny the facilities to the Japanese. Although the division was rescued by Chinese infantry and British tanks in the Battle of Yenangyaung, it lost almost all its equipment and its cohesion. On the eastern part of the front, in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road, the Chinese 200th Division held up the Japanese for a time around Toungoo, but after its fall the road was open for motorised troops of the Japanese 56th Division to shatter the Chinese Sixth Army to the east in the Karenni States and advance northward through the Shan States to capture Lashio, outflanking the Allied defensive lines and cutting off the Chinese armies from Yunnan. With the effective collapse of the entire defensive line, there was little choice left other than an overland retreat to India or to Yunnan. =Allied retreat= Japanese advance and Allied retreat The retreat was conducted in horrible circumstances. Starving refugees, disorganised stragglers, and the sick and wounded clogged the primitive roads and tracks leading to India. At least 500,000 civilian fugitives reached India, while an unknown number, conservatively estimated between 10,000 and 50,000, died along the way. In later months, 70 to 80% of those who reached India were afflicted with diseases such as dysentery, smallpox, malaria or cholera, with 30% \\"desperately so\\". On 26 April the British, Indian and Burman forces joined the civilians in a full retreat. The Burma Corps retreated to Manipur in India. At one stage, Alexander proposed that the 7th Armoured Brigade and one infantry brigade accompany the Chinese armies into Yunnan, but he was persuaded that the armoured brigade would quickly become ineffective once it was cut off from India. The Japanese tried to cut off Burma Corps by sending troops by boat up the Chindwin River to seize the riverside port of Monywa on the night of 1/2 May.Allen, pp. 74‚Äì76 The hastily reconstituted 1st Burma Division was unable to recapture Monywa, but allowed the rest of the Corps to withdraw to the north.Slim (1956), p.101 As the Corps tried to cross to the west bank of the Chindwin by ramshackle ferries to Kalewa, on 10 May the Japanese advancing from Monywa attempted to surround them in a \\"basin\\" encircled by cliffs at Shwegyin on the east bank. Although counter-attacks allowed the troops to escape, most of the Burma Corps' remaining equipment had to be destroyed or abandoned.Slim, pp.107‚Äì111 Burma Corps reached Imphal in Manipur just before the monsoon broke in May 1942. The ad hoc Burma Corps HQ was disbanded and IV Corps HQ, which had recently arrived in India, took over the front. The troops found themselves living out in the open under the torrential monsoon rains in extremely unhealthy circumstances. The army and civil authorities in India were very slow to respond to the needs of the troops and civilian refugees. Although the front-line units had maintained some semblance of order, many improvised units and rear-area troops had dissolved into a disorderly rout.Slim (1956), p.118 The troops were in an alarming state, with \\"hair-raising stories of atrocities and sufferings\\". The British Civil Government of Burma had meanwhile fallen back to Myitkyina in Northern Burma, accompanied by many British, Anglo-Indian and Indian civilians. The Governor (Reginald Dorman-Smith) and the most influential civilians were flown out from Myitkyina Airfield, with some of the sick and injured.Bayly and Harper, pp.177‚Äì178 The majority of the refugees at Myitkyina were forced to make their way to India via the unhealthy Hukawng Valley and the precipitous forested Patkai Range. Many died on the way, and when they reached India, there were several instances in which civil authorities allowed white and Eurasian civilians to continue while preventing Indians from proceeding, effectively condemning many to death.Bayly and Harper, pp.187‚Äì188 By contrast, many private individuals such as the Assam Tea Planters Association did their best to provide aid. The Japanese advance cut off many of the Chinese troops from China. Many of them also retreated via the Hukawng Valley route and subsisted largely by looting, further increasing the misery of the refugees. The Chinese 38th Division however, commanded by Sun Li-jen, fought its way westward across the Chindwin, arriving in India substantially intact although with heavy casualties.Slim, p.115 The 23,000Bayley and Harper (2004), p.196 Chinese soldiers who had retreated into India were put under the command of the American General Joseph Stilwell, who had also made his way to India on foot, and were concentrated in camps at Ramgarh in Bihar. After recuperating they were re-equipped and retrained by American instructors. The remaining Chinese troops tried to return to Yunnan through remote mountainous forests but many died on the way. =Halt to operations= The Japanese 18th and 56th Divisions pursued the Chinese into Yunnan, but were ordered to halt on the Salween River on 26 April.Allen, p.72 The Japanese 33rd Division likewise halted on the Chindwin at the end of May, ending the campaign until the end of the monsoon rains. In the coastal Arakan Province, some of the Burma Independence Army reached Akyab Island before the Japanese troops. However, they also instigated riots between the Buddhist and Muslim populations of the province.Bayly and Harper, p.172 The Japanese advance in Arakan ended just south of the Indian frontier, prompting the British military and civil authorities in and around Chittagong to implement a premature \\"scorched earth\\" policy which contributed to the Bengal Famine of 1943. Shan States On 21 December 1941, Thailand had signed a military alliance with Japan. On 21 March 1942, the Japanese agreed that Kayah State and the Shan States were to be under Thai control. The leading elements of the Thai Phayap Army crossed the border into the Shan States on 10 May 1942. Three Thai infantry divisions and one cavalry division, supported by the Royal Thai Air Force, captured Kengtung on 27 May. The opposition had been the 93rd Division of the National Revolutionary Army, which was already cut off by the Japanese advance to the Salween River and was retreating. On 12 July, a Thai division began to occupy Kayah State. They drove the Chinese 55th Division from Loikaw, taking many prisoners. The Thais remained in control of the Shan States for the remainder of the war. Their troops suffered from shortage of supplies and disease, but were not subjected to Allied attacks. Panglong, a Chinese Muslim town in British Burma, was entirely destroyed by the Japanese invaders in their invasion of Burma. The Hui Muslim Ma Guanggui became the leader of the Hui Panglong self-defense guard created by Su, who was sent by the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China. The Japanese burned Panglong, driving out the over 200 Hui households out as refugees. Yunnan and Kokang received the refugees from Panglong. One of Ma Guanggui's nephews was Ma Yeye, a son of Ma Guanghua and he narrated the history of Panglong including the Japanese attack.Wen-Chin Chang, p.122 An account of the Japanese attack on the Hui in Panglong was written and published in 1998 by a Hui from Panglong called \\"Panglong Booklet\\".Wen-Chin Chang, p.124 The Japanese attack caused the Hui Mu family to seek refuge in Panglong but they were driven out again to Yunnan when the Japanese attacked Panglong.Wen-Chin Chang, pp.129- See also *Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate ‚Äì a landmark 1965 court case on the scope of prerogative power arising from the invasion Notes References     Further reading * Carew, Tim.

It lists infantry divisions in the Soviet Union from the 1917 Revolution to the reorganisation of the Soviet Army in the aftermath of the Stalinist era. Mechanised Divisions were formed during 1945‚Äì46, and then all remaining Rifle Divisions were converted to Motor Rifle Divisions in 1957. Divisions of the Russian Civil War Many infantry (pekhotniye), literally 'movement', and rifle (strelkoviye), literally 'sharpshooter', divisions were inherited by the Workers-Peasants Army from the former Imperial Russian Army, but were renamed in the spirit of the Revolutionary times, often with names including words such as \\"Proletariat\\", \\"workers and peasants\\", or other titles that differentiated them from the past. They employed some of the 48,000 former Tsarist officers and 214,000 Tsarist NCOs along with over 10,000 administrative personnel. Initially the new Bolshevik rifle divisions were composed of rifle brigades, and included: :two or three brigades of two regiments each :an artillery brigade :a cavalry regiment :a communications battalion :a reconnaissance company :an engineer battalion :an air (balloon) detachment (otryad) :an aviation group (aircraft) :rear services The division was to have an establishment of 26,972, with 14,220 combat troops, and depended on 10,048 horses to manoeuvre. Due to difficulties with recruiting volunteers into the armed forces early in the Russian Civil War, conscription was introduced on 29 May 1918, and all infantry divisions were renamed into rifle divisions on 11 October 1918. The first six of the 11 formed divisions were those formed in the Petrograd, Moscow, Orel, Yaroslav, Privolzhsk and Ural okrugs. However, the divisions were initially only numbered, eventually 1st through to 47th by 1919. Five of these divisions were also named.

Fought in the Donbass, May 1919. Left the RKKA and became the core of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (RIAU), August 1919. The establishment and organisation of the divisions (N 220/34) had changed by the end of 1918 to increase the number of regiments in brigades to three, while eliminating the artillery brigade headquarters, leaving the nine artillery battalions (known as divizions) and one horse artillery battery to be allocated to rifle brigades. An armoured auto detachment (otryad) was also instituted. By 1921 the establishment of the rifle division had changed substantially in accordance with TO&E; N 1400/246 for peace-time, with two brigades and only 15,876 personnel, and the reduction of artillery to two battalions and one battery, and the cavalry from four to three squadron regiment. From 10 June 1922 the organisation of rifle divisions war changed from brigade to regiment structure, with three regiments in each. The establishment of divisions stationed in the border areas was reduced to 8,705 personnel, and those in the interior regions to 6,725, including the reduction to a single cavalry squadron. The number of divisions was increased to 49. Divisions of the interwar years Due to increasing economic difficulties in the post-war USSR, the armed forces were substantially reduced, and from 8 August 1923 transferred to the territorial system of organisation. All divisions were reduced to an establishment of 1,437 permanent cadre and 8,084 conscripted personnel. These new divisions were initially called militia-rifle divisions (), and later were renamed territorial-militia divisions (). However, despite reduction in number of service personnel, the number of territorial-militia divisions quadrupled by summer 1928. The territorial principle of manning the Red Army was introduced in the mid-1920s. In each region able-bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in territorial unit, which comprised about half the Army's strength, each year, for five years. The first call-up period was for three months, with one month a year thereafter. A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus. By 1925 this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions. The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two-year stints. Most of the divisions that participated in the Russian Civil War were disbanded by 1927, however, Leon Trotsky initiated a formation of the new armed force with a professional cadre which was supported in its evolution even after his departure from Soviet Union. The reform in the rifle forces that begun in 1924 did create some notable changes, including commencement of adding names to the regular and newly formed territorial divisions, and creation of national divisions, notably one Belarus, four Ukrainian, two Georgian, one Armenian, and one Azerbaijanian divisions. In 1928 1st and 3rd Turkestan, and in 1929 an Azerbaijanian divisions were reorganised as mountain-rifle divisions. Of the 70 rifle division, 41 were now territorial in their establishment. During the 1930s the RKKA infantry forces were not only expanded, but also substantially reorganised, in part due to substantial input of military theorists into their doctrinal development, such as that of Mikhail Tukhachevsky who's 1934 report to the Defence Committee included 13 types of infantry division divisions. On 31 January 1935 the Committee decreed adoption of a single 13 thousand personnel peace-time establishment for a rifle division which included: :three rifle regiments :one artillery regiment: :one tank battalion (mixed) :separate reconnaissance battalion (light tank company, cavalry squadron and SP artillery battery) :communications battalion :separate anti-aircraft machine-gun company :sapper company :aviation flight :rear services This structure more than double the number of combat personnel in the division from the 1929 establishment of 20.2% to 41.7%. In May 1937 the military commissars were added to the establishment of all RKKA military forces. On 29 November 1937 four types of structures for rifle forces were established: :Far Eastern District divisions ‚Äì 10,000 establishment :Cadre divisions ‚Äì 7,000 (6950) establishment :Cadre mountain divisions ‚Äì 4,000 establishment :Cadre territorial divisions ‚Äì 6,000 (5,220) establishment. These lacked the communications, reconnaissance and sapper battalions. The territorial system was reorganised, with all remaining formations converted to 'cadre' divisions, in 1937 and 1938, with the cadre divisions retaining one territorial regiment until reorganisation that followed 1938 restructuring of all armed forces. Kamchatka and Sakhalin divisions were also added in the wake of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Border Wars. By 1938 there were plans to increase the number of rifle divisions in the RKKA from 98 to 173. These would include: :17 rifle divisions with 14 thousand personnel :1 rifle divisions with 12 thousand personnel (TO&E; 04/400) :33 rifle divisions with 8,900 personnel (TO&E; 04/100) :76 rifle divisions with 6 thousand personnel (TO&E; 04/120) :33 rifle divisions with 3 thousand personnel :13 mountain-rifle divisions with 4 thousand personnel The wartime strength of the new rifle division that was intended to include two artillery regiments was to have 18 thousand personnel, but none had been brought up to this strength by 1941. Divisions of the Second World War Two events shaped the evolution of the RKKA rifle divisions during the initial period of the Second World War: the decision in 1938 to reorganise the Army, in part due to and following the repressions of the officer corps in 1937, and the 1939 campaign in Poland, and later war against Finland. In the course of the Second World War the Soviet Union's Red Army raised over four hundred and fifty numbered rifle divisions (infantry). Usually the rifle divisions were controlled by the higher headquarters of the rifle corps. But scores of these formations were reformed several times; the total number of divisional formations formed may have been as high as 2,000, according to Craig Crofoot. On 22 June 1941 the Red Army had 103 divisions in the western military districts, of which 70 were organised according to peace-time TO&E; 04/100 with 10-thousand bayonet strength (actual number of rifles 7,818), but brought up to the 12-thousand strength (TO&E; 04/400), with another six at the 11-thousand strength. Another 78 rifle divisions in the interior military districts were organised according to peace-time TO&E; 04/120 6-thousand (5,864) bayonet strength (actual number of rifles 3,685). The wartime organisation of the RKKA rifle division was 14-thousand (14,483) with 10,420 rifles, but only 20 western border divisions had been brought up to this establishment when the war begun. Zaloga notes that the Red Army formed at least 42 'national' divisions during the Second World War, including four Azeri, five Armenian, and eight Georgian rifle divisions and a large number of cavalry divisions in Central Asia, including five Uzbek cavalry divisions. =Note on Designations= During the war, many divisions were formed, destroyed or otherwise disbanded, and reformed several times: A notional example, using imaginary designations, runs: \\"The 501st Rifle Division (1st formation), readiness category B organised to 1937 tables may have been disbanded at Vyazma in 1941, and a new 501st Division (2nd formation), readiness category A organised on 1942 tables formed in Rostov thousands of km away, then renamed 200th Guards Rifle Division in 1944, and a new 501st (3rd formation), readiness category A organised to 1944 tables division formed in Minsk\\".

It contains four regions (A, B1, B2, and B3), named in order of their effect on plasmid stability. The A-Domain is highly conserved, any mutation abolishes origin function. Mutations on B1, B2, and B3 will diminish, but not prevent functioning of the origin. Element A is highly conserved, consisting of the consensus sequence: (where Y is either pyrimidine and R is either purine). When this element is mutated, the ARS loses all activity. As seen above the ARS are considerably A-T rich which makes it easy for replicative proteins to disrupt the H-bonding in that area. ORC protein complex (origin recognition complex) is bound at the ARS throughout the cell cycle, allowing replicative proteins access to the ARS. Mutational analysis for the yeast ARS elements have shown that any mutation in the B1, B2 and B3 regions result in a reduction of function of the ARS element. A mutation in the A region results in a complete loss of function. Melting of DNA occurs within domain B2, induced by attachment of ARS binding factor 1 to B3. A1 and B1 domain binds with origin recognition complex. To identify these sequences, yeast mutants unable to synthesize histidine were transformed with plasmids containing the His gene and random fragments of the yeast genome. If the genome fragment contained an origin of replication, cells were able to grow in a medium lacking histidine. These sequences were termed autonomously replicating sequences, because they were replicated and inherited by progeny without integrating into the host chromosome.

The default blend mode in most applications is simply to obscure the lower layer by covering it with whatever is present in the top layer (see alpha compositing). However, as each pixel has a numerical representation, there exist a large number of ways to blend two layers. Most graphics editing programs like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP allow the user to modify the basic blend modes, e.g. by applying different levels of opacity to the top \\"layer\\". The top \\"layer\\" is not necessarily a layer in the application; it may be applied with a painting or editing tool. The top \\"layer\\" can also be referred to as the \\"blend layer\\" or \\"active layer\\". In the formulas shown on this page, values go from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white). Normal blend mode This is the standard blend mode which uses the top layer alone, without mixing its colors with the layer beneath it: : f(a, b) = b where a is the value of a color channel in the underlying layer, and b is that of the corresponding channel of the upper layer. The result is most typically merged into the bottom layer using \\"simple\\" (b over a) alpha compositing (making the actual formula f(a, b) = alpha(b, a)), but other Porter-Duff operations are possible. The compositing step results in the top layer's shape, as defined by its alpha channel, appearing over the bottom layer. Dissolve The dissolve mode takes random pixels from both layers. With top layer opacity greater than that of the bottom layer, most pixels are taken from the top layer, while with low opacity most pixels are taken from the bottom layer. No anti-aliasing is used with this blend mode, so the pictures may look grainy and harsh. Adobe Photoshop generates a pseudo-random noise dither pattern on startup, with each pixel location in a 2D raster array assigned a gray value (R=G=B) and an alpha value of 1 (‚Äúon‚Äù). As the opacity of the top layer is reduced, the alpha value of some of the gray pixels is switched from 1 to 0 (\\"off\\"), with the result that image pixels corresponding to a gray-valued pixel in the raster array are either on (visible, opaque) or off (invisible, transparent), with no opacity gradation. Multiply and Screen Multiply and Screen blend modes are basic blend modes for darkening and lightening images, respectively. There are several different combinations of them like Overlay or Soft Light (mentioned further down) and Vivid Light, Linear Light and Pin Light. =Multiply= Multiply blend mode multiplies the RGB channel numbers for each pixel from the top layer with the values for the corresponding pixel from the bottom layer. The result is always a darker picture; since each value is less than 1, their product will be less than either of the initial values. f(a,b) = ab, where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value. This mode is symmetric: exchanging two layers does not change the result. If the two layers contain the same picture, multiply blend mode is equivalent to a quadratic curve, or gamma correction with Œ≥=2. For image editing it is sometimes more convenient to simply go to the Curves dialog of the software, as it gives more flexibility in the shape of the curves. Or one can use Levels dialogue ‚Äî the middle number is usually 1/Œ≥, so one can just type 0.5. If one layer contains a homogeneous color, for example the gray color (0.8, 0.8, 0.8), multiply blend mode is equivalent to a curve which is simply a straight line. This is also equivalent to using this gray value as opacity when doing ‚Äúnormal mode‚Äù blend with black bottom layer. =Screen= With Screen blend mode the values of the pixels in the two layers are inverted, multiplied, and then inverted again. This yields the opposite effect to multiply, and results in a brighter picture. f(a,b) = 1 - (1 - a)(1 - b), where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value. This mode is symmetric: exchanging two layers does not change the result. If one layer contains a homogeneous gray, Screen blend mode is equivalent to using this gray value as opacity when doing ‚Äúnormal mode‚Äù blend with white top layer. File:Blend modes 1.-top-layer.jpg|Example top layer File:Blend modes 2.-bottom-layer.jpgExample bottom layer File:Blend modes 4.-multiply.jpg|Multiply blend mode applied to the example pictures File:Blend modes 5.-screen.jpg|Screen blend mode applied to the example pictures =Overlay= Overlay combines Multiply and Screen blend modes. The parts of the top layer where the base layer is light become lighter, the parts where the base layer is dark become darker. Areas where the top layer are mid grey are unaffected. An overlay with the same picture looks like an S-curve. f(a,b) = \\\\begin{cases} 2 a b, &\\\\mbox{if } a < 0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 - 2 ( 1 - a ) ( 1 - b ), &\\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value. Depending on the value a of the base layer, one gets a linear interpolation between black (a=0), the top layer (a=0.5), and white (a=1). =Hard Light= Hard Light is also a combination of Multiply and Screen. Hard Light affects the blend layer's relationship to the base layer in the same way Overlay affects the base layer's relationship to the blend layer. The inverse relationship between Overlay and Hard Light makes them \\"commuted blend modes\\". =Soft Light= Comparison of soft light blend modes Soft light is most closely related to Overlay and is only similar to Hard Light by name. Applying pure black or white does not result in pure black or white. There are a variety of different methods of applying a soft light blend.http://gimp.1065349.n5.nabble.com/Image-processing-algorithms-resources- td34204.html All the flavors produce the same result when the top layer is pure black; same for when the top layer is pure neutral gray. The Photoshop and illusions.hu flavors also produce the same result when the top layer is pure white (the differences between these two are in how one interpolates between these 3 results). These three results coincide with gamma correction of the bottom layer with Œ≥=2 (for top black), unchanged bottom layer (or, what is the same, Œ≥=1) (for top neutral gray), and Œ≥=0.5 (for top white). The formula used by Photoshop as of 2012 has a discontinuity of local contrast, and other formulas correct it. Photoshop's formula is: : f_{photoshop}(a,b) = \\\\begin{cases} 2 a b + a^2 (1 - 2 b), &\\\\mbox{if } b < 0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 a (1 - b) + \\\\sqrt{a} (2 b - 1), &\\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value. Depending on b, one gets a linear interpolation between three gamma corrections: Œ≥=2 (for b=0), Œ≥=1 (for b=0.5), and Œ≥=0.5 (for b=1). Pegtop's formula is smoother and corrects the discontinuity at b = 0.5: : f_{pegtop}(a,b) = (1-2b)a^2 + 2ba. This is a linear interpolation between Multiply (for a=0) and Screen (for a=1) blend modes. It can also be seen as a linear interpolation between the gamma correction with Œ≥=2 (for b=0), and a certain tonal curve (for b=1). (The latter curve is equivalent to applying Œ≥=2 to the negative of image.) A third formula defined by illusions.hu corrects the discontinuity in a different way, doing gamma correction with Œ≥ depending on b: : f_{illusions.hu}(a, b) = a^{( 2^{2(0.5 - b)} )} For b=0, one still gets Œ≥=2, for b=0.5 one gets Œ≥=1, for b=1 one gets Œ≥=0.5, but it is not a linear interpolation between these 3 images. The formula specified by recent W3C drafts for SVG and Canvas is mathematically equivalent to the Photoshop formula with a small variation where b‚â•0.5 and a‚â§0.25: : f_{w3c}(a, b) = \\\\begin{cases} a - (1 - 2 b) \\\\cdot a \\\\cdot (1 - a) & \\\\text{if } b \\\\leq 0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a + (2 b - 1) \\\\cdot (g_{w3c}(a) - a) & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where : g_{w3c}(a) = \\\\begin{cases} ((16 a - 12) \\\\cdot a + 4) \\\\cdot a & \\\\text{if } a \\\\leq 0.25 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{a} & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} . This is also the formula used by Cairo, and in earlier PDF documentation. It is still a linear interpolation between 3 images for b=0, 0.5, 1. But now the image for b=1 is not Œ≥=0.5, but the result of a tonal curve which differs from the curve of Œ≥=0.5 for small values of a: while gamma correction with Œ≥=0.5 may increase the value of a many times, this new curve limits the increase of a by coefficient 4.  Dodge and burn  Dodge and burn change the lightness of the pictures, inspired by the dodging and burning performed in a darkroom. Dodging lightens an image, while burning darkens it. Dodging the image is the same as burning its negative (and vice versa). * Dodge modes: ** The Screen blend mode inverts both layers, multiplies them, and then inverts that result. ** The Color Dodge blend mode divides the bottom layer by the inverted top layer. This lightens the bottom layer depending on the value of the top layer: the brighter the top layer, the more its color affects the bottom layer. Blending any color with white gives white. Blending with black does not change the image. The operation is not invertible due to possible clipping of highlights. (The clipping happens in the same area as for the Linear Dodge.) When the top layer contains a homogeneous color, this effect is equivalent to changing the white point to the inverted color. The perceived contrast increases when there is no clipping. ** The Linear Dodge blend mode simply sums the values in the two layers (also known as additive blending). Blending with white gives white. Blending with black does not change the image. When the top layer contains a homogeneous color, this effect is equivalent to changing the output black point to this color, and (input) white point to the inverted color. The contrast is decreased when there is no clipping. ** Divide: Same as \\"Color Dodge\\", but blending with white does not change the image. File:Blend modes 5.-screen.jpg|Screen blend mode applied to the example pictures File:Blend modes 7.-colordodge.jpg|Color Dodge blend mode applied to the example pictures File:Blend modes 8.-lineardodge.jpg|Linear Dodge (Additive) blend mode applied to the example pictures * Burn modes: ** The Multiply mode simply multiplies each component in the two layers. ** The Color Burn mode divides the inverted bottom layer by the top layer, and then inverts the result. This darkens the top layer increasing the contrast to reflect the color of the bottom layer. The darker the bottom layer, the more its color is used. Blending with white produces no difference. When the top layer contains a homogeneous color, this effect is equivalent to changing the black point to the inverted color. The operation is not invertible due to possible clipping of shadows. The clipping happens in the same area as for the Linear Burn. ** The Linear Burn mode sums the value in the two layers and subtracts 1. This is the same as inverting each layer, adding them together (as in Linear Dodge), and then inverting the result. Blending with white leaves the image unchanged. * Vivid Light: this blend mode combines Color Dodge and Color Burn (rescaled so that neutral colors become middle gray). Dodge applies when values in the top layer are lighter than middle gray, and burn applies to darker values. The middle gray is the neutral color. When the top layer's color is lighter than this, this effectively moves the white point of the bottom layer down by twice the difference; when it is darker, the black point is moved up by twice the difference. (This increases the perceived contrast.) * Linear Light: this blend mode combines Linear Dodge and Linear Burn (rescaled so that neutral colors become middle gray). Dodge is applied when the value on the top layer is lighter than middle gray, and burn applies when the top layer value is darker. The calculation simplifies to the sum of the bottom layer and twice the top layer, subtract 1. This mode decreases the contrast. * Subtract: this blend mode sums the value in the two layers and subtracts 1. Unlike Linear Burn, blending with white affects the image. Simple arithmetic blend modes =Divide= This blend mode simply divides pixel values of one layer with the other, but it's useful for brightening photos if the color is on grey or less. It is also useful for removing a color tint from a photo. If you create a layer that is the color of the tint you wish to remove - such as a pale blue, for scenes that are too cool in color temperature - Divide mode will return that color to white in the resulting composite, as any value divided by itself equals 1.0 (white). =Addition= This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above 1 (in the case of RGB), white is displayed. \\"Linear Dodge\\" produces the same visual result. Since this always produces the same or lighter colors than the input it is also known as 'plus lighter'. A variant subtracts 1 from all end values, with values below 0 becoming black; this mode is known as 'plus darker'. =Subtract= This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed. =Difference= Difference subtracts the bottom layer from the top layer or the other way round, to always get a non- negative value. Blending with black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0. (The RGB value for black is (0,0,0).) Blending with white inverts the picture. One of the main utilities for this is during the editing process, when it can be used to verify alignment of pictures with similar content. Exclusion is a very similar blend mode with lower contrast. =Darken Only= Darken Only creates a pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. If the foreground pixel has the components , and the background has , the resultant pixel is : [\\\\min(r_1, r_2), \\\\min(g_1, g_2), \\\\min(b_1, b_2)] =Lighten Only= Lighten Only has the opposite action of Darken Only. It selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. The mathematical expression for Lighten Only is : [\\\\max(r_1, r_2), \\\\max(g_1, g_2), \\\\max(b_1, b_2)] Boolean arithmetic blend modes Rarely, applications such as Aviary's Peacock will supply boolean arithmetic blend modes. These combine the binary expansion of the hexadecimal color at each pixel of two layers using boolean logic gates. The top layer's alpha controls interpolation between the lower layer's image and the combined image. Hue, saturation and luminosity Photoshop's hue, saturation, color, and luminosity blend modes are based on a color space with hue, chroma and luma dimensions. Note: this space is different from both HSL and HSV, and only the hue dimension is shared between the three. See the article HSL and HSV for details. Unlike all of the previous blend modes described, which operate on each image channel independently, in each of these modes, some dimensions are taken from the bottom layer, while the remainder are taken from the top layer. Colors which end up out of gamut are brought inside by mapping along lines of constant hue and luma. This makes the operations uninvertible ‚Äì after a top layer has been applied in one of these blend modes, it is in some cases impossible to restore the appearance of the original (bottom) layer, even by applying a copy of the bottom layer in the same blend mode above both. * The Hue blend mode preserves the luma and chroma of the bottom layer, while adopting the hue of the top layer. * The Saturation blend mode preserves the luma and hue of the bottom layer, while adopting the chroma of the top layer. * The Color blend mode preserves the luma of the bottom layer, while adopting the hue and chroma of the top layer. * The Luminosity blend mode preserves the hue and chroma of the bottom layer, while adopting the luma of the top layer. Because these blend modes are based on a color space which is much closer than RGB to perceptually relevant dimensions, it can be used to correct the color of an image without altering perceived lightness, and to manipulate lightness contrast without changing the hue or chroma. The Luminosity mode is commonly used for image sharpening, because human vision is much more sensitive to fine-scale lightness contrast than color contrast. See Contrast (vision). Few editors other than Photoshop implement this same color space for their analogs of these blend modes. Instead, they typically base their blend modes on HSV (aka HSB) or HSL. Blend modes based on HSV are typically labeled hue, saturation, and brightness. Using HSL or HSV has the advantage that most operations become invertible (at least in theory), but the disadvantage that the dimensions of HSL and HSV are not as perceptually relevant as the dimensions of the space Photoshop uses. Relation to masking The result of applying several of these modes depends linearly on the pixel level of the top layer. In such cases, when the top layer is purely black, one gets a certain transformation of the bottom layer (which may be just a purely black or purely white image). When the top layer is purely white, one gets another such transformation. The intermediate gray values are described above using the opacity slider on the second transformation. In such cases, applying the blending mode is equivalent to Normal blending: * Apply two transformations to the bottom layers; * Use the result of the first transformation as the new bottom layer; * Put the result of the second transformation as the new top layer; * Use the initial top layer as the mask on the new top layer. (This assumes that the mask may be colored, with its R,G,B channels masking the channels of the image independently. Many image manipulation programs do not allow such masks; for them this equivalence holds only for grayscale top layers.)  Differences between layer and tool blending  Some applications allow the user to apply blending modes to painting tools, such as the Brush tool in Photoshop. When blending modes are used with these tools, the result is calculated based on pixels already existing on the target layer. If no pixels currently exist, then the 'painted' pixels are created as if in Normal blending mode. Subsequent strokes that overlap are then calculated based on the tool's blending mode, and the result is applied directly to the layer. A key difference with tool blending versus layer blending is that the results of tool blends are generally not able to be adjusted after the stroke is made, with the exception of stepping backward with the application's Undo command; layer blends may be adjusted with opacity or even switched, as they are applied dynamically between layers. This distinction is useful to create various effects on a single layer, such as when applying dodge and burn techniques, where painting with a low opacity in screen or multiply modes allows the user to build up or reduce the results in a more organic way on a single layer.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Along with the Wallace-Jagdfeld Octagon House, it is one of two Octagon Houses in Fond du Lac. The house was featured as the second-most haunted house in Wisconsin on the History Channel show \\"Hidden Passages\\". History Isaac Brown, a carpenter and trader with Native Americans, reportedly grew fearful of attacks from them in 1856, so he built a house that was designed for hiding. An Orson Fowler-designed eight-sided structure, it contained nine secret passageways and spaces. A tunnel was built between the house and a woodshed, which was used as a safe house on the Underground Railway. A small storage room beneath the front porch was used to hide the runaway slaves. Brown gave the house to his son Edwin A. Brown as a wedding present. The younger Brown and his wife Ruth Edward (Pier) Brown had three children in the house. The house became a rental unit in 1900, and remained so until the late 1960s to early 1970s. Plans for a new high school threatened the house. Despite the house being on the National Register of Historic Places, no buyers were interested and it was days away from demolition. Local dressmaker and antiques dealer Marlene Hansen bought the house without viewing the interior. Hansen and her family restored the house, turning it into a historic and spooky tour house. In 2005 The Southern Wisconsin Paranormal Research Group studied the house and reported that they found paranormal activities there. \\"I can't tell what others have seen, felt, or experienced, but I can tell that they do experience something,\\" Hansen said. \\"Their body language changes and I can see it in their faces.\\" Her grandson, who often gives tours of the house, has said that visitors have reported hearing sounds, including small children laughing and playing, and feeling cold hands touching them. Some people believe that the children are Edwin Brown's children. Features The house has stucco walls, with four dormers, and a central chimney. It is now a museum.

Famous Dominican baseball coach and trainer Ramon Lora (born 1977), now coaching at Western Oklahoma State College, was born in Gaspar Hernandez. Lora's 2011 team captured the NJCAA National Championship while featuring numerous Dominican players at the American college. History The current site of Gaspar Hernandez retains features of indigenous culture, mainly of the Ciguayo and Ciboney Indians from the societies of R√≠o San Juan, Nagua and Samana. The present municipality was founded on April 5, 1907, in a place originally called Canto La Ermita. At that time the population was concentrated on the banks of the river Joba. The place was renamed Gaspar Hern√°ndez in honor of the famous priest, associate of Juan Pablo Duarte in the war of independence from Haiti. Climate Economy The municipality of Gaspar Hernandez has a diversified economy divided between tourism and agricultural production. Ecotourism exists mainly in the Ojo de Agua district, with caves and caverns, beautiful natural landscapes, and the source of water, dipping between rocks and reappearing as the Ojo de Agua. Important hotel projects along the coast of Gaspar Hernandez include: Bahia Principe, Bahia Esmeralda, El Pescador, Playa Cana, Playa Rogelio, and Punta Gorda . The Municipal District of Veragua produces banana, maize, cassava, and sweet potatoes. The District of Joba Arriba is the largest producer of cocoa, with one of the country's largest cocoa farmers' associations. It also produces other minor agricultural products. Cattle and hogs are another important sector. Fishing has developed gradually, catering to the tourist resorts of Sosua and Cabarete. Beekeeping is a new activity in the municipality in the production of honey, pollen and Royal Jelly.

So you hear Riu or Tiu (uncle) instead of Rio or Tio.  Location  Guayabal lies 725 meters above sea level at the confluence of the Arroyo Guayabal in the Rio Cueva. The coordinates are 18¬∞44'56 N 70¬∞50'11 W (from Google Earth). A trail goes through the Arroyo Guayabal to Constanza. Constanza is about a two-hour drive, yet the roads require the use of sports utility vehicles. Guayabal is about 20 km (50 minutes if using the public minibus, Guagua) north-east of Padre las Casas, and about another 2 hours, in the Guagua, away from the province capital Azua de Compostela.  Society  Guayabal administrates some smaller villages alongside the Rio Cueva. These villages are accessible solely with offroad capable vehicles. Some include: Periquito (20 min. west), Arroyo Corozo (15 min. east), La Guama (30 min. south-east) and El Recodo (2 hr.'s south-east). Being that Guayabal is difficult to access its residents are very dependent on Padre las Casas for many goods and services. There is much poverty and as such there is a lot of emigration in search of work. Yet, during Christmas, Navidad, or Easter, Semana Santa, the town is repopulated.  Economy  The economy is dominated by the cultivation of beans(habichuelas), peas(guandule), cassava(yuca)and calabash(auyama). The production region, called Loma or Cerca, covers all the hillsides up to the top of the highest mountains, i.e. over 1,000 meters above sea level. The cost of an acre of land(tarea), approximately 629 m2, is about $4000RD or about $100US. Meat producers are sparse and there are even less milk producers left. The common mode of transports is through the use of horses, mules and donkeys.  Tourism  There is little tourism; Guayabal has two small hotels. One has the usual amenities of a hotel, it includes a bath, a T.V., and a ventilator, but these rooms serve mostly reserved by business travelers. There is one restaurant, there is great hospitality and it is common to be invited to dine with a local family.

Ingo Oschmann (born 3 August 1969 in Bielefeld) is a German comedian, entertainer and stage magician who also works as a television presenter and actor. In 2003, he became the first comedian to win the final of Star Search in Germany. Career Ingo Oschmann first began practising magic in the year 1992 when he started performing at children's birthday parties, weddings, company anniversaries, and street festivals. In the year 1993 he attended several workshops like acting, pantomime, and improvisation. In the next couple of years he developed shows for kindergartens and schools in Bielefeld and surrounding areas. He also attended supplementary training seminars with the expectation of applying and furthering his skills in the fields of pantomime, clownery, and acting. Additionally, he had minor solo performances on the theatre stage.Biography on Ingo Oschmann's homepage In 1996 Oschmann created magic and acting seminars for children and adults. In 1997 he extended his professional repertoire with comedy, political cabaret and presentation. In the same year he won a casting in Munich and worked for the cabaret artists Kl√∂pke & Schiefer (i.e. stage direction and texting). In the year 2000 Oschmann presented his first full-length solo evening programme called \\"Kommunikaze‚Äú. Furthermore, he developed, arranged and presented the variety show BELAMI. Oschmann celebrated his first major success on stage in the year 2001 by winning the Swiss Comedy Award.Homepage Swiss Comedy Award Thereafter he passed the K√∂lner Comedy Academy (Cologne Comedy Academy) and wrote his second solo evening programme \\"Oben ist es besser als unten!‚Äú (literally \\"It's better to be at the top than at the bottom!‚Äú) In addition, he developed, planned and organized the Figaro Comedy Show, a comedy talent show which took place in a hairdresser's shop in Bielefeld once a month. Oschmann presented the show himself and invited e.g. comedians, cabaret artists, magicians and street artists to perform live on stage. The monthly show ran successfully until the end of 2006. Winning the Swiss Comedy Award in 2001 was an important step in Oschmann's career. Afterwards he appeared in several shows on Swiss and German television. But the real breakthrough as a professional artist followed not until the year 2003 when Oschmann succeeded as a comedian in the first season of the famous TV show Star Search, broadcast by the German TV channel Sat.1. Oschmann's prize for winning the final of Star Search was his own TV comedy show called \\"Wenn Sie lachen, ist es Oschmann!‚Äú (literally \\"When you laugh, it's because of Oschmann!‚Äú). Sat.1 produced two seasons of the show in 2004. In 2005, Oschmann became the host of another show on German TV: a clip and comedy show called \\"WWW - Die Witzigsten Werbespots der Welt‚Äú (\\"The funniest TV commercials in the world‚Äú), of which several seasons were produced between 2005‚Äì2007. Since 2004, Oschmann has had numerous appearances as a stand-up comedian, magician and guest on all major German TV channels, e.g. performances and scenes with well-known artists like Dieter Hallervorden and J√ºrgen von der Lippe, as well as invitations for all the main comedy and evening shows of famous German TV presenters like Hugo Egon Balder, Thomas Hermanns and Anke Engelke - just to name a few. In 2007, Oschmann's first DVD entitled Ingo Oschmann live with his third solo evening programme \\"Wenn Sie lachen, ist es Oschmann!‚Äú (recorded live on stage in 2005) was released.

Its population was 645 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Safford micropolitan area. Central is located between the towns of Thatcher and Pima, all west of the Graham County seat, Safford. U.S. Route 70 is the main thoroughfare. Central has a ZIP Code of 85531; in 2000, the population of the 85531 ZIP Code Tabulation Area was 404. Geography Central is at , at an elevation of approximately 2900 feet above sea level. From this location just south of the Gila River within the Upper Gila Valley, Mount Graham of the Pinale√±o (Pinaleno Mountains) range dominates the southern skyline. Demographics History Central was first homesteaded by the Cluff family in 1880. The Cluffs extended the Central Canal to their lands on the eastern side of Central. Later settlers extended the canal west and north. In 1883 construction began on a one-room white rock building to be used as a church meeting house and school house. By 1884 twenty families, including Cluff, Norton, Shurtz, Bigler, and Webster households resided in Central. In 1978 the streets were named after these early Mormon pioneers. In December 1883 the Central Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was organized and Joseph Cluff was ordained the first bishop. A new red brick church was built in 1885. It was the first regular meeting house built in this part of Arizona and was also the first home of the LDS Academy from December 1890 to May 1891. A plaque east of Hwy 70 on Central Road commemorates the original home of the St. Joseph Stake Academy that later moved to Thatcher and became Eastern Arizona College. In 1894, LDS Church historian Andrew Jensen reported on the Central Ward: \\"Thirty-five families or 178 souls, constitute the Mormon population, and there are only two other families in the district. Central excels in point of large orchards, extensive alfalfa fields and good grain. The meeting house is the only public building in the settlement, in which there is also a small store and a post office. There are a number of fine and comfortable private residences, built mostly of brick and adobe.\\"Jensen, Andrew. History of Central, LDS Church Historian. A railroad through Central was completed in 1896. The head of the Central Canal washed out in 1905. Since then, the Smithville and Union Canals have been used exclusively. The Gila Valley Arizona Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opened in 2010, is located in Central. The temple is the third LDS temple built in Arizona and the first temple announced by Thomas S. Monson after being sustained as President of the Church in 2008.

Convicted of multiple charges in 1995, Stanfa was sentenced to life in prison. Early life Stanfa was born in 1940 in Caccamo, Sicily. In 1964, at the age of 23, Stanfa immigrated to the United States, and listed his occupation as a bricklayer. That same year, he was married to Lena, and settled in New York City, and by the late 1960s, moved to Philadelphia. Mafia career According to law enforcement, when Stanfa arrived in New York City, his brothers and brother-in-law, who were made men in the Gambino crime family, introduced him to the family. The Gambino family leaders arranged for Stanfa to work for Angelo Bruno, the boss of the Philadelphia crime family. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was killed by a shotgun blast in the back of the head as he sat in his car in front of his home at the intersection of 10th Street and Snyder Avenue in South Philadelphia, while Stanfa, his driver, was wounded. It is believed that the killing was ordered by Antonio Caponigro, Bruno's consigliere. A few weeks later, Caponigro's lifeless body was found, battered and nude, in the trunk of a car in The Bronx. The Commission had reportedly ordered Caponigro's murder because he assassinated Bruno without their sanction. Other Philadelphia family members involved in Bruno's murder were tortured and killed. Stanfa testified before a grand jury about the killing, and disappeared shortly after. In December 1980, Stanfa was arrested in Baltimore, where he was working as a baker in a pizza shop, and taken back to Philadelphia on charges that he had lied to the grand jury about meetings with mobsters after Bruno's death. In 1981, he was convicted of perjury and sentenced to eight years in prison. Boss and war Stanfa recruited John Veasey as an enforcer during the war with Merlino. Veasey would later become a government turncoat and testify for the prosecution at Stanfa's trial. In 1991, Stanfa emerged as the new leader of the Philadelphia family, and the young group of mobsters led by Joey Merlino openly rebelled against him. The \\"Young Turks\\" as the press would eventually dub Merlino's tight-knit crew, struck first with the killing of Felix Bocchino on January 29, 1992. While Joey Merlino was in prison in 1990, he met Ralph Natale, and the two allegedly conspired to take over the Philadelphia crime family from Stanfa.Caparella, Kitty. \\"Recalling A Bloody Hit.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. April 24, 2001.Anastasia, George. \\"Mob Boss Natale Tells of 'Descent Into Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 31, 2001. Merlino was released from prison in April 1992, after he was convicted in January 1990 of planning the heist and sentenced to three years in prison. In an attempt to quell further violence, Stanfa officially inducted Merlino and his best friend Michael Ciancaglini into the crime family. Stanfa hoped he would be able to keep tabs on the Merlino crew and make it easier to kill them if necessary. While this act of diplomacy temporarily ended the violence, by 1993 an all-out war broke out between Stanfa and Merlino. On August 5, 1993, Merlino survived a drive-by shooting assassination attempt by two Stanfa gunmen, taking four bullets in the leg and buttocks, while Ciancaglini was shot in the chest and died. On August 31, 1993, a drive by shooting was performed on Stanfa and his son while they were driving on the Schuylkill Expressway. Stanfa escaped uninjured and his son survived being shot in the jaw. On September 17, 1993, a friend of Merlino's was shot and killed by Stanfa gunmen. Stanfa gunman Philip Colletti testified in court that he planted a remote control bomb under Merlino's car several times, but that it failed to go off every time. In November 1993, Merlino was arrested by the FBI, charged with violation of his supervised release, and sent back to prison. Merlino was mainly supported by a group of young mobsters he knew since childhood while Stanfa, in an unusual tactic recruited for his side several men who were not of Italian heritage, including the Veasey brothers. According to the former executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Frederick T. Martens, \\"Stanfa brought in people, like the Veasey brothers, who had no background in the mob but who were willing to break legs and pull a trigger\\". Trial and life sentence Stanfa was indicted on labor racketeering, extortion, loansharking, murder and conspiracy to commit murder on March 17, 1994. On the day of Stanfa's trial on October 5, 1995, William Veasey, John Veasey's brother who was scheduled to testify against Stanfa, was murdered. On November 21, 1995, Stanfa was convicted of 33 of the 35 charges. On July 9, 1996, Stanfa was sentenced to life in prison. Ralph Natale took over as boss, but Merlino was the real power in the family, allowing Natale to become boss to direct law enforcement attention away from himself. Stanfa is serving his life sentence at the United States Penitentiary (USP), located in Allenwood, Pennsylvania; he was later transferred to FCI Schuylkill. References *Anastasia, George.

Specific research items in FY2010 are listed below.(Latest Publications)  Deepening economic integration  ::ERIA will conduct policy studies to promote deepening economic integration through the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investments as well as the improvement of business environment in collaboration with business community in the region, paying special attention to the improvement of cross border business transactions and behind-the-border issues including investment environment and various non-tariff measures. The following are the research projects reflecting the regional needs of ASEAN and East Asia; ::*Extend and elaborate more the analysis on linkages between real and financial economies, providing rigorous analysis pursuing financial market integration through market and institutional reform strategies. ::*Provide assessment on the current fiscal position, the impact of the stimulus package provided to cope with the last financial crisis, and potential fiscal risk as consequences of stimulus issuance both in medium and long term. ::*Continue to support ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting by further developing AEC/ERIA scorecards in cooperation with the ASEAN High Level Task Force and ASEAN Secretariat through rigorous analysis based on objective data collection and the application of quantitative methodologies. ::*Conduct the analysis of safety and environment standardization and conformity assessment in East Asian countries and propose a desirable system, focusing on accessible design and green technology.  Narrowing Development Gaps  ::ERIA will continue to pursue deepening economic integration and narrowing development gaps at the same time, by applying a comprehensive approach to cover regional connectivity, maximize regional growth, and expand regional domestic demand. The following research projects are planned; ::*Provide intellectual support for drafting ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan, which enables ASEAN to come up with coordinated direction to promote sectoral efforts to achieve ASEAN Community Building by the year 2015, focusing on connectivity aspects of various economic and social activities. ::*Further develop and deepen the analysis on various regional industrial corridor projects including Mekong-India Industrial Corridor project and Indonesia Economic Development Corridor project, Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) and Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), in cooperation with ASEAN Secretariat, Asian Development Bank, and related institutions and countries. This project will include the expansion and sophistication of the geographical simulation analysis focusing on the effect of logistics improvements, and also include the promotion of infrastructure projects on PPP basis related to various industrial corridors. ::*Conduct studies to stimulate innovation in the region utilizing varying potentialities in East Asia, which provides resources for raising the level of economic activities in this region. ::*Target the expansion of middle class in East Asia, further develop research works toward developing safety nets such as social insurance and enhancing the education system in East Asia building upon the stocktaking works of FY 2009, and deepen the analysis in fields like economic and social implications of prolonged low-fertility rate and rapid aging, reforming civil service pensions, issues of unorganized labor and strengthening rural social protection systems. ::*Deepen a study on the development of small and medium- sized enterprises. This project will intend to improve economic efficiency in East Asia through the productivity enhancement and networking of SMEs, including the measures for outsourcing or sharing of common administrative and research operations.  Sustainable Economic Development  ::The ERIA will support interdisciplinary efforts for environment and energy issues for sustainable development in the region through comprehensive analyses and policy reviews. The projects will include the following; ::*In view of the commitment made by participating countries of the World Summit on Sustainable Development to minimize adverse effects of chemical production and use by 2020, to analyze economic and social impacts of different approaches for the chemical management, surveying current chemical management system and industrial structure in each East Asian country, and studying economic and social impacts. ::*Continue research on 3R (reduce, reuse, and recycling) policies focusing on the importance of recycling statistics, to identify different indicators and definitions of recycling rates and to propose strategies on how to develop a statistical system to evaluate policy impact, which will provide the basis for coordination among stakeholders, industrial standards for recycled goods, and eco-industrial parks ::*Deepen research on energy efficiency, biomass, and bio-fuels for energy security in East Asia. This project will be a continuation of past three years‚Äô project and intend to conduct comprehensive surveys and propose agreeable policy framework for international cooperation. ::*Building upon the result of the evaluation of the impact of energy market integration in East Asian region, conduct research works on the issues of energy market integration including energy security, reform of energy pricing regime, liberalization of domestic energy market system, and investment and trans border trade of energy. = ERIA Outreach = :The Public relations Division of ERIA is responsible for disseminating and sharing the findings of ERIA‚Äôs research through publications, capacity building activities, and the holding of public symposia and seminar.  Publications  :The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) produces books, research reports, discussion papers, and policy briefs to share and disseminate its research findings and policy recommendations to stakeholders and interested public. :These publications cover a wide range of subject matter on deepening economic integration, narrowing development gaps, and sustainable development ‚Äì the three pillars under which ERIA conducts research. ERIA is also highly involved in energy-related research. :ERIA also co-publishes with international academic and professional printing houses. :Publications can be found at http://www.eria.org/publications/index.html  Capacity Building  :The Capacity Building Programme links ERIA‚Äôs research, researchers and wider networks to government officials in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Acting as a bridge between ERIA materials and emerging ideas, or through the provision of technical assistance to support analysis and policy modelling, the programme supports the development of better policy and policy regulations. :Since the inception of the Capacity Building Programme, nearly 50 activities have taken place, with around 150 government officials benefitting through the programme since 2015. In addition to responding to special requests from the participating countries, regular activities take place around five components.  Seminar and Symposia  :Seminars and Symposia will be held with the aim of nurturing a sense of community in the region, seeking inputs from stakeholders, as well as promoting ERIA and disseminating ERIA related research findings. Various joint seminars and symposia will be held together with leading research institutes in and out of the East Asian region, including those in United States and Europe. = Providing Policy Recommendations = :One of the most important ERIA's works is providing policy recommendations to leaders, ministers in ASEAN and EAS through East Asia Summit and ASEAN Summit, and another related meetings. As ERIA's mission expands by receiving instructions and task-outs from Summits and Ministerial Meetings, ERIA's role as the \\"Center of Excellence\\" in ASEAN and East Asia becomes increasingly important. *:At the 5th East Asia Summit and the 17th ASEAN Summit held on October 2010 in Vietnam :Heads of government of ASEAN Member States commended ERIA's contribution in \\"Comprehensive Asia Development Plan (CADP)\\" and \\"Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity\\". *:At the 16th ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting held on November 2010 in Brunei Darussalam :The Ministers expressed their high appreciation to the ERIA for its valuable support in conducting the Final Report on the ASEAN Strategic Transport Plan (ASTP) 2011‚Äì2015.  Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia  The ERIA is tasked with reviewing the proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia or CEPEA, the Japanese proposed trade bloc involving the 16 nations of the East Asia Summit.Japanese Economists To Address NZ Business Leaders It was decided at the Third East Asia Summit that the ERIA report on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia would be received at the Fourth East Asia Summit. The Fourth EAS was delayed for almost a year by reason of difficulties in the host nation Thailand. With the subsequent change of government in Japan, and the discussion by the new administration of the East Asia Community the future of CEPEA is not yet clear. Subsequently, the Fourth East Asia Summit supported further development on trading groupings based around the 13 country ASEAN Plus Three and the 16 country East Asia Summit.Chairman‚Äôs Statement of the 4th East Asia Summit Cha-am Hua Hin, Thailand, 25 October 2009 At the subsequent APEC conference Australia announced a million Australian dollars in funding to ERIA to support research into the 16 country bloc.Australia providing $1 million to boost regional integration  See also  *Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia *Institute of Developing Economies *Masahisa Fujita  References   External links  *Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) Organizations associated with ASEAN Economic research institutes ","title":"Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia"},{"id":"16120354","text":"The Cocioc is a left tributary of the river Sabar in Romania.

California Legislative Information Service website This law applies to all businesses in California, including hotels and motels, restaurants, theaters, hospitals, barber and beauty shops, housing accommodations, and retail establishments. The law was enacted in 1959 and was named for its author, Jesse M. Unruh. The Unruh Civil Rights Act is codified as California Civil Code section 51.http://oag.ca.gov/publications/CRhandbook/ch4 Text of the Act \\"All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\\" Legal interpretation and effects The California Supreme Court has repeatedly \\"interpreted the [law] as protecting classes other than those listed on its face\\". For example, even prior to the 2005 addition of sexual orientation to the law's list of covered classes, the Unruh Act had been \\"construed as protecting gays and lesbians from arbitrary discrimination\\", such as in the case of Rolon v. Kulwitzky. The California Supreme Court also decided that the act outlaws sex-based prices at bars (ladies' nights): offering women a discount on drinks, but not offering the same discount to males. In Koire v Metro Car Wash (1985) 40 Cal 3d 24, 219 Cal Rptr 133, the court held that such discounts constituted sex stereotyping prohibited by this Act. California courts recently held that a private school's admissions office was not covered by the Act, because it was not a business. (A school had expelled two students who were perceived as bisexual.) \\"Although the fact the School is nonprofit is not controlling, this does mean it should not be deemed a business unless it has some significant resemblance to an ordinary for-profit business.\\" Doe v. California Lutheran High School Ass'n, 170 Cal.App.4th 828 (2009). However, schools may be businesses for the purpose of the Act when they are engaging in commercial activities. \\"For example, the Court noted that the School would not be permitted to discriminate in its nonmember transactions, such as in the sale of football tickets, because of the Unruh Act. Thus, while private religious schools' admissions and disciplinary practices may not be subject to the Unruh Act, schools should be aware that other business transactions may still be.\\" Disability litigation Since the passage of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, disability access violations count among the practices that run afoul of the Unruh act. Combined with the California Disabled Persons Acts, disability access plaintiffs are allowed to tack on state claims for money damages onto requests for injunctive relief in ADA lawsuits. The act allows plaintiffs to claim treble damages with a minimum of $4000 per access violation plus attorneys fees. In most states, plaintiffs are entitled to only injunctive relief, having the disability access issue fixed. As a result of the damages claimed under Unruh Act, California accounts for 42% of all ADA litigation nationwide. However, in California, damages may be reduced in certain cases to $2,000 or $1,000 if construction related accessibility violations are corrected within 30‚Äì60 days of being served with a complaint. Modifications In 2009 a proposed change, SB 242, that would have added use of language to the list of protected statuses, was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 2015 a proposed change, SB 600, that added citizenship, primary language, and immigration status to the list of protected statuses, was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown.

It is one of many octagon houses built in the United States in the mid-19th century. In 1950 architect Rexford Newcomb wrote, \\"...probably the best-planned octagon house in the country is the John Richards House at Watertown, Wisconsin...\\" History The Watertown Octagon House in 1933 The house was designed and built by John Richards, a pioneer Watertown lawyer and mill owner, with construction completed in 1854. It was still in the Richards family until the death of his grandson, William Thomas, in 1935. The family offered to sell the house to the city (reputedly for $1) but it was sold to the Watertown Historical Society (founded 1933), and opened to the public in 1938.Page at Watertown Historical SocietyMain page at Watertown Historical Society The house is still a museum open to the public. The house is built of brick, and is across excluding the balconies. It has eight square rooms on each floor and triangular rooms in the corners, a total of 32 rooms including the cupola. The porches or verandas running all round the house are constructed in timber. They are part of the original design, but by 1924 they were so rotten as to be dangerous, and Richards' daughter had them taken down. For many years visitors could only imagine the house with its porches by referring to a scale model of the house, which sits in the grass next to the house. The porches were reconstructed in 1978 at a cost of $50,000. By 2006 they were again in a dangerous condition and an anonymous donation enabled them to be restored once more.Watertown Daily Times article about the recent restoration Inside the house at the center a hanging spiral staircase connects the floors. Its rail and spindles are of cherry trees from Richards' land. The staircase is built into four chimney flues that protrude above the cupola. Richards also built a passive air conditioning system into the house, with air intakes below the eaves, ducts in the brick walls, and outlets in the major rooms. The roof is funnel- shaped, and fed rainwater into a tank on the third floor, which fed faucets at a few spots in the house. The kitchen was in the basement, with a Dutch oven big enough to hold 24 loaves of bread. A dumbwaiter carried food from the kitchen up to the dining room. With Richards came to Wisconsin in 1836 and operated a grist mill across the Rock River from this house. He was later appointed the first district attorney of Jefferson County, and was elected justice of the peace and an early mayor of Watertown. In 1840 he fetched his wife Eliza Forbes from Massachusetts, reportedly promising to build her the finest house in the best town in Wisconsin Territory. The house is located within the Richards Hill Residential Historic District.

A veteran of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, he served on al-Qaeda's Shura Council and ran a religious school called the Institute of Islamic Studies in Kandahar, Afghanistan, from the late 1990s until the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Along with Abu Walid al Masri, Saeed al-Masri and Saif al-Adel, al-Walid opposed the September 11 attacks two months prior to their execution. Under interrogation, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said that al-Walid had opposed any large-scale attack against the United States and wrote bin Laden a stern letter warning against any such action, quoting the Quran. Al-Walid fled from Afghanistan to Iran after the American invasion and was held there under house arrest from 2003 until April 2012. At that time, Iran extradited him to Mauritania, where he was held in prison until his release on July 7, 2012. He was released after renouncing his ties to al-Qaeda and condemning the September 11 attacks. Life The publisher of the magazine Al-Talib (The Student), al-Walid wrote poetry that attracted the attention of Osama bin Laden, and was invited to give spiritual lectures to mujahideen at Afghan training camps. Some time in late 2000 or early 2001, bin Laden was videotaped reciting al-Walid's poem \\"Thoughts Over al-Aqsa Intifadah\\".IntelCenter, \\"Know Thy Enemy\\", DVD Series, volume 28 It was later suggested that he had traveled to Iraq in early 1998 in an attempt to meet with Saddam Hussein, but was turned away as the leader did not want to create problems for his country.Senate Intelligence Committee, 109th Congress, \\"Senate Report of Pre- war Intelligence on Iraq\\", p. 73-75 Later in 1998, the United States learned al-Walid was staying in Room 13 at the Dana Hotel in Khartoum, and President Bill Clinton sought to have him killed or preferably renditioned to a friendly country for interrogation. When a plan was finally made to capture him using another country's officials, he had already left Sudan. Al-Walid called by his kunya, Abu Hafs. In 1998, Germany began monitoring Mohamedou Ould Salahi's accounts, and it was noticed that al-Walid had asked him to spare some money twice, resulting in a DM8,000 transfer in December and one other situation in which he sent him money. In January 1999, al-Walid telephoned Salahi using a monitored satellite phone he borrowed from Bin Laden.Department of Defense, \\"Administrative Review Board Hearing for Mohamedou Ould Slahi\\", p. 184-216 He was initially labeled as being the same person as Slahi by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who amended their list in June 2007 to distinguish the two people. It was later suggested they were brothers-in-law, cousins or cousins-in-law. The confusion seemed to stem from the fact that al-Walid's wife and Salahi's wife were sisters. In mid-2000, al-Walid was approached by Ahmed al-Nami and Mushabib al-Hamlan who asked him about becoming suicide operatives.9-11 Commission Final Report, July 22, 2004 Ayman al-Zawahiri has credited al-Walid's book Islamic Action Between the Motives of Unit and the Advocates of Conflict as being one of the driving forces behind convincing al- Qaeda to merge with Egyptian Islamic Jihad in June 2001. \\"War on Terror\\" It is believed that the American invasion of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks by bin Laden actually drove al-Walid away from al-Qaeda and that he and a number of other discontent former members moved to the south to avoid connection with the ongoing fight. The United States accused him of entering Iraq again in an attempt to get Hussein to negotiate but stated that he was rebuffed on the same terms as his first visit. He was reported killed twice, the second time following a January 8, 2002 airstrike in Zawar Kili, outside of Khost.Vider, Manuel. \\"Understanding Terror\\", p. 15 When Shadi Abdellah was arrested in 2002, he cooperated with authorities, but suggested that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Osama bin Laden were not as closely linked as previously believed, in large part because al-Zarqawi disagreed with many of the sentiments put forward by al-Walid for al-Qaeda.Bergen, Peter. \\"The Osama bin Laden I know\\", 2006. p. 359-422 Zawahiri continues to speak positively of the role al-Walid played in encouraging Pan-Islamic peace and cooperation. Libyan Islamist Nomam Benotman also indicated in a letter to bin Laden that he, al-Walid, and Al Qaeda security official Abu Muhammad al-Zayat opposed the 9/11 attacks.

The first source to mention Maturinus is the Martyrology of Usuard, written in 875. In the next century, a biography of Maturinus was composed. According to his legend, Maturinus was born in Liricantus (now Larchant). His parents, Marinus and Euphemia, were pagan. His father was entrusted by Maximian with the task of exterminating the Christians of the region. His son Maturinus, however, was secretly baptized by Polycarp,The legend does not take into account that Polycarp lived in the East in the second century. when the boy was twelve. According to legend, he began to perform miracles, drive out demons, and calm rowdy or riotous individuals. He eventually converted his parents to Christianity.Alban Butler, Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), 5. He became a priest at the age of twenty, and took care of the diocese when the local bishop went to Rome. His fame grew, and emperor Maximian himself requested that he come to Rome so that his daughter-in-law Flavia Maximiana Theodora, who had been possessed by an evil spirit, could be cured by the saint. The demon in Theodora‚Äôs body was expelled. Maturinus lived for three more years in Rome, interceding with the emperor on behalf of persecuted Christians. He died on November 1, and was buried in a Roman cemetery. However, Maturinus miraculously indicated that he wished to be buried in Larchant; his body was taken to Sens and then to Larchant. Veneration Basilica of Saint Mathurin in Larchant Maturinus' relics were kept at Saint- Mathurin, Larchant, as well as in the church of Saint-Mathurin in Paris, situated in the Latin Quarter.

Both Louis XI and Henry IV visited the church. In Patricia Highsmith's novel The Boy Who Followed Ripley (1980), the two principal characters visit the basilica en route to an outing in the Forest of Fontainebleau.

He was invoked against mental illness and infertility, and the faculty of medicine of the University of Paris kept their great seal safely in the Church of Saint-Mathurin.Ren√© Gandilhon, Sigillographie des universit√©s de France (Paris) 1952 Due to his association with madness and mental illness, he also became the patron saint of comic actors, jesters,See Fran√ßois Villon's Testament, 1280. and clowns. He was also the patron saint of sailors (in Brittany), of tinmen (in Paris), and of plumbers. In France, Trinitarian friars were known in France as ‚ÄúMathurins‚Äù; this is because the Trinitarians were based in the church of Saint-Mathurin in Paris from 1228 onwards.

Each character's profile is based more on the manga than the anime adaptation. Many of the characters also make a cameo appearance in the manga version of Mayoi Neko Overrun!. Main characters =Rito Yuki= ; Rito Yuki : :Rito is a 16 year-old high-school student and the protagonist of the series.To Love-Ru Chapter 27: Rito's Long Day („É™„Éà„ÅÆ„ÅÇ„ÇãÈï∑„ÅÑ‰∏ÄÊó•, Rito no aru nagai ichinichi) Rito used to be on the soccer team in junior high and was quite good, but quit because he was constantly helping his father with his manga artist duties, and also because he did not want to leave his sister Mikan alone in the house. Mikan comments he is very good at the most \\"pointless things\\", like crane and festival games (e.g. hoops, catching fish, squirt guns). Along with the numerous useless little things Rito is good at, he is also an accomplished florist, gardener, and horticulturalist. :Rito is extremely kind, selfless, caring, charismatic, and thoughtful, having a lot of respect for women, though mostly by intention, and not so much by success. Due to his shyness around girls, he is very clumsy around women and has great difficulty maintaining his composure around any sort of stimulating situation, which leads him to always molest or grope the many girls in the series (though mostly unintentionally). Due to the otherworldly circumstances around him, Rito is always put, along with many different girls, in any and each type of awkward, intimate, and embarrassing situations, such as when he and Haruna were once teleported naked together to the basement of Ryouko's medical clinic because of one of Lala's faulty inventions, or when Lala used the same invention to send them naked to the school. :Even without interference from Lala's inventions, Oshizu's psychic powers, or Celine jumping onto his face, Rito is somehow able to trip over absolutely nothing, and possesses an extraordinary skill in accidentally reaching his hands or face into the breasts or other private parts of any girl within reach when he is falling. In To Love Ru Darkness, his clumsiness becomes even more frequent and violating as well as strangely inventive and surreal. He has shown to be able to accomplish difficult feats, such as reaching his hands or various objects into the clothing and undergarments of girls or partially strip off their clothing, and also grab several private parts of several girls all at once, all of which being purely by accident. Ryouko suspects that Rito's frequent godly indecency and unwitting perverted acts manifest because of the way Rito extremely restrained himself with the girls, causing his \\"libido\\" to accumulate and release in form of accidentally groping girls' bodies and all other perverted stuffs happening so far, calling it the \\"Cataplectic Indecency Syndrome\\". She also believes that the more he suppresses it, the more extreme and unbelievable the \\"accidents\\" will be. :It is only by accident that he encounters Lala, and despite his enduring feelings for Haruna, Rito shows signs of developing deeper affection towards Lala throughout the story but is unsure if what he feels is actually love. At the end of the series, he confesses to Lala, but tells her he also loves Haruna, yet she is happy on both parts. He is confused as polygamy is illegal in Japan where Lala replied that once he is king of the universe the laws of earth no longer apply. By the end of the Darkness manga, Rito earns Haruna's mutual feelings; in addition to Lala, Run, Yami, and Momo. The ending implies that his love troubles will continue on forever. Riko Yusaki ; : :As Riko Yusaki, his female alter-ego, she is a beautiful girl (with a physical appearance resembling a tomboy) who gets much attention from men, such as Motemitsu, the perverted principal, and even Saruyama, Rito's best friend. Later, Saruyama falls in love with \\"Riko-chan\\" and asks Lala to invite her for a date; out of pity, she forcefully changes Rito into \\"Riko\\" so Saruyama can go on a date with Riko. After that Riko only appears for short number of times at rare occasions. Her last appearance was in Chapter 74 of Darkness manga, when Nemesis changed her gender through boy-girl change kun. =Lala Satalin Deviluke= Lala Satalin Deviluke. ; : :Lala is the main female protagonist and first princess of Deviluke, whose family rules the Galaxy. As such, her hand in marriage is sought from across the Galaxy as she is (presumably) the successor to the Galaxy's throne. A rather childish girl, she is somewhat na√Øve regarding the culture and customs on Earth. Lala initially runs away from home, as she does not wish to marry any of her suitors, and due to an accident, ends up naked in Rito's bathtub. Upon arriving on Earth, Lala pretends to love Rito to keep herself from getting married, but really does fall in love with him after she misinterprets a statement that Rito shouts that was meant for Haruna.To Love- Ru Chapter 2: Great Escape of Love (ÊÑõ„ÅÆÂ§ßËÑ±Âá∫, Ai no dai dasshutsu) Although Lala appears to be somewhat airheaded, she is well known on Deviluke for her genius-level intellect and enjoys making all manners of inventions, often prompting some disastrous effect or another. ;Appearance :Lala is a highly attractive teenage girl with a curvaceous figure, long pink hair, and emerald green eyes. Her most distinguishing feature is her tail, which is long, thin, and ends with a heart-shaped tip; it extends down from the base of her back. Another feature is that she is almost always seen wearing a hair clip with thick black swirls circling once then pointing downward. This is her robot companion Peke, who actually forms the clothes Lala usually wears. At the beginning of the series, she is almost always seen in her costume robot Peke's \\"Dress Form\\", in what can only be described as an \\"enlarged version of Peke herself\\". Wanting to fit in more with the people of earth, she has Peke dress her in various earth clothing styles; she has also bought herself a large number of earth clothes to wear when Peke is out of energy. Lala is often idolized by other girls on school for her beautiful figure and one of the biggest busts on school. She is considered so attractive that is seen as a perfect beautie, which even make relatively normal-sized girls, like Haruna, to feel inferior. Ironically, she is mostly oblivious to her appearance. According to Risa Momioka, Lala's measurements are B89-W57-H87.To Love-Ru Chapter 60: ;Personality :Lala is shown as a girl the same age as the other characters, but with a rather childish personality: she is impulsive and acts instinctively, without thinking about the possible consequences. However, Lala also has a positive side: her extroversion allows her to socialize easily and, together with her beauty, helps to make her very popular in school. She is very caring and generous and seems to have a need to make everyone she cares about happy, even those with whom she has no real relationship, all while showing an amazing level of compassion that goes beyond simply charity or help. She is also very naive about terrestrial culture and often makes highly dangerous mistakes by accident or serious communication failure. Over time, on the other hand, can be witness an evolution of Lala's character, due to the proximity to Rito and his friends, which leads to a maturation, mainly from the sentimental point of view. :Since her first appearance, Lala has presented herself as a carefree girl and without any modesty: she does not disdain being naked in public or at home, nor appearing in front of Rito wearing little or nothing at all (typically, after a bath or upon awakening). Moreover, several times, as if it were a common thing, Lala asks Rito to bathe together, for the simple reason that on her planet Deviluke, she has always been bathed by maids, which is the reason why Lala has no notion of modesty. ;Powers and abilities :Being a member of the Devilukian and Charmian alien races, Lala has superhuman strength, power and speed. She is also known in Deviluke for her genius-level intellect (to the point of being considered one of the most intelligent people in her galaxy), and has made inventions of all kinds. Lala's physical strength is pure brute force to the point where a punch can cause a shock wave and create a small crater in a wall without physical contact with it. She has also been shown to withstand heavy physical attacks (usually without being hurt); this is also important internally, as she can eat spicy food. One trait Lala inherited from her mother, Sephie Michaela Deviluke, is an enhanced metabolism; thanks to it, Lala can not gain weight. Like all citizens from Deviluke, Lala has a distinctive tail with a shape of a spade on the end that can shoot a destructive beam. Oddly, her tail is very sensitive, causing her friends to nickname it her \\"weakness\\" (since the tail of all female Devilukeans is more sensitive than that of a male), despite being able to shake someone with her tail by mustering enough strength. :Despite her childlike personality, Lala's intellect is perhaps one of her most remarkable abilities, being capable to create extraordinary inventions as well redesign other material objects; her planet even wanted to use it for weapons research and engineering. Lala usually creates a multitude of inventions throughout the whole series, most of them being seemingly childish and toy-like, with some of them having no original purpose aside from having fun. A running gag in the plot is that her inventions usually do not work as well as Lala and the others had hoped, often resulting into perverted accidents. So far, Lala's greatest creation is Peke, her sentient all-costume robot. ;Biography :Throughout the series, she frequently tries to get Rito to love her, although her grand gestures generally end up putting Rito and company in embarrassing situations. Although Rito frequently chastises her for causing embarrassing and otherwise troublesome incidents, Lala rarely shows any form of negativity towards him and even states it is impossible for her to hate him.To Love-Ru Chapter 91: Honest Feelings (Áúü„Å£Áõ¥„Åê„Å™„Ç≠„É¢„ÉÅ, Massugu na kimochi) Even after finding out that he was in love with Haruna as well, she instead cheered and stated that they could both marry him. While the fact that Lala is an alien is initially a secret, it becomes common knowledge relatively soon after her arrival with no one making a big deal about it. ;In other media :In addition to the anime and manga, Lala has appeared in five To Love Ru video games: To Love Ru: Exciting Outdoor School Version, To Love Ru: Exciting Beach School Version, To Love Ru: Darkness ‚Äî Battle Ecstasy, To Love Ru: Darkness ‚Äî Idol Revolution, and To Love Ru: Darkness ‚Äî True Princess. Lala appears as a support character in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump crossover fighting game J-Stars Victory VS. Lala also makes a cameo appearance in the eighth chapter of the manga adaptation of the light novel series Mayoi Neko Overrun!. ;Reception :Lala is one of the most popular characters of To Love Ru among fan readers of the series. The June 2015 issue of Shueisha's Jump Square magazine included the results of its popularity poll for the heroines of To Love-Ru Darkness. In the various categories presented, Lala ranked 2nd as \\"which character would you want to be your friend?\\" and \\"which character would you want to switch bodies with for just one day?\\", and 3rd as \\"which character would you want to be your girlfriend (or wife)?\\", \\"which character would you want to be in your family (but not as a wife/girlfriend)?\\" and \\"which character would be your favorite if all the heroines were in an idol group?\\". In the same year, Jump Square presented the results of another popularity poll for the female characters of To Love-Ru Darkness in the October issue; this time Lala ranked 4th as \\"which character would you want to be your girlfriend (or wife)?\\" and \\"which character would you want to be in your family?\\", 6th as \\"which character would be your favorite if all the heroines were in an idol group?\\" and \\"which character would you want to switch bodies with for just one day?\\", and 8th as \\"which character would you want to be your friend?\\". =Haruna Sairenji= :Haruna is the second female protagonist of To Love Ru and one of Rito's classmates, as well as the girl of his affections; Haruna has similar feelings for him, having been attracted to his kind, gentle nature since junior high. Despite her growing love for the boy (which she believes to be unrequited), she usually suppresses her feelings and cannot confess to him because of her friendship with Lala. However, with some encouragement and having understood the fact that she cannot continue to hide her feelings, Haruna eventually tells Lala of her ordeal, to which she accepts, claiming Haruna as her rival for Rito's heart, while still remaining friends.Motto To Love Ru Episode 11: =Mikan Yuki= ; : :Rito's independent and reliable 12-year-old sister, Mikan takes care of the housework while their parents are away on business and watches after Celine. In contrast to her brother, she is very mature and does not hesitate to tease him, going as far as stating they aren't blood-related, but quickly retracting the statement, playing it off as a lie. Mikan also seems to have a certain lack of respect for Rito because of this (she hardly ever addresses him by his honorific as an older brother), but does refer to him as \\"Onii-chan\\" as thanks for trying so hard to take care of her when she develops a feverTo Love-Ru Chapter 104: Siblings (ÂÖÑÂ¶π, Ky≈çdai) and when he gives her a Christmas present. :Mikan may not show it, but she cares very deeply for Rito and misses his company, to the point one could suspect her of having a brother complex. This is more evident in the second OVA where she wonders if he would marry her if they were not blood related, and in the manga where she blushes every time another character mentions her brother, and also in the 5th OVA where after being hit by the pollen she tries to molest him while affectionately calling him \\"Onii-chan\\". Her brother complex may be the reason she rarely calls Rito \\"Onii-chan\\"; less a lack of respect and more a sign of her wish that their relationship was something other than that of a brother and sister. She also states how she and Rito used to play together before Lala entered their lives.To Love-Ru Chapter 73: Bad Mood? Good Mood? (‰∏çÊ©üÂ´å?„ÅîÊ©üÂ´å?, Fukigen? Gokigen?) It is later revealed that Mikan is terrified of thunder and lightning (and that Rito would always comfort her). :Mikan grows quite attached to Golden Darkness, perhaps due to Darkness seemingly being the same age as her. Mikan is very perceptive and seems to be able to read people's emotions, even their reactions, most of which is Rito's obvious anxiety around Haruna and Yui's subtle feelings for him. Mikan even calls him a \\"playboy\\" (as does Nana) for attracting so many girls all of a sudden. Mikan, however, does respect Rito's relationship with Lala, even going so far as to tell Momo not to get too close to Rito for Lala's sake, although it is fairly obvious that she could have done this out of jealousy from how close Momo was getting to Rito. =Golden Darkness= ; : :A dispassionate, withdrawn assassin, Golden Darkness was hired by one of Lala Satalin Deviluke's prospective suitors, Lacospo, to kill Lala's fianc√© Rito Yuki. She breaks the contract after noting Rito's true nature. Golden Darkness came to Earth on the Lunatique, a very fast spaceship (it can travel 30 million light- years in 2 hours). Golden Darkness has decided to stay on Earth, where she roams the streets of , purportedly to continue her mission to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this despite numerous opportunities, hinting that she says this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed.To Love-Ru Chapter 138: Commonly referred as \\"Yami\\", she spends much of her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it is the only thing she eats since it is the first food offered to her by Rito).To Love-Ru Chapter 76: By her planet's calculations, she is 24 years old, despite having the appearance of a 14-year-old (her Trans ability has slowed her aging process), although this is only mentioned in the anime.To Love Ru Episode 22: She has also a weakness to anything slimy.To Love-Ru Chapter 58: :Like Lala, Golden Darkness' physical abilities are exponentially stronger than a human's. She states she hates \\"ecchi\\" people, and does not hesitate to assault a person who looks at her in an obscene way. She does though hate when people are free of her as shown in the anime as she beats Rito up after being told by Rito that he's free of her. She's capable of spinning people away if she's caught by someone's with a strong grip. She has become close to Rito's younger sister Mikan Yuki and seems to keep an eye out for her, evident when she and Mikan switched bodies and the Principal attempted to grope her, prompting Golden Darkness (in Mikan's body) to warn him not to touch Mikan and deliver a savage beating. Though she always says she will kill Rito one day, it is becoming increasingly doubtful that she will ever do it. In fact, she seems to have begun to develop feelings for Rito. Instead of beating him and saying \\"I hate ecchi people\\" like she normally does, she blushes when Rito sees her in a swimsuit and states \\"Don't look at me with those ecchi eyes\\". This is also proven further when Golden Darkness nearly tells Rito that she wants him to \\"embrace\\" her.To Love-Ru Chapter 159: :In To Love Ru Darkness, after some convincing from Mikan, she enrolls in the school and becomes a classmate of the main cast. Mikan is also giving her cooking lessons. Despite her normal stoic appearance, it is obvious that she does care for Rito, and is shown to be developing further feelings for him, although not enough to forgo the occasional beating when he becomes \\"Ecchi\\". Her new life may already be in jeopardy when Mea Kurosaki, a fellow classmate, is revealed to be her 'little sister', suggesting that she will have to return to space and fulfill her contract to kill Rito. It is revealed that Golden Darkness's creator is the Sainan High teacher Tearju Lunatique,To Love-Ru Chapter 149: and that her given name is \\"Eve\\".To Love-Ru Darkness Chapter 14: When Golden Darkness' former rival Azenda hires the alien hitman Kuro to kill Rito, she rescues him from Kuro before she confesses her love to him, making her the second female heroine to convey to Rito. :She is based on Eve from Black Cat, as they both look the same and can turn any part of their bodies into a weapon; they are even voiced by the same actress Misato Fukuen in their respective animes. Also, there's a chapter in To Love Ru in which Golden Darkness tries on a black dress similar to the one that Eve wears in the final chapters of Black Cat.To Love-Ru Chapter 61: :Kentaro Yabuki initially illustrated Black Cat between 2000-2004, then assisted Saki Hasemi with his manga project To Love Ru. They agreed that a character featured in To Love Ru would be based on one of the protagonists in Black Cat, which ended up being Eve. Her character was recognized for being extremely similar to Eve and is currently one of the most popular characters in the series. Fans also debate whether she could have her own series. =Yui Kotegawa= ; : :An uptight, high-strung girl placed in Rito's class during the second year, Yui Kotegawa has little to no tolerance for anything she does not consider to be \\"acceptable behavior\\", and in the face of any kind of \\"shameless\\" act, Yui reacts by saying her trademark phrase: \\"How shameless!\\"; ironically, she secretly desires for Rito to do them to her, which is proven during one of Rito's \\"accidents\\" when she offers herself to him on the condition that he would only ever do it with her, and even stating: \\"You're the only one who can do naughty things to me.\\" Her haughty opinions, quick temper, and habit of speaking her mind often result in her vocally reprimanding classmates. :Yui quickly grows annoyed and disgusted by eccentricities and bizarre actions, particularly with regards to Rito and Lala. Unfortunately, almost every encounter with Rito usually ends with her embarrassed, naked, or groped (or all three). Although her nature prevents her from easing her behavior, she slowly warms up to his usual antics. After Rito saves Yui from a group of delinquents, she develops feelings for him, though her inexperience with boys leaves her unable to understand her feelings and is continually in self-denial about them. Usually, when Rito asks what is wrong, she says the exact opposite of what she wants to say and then hurts him in some way (a typical tsundere). In To Love Ru Darkness, Yui seems to have adopted Rito's clumsiness, which makes her fall onto him, pull his pants down, and plant her face in his groin. :A common gag is that some characters cannot remember Kotegawa's family name (calling her \\"Kokegawa\\" for example), presumably due to the fact that she is generally an unwilling participant in Lala's frequent schemes. After Celine takes on her humanlike form, she becomes very close to Yui, even being seen as a daughter-like figure in Yui's daydreams of her and Rito being married together. Yui also really likes cats: she owns cat-based books, has a stuffed cat, decorates her room with cat- shaped things, shapes her chocolate into a cat's face, and even has a cat- themed floaty, something Rito seems to find cute about her. According to Mio, her measurements are B88, W59, H87. =Nana Astar Deviluke= ; : :Nana and Momo are Lala's younger sisters and they are also twins. They were first introduced in a virtual game world created by Lala that they subsequently modify. They claim they did this to determine the nature of their sister's friends and to test Rito's affection for Lala. :Both Nana and Momo are currently on Earth, running away from their studies.To Love-Ru Chapter 97: Trouble Quest 5 („Å®„Çâ„Å∂„Çã„Åè„Åà„Åô„Å®5, TORABURU KUESUTO go) During this time, Lala has taken it upon herself to look after them and discipline them when they do something mischievous; ironically she has done those herself. They used to live with Zastin and his cohorts, but found it too cramped and uncomfortable. To get around this and to spend more time with their big sister, they created a pocket dimension in Rito's house (it is said to be bigger than Rito's house) to live in. Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Nana summons animals. :Nana has long hair, a single visible sharp tooth and unlike her sisters, a flat chest, which is used as a recurring gag throughout the manga. She is quite jealous of Momo's chest. She understands and can talk to animals. At some point of the series To Love Ru OVA 5, Nana develops small feelings for Rito, after he saved her from Momo's plant friends. And she manages to get the courage to sleep with Rito in his bedroom while he is sleeping, but actually sees Lala and Momo sleeping with him. Nana is so far the only character to question why so many girls fall in love with Rito, yet it is clear that she has growing feelings for him as well. :In To Love Ru Darkness, Nana becomes a Sainan High student at Momo's urging. Nana manages to get a new friend named Mea. When she found out Mea was a weapon like Yami and that she wanted to stop \\"playing\\" friends, she became depressed and confused in the 3rd episode of To Love Ru Darkness 2nd. After being encouraged by Rito, Nana met up with Mea again and made up when Nana said she doesn't care if Mea is a weapon or anything, she just wants to be with her and be friends. Shortly after Nana's feelings for Rito grew and tried to sneak into his bed a second time, but found out Momo was already there. =Momo Belia Deviluke= ; : :Momo has short hair and is generally sweeter than her twin, but develops a bad attitude whenever Nana takes credit for what she does. What gadgets are to Lala and animals are to Nana, plants are to Momo; she has a special connection with them that allows her to manipulate plants at will. :She immediately falls in love with Rito and has a strong attraction towards him (similar to Lala's, but with a more lustful desire), stating how his facial expressions are lovely, letting him touch her tail, and even becoming more aroused when Nana refers to him as a \\"beast\\". At times, she would even sneak into Rito's bed at night, but when asked why she does that, she simply replies that she is sometimes half asleep and unintentionally ends up in Rito's bed. At one time, she nearly stated how jealous she was of Lala that Rito's hand was stuck to her tail. Her tail is also able to shoot out lightning. As her attraction to Rito grows, so does her protectiveness of him, as she will physically threaten other characters (such as Mea) with violence if she attempts to harm Rito.to-LOVE ru chapter 160 page 13 Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Momo summons plants. :In To Love Ru Darkness, Momo takes over the role of the main female protagonist alongside Golden Darkness. Wanting Rito's love, but unwilling to cause conflict between her sister or Haruna, Momo realises if Rito becomes the next king of Deviluke, Earth laws will not apply to him, allowing him to create a harem where she can display her affections openly. Momo along with her sister become Sainan High's students, where Momo takes it upon herself to try to bring out the \\"carnivore\\" in Rito, which basically means his sex drive so he will take it upon himself to want to create a harem with all of the female cast. In the final chapter, Momo decides to be true to herself. She is the fourth and last heroine to confess her love to Rito. Secondary characters =Risa & Mio= ; & : :The mischievous, yet cheerful, best friends of Haruna, Risa and Mio are a pair of inseparable girls, spending as much time as they can with her and Lala, and whenever the latter inquires about Earth\`s culture and habits, they divulge as much information as they can for (although it is often misleading and perverted). Risa and Mio are known for their playful habit of groping the breasts of other girls and whispering naughty things into their ears to tease them, with Haruna as their most recurring victim; they like to do this with her mainly in front of Rito, in addition to also teasing Haruna about her feelings for him. While Mio enjoys cosplay and works part-time at a maid caf√© (to where Risa is always going to, as well), Risa is member of Sainan High's tennis club like Haruna, but she mostly skips it to do other things. =Run & Ren= ; : :A childhood friend of Lala, Ren is infamously known for wearing girls clothing during his play dates with Lala when he was a child. He arrives on Earth to win Lala by proving he is \\"man enough\\" for her, but becomes jealous of her relationship with Rito. Due to his pursuit of her, he accidentally gives Rito his first kiss.To Love-Ru Chapter 23: Scramble For The Lips (Âîá‰∫âÂ•™Êà¶, Kuchibiru s≈çdatsusen) While Ren is furious, it has an unexpected consequence towards his \\"alter ego\\". As Ren is from planet , he can change gender in mind and body upon triggering a specific stimulus. In his case, a sneeze. As a girl, ' is in love with Rito, due to the kiss, and blames Lala for her misfortunes, while Ren is still in competition, albeit one-sided, with Rito for Lala's hand in marriage.To Love-Ru Chapter 42: Confession (ÂëäÁôΩ, Kokuhaku) :In To Love Ru Darkness, the relationship between Rito and Run is deepened: during an outing, the boy realizes that he has always neglected Run's feelings and has never tried to know her, while she burst into tears at awareness that Rito will never see her as a girl because of her dual nature. On this occasion, the two personalities Ren and Run permanently separate into two distinct bodies, ending the embarrassing sex change problem; this maturation is another characteristic of the inhabitants of Memorze. Right after this happens, Run confesses her love to Rito, who seems to start having feelings for her, since in a dream he imagined kissing not only Lala and Haruna, but Run too. He also promises himself to give Run an answer about his feelings for her. :In the anime, while Ren appears a few times, Run is the dominant personality of the two, who is more serious about her feelings towards Rito to the point of stalking him, even taking a simple misunderstanding from him into her believing all men are never serious about her feelings. In the manga, Ren appears at first as the main personality. However, later on Run becomes the dominant personality (like in the anime) with Ren usually showing up for comedic effect, or when Ren does show up he inevitably changes into Run. In To Love Ru Troubles, it is revealed they are able to communicate with each other. Currently, Run is a famous idol, having released several albums, some along with Kyouko, with whom she befriended after Run has played an antagonist on her show. =Saki Tenjouin= ; : :The self-proclaimed \\"queen bee\\" of Sainan High, Saki is a pretty, popular, and rich girl who believes herself to be Lala's rival (who is totally oblivious to Saki's animosity towards her and, ironically, thinks of Saki as a good friend of hers). Due to Lala being considered prettier than her and, thus, getting more attention from the people, Saki, stating there can only be one \\"queen\\" in Sainan High, consistently tries to one-up her, going through any possible means to prove that she is better than Lala, even though her plans usually backfire and she ends up embarrassing herself in many different ways; the most frequent result is she getting naked in front of a crowd.To Love-Ru Episode 5: The Queen's Challenge („Åè„ÅÑ„Éº„Çì„ÅÆÊåëÊà¶Áä∂, Kuƒ´n no Ch≈çsenj≈ç) :Saki is one of the few female characters who doesn't feel any romantic feeling toward Rito (the only exception being when she was infected by Celine's pollen and briefly fell in love with him), and it's very likely she will not end up as part of his harem, even though most of her appearances seem to only serve the purpose of being a victim to the perverted mishaps that surround him. In the anime, however, she occasionally tries to seduce Rito in order to make Lala jealous (despite not loving him). Instead of Rito, Saki has a crush on Zastin, which left her horrified to discover that he, by chance, is the personal bodyguard of Lala, but this made her even more determined to win his heart at any cost.To Love-Ru Chapter 80: Master of Love (ÊÅãÊÑõ„Éû„Çπ„Çø„Éº, Ren'ai MASUTƒÄ) =Ryouko Mikado= ; : :The provocative school doctor at Sainan High, Ryouko helps out other extraterrestrials on Earth in various ways, usually dealing with medical care, although she does offer her human students a variety of her own concoctions as well. Formerly an operative for a shadowy, black market extraterrestrial organization bent on overthrowing Emperor Gid, she fled to Earth in hopes of hiding from her superiors. Evidence of her non-human origins are the elf-like ears hidden by her short hair - her species has not yet been specified. Furthermore, she seems to be smitten with Rito, as shown when she asks him to rub oil on her. =Shizu Murasame= ; : :The ghost of a girl who died 400 years ago, Shizu is sincere, kind, and very curious about the modern world, but has a severe fear of dogs, likened to Haruna's level of fear to the supernatural. She is usually addressed as ; the is an honorific used to refer to women. When frightened, she can emit blasts of mental stress, blowing apart various objects and surroundings, but is also capable of manipulating others through sheer willpower.To Love-Ru Chapter 113: Beach Girls‚ô° („Éì„Éº„ÉÅ„Éª„Ç¨„Éº„É´„Ç∫‚ô°, Bƒ™CHI G«çRUZU‚ô°) A related gag is the blasts of stress frequently rip apart clothing, resulting in Rito being in an awkward situation with one of the female cast. Since her meeting with Rito and the others, she begins exploring the world outside the old school building. Oshizu is aware of Haruna's crush on Rito by her ability to sense feelings while possessing another person and becomes very supportive towards cheering Haruna into confessing her feelings to him. :Oshizu \\"returns\\" to the living after Ryouko creates a prosthetic body for her to inhabit, built with biological qualities (looking and feeling like an actual human body). However, she occasionally \\"disconnects\\" her spirit from the body during brief moments of excitement. She currently lives with Ryouko and works as a nurse at her clinic to pay her back for the body, and also to remain close for Ryouko to maintain her physical body. In the first anime, Oshizu is not given a new body and her presence is limited, while she has her prosthetic body as she does in the manga for the OVA releases and the new anime. =Mea Kurosaki= ; : :The first-year schoolgirl appears in 1st chapter of To Love Ru Darkness. She is the classmate of Nana and Momo when they two transfer to Sainan High. Nana becomes her friend after talking to Mea about Nana's ability to understand animals' language. At the end of the second chapter of Darkness, Mea reveals to Yami that she is Yami's little sister, and possess similar powers. Mea desires for Yami to kill Rito and return to her life as an assassin instead of living a normal life on Earth. Her master calls her ' (katakana) instead of (kanji). After chapter 7, it appears she is starting to develop sexual feelings for Rito, and start seeing other people as friends. After Nana found out Mea was a weapon, she told her she was \\"playing\\" friends with her. However, Nana made up with her and became friends again. As Nemesis possesses Mea's body to witness Yami's ecchi-Darkness Mode, Mea managed to overcome her and break ties with Nemesis. From then on, Mea participates in Rito's harem though still cares for Nemesis. =Nemesis= ; : :The primary antagonist of To Love Ru Darkness and Mea's boss, who is behind the plan to make Yami return to the assassins' world. She has long black hair, golden eyes, a small yet slender body, and dark skin. She has a similar appearance to Mikan and possesses the same transformation ability as Yami and Mea. It is shown that Nemesis has a bit of a sexual interest in Rito. Momo has an antagonistic personality toward her. It is then noticed by Mea in the anime of To Love Ru Darkness that if Yami were to join Momo's harem this would force nemesis to join as well thus giving Momo an advantage. :She knows that Yami possesses a destructive weapon called \\"Darkness\\" which, according to Tearju, is supposedly a forbidden transformation of hers. In the major battle between Nemesis and a fully reformed Gid Lucion Deviluke, Nemesis is fatally injured which would literally make her vanish until Rito takes pity on her and allows her to inhabit his body for the time-being to recover, much to Momo's chagrin. After reaching full recovery, Nemesis comes to fully understand Rito's well- being and forces application for Sainan High's new student council president to improve Rito's harem. Supporting characters =Kenichi Saruyama= ; : :The perverted best friend of Rito, Kenichi has known him since junior high and is more open and obvious of his obsession with girls and is one of the few male characters Rito can talk to about his situations involving Haruna or Lala. He is aware of Rito's feelings for Haruna and consistently advises he get together with her. Recently, Kenichi reveals his crush on a girl named Riko, but does not realize she is actually Rito, who is accidentally transformed into a girl by one of Lala's bizarre inventions. =Zastin= ; : :Lala's personal bodyguard and the best swordsman on Deviluke. Despite his skill with the sword, Zastin has a horrible sense of direction, resulting in him getting lost (one of the running gags in To Love Ru). He also seems to have extremely bad luck, where he keeps getting run over by trains and cars. Initially, Zastin disapproves of Rito, deeming him weak and subsequently seeks to test his strength. However, once Rito exclaims his opinion of marriage in self-defense, Zastin is swayed by his words (though not in the way Rito intends) and summarily approves of him, believing he truly understands Lala's feelings. :He is currently working as the assistant chief to Saibai; the funds he gets for his duties are handed to Lala for her use. Zastin has shown a keen interest in becoming a manga artist, professionally. He has two assistants that work under him, simply known as Maul and Smutts. Zastin's tail is thin and very scorpion-like in appearance. =Rin Kujou= ; : :Being one of Saki's closest friends, Rin is hardly ever seen without accompanying her and/or Aya. Rin is skilled in the kendo arts and has been the bodyguard of Saki for years, as her family has always served the Tenjouin household in this position. She is also the only person who has been able to take down Lala in one strike by throwing a vibrating bracelet onto Lala's tail incapacitating her. :While Rin is usually calm and composed, and perhaps one of the most mature character in the series, she is also loyal, caring, and protective to Saki, being very dutiful to her job as bodyguard. These made her conflicted when Saki once ran away from home, and Rin was ordered to bring her back, even by force. But after Saki managed to settle things with her family, she and Rin were able to remain friends. :In To Love Ru Darkness, Rin's role in the manga is increased as she start to develop romantic feelings for Rito after he saves her from a cursed sword (with the help of Mea and Yami); Saki is completely supportive of her feelings for him, as she, frequently, sets up dates between Rin and Rito. =Ayako Fujisaki= ; : :The bespectacled Ayako \\"Aya\\" Fujisaki is weak-willed and became associated with Saki after she and Rin protected her from bullies when they were kids. So far, Aya has served little purpose throughout the series besides following and supporting Saki, whom she idolizes. She is essentially something of an extra to their group, and has never been seen without accompanying Rin and Saki. :The most known aspect of Aya's personality is her adoration of Saki, whom she looks up to and cares for the most in her life. She is also one of the few girls who don't have any romantic feelings towards Rito; most, if not all, of her admiration goes to Saki, and she naturally hates Rito's perverted accidents, especially if it's towards her, Rin, and, most of all, Saki. =Celine= ; : :Lala's gift for Rito's 16th birthday, Celine is initially a multi-story, carnivorous, sentient sunflower kept in the Yuki's residence backyard. Although seemingly monstrous, Rito cares for Celine deeply, referring to her as his family. The plant has traits in common with humans: perspiring when the climate is humid, wearing a scarf during a chilly weather and eating ramen when hungry (although Celine still needs the basic nutrients of water and sunlight as well). When Celine seemingly contracts a deadly disease, Kare Kare, Rito is fully dedicated to saving her and finding the only known antidote, the luckberry. With his friends they journey to the S-level-danger class planet of Misletoe to obtain the antidote, only to return and find Celine all dried up. In reality, she was germinating and Celine burst out from her single seed, taking the appearance of an infant girl, with a flower on her head. This event shocks even Momo, who is very knowledgeable about the galaxy's flora, stating that even with all of her knowledge there is still much about Celine's biological makeup that is a complete mystery to her. :Referring to Rito as her \\"mama\\", the infant Celine gets drunk when she drinks cola at which time she sprays pollen from the flower on her head that temporarily causes anyone who inhales it to fall in love with Rito (a side-effect that originates from Celine's own affection for him from taking care of her every day). Celine has a tendency to jump onto someone out of nowhere or playfully tackle any passing girl and attempting to breast feed. In episode 5 of To Love Ru Darkness ova, Celine takes the form of a fully grown adult woman on a full moon and is able to talk instead of saying the usual \\"mau\\", but returns to normal in her infant form upon morning. Comically mistaken as being Rito's daughter, Celine makes guest star appearances in the OVA adaptation (as a plant near the end of OVA 4 and as an infant in OVA 6 part 3) and becomes a regular character with her infant form in the new anime series. =Kyouko Kirisaki= ; : :A half-alien girl, Ky≈çko is a famous idol who has the ability to create and throw fire at will and becomes friends with Run when Run portrays an antagonist on her show. She is best known for her role as Magical Ky≈çko, a fictional magical girl character who stars in her own television series which Lala loves watching, often forcing Rito to watch it with her. She is present when Run asks Rito to be her date, and is able to tell they aren't dating though wishes Run luck on getting him. Ever since their first meeting on her show, Ky≈çko and Run have done many projects together, including debuting many songs together. :When Rito and his friends are given invitations to an RPG world Lala had partially created, an image of Kyouko is programmed into the game. However, Ky≈çko's programming within the game is modified by Nana and Momo, turning her into the \\"Demon King\\", tasked with seeking out Rito and offering him a way to send him and his friends home if he leaves Lala and promises to become her boyfriend. Adding to Rito's anxiety, Demon King Ky≈çko threatens to destroy Rito and his friends if he does not state his feelings for Lala. In comedic fashion, the otherwise unbeatable Ky≈çko is destroyed by a watering can that only Rito can use. Although she doesn't seem to be interested in Rito at first there do seem to be signs of her being fond of him after a few interesting situations arise. This becomes more evident after he saves her when she visited his school (to the extent of referring to Rito as a \\"prince\\" when he \\"princess-carries\\" her). :Kyouko is based upon the character of the same name from Black Cat. Kyouko also appears in a television in \\"Black Cat\\". =Tearju Lunatique= ; : :The woman who created Golden Darkness using of her own DNA, therefore the two look almost identical although each has her own distinguishing features. She raised Yami as her own daughter and, after finding out the organization wanted to turn Yami into a weapon, was almost killed while rescuing Yami and then fleeing for life. :Well-endowed and beautiful, she quickly becomes the object of attention of the male students of the school who consider her clumsiness (on a par with Rito's, according to Oshizu) as rather cute. Unlike others, she calls Yami \\"Eve\\". She is also an old classmate of Ryouko Mikado, and was brought to Earth by her to reunited with Yami. :As with her creation, Tearju is based upon the character of the same name from Black Cat, who has a similar role to that of Tearju in To Love Ru. =Azenda= ; : :Yami's former opponent. She arrives to Earth under Nemesis's request to fight Yami. Other characters =Peke= ; : :Peke is Lala's all-costume robot, who acts as a module to form her clothing. Peke is exceptionally devoted to Lala and has the ability to shapeshift into any kind of clothing for her to wear, but this also drains her power supply. She can also scan the clothing of people around her and duplicate those clothes. As her batteries run out, the clothing Lala wears will slowly dissolve, until it completely disappears. To recharge, Peke simply needs to sleep. Using a dress-form program, Peke has the ability to take on a human form, with the appearance of a young girl. =Saibai Yuki= ; : :Rito's father is a manga artist and is very different compared to Rito in terms of both looks and personality. Saibai draws at amazing speeds and can be utterly serious before deadlines are met, but seems to have a bit of a goofy side, such as making a joke about Rito and Lala \\"sleeping\\" together every night and punching Rito when he got drunk and mistook his son for a burglar. With the help of Lala he returns for the Christmas party, stating how much Zastin and his workers have grown since starting out. In the anime, he writes a (not-so- encouraging) letter to him at the end of the first season. =Ringo Yuki= ; : :Rito's mother is a fashion designer and a scout for fashion models. Normally working overseas, she returns home to check up on the family. Despite initially appearing to be refined and chic, Ringo's personality is equally as odd as Saibai's, where she has a tendency to start sizing women up with her hands, whenever she spots pretty girls. Ringo seems to take her work very seriously, having immediately entered \\"work-mode\\", when she meets Lala and Haruna for the first time.To Love-Ru Chapter 60. Troublesome, Isn't It? (Â§ßÂ§â„Å†„Å≠„Çß, Taihen da nƒì) Like her daughter, Ringo is also highly perceptive, able to read Haruna's feelings towards Rito. With the help of Lala, she returns for the Christmas party and mistakes Celine as her son's child. =Gid Lucion Deviluke= ; : :The King of Deviluke and Emperor of the known universe, Gid is the father of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Despite his near omnipotent power, he has the physical appearance of a young boy, looking slightly devilish, with shark-like teeth, spiky black hair, and the characteristic Devilukean tail. While his daughters' tails end in spades, his appears as a wicked looking trident. Gid's personality borders juvenile delinquency and (extreme) perversion, going as far as to use his child like appearance to get close to pretty girls, thus Lala claims the only reason he wants her to marry is so he can step down as king and be free to pursue his perverted hobbies. Lala states his current appearance is due to him using too much power during the \\"Galaxy Unification Wars\\", which desized his body, following his conquest. However, even in this form he is described to still be very powerful, stating he could destroy the Earth if he released it. :In To Love Ru Darkness, he is revealed to be back to his adult form when he has to fight Nemesis when she engages him in combat trying to kill him, he wins the fight with little effort' giving nemesis the ultimatum of surrendering or be destroyed; when she refuses he tries to kill her, but Rito steps in and allows her to live inside his body stating he sees redemption in her and will look after her for the time being, despite Gid warning him that she might betray him and start more mischief. :In the manga, he seems more easygoing and is much more accepting of Rito as his heir, where he simply wishes to relinquish the throne so he could pursue his perverted interests. However, in the anime, he is much more critical of Rito and even attacks him, saying that Rito is not suitable for Lala. =Sephie Michaela Deviluke= ; : :First referenced in Chapter 2 and formally introduced in Chapter 49 of Darkness, Sephie is the Queen of Deviluke and the mother of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Unlike the rest of her family whose middle names refer to devils, her middle name is a reference to the archangel Michael. :Sephie is the last descendant of the Charmian race and therefore possesses no tail. While her Charmian blood endows her with the most beautiful appearance and voice, it has also caused trouble for her in the past. She possesses Charm, an ability that seduces any male she comes across, causing them to lose their sanity and run wildly towards her. The first person not to be affected by her Charm ability is Gid. The second person is Rito. Gid helped Sephie restrain many males during his combat training and gained her trust. She later married Gid and had three children. :It is said that Nana's and Momo's trait to communicate with animal and plants respectively was inherited from Sephie's Charm ability. =Akiho Sairenji= ; : :Haruna's older sister, she shares her apartment with Haruna. Extremely popular with the guys (having received confessions from two men at the same time), Akiho continuously turns them down, as her sister states she is not looking for love at the moment. However, she has been dating Yuu Kotegawa.To Love-Ru Chapter 117 =Yuu Kotegawa= : :Yui's 19-year-old brother, is a ladies' man, something Yui dislikes. After finding Rito and Yui being chased by hoodlums, he defends the two from the ruffians, while commenting that he hopes Yui will grow to be more mature.To Love-Ru Chapter 86: Sister... (Â¶π„Çà„Éª„Éª„Éª, Im≈çto yo...) At the moment, he is dating Akiho, Haruna's older sister but unknown to him she isn't taking the relationship as seriously as he does.To Love-Ru Chapter 138: Happening Weather He also is one of the few people to know that Rito is Riko. =Taizou Motemitsu= ; : :The best pitcher on the baseball team at Sainan High and an arrogant womanizer, whenever a new girl comes to the school, Motemitsu will try anything to get them to go on a date with him. Greatly admired by his teammates and the male student body, Motemitsu unfortunately is a closet pervert, having taken shots of girls changing.To Love-Ru Chapter 13: The Lust Whirling Underwater (Ê∞¥‰∏≠„Å´Ê∏¶Â∑ª„ÅèÊ¨≤Êúõ, Suich≈´ ni uzumaku yokub≈ç) He was once found out taking photos of girls in the swimming pool, during a swimming class, and was suspended from school for two weeks. He also keeps a personal record of every girl in the school with him. A running gag involves Motemitsu immediately asking out (or, in one case, proposing to) any pretty girl he sees, causing his followers to comment \\"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, [whatever Motemitsu has just done]!\\", only to be instantly rejected, to which his followers say \\"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, immediately rejected!\\". He is not seen or mentioned in the later half of the manga for reasons never explained, most likely due to focus more on the growing main cast. =Principal= ; : :The unnamed principal of Sainan High is well known throughout campus as a pervert. He will enroll any girls into the school body so as to ogle and grope them without hesitation (though, according to him, they have to be \\"cute girls\\"). This groping is not limited only to Sainan High, but in public, as well. :A common gag involves the Principal spontaneously shedding his clothes and chasing after a girl he becomes smitten with, which inevitably results in him beaing beaten to a pulp. Once, Run purposefully causes herself to change into Ren to get the principal to leave her be; upon seeing Ren, the principal thinks briefly, then continues to chase him (stating \\"This is okay too\\"). :Throughout the series, the principal has survived many severe injuries and attacks. Some of these include burning, (by Kyouko) beaten up, and on one occasion, almost eaten by a crocodile in the Amazon. :The unnamed Principal bears a strong resemblance to famed erotic photographer, Nobuyoshi Araki, complete with trademarked, devil horn hair style. =Haruko Nitta= ; : :Mikan's homeroom teacher in Sainan First Elementary School (ÂΩ©ÂçóÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†° Sainan Daiichi Sh≈çgakk≈ç). She is shown to be an otaku and big fan of Saibai's work, who happens to be the Mikan's father, whom she considers to be her top student. =Sachie & Mami= ; & : :They are two of Mikan's close friends who attend Sainan First Elementary School along with her. They like to tease Mikan about her relationship with Rito. They once visit the Yuki family and, later in their visit, Sachie forgets to return Mikan's book, so they come back to the house only to see Mikan in an abnormal position with Rito. =Sayaka & Koyomi= ; & :Rito's classmates and Haruna's fellow members in the tennis club of Sainan High, Sayaka (named Matsuo (ÊùæÂ∞æ) in the first season of To Love Ru anime) and Koyomi are a duo of minor characters whose most of their appearances are simply for fan service sake, never getting involved in any major plot. =Lacospo= ; : :A small frog-like alien prince who is one of Lala's fianc√© candidates and one of the few antagonists in the first series. He is by far the most persistent of Lala's suitors and most recurring to try to win her love. Appearing multiple times in the manga to steal Lala, and even hired Yami to assassinate Rito. =Kuro= ; :An alien hitman who is based on the character Train Heartnet from Kentaro Yabuki previous work Black Cat.

Design =Firepower= Abhay features an all-electrical turret drive system and a 40 mm high-velocity cannon capable of firing APFSDS and High explosive rounds.article from the journal TechFocus of the DRDO The anti-air firing range of the 40 mm cannon is 4 km and 2.5 km for ground attack. The ICV comes loaded with a total of 210 rounds of ammunition, and its turret, housing a thermal imager using the Catherine FC, also contains a twin-launcher for the Kornet-E ATGM (anti-tank guided missile). The Abhay is operated by a crew of three, and carries seven infantry soldiers. An electro-mechanical all-electric drive (AED) for weapons control with independent stabilisation has been developed indigenously by DRDO in association with private sector industry for the turret. The purpose of the AED is to position the 40 mm cannon on to the target in azimuth and elevation and to provide twin-axis turret stabilisation against external disturbances. The AED uses brush-less drives with especially designed backlash-free elevation and traverse gearboxes coupled to the turret ring for rotation in azimuth, and to sector gears for elevation/depression of the cannon, respectively. The AED also employs vector-control technologies implemented through digital controllers and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based power amplifiers for control of the brush-less drives. It also uses fibre-optic gyros as feedback elements for the purpose of stabilisation. AED has a provision for MIL-STD-1553B databus and RS-422 interfaces for real- time connectivity. =Mobility= Abhay is powered by a Greaves Cotton TD2 V8 410 kW (550 hp) diesel engine (a power-to-weight ratio of 24 hp/tonne) and an automatic gearbox supplied by L-3 Communications. The hydro-pneumatic suspension allows for increased passenger comfort. These factors will give Abhay excellent mobility and speed. The DRDO's Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) based in Bengaluru is designing the ergonomical layout of Abhay.DRDO‚Äôs Life saving products save foreign exchange too , FIDSNS, August 30, 2007 =Protection= Abhay is fitted with NBC protection system and Laser warning detectors. =Armour= Abhay is equipped with composite armour. Two prototypes were built. The first one was with the steel armour and the second one was fitted with the composite armour. The composite armour reduces the weight by 40% compared to steel. Lighter ERA has been developed to be used on the Abhay.

The song was inspired by the manufactured nature of the Monkees and was released as a single on January 9, 1967, reaching number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failing to chart in the United Kingdom. Composition and content Written in late 1966, \\"So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" has been described by Byrds expert Tim Conners as \\"an acerbic, but good-natured swipe at the success of manufactured rock bands like the Monkees.\\" The Monkees television series had debuted in America in September 1966, and had launched the pre-fabricated band to international fame. The manufactured nature of the group caused the Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, and lead guitarist, Jim McGuinn, to look upon the current state of the pop world with more than a little cynicism‚Äîsomething that was reflected in the song's lyrics. Musically, \\"So You Want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" features a driving, circular Rickenbacker guitar riff by McGuinn and, what Conners has called an \\"unstoppable bass hook\\" from Hillman. Hillman has stated that he composed the song's bass part during a recording session for South African musician Hugh Masekela. The song also features Masekela's trumpet playing, which represents the first use of brass on a Byrds recording. In addition, \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" features the sound of hysterical teenage pop fans screaming. These screams were recorded at an August 15, 1965 Byrds' concert in Bournemouth, by the band's publicist, Derek Taylor, at McGuinn's request. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke has written that although the song's lyrics are heavily sarcastic, beneath the playful cynicism there is a deeper, implicit irony to the song; The Byrds had, themselves, achieved almost overnight success with the release of their debut single, a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". However, the band members all knew, from their common bitter personal experiences, that the most difficult part of success was in remaining successful, staying ahead of the curve artistically, and staying sane under the immense pressure of stardom. During an interview with music journalist Pete Frame, McGuinn said: > Some people have accused us of being bitter for writing that song, but it's > no more bitter than \\"Positively 4th Street.\\" In fact, it isn't as bitter as > that. We were thumbing through a teen magazine and looking at all the > unfamiliar faces and we couldn't help thinking: \\"Wow, what's happening ‚Ä¶ all > of a sudden here is everyone and his brother and his sister-in-law and his > mother and even his pet bullfrog singing rock 'n' roll.\\" So we wrote \\"So You > Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" to the audience of potential rock stars, > those who were going to be, or who wanted to be, and those who actually did > go on to realize their goals. Release Upon release, the band performed the song on a number of television programs, including Popside, Top of the Pops, Drop In, The David Frost Show, and Beat-Club. The band also performed \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" as the final song of their appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, with the help of guest musicians Hugh Masekela and Big Black. The Byrds' performance of the song at Monterey is included on the 1992 The Monterey International Pop Festival CD box set. In addition to its appearance on the Younger Than Yesterday album, \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965‚Äì1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season. Live performances of the song are included on the live portion of The Byrds' (Untitled) album, as well as on the Live at the Fillmore - February 1969 and Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971 albums. Cover versions The two earliest cover versions of \\"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" were by the Royal Guardsmen, on their 1967 album The Return of the Red Baron, and the British band the Move, who included the song on their 1968 EP, Something Else from The Move. Hookfoot, the British group who served as Elton John's backing band for a number of years, also released the song as a single in 1974. The song was covered by Scottish hard rock band Nazareth, as part of the track \\"Telegram\\", on their 1976 album Close Enough for Rock 'n' Roll. Black Oak Arkansas covered the song on their 1977 The Best of Black Oak Arkansas album, with the song later being included on the Hot & Nasty: The Best of Black Oak Arkansas compilation album in 1993. In 1979, \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" was recorded by the Patti Smith Group and released as the third single from their album Wave. The song was also covered by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their Southern Accents tour, and it appears on the 1985 live album, Pack Up the Plantation: Live! In 1984, McGuinn joined R.E.M. on stage at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey, for a rendition of \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\". R.E.M.'s Peter Buck explained: \\"When we played 'Rock 'n' Roll Star', where it has that part where it goes 'la la la la la la la', he played C-F-G, and I said, 'That's weird, we do C-D-G'. Then he played it that way and said, 'You know, I like that better. I think I'll change it'. And I went, 'You mean you're going to change the chord of the song?' and he went, 'Yeah, I've never played it that way, and I like it a lot better'. Roger McGuinn's been playing that song for twenty years, and here I suggest he plays it this way, and he does!\\" Unrest recorded a version of \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" in 1985 for their self-titled debut album. They later re- recorded the song during the sessions for their fourth album, Malcolm X Park, released in 1988. Crowded House performed the song (along with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Eight Miles High\\") with McGuinn in Los Angeles on April 7, 1989. The performances were released as B-sides on the \\"I Feel Possessed\\" CD single. The Swedish pop group Roxette included the song in their 1993 MTV Unplugged show. Ronnie Wood also covered \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" on his 2001 solo album, Not for Beginners. The German Alternative Rock/Punk Band Beatsteaks covered the song on their 2004 \\"Hand in Hand\\" single. In 2006, Les Fradkin released a cover version of the song on his album Goin' Back. Also, the Dutch rock band Golden Earring covered the song as a bonus track on their This Wheel's on Fire CD single. Jon Bon Jovi has also covered the song in live concerts. Pearl Jam have covered \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" a number of times at live concerts. Pearl Jam's singer, Eddie Vedder, also covered it during his 2012 American solo tour. The British rock band Charlie released a song titled \\"Killer Cut\\" in 1979, that is essentially a sequel to \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" and begins with the lyrics \\"So you want to be a rock and roll star, well, times have changed/That's all I'll say/You still need an electric guitar but most of all you need that radio, radio play.\\" Counting Crows have been known to perform a few lines from \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" as an introduction to their song \\"Mr. Jones\\" during live performances.

Although having a Y-chromosome and male internal organs, at birth they tend to appear externally female and are raised as girls. Around puberty, the onset of male hormones causes virilization and their actual sex becomes apparent. At this point, they switch genders and are raised as boys. This is a common enough occurrence that it does not cause much concern among the townspeople, who are accustomed to it.

Sedan services exist in many places, though the exact definition, along with regulations, may vary in different places. In some places, the term refers to a more luxurious service than taxicabs, while in other areas, it is a cheaper alternative. In most places, the ride must be prearranged, and a sedan driver is not legally permitted to pick up a hailing passenger like a taxicab. Also, most sedan services do not use meters like taxicabs, but rather charge by the mile, following the odometer. Where sedan services are cheaper, many such providers use older vehicles, and do not have the same level of protection as taxicabs, which has raised concerns in some places for both the drivers and passengers.

It is the oldest residence in Raleigh on its original foundation. In addition to the house, the Park includes the birthplace of President Andrew Johnson, the Ellen Mordecai Garden, the Badger- Iredell Law Office, Allen Kitchen and St. Mark's Chapel, a popular site for weddings.\\"Mordecai Historic Park\\" , Raleigh, North Carolina It is located in the Mordecai Place Historic District. The oldest portion of the house was built by Joel Lane for his son, Henry. At one time, the plantation house was the center of a plantation, one of the largest in Wake County. Lane is considered a founder of Raleigh, as 1,000 acres was sold from his plantation as the site of the city. The house was named after Moses Mordecai, whose first wife, Margaret Lane, had inherited it from her father Henry. After she died, Mordecai married her sister Ann Lane. In 1824, Mordecai hired William Nichols, State Architect at the time, to enlarge the house. The addition was considered a significant work of Nichols, who had also been responsible for remodeling the original building containing the State House. With the addition of the four new rooms in 1826, the Mordecai house was transformed into a Greek Revival mansion. The Mordecai family, descended from immigrant grandfather Moses Mordecai (1707‚Äì1781) of Bonn, Germany, became one of the original three hundred Jewish families in the United States and one of the few of Ashkenazic Jewish descent.Burial: Mikveh Israel Cemetery Philadelphia Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA Created by: Ruby Mordecai. Record added: Dec 28, 2006 Find A Grave Memorial# 17200311 The family members were prominent in local and state affairs. Jacob Mordecai, Moses' father, founded a girls' school in Warrenton, North Carolina. A prominent lawyer, Moses Mordecai was a member of the 1805 Court of Conference. With his first wife Margaret, Moses Mordecai had two sons, Henry and Jacob, and one daughter, Ellen. He and his second wife Ann had a daughter, named Margaret after his late wife, Ann's sister. Henry Mordecai became a prosperous planter at Mordecai House and was elected to the State Legislature. The family were also prominent slave owners, and many slaves, both those who worked in the home and those who worked the fields, lived on the former plantation. The State Historic site narrates the stories of both the free and enslaved residents, including moving testimonials from three former slaves . His daughter Margaret Mordecai married and inherited the mansion; her descendants owned and occupied Mordecai House until 1967. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Mordecai family sold off land, which was subdivided for the continuing expansion of Raleigh. In 1867, George Washington Mordecai donated land east of the city to establish a Confederate cemetery; he donated another plot for Wake County's first Hebrew Cemetery. (The adjacent Oakwood Cemetery, chartered in 1869, became the namesake of the large suburb that developed in the adjoining wooded land, which was earlier known as Mordecai Grove. In 1974, Oakwood became the first neighborhood in Raleigh to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.) Mordecai descendants owned the mansion property until 1967, when the house and its surrounding block were put on the market. Local preservationists protested and the city purchased the property, turning it over to the Raleigh Historic Sites Commission to supervise and develop as a historic park. The commission was able to obtain many original Mordecai furnishings, as well as preserve the family papers and library. Mordecai Historic Park is now managed by the City of Raleigh's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Department. The Mordecai House is a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark. Mordecai House was featured in a season two episode of Ghost Hunters in which the TAPS team investigated claims of paranormal activity.

It was staged for the first time at the Tricycle Theatre in 2008 directed by Ramin Gray, and featured Derbhle Crotty, Tom Burke, John McInerny, and Gerard Murphy in the cast. Overview The play is set in Ireland during the 18th century. A soldier of the English army has two illegitimate children by his mistress, a local woman. His upcoming departure for England triggers a dramatic series of events. Young cattle-killer Dermot is a Celtic Caliban. He becomes the instrument of his mother Maryanne revenge against his own father, Lieutenant Coyle. Butler said of the play, More than anything I want to put the audience in the eye of the storm. There are a lot of plays about war and colonialism that are wry and ironic and theoretical and that‚Äôs all very well, but it‚Äôs always taking a step backwards from the reality. Reviews Dominic Cavendish of The Telegraph said that \\"this lush, savage, nightmarish imagining of colonial Ireland circa 1762 suggests an imagination that has suddenly, gloriously and recklessly taken wing\\", claiming that he was \\"thrilled at the provocation of it, transfixed by its darkness\\" and that \\"as a vision of a world without hope, it is too terrifying to dismiss.\\" Andrew Billen of the New Statesman, however, \\"resented having been trapped in a room for 110 minutes with a work that took itself so seriously it did not even allow us an interval\\", commenting that \\"it was like being held hostage by a violent lunatic.\\"http://www.newstatesman.com/theatre/2008/03/devil-rsc- london-play-audience While Michael Billington of The Guardian felt that \\"while Butler makes clear the irony of conscripted converts to Protestantism helping to oppress the local Catholics, he clouds the action with cloudy symbolism\\", admitting, however, that he \\"was left to enjoy the handful of scenes that really work\\". Rebecca Omonira, writing for IndieLondon, however, commented that the \\"enigmatic play had me ‚Äì and the rest of the audience ‚Äì enthralled from start to finish\\", praising it as \\"a graphic depiction of the worst of humanity\\" which \\"relentlessly shows how ordinary people become complicit conspirators in torture and rape.\\".http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre- Review/ill-be-the-devil-tricycle-theatre-review The Daily Mail praised it as \\"a gripping play and an extraordinary piece of writing which comes at you in a blizzard of diseased banter‚Äù,http://www.tricycle.co.uk/home/about-the- tricycle-pages/about-us-tab-menu/archive/archived-theatre-production/ill-be- the-devil-2/ while Julie Carpenter writing for the Daily Express described it as \\"a violent, unforgiving and immensely powerful play that is not for the faint-hearted\\". =Other reviews= *http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/illbedevil-rev http://www.extraextra.org/Review_I'll_Be_the_Devil-08.html References External links  2008 plays Fiction set in the 18th century English plays Plays and musicals based on The Tempest Plays by Leo Butler Plays set in Ireland ","title":"I'll Be The Devil"},{"id":"16120853","text":"WLGZ may refer to: * WLGZ-FM, a radio station (102.7 FM) licensed to serve Webster, New York, United States * WDCX (AM), a radio station (990 AM) licensed to serve Rochester, New York, United States, which used the call sign WLGZ from December 1999 to May 2008 ","title":"WLGZ"},{"id":"16120859","text":"Don Juan is a town in the Monte Plata province of the Dominican Republic.

Sabana de la Mar is located in the northeastern of Dominican Republic, on the southern side of Samana Bay. It is an urban area with 508.52 km2. It was founded in 1760, foundation initiated by the Governor Francisco Rubio and Pe√±aranda in 1756 at the same time as the one of the Peninsula of Santa B√°rbara of Saman√°, along with a group of explorers from the Canary Islands. Eventually, other Europeans came to the community: Swiss, Italians, and the working class of African descent. The economy of 10,582 inhabitants is based on agriculture, fishing, and Government jobs. A large portion of the Haitises National Park and the San Lorenzo Bay are located in Sabana de la Mar. Environmental issues are a great concern for this community. Since the 20th Century, Sabana de la Mar has been recognized as the birthplace, on December 1, 1892, of Se√±orita Elupina Cordero. She became blind at a very early age and developed a mystical and religious personality that has attracted thousands of followers. While alive, she was known for curing different types of illnesses with her prayers, touch, and natural remedies using herbs she grew in her garden. There is the Chapel Se√±orita Elupina Cordero, where she is buried. It has become a must pilgrimage for hundreds of people from all over.

History Nick Abbot was born on 22 August 1960, and was educated at George Heriot's School, an independent school for boys in Edinburgh, and at Brunel University in Uxbridge in West London, where he gained an upper-second class degree in psychology. His professional career began as a Virgin Megastore DJ. He had previously presented student radio at Brunel University's radio station, Radio Brunel. In early 1987, he joined Radio Luxembourg to present an overnight music show. After hearing American talk show presenter Neil Rogers, Abbot was inspired and the show instead became a phone in. Eventually, a 'straight to air' format was settled upon, where calls would be taken unscreened. This format quickly became a hit with listeners. The absence of a delay system to 'dump' offensive language resulted in callers saying swear words just before they were cut off. It is believed that Abbot was one of the first (if not the first) to take calls straight to air, and later LBC colleague Iain Lee has often confessed that he stole some of his act from Nick (as well as Clive Bull and Tommy Boyd), perhaps hinting he got the inspiration for his \\"Triple M\\" show from Nick Abbot in addition to Boyd's \\"Human Zoo\\" show. In October 1988, Abbot launched the new BBC radio station for London, BBC GLR (Greater London Radio). He presented the breakfast show for a year, but his contract was not renewed. He then returned to VMR, where he stayed until 1993.  Radio work in the 1990s  = Virgin Radio = Abbot was part of the original line-up on Virgin Radio in April 1993. There he presented the weekday late night phone-in show SundayThursday from 10pm to 2am. The programme was a mixture of music and phone-in. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often voiced his opinions about other stations and presenters, and it was this that eventually led him into trouble. Following a negative newspaper review by writer Robin Katz, Abbot's outbursts on-air eventually led to a censure from the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Radio Authority. He also called phone-in shows on other radio stations, speaking to the phone operators, and commenting on the usually elderly callers while listening to the programmes while on hold. Usually, he failed to make it on air, but occasionally he did, including a memorable call to the Scottie McClue show. In June 1994 he was moved to the weekday 710pm show where he had to tone down his act, mainly taking music requests. In January 1995, he moved back to the weekday late night show (this time from 11pm to 2am) where he remained until April that year when he was moved to the drivetime show (47pm). He was dismissed from the station in September that year, leaving Virgin Radio with a fine of ¬£5,000 for a sexual reference about a fellow DJ, and a further ¬£20,000 for allowing a caller graphically to describe a sexual practice. = Talk Radio = In the summer of 1996, Abbot was heard on Talk Radio UK acting as holiday cover. He was subsequently offered a regular show during the summer of 1997 on Saturday afternoons, alongside Carol McGiffin, later moving to Saturday evenings from 7:30pm to 10 pm. =Return to Virgin= It was during this period that Virgin Radio's new management re-hired Abbot to cover various shows on the station. He took over the evening show for six weeks during the summer of 1997, as well as providing holiday cover. In early 1998, he took over the weekday afternoon show on Virgin Radio from 1pm to 4 pm, while continuing with his Saturday evening show on Talk Radio. In May 1998 (while still presenting his daily show on Virgin Radio) he took over the weekday evening show on Talk Radio UK from 7pm to 9 pm. Black Thursday  Thursday 12 November 1998 was known as Black Thursday. Talk Radio UK had been taken over by new management, and many presenters and staff were fired. Abbot was one of the many casualties. He continued with his weekday show on Virgin Radio, which was now extended to six days a week from 1pm to 4 pm SundaysFridays. LBC Between March and September 1999, long-established London station LBC hired Abbot & McGiffin for a Saturday evening phone-in, similar in format to the duo's earlier Talk Radio show. During this time, he continued working for Virgin Radio as a DJ. Throughout the summer of 2000, he presented a Sunday morning phone-in show on Virgin, also hosting the weekday afternoon show. Later that year he moved to the drivetime slot, until leaving Virgin once again, in May 2001. He also provided holiday cover for Chris Evans. =Real Radio= In late 2001, Abbot joined Real Radio (Wales) to host its late-night phone-in show for a week as holiday cover for regular presenter Adrian Allen. October 2001 saw the beginning of a five-day stint at Manchester's Key 103, during which he presented the 10pm2am programme. In January 2002, he moved to Real Radio (Scotland) where he again presented the late night phone-in. Later in 2002, his show was networked across all three Real Radio stations (Scotland, Wales & Yorkshire). He presented his last Real Radio show on 19 December 2002, subsequently deciding to take a break from radio for over two years. = Return to radio = On 3 September 2005 Abbot was heard on London's 102.2 Smooth FM, presenting the Saturday morning show. He stood in for various presenters, including on 'Weekend Breakfast', and covered shows on digital station Planet Rock. This became a regular gig from 17 December 2005 onwards, airing on Saturdays and Sundays from 2‚Äì6 pm. In 2006, he had brief stint standing in on Caroline Feraday's weekend show (10 pm1 am, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights) on LBC 97.3, from 10‚Äì19 February. However, he lost his voice during his second show, cutting the show short and being replaced by a recording of his friend and former Virgin and Talk colleague/sparring partner Wendy Lloyd. He was also unable to present the following evening's show but returned on 17 February for the final three shows of this stint. He subsequently took over a regular slot on LBC on Saturday nights from 10pm to 1am. Abbot's show had a distinctive style among LBC presenters. It became normal for a summary of the week's news to take place at the start of the show over his opening jingle, \\"Boogie Woogie\\" by Liberace (replacing the theme tune he had previously used: \\"The Beautiful People\\" by Marilyn Manson). During the show, he played various sound clips including quotes from films such as The Terminator, and clips from his former co-presenter Carol McGiffin. In late 2007, he took over LBC's weekday evening show from 7pm to 10pm, while continuing with the Planet Rock weekend show (the latter ending in September 2008). = Current work = Abbot now presents a Friday, Saturday & Sunday night show on LBC from 10pm to 1am. Featuring commentary and discussion on current affairs and other subjects the show has a strong emphasis on humour. His links and commentaries are punctuated by short dialogue clips drawn from film soundtracks and politicians. Calls to the programme are often on serious topics, and callers are given free rein. Abbot also usually presents a week of A to Z themed shows on LBC during the festive period, covers for other LBC presenters on an occasional basis and writes a blog for the LBC website. In March 2017 he launched a new podcast entitled The Nick Abbot Habit with a second series started in September 2018. On 5 July 2019, Abbot announced on his show that he and his friend/former co-host Carol McGiffin are set to reunite for a new podcast series called \\"What‚Äôs Your Problem?\\" The podcast was released on iTunes, Global player app, and podcast providers on 20 January 2020. Books Abbot has written a series of books, mainly on topics and news from the time of publishing, including Listen to me, I Know Everything and Do You Mind If I Say A Few Words, which chart his columns through a specific time period.

The factory today is in Razgrad. In 1990 there were 96 toy manufacturers in Bulgaria - producers' co-operative societies and factories. Thirteen of them formed the State Economic Group \\"–î–°–û –ú–õ–ê–î–û–°–¢\\" / \\"DSO Mladost\\"). Nowadays there is only one toy manufacturer left - \\"–ú–ò–†\\"/\\"MIR\\" (from the communist era) to \\"–ú–ò–ö–†–û\\" / \\"MIKRO\\" a.k.a. \\"–ú–ò–ö–†–û'67\\" / \\"MIKRO'67\\" (post-communist era). Nowadays both the Mikro and Mikro'67 names are used interchangeably.  The factory  The Mikro'67 factory In 1952 in one of the workshops of TPK (producers' co-operative society) Metalik differentiated team of workers for toys manufacturing. With a great effort and ambition the first toy was handmade - a wind-up chain tractor. The production list was growing - trucks, dumpers, diggers, a cannon, a car, a rocket and more. The volume of production and the number of the workers were growing; these were factors for the creation of a new independent factory. On January 1, 1967, it was established and independent producers' co-operative society for toys manufacturing with chairman Petar Petrov. A question then arose - how was the new manufacturer to be named? With a number of opinions and suggestions, the most adequate of them was \\"Peace\\", because peace means joy and carefree childhood for children all over the world. In 1971, the workers moved into a new building. Introduction of new technologies had then begun. Typical for that time were battery-operated toys - machine guns, telephones, SAU tanks and more. The range of toys produced widened. On July 1, 1971, the name was changed from \\"TPK Mir\\" to \\"Mir factory\\" and became a part of DSO Mladost, a part of Committee for Youth and Sport and later a part from the Ministry of Light industry. The adoption of new series of Tonka (USA) toys has begun. The production list grew up to 40 different toys. The unification of parts and products started. For the first time, the company expanded out of Bulgaria and began exporting products to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Cuba, Albania, and Jordan. Almost 80% of the production was exported. On August 1, 1980 the name was changed from \\"Mir factory\\" to \\"Mir Youth factory.\\" In 1983, topyl printing, assembling the toy boxes with PVX glue, moulding, and plastic parts metalling. A the English company Matchbox's technology for the production of toys using the moulding method was licensed during this time. FIve different casts were made and eight more in 1984. In 1984 the toys from the MUKPO series were awarded with a gold medal at the International Fair in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The toys from the HOBBY series were evaluated with the highest rank for \\"K\\" quality. In November 1986 a workers team for the manufacture of ski automates licensed from the West Germany company Marker was formed.  Matchbox  After making a deal with the Matchbox company in 1983 the factory initiated the production of the first five Matchbox Superfast models and the first few Superking models. The pearl-colored paint on the models was not very durable, although this problem later improved. The wheels sets were imported. Today it is very hard to find mint condition models from that time‚Äîeven in Bulgaria. Up until 1989, seventeen Superfast models and seven Superking models were introduced. Although all of the models had minor variations, they were essentially alike. Importantly, there was one primary condition for leasing the dies to the Bulgarian manufacturer - all the models produced were intended to be sold only to the Bulgarian market‚Äîwith no exports permitted. Around 100,000-150,000 pieces of each casting were made. Additionally, after using the new dies, the factory was expected to return them. In 1991, after the Cold War had ended, production began on the \\"second wave\\" of Superfast models. In the beginning there were again limited variations, but some of the early editions have the decals and the colors of the original models. After a few years, business relations soured between the Matchbox company and their Bulgarian partner. It seemed that after opening the borders, many of these Bulgarian models were sold abroad and some were very popular. The Matchbox company eventually broke the contract with Mikro, but they were unable get back the dies for some models. The results of this split are that the nowadays Mattel does not recognize Bulgarian models as authentic Matchbox and that there are thousands of new variations by color, stamps, and wheels. At the end of the 1990s Mukro'67 began offering advertising graphics for their models. Customers who wanted to personalize cars with a name, brand, or a graphic could get a manufacturing deal for customized Bulgarian Matchbox models. There was a condition - the customer had to order 100 pieces or more, although the models were allowed to be different. This marketing tool was used by local companies to promote products targeting children and adolescents and other companies related to auto care and auto parts. International Matchbox and other diecast model clubs also got some limited edition models for their members during special events. The quality of the models has slowly degraded. This, the uniform production list for more than 15 years, and the higher prices and other issues are all factors for lower production numbers nowadays. From time to time, shortages of certain parts cause new wheel variations to appear - sometimes even non-Matchbox models receive Matchbox wheels and vice versa.  Gama  In 1985, parallel with the Matchbox models, production began on the Gama models. For the first 1‚Äì2 years, they were all kit models for user-assembly and available in only one color‚Äîpearl grass green. Later, they started making factory-assembled models. Some Gama models are still in production.  Schuco  In 1994, Mikro started making Gama/Schuco models for the German market. In the first few years of production, they were unavailable on the Bulgarian market, but a limited number of models that didn't meet the German criteria for quality slipped from the factory and got into the hands of local collectors. Mikro was making mainly Opel models, although there were few BMW models and Mercedes Vito, promotional models and construction and other vehicles. The models were made and boxed in cheap boxes, exported to Germany where they were then transferred into their original Schuco boxes. Unlike the Matchbox models, neither the Gama nor the Schuco models has a sign on the base plate reading \\"Made in Bulgaria.\\" In fact, some of them even have the \\"Made in Germany\\" or \\"Made in W. Germany\\" insignia. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that the country of manufacture could affect sales because some collectors consider the German or Chinese editions to have better quality.  Other models  Mikro'67 made and still makes some pressed steel Buddy L, Clover and Tonka toys. Between 2004 and 2008, five NZG diecast models were made. Only one diecast model was actually 100% designed and made in Bulgaria. A few models were based on Yaxon, Kidco, and Unimax models.  Media  The Mikro'67 website is fairly updated and doesn't target the diecast models. Product/model catalogs never have been issued to customers or collectors, and there are only two known editions of brochures (of A4 size): one from the 1980s and one from 1991 intended for merchants or given to potential customers at toy and industrial fairs.

The words and music were written by Joseph Burleson Peavey in 1939. The title of the song was adopted as the official domain name for Mississippi State athletics and for all social media platforms of the athletic department in 2014. Rally Cry Hail State, as the rally cry of the athletic program at Mississippi State, began to rise in popularity around 2010. With the rise in prominence of the football team under Coach Dan Mullen and a major marketing push from the Athletic Department, the phrase began making its way into the everyday lexicon of the Mississippi State fan base. Social Media Hail State became the official hashtag of Mississippi State Athletics and Academics around the 2010 football season. It has trended nationally and internationally at different momentous moments in the recent athletic history of the university. Mississippi State was the first university to paint a hashtag (#hailstate) onto a playing surface. The football program painted #hailstate in the north end zone at Davis-Wade Stadium. This act and future hashtags was later banned by the NCAA for all institutions. Use in football games Hail State is played by the Famous Maroon Band at the start of each home game and after each time the team scores. There are several abbreviated versions that are played as stand tunes or in combination with the full theme. Lyrics Hail dear ol' State! Fight for that victory today. Hit that line and tote that ball, Cross the goal before you fall! And then we'll yell, yell, yell, yell! For dear ol' State we'll yell like H-E-L-L! Fight for Mis-sis-sip-pi State, Win that game today! Alternate last line Many Mississippi State fans replace the last line \\"Win the game today!\\" with \\"Go to hell Ole Miss!\\", a tongue-in-cheek jab at their rivals. Fans have also been known to shout this at the end of the U.S. National Anthem, regardless of the game, sport or team playing.

Early life and World War I Born in Marseilles of a Corsican seafaring family, Coli became a merchant captain, married, and produced three daughters. Upon outbreak of World War I he offered his services to the French Navy. Reportedly disillusioned because no warships needed a captain, he entered the army as a private. His age and experience gained him a commission in 1915 and that summer he was promoted to captain. Suffering multiple wounds, he was declared unfit for infantry service and transferred to the French Air Service, gaining his pilot's brevet in March 1916. Late that year he joined Escadrille N.62 and rose to command the squadron in February 1917. Captain Coli remained as chief of the Escadrille des Coqs even after losing an eye in a crash in March 1918. He departed the Roosters that August with a reputation as an exceptional navigator and leader. Post-war career L'Oiseau Blanc After the war Coli began a series of record-setting distance flights. On January 26, 1919, he achieved the first double crossing of the Mediterranean with Lieutenant Henri Roget. The flight established the over-water distance record of 735 kilometers (457 statute miles) in five hours. On May 24, again with Roget, Coli set a long-distance record from Paris to Port Lyautey, Morocco, a distance of . He was injured in the crash at the end of the flight. The following year, 1920, with Joseph Sadi-Lecointe, Coli made further long- distance flights around the Mediterranean. In 1923 Coli began planning a nonstop transatlantic flight with wartime comrade Paul Tarascon, a leading flying ace. In 1925 they became interested in the Orteig prize of $25,000 for the first flight between Paris and New York. Late in 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane and Tarascon was badly burned. A new aircraft was sought, and Tarascon relinquished his place as pilot to Charles Nungesser. They took off from Paris on May 8, 1927, in the biplane L'Oiseau Blanc, but disappeared en route. In 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. p 14.

Anzac Day is the anniversary of the landing of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War I. This was the first major battle Australian or New Zealand troops had been in, and losses were severe. From 1916, the day was given over to commemoration of the Anzacs who died in this battle. In 1920 the Reform Government of New Zealand passed the Anzac Day Act 1920 to make the day an official public holiday. This stated that the day was in \\"commemoration of the part taken by New Zealand troops in World War I, and in memory of those who gave their lives for the Empire\\" rather than only those who died at Gallipoli. The Act stated that the day would be observed \\"as a public holiday\\", banned the holding of horse races on Anzac Day and required the closing of licensed premises on the same basis as Christmas Day and Good Friday. The following year the Act was amended by repealing the sections on licensed premises and horse-racing, and stated that the day would be observed 'as if Anzac Day were a Sunday' rather than as a public holiday, perhaps in order to better express the quasi- religious mood of the day. Following World War II, the 1920 Act was repealed and replaced with the Anzac Day Act 1949. The day became one of commemoration of the part taken by New Zealand servicemen and women in the Second World War and the Boer War as well as World War I, and in memory of \\"those who gave their lives for New Zealand and the British Empire or Commonwealth of Nations\\". It also banned employers from transferring their employees' Anzac Day holiday or holiday pay to another day. In 1966 the 1949 Act was repealed and replaced with the Anzac Day Act 1966. This specified that the day was in commemoration of those who \\"at any time have given their lives for New Zealand the British Empire or Commonwealth of Nations\\". It also specified that when Anzac Day falls on a Sunday it will be observed on the Sunday and not moved to the Monday, and made the day a half-day rather than full-day holiday, with any activities normally permitted on a Saturday allowed after 1pm. The Act also allowed the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (a veterans' association) to establish charitable trusts. The 1966 Act was passed following several years of controversy over the Anzac Day holiday. Many people resented that sport and other entertainment was banned (generally by local authorities rather than central government), especially as there was a widespread perception that returned servicemen spent the day drinking. At the same time, some felt that the day had become less respected, and simply a 'day off' for most. The law was changed with the support of the RSA and followed partial liberalisation of the day by several local councils. In debates on the Act, MP Sir Basil Arthur and former Prime Minister Walter Nash suggested that New Zealanders should be ashamed that they could not set an entire day aside for remembrance. The Evening Post newspaper, however, argued that if the day was not changed it 'was surely destined to die not many years hence'.Helen Robinson, 'Lest we Forget? The Fading of New Zealand War Commemorations, 1946‚Äì1966', New Zealand Journal of History, 44, 1 (2010). In 2013, the Holidays (Full Recognition of Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day) Amendment Act 2013 was passed, with the effect that if Anzac Day should fall on a Saturday or Sunday, for those employees who would not work otherwise work on that Saturday or Sunday, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday. The 1966 Act remains part of New Zealand law.

The church, located at 509 N. Florida Avenue, is predominantly a Romanesque structure, with other elements. The church is home to Sacred Heart Parish, part of the West Hillsborough Deanery of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Petersburg.\\"Parishes and Missions\\". Diocese of St. Petersburg. Retrieved March 4, 2010. The first Catholic parish on Florida's West Coast was established in 1860 and named St. Louis Parish in honor of Fr. Luis de Cancer, a Dominican missionary who was martyred on the shores of Tampa Bay in 1549. The initial wooden-frame building called St. Louis Church was erected on the site where Sacred Heart stands today. In 1888 the Jesuits took over the pastoral responsibilities of the parish, after a serious outbreak of yellow fever in Tampa took the lives of three diocesan priests. Using Tampa as their base, the Jesuits were given the responsibility of all of South Florida by Bishop Moore. In 1905, a new Church was constructed in Romanesque style and the parish was renamed Sacred Heart. As Tampa grew, so did the parish, and by 1897 it was decided that a new church was needed. Construction on the church began with a groundbreaking on February 16, 1898, with the laying of the cornerstone taking place on February 4, 1900. The dedication of Sacred Heart Church took place on January 15, 1905, and at that time the parish was renamed Sacred Heart Parish.\\"Sacred Heart Parish History\\". Sacred Heart Catholic Church. Retrieved March 4, 2010. The architect for the new Sacred Heart Church was Nicholas J. Claytonhttp://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utaaa/00020/aaa-00020.html Information of Nicholas J. Clayton of Galveston, TX, who designed many Roman Catholic Churches in Texas and throughout the southern United States. The granite and marble structure includes a 135-foot dome, solid oak pews and doors, porcelain tiles, and a Carrara marble altar. Its 70 stained glass windows were designed and manufactured for Sacred Heart by Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany. The facility is a popular location for weddings, having hosted weddings for some parish families going back as many as six generations. The parish operated a school, Sacred Heart Academy, which it established in 1931, on Florida Avenue in the city's Tampa Heights neighborhood. However, due to the changing demographics of the immediate area, Sacred Heart Academy was forced to close at the end of the 2011-12 school year. Previously affiliated with Sacred Heart Parish was another Tampa institution, Jesuit High School, founded in 1899, which thrives today. 2010 Catholic Heritage MarkerIn 2005, after the 100th anniversary of Sacred Heart Church, the Jesuit community which had long served the parish withdrew in order to concentrate on their academic institutions throughout the South. The fourth bishop of the Diocese of St. Petersburg, Most Rev. Robert Lynch, invited the Franciscan Friars of the Most Holy Name of Jesus Province to assume the pastoral responsibilities for the parish. The current pastor is Father George Corrigan, OFM. In 2010 the Diocese of St. Petersburg added a Catholic Heritage Marker to the church exterior, recognizing its historic significance.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=37795  See also  *Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Petersburg *St. Louis Catholic Cemetery References Sacred Heart Church interior.

It is home to over 10 galleries, museums and collections and is known for its street art. It is roughly bounded by North 36th Street (US 27) (north), North 20th Street (south), I-95 (west) and Northeast First Avenue (east). It is one of the largest open-air street art installations in the world. History Letters of \\"war\\" spray painted over space picture and oversprayed with \\"FC preserved\\" The Wynwood Art District Association was founded in early 2003 by a group of art dealers, artists and curators Mark Coetzee, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric. Mark Coetzee initiated the idea based on a similar project, Art Night, which he started in his hometown, Cape Town, South Africa. Founding members at the first meeting in Rocket Projects media room were Brook Dorsch of Emerson Dorsch Gallery, Weston Charles, Cooper and Elizabeth Withstandley of Locust Projects, Mark Coetzee of the Rubell Collection, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric of Rocket Projects, Bernice Steinbaum of Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, and Marina Kessler of Marina Kessler Gallery. The association created the Second Saturdays Gallery Walk, designed the Manhole cover logo along with the light banners that hang on street corners, and publishes annual brochures with a map and a list of the association's members. The neighborhood thrived on the growth of Art Basel Miami Beach and it was once home to over 70 galleries, five museums, three collections, seven art complexes, 12 art studios, five art fairs, and the Wynwood Walls. As of 2018, less than ten galleries remain as the neighborhood struggles with gentrification and increased rent. The Wynwood Walls were created in 2009 by the late Tony Goldman in an effort to develop the area's pedestrian potential. Goldman bought his first building in Wynwood in 2004, and owned nearly two dozen properties by 2008. Artists from around the world have contributed to the Wynwood Walls. The Walls have been covered by media such as the New York Times and the BBC bringing international attention to the destination. It was also featured in the docu-series entitled Here Comes the Neighborhood. The Walls have expanded to include murals outside the neighborhood, including Outside the Walls which features art covering entire buildings. In 2010, Goldman added the Wynwood Doors to highlight smaller artists. Curbed listed Wynwood Walls as among the 16 most Instagrammable places in US cities in 2018. Every second Saturday of each month, a community-wide art walk is held. Galleries, art studios, alternative spaces and showrooms open their doors to the public for art, music and refreshments. In addition, The Wynwood Walls has grown to have more than 400 businesses in the area. There are 30 food stops within this 50 block art district.

The name is found in Great Britain and in other places throughout the world settled by the English. According to the 2000 census there are fewer than 1300 Camps in the UK. The 2000 US census puts the number at over 27,000, making it the 1087th most common name in America, after McDermott.. The Australian government currently reports 465 persons named Camp. The governments of Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa do not currently provide lists of surnames as the UK and others do. Totals outside the English-speaking world are also unknown. Origins People with the surname Camp have no single origin or ancestor, the name instead having been chosen by different families over a few centuries. The name is sometimes a variant spelling of \\"Kemp\\", which comes from the Old West Germanic \\"kampo-z\\", meaning \\"a contest, or fight\\", which in turn became the Old English \\"kemp\\", for a \\"fighter\\" or \\"soldier.\\" However, the name usually denotes a family whose house was on an open field, or \\"camp\\", rather than in the woods or elsewhere. The word was borrowed from the Middle French \\"camp\\", its first use in English, in 1528, being for a \\"place where an army lodges temporarily\\", only later transferring to a non-military use sometime after 1560. The French \\"camp\\" (later \\"champ\\") is itself derived from the Latin \\"campus\\", which also meant an \\"open field\\", but also and especially an \\"open space for military exercise\\". Coincidentally, the word's martial sense had been borrowed by the Germanic tribes during their conflicts with the Romans to become the aforementioned \\"kampo-z\\". Throughout the English-speaking world, but especially the United States, the name is sometimes derived from other, often longer, European names (e.g. the Italian \\"Campesi\\" or the Dutch \\"Van de Kamp\\") which were changed during the process of cultural assimilation. Camp can also be a shortening or anglicizing of similar French names, such as \\"de Camp\\" and \\"du Camp\\".

The firm specializes in the construction and design of concrete skateparks and skate plazas, skateable art sculptures, several styles of ramps, and courses for skateboarding, BMX and motocross events. History The company began in the 1980s when founder and president, Aaron Spohn, was living in Venice Beach, California. He and his friends would skate the streets of Venice and occasionally build makeshift ramps on the boardwalk. The City would tolerate these ramps for a few weeks at a time before tearing them out. Spohn lobbied for several years for the City of Venice Beach to build a skatepark where he and other skaters could safely and legally skate. Spohn eventually built a half-pipe in his backyard, which he named \\"Spohn Ranch\\". Contest organizers began approaching Spohn about building ramps for their events. In the early 1990s, the ESPN television network developed the X Games annual sports event, and in 1995 Spohn designed and built courses for the inaugural event. After a few years of working with the X-Games and the Gravity Games and Vans Triple Crown, municipalities began approaching Spohn Ranch for help with building permanent outdoor facilities. Spohn asked friends and family members to join his company to develop it into a full-time job. Working with municipalities and groups of volunteers, Spohn Ranch worked primarily in the municipal sector, helping design and build skateparks. The company's work presently focuses primarily on the development of concrete facilities for skateboarding, BMX bike riding and inline skating. Ramp lines make up about 10% of the company's business, while special events and commercial shoots have been reduced to about 5% of yearly revenue. The company has also developed pre-cast concrete skate features for skatepark construction., and designed skateparks as community spaces, or \\"skateable art\\" in 2008.

Gameplay This game is drastically different from the Japanese version of Bases Loaded II: The Second Season. While the controls are nearly identical to Bases Loaded II, the camera angles are different for fielding. Graphics also look more realistic and more advanced due to the enhanced engine used to make this game. There are three statistics for the biorhythms: P-Physical, S-Sensitivity, and I-Intellectual. They affect the player in ways that can only be mentioned while playing him on the screen. Positive numbers indicate that the player is better at one of the statistics. Negative numbers means the player is doing poorly at one of the statistics. Zero is considered to be critical and indicates the a statistic is a breaking point. Regular abilities are boosted by positive numbers (in addition to playing above his usual skill level) while negative numbers mean that a player will not play up to his potential. Each time has a letter of the Latin alphabet associated with their name. It is assumed that each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a certain Nippon Professional Baseball league team.

The church was planted in 1998 by four families, including the now senior pastor and elder, Jim Putman. Since its founding, the church has grown to an average weekend attendance of over 7,000 and has become one of the fastest growing churches in the United States, ranking 13th in a 2007 report.  History  The church began by meeting in private homes until the numbers became too great, at which time it was able to rent space in a movie theater. In 1999, Church Development Fund stepped in to buy of land in Post Falls, through its Advanced Land Purchase program, in order for the church to build a facility to serve the 850 in weekly attendance at that time. The church moved into a building on that property in 2001, but quickly outgrew it. In 2004, the church built a facility, with a multi-purpose 1,700 seat auditorium, also on the same property. Real Life Ministries has purchased an additional plus a home, for a total of at the current site. The Church's master plan for the current site included a 3,600 seat main building, a softball field and a youth center. It has been a borrower of CDF for land purchases and all phases of construction. In a 22 June 2006 letter to the Coeur d'Alene Press (CDA Press), RLM's financial accountability was questioned. The writer suggested RLM seek certification from the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability as other large churches had done. RLM responded with its own letter to the CDA Press on 15 July, describing its accounting practices and stating that it would seek ECFA certification as an additional measure of outside accountability. In December 2008, the ECFA accepted RLM's application.  Expansion issues  With its congregation continuing to grow, Real Life Ministries has purchased a plot of land for a new site, again borrowing funds from the Church Development Fund.Kootenai County Recorder's Office #I 2126812000 (Recorded 10-15-2007) Preliminary plans for the new property include an expandable 3,500 seat auditorium, state-of-the-art children's facility, a 300-seat chapel, field house and six multi-use sports fields. The property, however, has no water rights (according to the deed recorded at the county), no septic hook-up, and access roads have not been widened nor brought up to highway standards. According to the Conditional Use Permit Agreement,Kootenai County Recorder's Office #I 2077525000 (Recorded 1-16-2007) RLM will fund a traffic study and infrastructure improvements, including but not limited to reconstructing two adjacent roads, before receiving any building permits. Senior Pastor Jim Putman has said that while plans to build on the new property have been shelved, the real need now is for RLM to build the sports fields on the new property. After spending more than $750,000 dollars on the new property project, Putman announced in July 2008 that RLM will not begin construction on the parcel of land, saying \\"...at this time at least the new building is out of reach. Other options must be explored as a temporary solution until the time when what‚Äôs required can be afforded (initial estimates being $40 million). Also in his July 2008 announcement, he suggested home church as one potential option, saying, \\"Maybe doing church on Sunday in our homes? How do we keep reaching people but not get in over our heads financially.\\" The July 2008 statement also said, \\"We believe the move to the new property is something God wants us to do, but the timing has always been in question.\\" Earlier in the project, Putman was quoted as saying, we believe \\"Jesus has shown us He is all in, now we will wait for Him to tell us when.\\" Boise Bible College - Post Falls In 2004, Boise Bible College launched the Post Falls Center in co-operation with Real Life Ministries. The extension site combined the discipleship process developed by RLM with the Biblical training provided by BBC, resulting in an A.S. in Biblical leadership. This co-operative extension site was no longer active in February 2009.

She was raised in Harlem by her mother Viola Jones Hillary, her father having died while she was two.Katharine Q. Seelye, \\"Barbara Hillary, 88, Trailblazer on Top (and Bottom) of the World, Dies,\\" The New York Times, November 26, 2019. Hillary grew up impoverished‚Äîher mother cleaned homes to support the family‚Äîbut she spent much of her time reading: \\"there was no such thing as mental poverty in our home.\\" One of her favorite books was the adventure novel Robinson Crusoe. She attended the New School in New York City where she majored in gerontology, earning both her Bachelor of Arts and master's degrees. Following her graduation from the New School, she became a nurse, practicing for 55 years before retiring. Around 1998, Hillary was diagnosed with lung cancer which required surgery to remove. This surgery resulted in a 25 percent reduction in her breathing capacity. This was her second cancer diagnosis, having been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 20s. She became ill in early 2019 as fluid accumulated in her heart valve. Despite the illness, she still managed to travel to Mongolia to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on societies there. After months of declining health, she was hospitalized and later died on November 23, 2019 in Far Rockaway, New York. =Activism= Hillary was active in her community. She was the founder of the Arverne Action Association, Inc., a group dedicated to improving life in Arverne, New York and the Rockaway Peninsula Community. She was also founder and Editor-in-Chief of The Peninsula Magazine, a non-profit and multi-racial magazine in the New York City borough of Queens. This magazine was the first of its kind in the region. After visiting the poles, Hillary took interest in the effects of climate change on the polar ice caps and the world beyond and took to public lecturing on the topic. In 2019 she traveled to the Mongolian steppe to visit a community whose cultural traditions are threatened by climate change.  Adventurer  = Trips to the North and South poles = After retiring from nursing, Hillary sought adventure dog-sledding in Quebec and photographing polar bears in Manitoba. When she learned that no black woman had reached the North Pole, she was determined to become the first one to do so. A polar expedition at the time cost around $20,000 and required her to ski, which she had never done before. To raise funds, she sent letters to potential sponsors and took in donations, eventually raising over $25,000 to fund her expedition to the Arctic. To prepare for her journey she took cross-country ski lessons, hired a personal trainer and worked out with weights. On April 23, 2007, at the age of 75, she became one of the oldest people to set foot on the North Pole, and the first black woman. Five years later, she became the first African-American woman on record to stand on the South Pole at age 79, on January 6, 2011. Following her expeditions, Hillary became an inspirational speaker. She was profiled by NBC News and CNN.com, and gave speeches at various organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW). Hillary dedicated her travel to the North Pole to her mother, Viola Jones Hillary, who moved from the ‚ÄúLow country‚Äù of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to New York City in the 1930s to give Barbara and her sister, Dorothy Hillary Aranda, a chance for a better education.

'Service' is used throughout this article as it was the correct name at the time the Act was in force. Introduced to the Parliament by the Liberal Government, the Act was strongly opposed by the Labor Opposition and the New South Wales Police Association. The Act was automatically repealed by virtue of a sunset clause on 31 December 1994.  Background  The United Kingdom and Canada have long histories of allowing volunteers to serve on a part-time basis alongside regular constables in their special constabularies and auxiliary constabularies respectively. The intention of the Police Service (Volunteer Police) Amendment Act 1992 was to adapt the principle of voluntary part-time police service for New South Wales.  The volunteer police  The Act established the position of 'police volunteer' within the Police Service and collected these volunteers under the title 'the volunteer police'. The Commissioner of Police was given the powers to appoint, discipline and dismiss police volunteers and also to determine their functions, with the requirement that police volunteers be under the supervision of police officers at all times. Appointment as a police volunteer conferred on a person the same powers and privileges of a special constable appointed under the Police (Special Provisions) Act 1901, which gave the police volunteer the same powers as a constable employed by the Police Service. However, while the Commissioner could determine what weapons were to be carried by police volunteers, the Act specifically prohibited them carrying or using firearms.  Debate  There was much parliamentary debate on the Act. When the Opposition called a division, the vote was split evenly and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly used his casting vote to resolve the matter in the affirmative. = Support = Supporters of the Act - members of the Liberals and the Democrats - argued that volunteer police would build upon the community policing practices implemented by the Government, would augment police in the event of an emergency, and would allow members of the public to contribute to a cause which they felt strongly about. = Opposition = The Labor Opposition, backed by the principal unions in the Police Service - the New South Wales Police Association, the Commissioned Police Officers Association of New South Wales, and the Public Service Association - was opposed to the Act. Arguments against the Act revolved around concerns that police volunteers would not be sufficiently trained, experienced or equipped for police work, and that the Government intended on tricking the public into thinking there were more police officers on the streets than was actually the case.  Successor scheme  In 1995, the NSW Police Service introduced a scheme called Volunteers in Policing which allows community members to assist police by performing certain non-core police duties. Such duties are limited to community engagement and basic administrative tasks, with no law enforcement responsibilities or powers granted to volunteers.

It includes two lamps that have white LED lights powered by an individual solar panel. In 2004, Engineers Anil Chitrakar and Babu Raj Shrestha collaborated with their respective organizations, Environmental Camps for Conservation Awareness and Centre for Renewable Energy, to produce, distribute, and further the development of the solar tuki in Nepal. Their organizations sell the solar tuki systems, including solar panel, for $28 U.S. dollars, and the individual lamp is sold for $11.  Components  The typical solar tuki unit includes a 3 watt solar panel that charges a battery(NiMH or Li-ion) connected to two 0.4 watt white LED lamps. In addition to being used as a lamp the solar tuki also has the capability to power a radio, and charge a mobile phone. An added feature that can be utilized is a chlorinator, which is used to treat water. The charging time of the lamps vary by how long the solar panel is kept in the sun, and the strength of the sunlight on a given day. Anil Chitrakar, co founder and developer of solar tukis, claims that the lamp can work for up to ten hours when charged in the sun all day long.  Development The research and development of the Solar Tuki was supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and help from the Asian Institute of Technology. It was developed from May 1999 until the final model of the Solar Tuki was completed in December 2003. The organizations that advocated the growth of the solar tuki in Nepal are the Centre for Renewable Energy (CRE) and Environmental Camps for Conservation Awareness (ECCA). These two organizations have worked together since the establishment of the solar tuki program in 2004. The advancement of ECCA's and CRE's efforts in Nepal were funded primarily by the multiple awards and competitions that have been endowed by several environmentally aware agencies. These endowments have been allocated by the Global Environment Facility, who donated $50,00, and the World Bank Development Marketplace Award, which granted ECCA another $92,00. = ECCA's involvement = Environmental Camps for Conservation has been the leader in influencing the availability of the solar tuki in Nepal. They have influenced other organizations, like CRE, to work together to provide the cheapest solar tuki to distribute to poor Nepalis. Since the solar tuki project's formation, there have been over 130,000 solar tuki lamps distributed throughout Nepal.  Marketing  ECCA created a micro financing system in order to reach even the poorest individuals. The system allows people to pay $2.30 per month for two years. This pricing includes a 5-year warranty and services to repair the lantern if damaged. They have set up the market to encourage outside entrepreneurs to compete in the distribution of solar tuki's. ECCA did this purposefully to make cheaper solar tuki units available from competitors, while lowering their sales in Nepal. ECCA has service centers in Kathmandu and Eastern Nepal to help local entrepreneurs learn how to build solar tukis and give advice on business aspects of starting an energy enterprise, such as natural resource management. Over 13 local manufacturers take part in constructing and selling the solar tuki in different areas of Nepal. Community centers To further help the poorer villages, ECCA has set up community charging stations. These charging centers allow the community members to charge their lamp units from one large 36-50 watt photovoltaic solar panel. One 50 watt solar panel can charge up to 40 lamps at once. The idea behind these community charging stations is that villagers will only have to pay the $11 for the lamp, instead of $28 for the lamp and solar panel. They have also set up buildings called service centers. Service centers serve as a place where villagers can go to have maintenance and replacements done to their tukis. ECCA trains individuals on repairing the solar lamps so that help can always be available at the service centers. Manufacturers provide the service centers with spare parts for repairs. Impact The solar tuki was created to be used as a tool to improve the quality of life for the Nepali people. Its various functions has helped the people in many aspects of their lives. Criticisms of the solar tuki have been on the cost of the technology. Even with maximum efforts to reduce costs, the price is still considered high for poverty stricken villages. Some villagers do not see it necessary to invest in the solar tuki if they already own a source of light (kerosene lamp). = Health and economic benefits= With the solar tuki replacing the traditional kerosene lamps, the health of individuals has improved due to the lack of smoke produced. Previously, soot from the kerosene lamps had caused eye irritation and coughing. Fire safety has also improved due to the lack of a flame inside households. With the absence of kerosene in the solar tuki, villagers save considerable amounts of time which they would spend acquiring fuel. Monthly expenses which would be spent on fuel are also saved, allowing villagers to allocate their earnings toward other necessities. The introduction of the solar tuki market has strengthened the economy of rural Nepal. Employment opportunities became available as businesses began manufacturing and distributing tuki's. =Educational benefits= The brightness of the LED bulbs illuminates small areas better than the kerosene lamp, which helps people with tasks such as cooking and studying at night. Some schools in Nepal give students a solar tuki lamp unit in order for them to study at night. This requires the students to come back to school in order to charge their tukis, which has increased student attendance. The ability to power a small radio from the solar panel provides unlimited use, without worrying about electricity costs. Therefore, villagers can have access to important information and be updated about current events.

These added years are generally the result of switching midstream to a different major or program. In certain cases such as engineering and teaching and life science degrees, the victory lap is instead attributed to increased course load and stress. Other slang terms used to represent this same idea include \\"jewel degree\\", \\"5th year senior\\", \\"super senior\\", and \\"Van Wilder\\" (in reference to the 2002 film National Lampoon's Van Wilder). Ontario The term victory lap is used to refer to the additional years of secondary education a student may take in Ontario. The term Grade 13, is also used to refer to a victory lap in Ontario. Grade 13 was previously an academic grade in Ontario secondary schools, offered from 1921 to 1988. In 1988, Grade 13 was reorganized into the Ontario Academic Credit, which continued to be offered until 2003. After 2003, Ontario's secondary schools formally offered only four grades of schooling (Grades 9 to 12). However, Patrick Brady and Philip Allingham of Lakehead University, has argued that the provincial government's attempt to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the continent's 12 grades system has only been partially successful. They noted that the concept of students taking a fifth year of secondary school, colloquially known as the victory lap, was still viewed as a \\"provincial norm\\". During the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year, 73 per cent of students in Grade 12 managed to complete their secondary studies in four years, with over 20,000 Grade 12 students, or 14 per cent of Ontario's Grade 12 student population returning for a \\"victory lap,\\" in the following year. In September 2013, the Government of Ontario introduced a 34-credit threshold (30 credits is necessary to receive the Ontario Secondary School Diploma), in an effort to limit the length of study for its secondary school students. The Government of Ontario estimates the credit cap would save the province C$22 million each year. In the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year, students 19 years or older made up 3 per cent of public secondary day school attendance in Ontario. As of September 2013, a \\"resident pupil\\" of Ontario has the right to attend a public secondary school until they've received their 34th course credit, attended the school for seven years, or until they are age of 20 and has not been enrolled in a school in the last four years; after which, the secondary school reserves the right to refuse further admission to the student.

Outline In the run-up to the United Kingdom general election of 2005, Wheatcroft looks at the journey of the British Conservative Party, from being the country's most successful political party of the 20th century to its wilderness of a long period in opposition, by way of Margaret Thatcher's heyday and her fall from power and the quite different style of John Major.A nation of Sun readers : Geoffrey Wheatcroft traces the fall of the Conservative party in The Strange Death of Tory England, book review from The Guardian online at books.guardian.co.uk (accessed 6 March 2008) Summary The book begins with the Conservative leadership contest of 1963, following the resignation of Harold Macmillan, which turned into a fight between Iain Macleod, the modernising chairman of the party, and the Earl of Home, the aristocratic dark horse. Home won, disclaimed his peerage, became Alec Douglas-Home and was elected to the House of Commons at a hastily arranged by-election. Wheatcroft depicts this contest as a clash between supporters of \\"the virtues of an hereditary governing class\\" and those of \\"worth proved by ability\\".Charlish, Nicky, The Strange Death of Tory England online at culturewars.org.uk (accessed 6 March 2008) Next comes a history of the party from its 17th- century beginnings, at the time of the Restoration, followed by an account of the Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson and Edward Heath years and Britain's trials and tribulations of the 1970s, which culminated in the election of Margaret Thatcher's first government in 1979. Within a few years, while holding onto power, the party began to split and fall apart. Wheatcroft seeks to explain this decline by offering factors long discussed by commentators: internal splits over Britain's place in Europe, political sleaze, a fundamental lack of ideology and a growing desire in the country for change after eighteen years of Conservative rule, coinciding with Tony Blair's \\"brilliant cynical sincerity\\". Future Wheatcroft finally proposes some cures for the party's ills. He considers that the UK lacks a mainstream party of the right that puts the country's own national interest first. He questions the absence of the mavericks the party used to have, giving it more life and soul, noting the example of Enoch Powell's opposition to capital punishment. Also is examined the rise of the American neoconservatives. The author suggests that the British Conservatives could learn both from them and from the Lion and Unicorn conservatism of the socialist George Orwell. He concludes:The Strange Death of Tory England online at wordpress.com (accessed 9 March 2008) Title The book appears to draw its title from George Dangerfield's The Strange Death of Liberal England (1935) which sought to explain the decline of the British Liberal Party after 1910. It should also be noted that The Strange Death of Tory England had previously been used as a title by Anne Applebaum for an article published in June 2001.The Strange Death of Tory England by Anne Applebaum dated June 8, 2001, online at slate.com (accessed 6 March 2008) Cover The pictorial dust cover of the book's first edition shows the last Conservative prime minister, John Major, batting in a game of cricket, at the moment of being clean bowled (his wicket demolished). That alludes to Major's well-known love of cricket and to the result of the United Kingdom general election of 1997, which was won in a landslide by the Labour Party with 418 seats in the House of Commons, its highest ever total, while the Conservatives took only 165, their worst performance since the general election of 1906. In 1997, the Conservatives did not win a single seat in Scotland or in Wales. Little changed at the 2001 General Election, with Labour taking 413 seats, the Conservatives 166, the Liberal Democrats 52 and the others 28.

It is the terminus for several CCRTA bus lines and its CapeFLYER passenger train that operates on summer weekends between Boston South Station and Hyannis. It also used by the Plymouth and Brockton Street Railway and Peter Pan Bus Lines intercity bus services. The Cape Cod Central Railroad uses a separate station building across the tracks for its excursion services. A rail yard used by the Cape Cod Central is located north of the station, along with a former roundhouse. The first Hyannis station was built by the Cape Cod Railroad in 1854. It was replaced by a nearly-identical structure in the early 1900s. The New Haven Railroad used a separate station north from 1953 until passenger service ended in 1964. The Cape Cod Central began excursion service in 1981; part of a former gas station was converted for use as a station. The station was also used by the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad from 1984 to 1988, and the Amtrak Cape Codder. The Hyannis Transportation Center opened in 2002, with a second platform opposite the Cape Cod Central platform. It was only used by buses until CapeFLYER service began in 2013. History Postcard of Hyannis station, The Cape Cod Central station in 2012 The first Hyannis station was constructed in the early 1850s by the Cape Cod Railroad in time for the arrival of the first train from Boston on July 8, 1854. It is said that the train was met by a crowd estimated at 3,000. Immediately the line started running three trains a day to and from Boston. Tracks continued south to Hyannis Wharf, where ferries connected to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Island. Passenger service between Hyannis Wharf and Hyannis ended in July 1872 when the Woods Hole Branch was opened, though freight service continued until 1937. The line became part of the Old Colony Railroad in 1872; the Old Colony in turn was leased by the New Haven Railroad in 1893. The original repair shops at Hyannis, damaged by fire in 1857, were destroyed by another fire in 1898. They were never rebuilt, but a replacement roundhouse was built in 1901. The original station was replaced in the early 1900s by a nearly-identical building. Through the first half of the 20th century, the station supported year-round service to Boston and seasonal service to New York City.New Haven Railroad timetable, June 22, 1931, Tables 46, 50 On April 23, 1953, the New Haven moved to a new station to the north, and the older station was soon demolished. The final summer for the New Haven's nighttime Cape Codder service was in 1958. Regular passenger service to Boston ended in 1959, with limited summer service (including the last Day Cape Codder) until 1964; the 1953-built station was reused for commercial purposes. The roundhouse was sold to a moving company in 1954, and sold again and renovated as a nightclub in 1980. It was placed on the Massachusetts Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1996. The building and surrounding property were sold to Hy-Line Cruises in 2015 for parking and storage. Hy-Line proposed to demolish the building in 2019, but withdrew the application after pressure from historical and civic groups. In July 1981, the Cape Cod Central Railroad began summer-only excursion service between Hyannis and Sandwich. Part of a former gas station in Hyannis, built sometime between 1900 and 1930 just northeast of the New Haven Railroad station, was converted for use as a station. The station was served by the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad from 1984 to 1988, and the Amtrak Cape Codder from 1986 to 1996. The station platform on the east side of the mainline is approximately long, which accommodates a seven car train. The larger Hyannis Transportation Center (HTC) was constructed just to the north in 2002, with a platform on the opposite side of the same track. Seasonal CapeFLYER service, which began in 2013, uses the HTC; the Cape Cod Central continues to use the older station, though the accessible high-level platform of the HTC is often used. Bus connections A row of bus bays on the north side of the HTC are used for local and intercity bus routes: =CCRTA= * H2O West - Hyannis to/from Harwichport * H2O East - Hyannis to/from Orleans * Barnstable Villager - Hyannis to/from Barnstable * Sandwich Line - Hyannis to/from Sandwich * Hyannis Area Trolley (in season) * Sealine - Hyannis to/from Falmouth/Woods Hole =Plymouth and Brockton Street Railway= *Hyannis to Barnstable, Sagamore, Plymouth, Rockland, Boston South Station, Logan Airport *Hyannis to Barnstable, Sagamore, Plymouth, Rockland, Boston- South Station, Boston-Park Square *Hyannis to Harwich, Orleans, Eastham, Wellfleet, Truro, and Provincetown =Peter Pan Bus Lines= *Hyannis to Barnstable, Sagamore, New Bedford, Fall River, Providence, New York Port Authority *Hyannis to Foxwoods Casino *Hyannis to Barnstable, Sagamore, Boston South Station, Logan Airport References External links * Barnstable, Massachusetts Cape Cod Central Railroad stations Old Colony Railroad Stations on Cape Cod Stations along Old Colony Railroad lines Former Amtrak stations in Massachusetts MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Transit centers in the United States Bus stations in Massachusetts Transportation buildings and structures in Barnstable County, Massachusetts ","title":"Hyannis Transportation Center"},{"id":"16123247","text":"Mendel Diness (1827 in Odessa ‚Äì December 1, 1900 in Port Townsend, Washington) was a Jewish watchmaker in 19th century Jerusalem who studied photography under the Scottish missionary and photographer James Graham and during the 1850s became the first Jewish photographer in Jerusalem.

However, in many countries, these workers are supposed to take a break and rest every few hours. Frequency The frequency of sleeping while on duty that occurs varies depending on the time of day. Daytime employees are more likely to take short naps, while graveyard shift workers have a higher likelihood of sleeping for a large portion of their shift, sometimes intentionally. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation has found that 30% of participants have admitted to sleeping while on duty.On Hiring: Sleeping on the Job - Chronicle.com More than 90% of Americans have experienced a problem at work because of a poor night's sleep. One in four admit to shirking duties on the job for the same reason, either calling in sick or napping during work hours. Views Employers have varying views of sleeping while on duty. Some companies have instituted policies to allow employees to take napping breaks during the workday in order to improve productivity while others are strict when dealing with employees who sleep while on duty and use high-tech means, such as video surveillance, to catch their employees who may be sleeping on the job. Those who are caught in violation may face disciplinary action such as suspension or firing. Some employees sleep, nap, or take a power-nap only during their allotted break time at work. This may or may not be permitted, depending on the employer's policies. Some employers may prohibit sleeping, even during unpaid break time, for various reasons, such as the unprofessional appearance of a sleeping employee, the need for an employee to be available during an emergency, or legal regulations. Employees who may endanger others by sleeping on the job may face more serious consequences, such as legal sanctions. For example, airline pilots risk loss of their licenses. In some industries and work cultures sleeping at work is permitted and even encouraged. Such work cultures typically have flexible schedules, and variant work loads with extremely demanding periods where employees feel unable to spend time commuting. In such environments it is common for employers to provide makeshift sleeping materials for employees, such as a couch and/or inflatable mattress and blankets. This practice is particularly common in start-ups and during political campaigns. In those work cultures sleeping in the office is seen as evidence of dedication. In 1968, New York police officers admitted that sleeping while on duty was customary. In Japan, the practice of napping in public, called , may occur in work meetings or classes. Brigitte Steger, a scholar who focuses on Japanese culture, writes that sleeping at work is considered a sign of dedication to the job, such that one has stayed up late doing work or worked to the point of complete exhaustion, and may therefore be excusable.

(Described in his poem \\"Narcissus\\") His undergraduate education at Amherst College was interrupted by his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He ultimately received his B.A. from Amherst in 1946. He went on to earn his Ph.D. from Harvard University, and it was during his graduate studies that he published his first poems in The Kenyon Review. From 1952 until his retirement in 1989, Ferry taught at Wellesley College where he was, for many years, the chairman of the English Department. He now holds the title Sophie Chantal Hart Professor Emeritus of English at Wellesley. He has also taught writing at Boston University, as well as Suffolk University, as a distinguished scholar. Ferry was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998, and he is a fellow of the Academy of American Poets. In 1958, Ferry married the distinguished literary scholar Anne Ferry (died 2006), they had two children, Elizabeth, an anthropologist, and Stephen, a photojournalist. Before moving to his current home in Brookline, Massachusetts, Ferry lived across the Charles River in Cambridge, in the house where 19th century journalist and women's rights advocate Margaret Fuller lived before she joined the Brook Farm community. Interview with Ferry about his translation of The Georgics of Virgil. Honors and awards In 2000, Ferry‚Äôs book of new and selected poems and translations, entitled Of No Country I Know, received the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets and the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry from the Library of Congress (for the best work of poetry for the previous two years). He is the author of a critically praised verse rendering of the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. The poet W. S. Merwin has described Ferry's work as having an \\"assured quiet tone\\" that communicates \\"complexities of feeling with unfailing proportion and grace.\\" Ferry is also a recipient of the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award. In 2011, Ferry was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\\"David Ferry awarded 2011 the prestigious Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for his lifetime accomplishments,\\"Poetry Foundation announcement. In 2012, Ferry was awarded the National Book Award for Poetry for his book Bewilderment (University of Chicago Press). Bewilderment was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award (2012, Poetry). Poetry and Translations For many years, David Ferry has been admired in the US for his translations of Gilgamesh, Horace and Virgil. His original poetry has flourished in the shadow of this other work and he likes to juxtapose translations with his own poems in an acknowledgement of influence and tradition. Elegance, clarity, an avoidance of frills ‚Äì the Horatian virtues ‚Äì are important to him. He has written critically about Wordsworth and always intends to communicate with readers, approaching both translation and original work with a wise passivity, even humility, in pursuit of ‚Äúthe heartbeat easy governance / Of long continued metrical discipline‚Äù (‚ÄòA Thank-You Note‚Äô). This selection draws from his whole oeuvre, including ‚ÄòPoem‚Äô (1960) which shows a young poet not wanting to howl or essay a barbaric yawp, but rather stiffly confined to New Formalist and Classical models, to inversion and Romantic lexis. It was twenty three years before Ferry published his own poems again. ‚ÄòIn the Garden‚Äô suggests how elegance had now fused with vitality, formal skill with vivid responses to reality. The narrator sits reading Edward Thomas, engaged in ‚Äúill-informed staring‚Äù and observation nudges the poem forward: ‚ÄúThe green of these leaves is almost an absence of green, / And the stalks look like rays of light under water‚Äù. Later Ferry poems meander, seem to have little intent on the reader, but brim with details, move like music. He understands the more we attend, whether to language or world, the more we discover we have missed. In ‚ÄòThat Evening at Dinner‚Äô, one of the guests struggles with her ‚Äúgraceless leg, / The thick stocking, the leg brace‚Äù. Yet the poem ends by gazing at books on shelves: ‚ÄúLine after line, all of them evenly spaced, / And spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.‚Äù Here Ferry interpolates lines from Samuel Johnson on ‚Äúchasms infinitely deep‚Äù that lie beneath the surface of things. It is not merely that ‚Äìas the writer of ‚ÄòOld Man‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Glory‚Äô must have felt ‚Äì we do not know these things, but that we do not have the ‚Äúfaculties‚Äù to know them. Over and over, Ferry alludes to this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, elusive partly as the result of the ambivalent gifts of time. ‚ÄòDown by the River‚Äô describes a scene‚Äôs ‚Äúparticipial rhythm, // Flowing, enjoying, taking its own sweet time‚Äù. But it is the shifting liquidity of water that most vividly evokes the ineffable, Ferry‚Äôs real subject. ‚ÄòLake Water‚Äô declares ‚ÄúThe plane of the water is like a page on which / Phrases and even sentences are written‚Äù. Yet as the poet tries to compose, ‚ÄúThe surface of the page is like lake water‚Äù and later again all is ‚Äúerased with the changing of the breeze‚Äù. For all their elegance and plain- speaking, these poems are marvellously unstable, modern, poignantly facing up to the limits of the faulty equipment we are given to understand the world. ‚ÄòThe Intention of Things‚Äô gently devastates with the idea that ‚Äúdeath lives in the intention of things / To have a meaning‚Äù. Lesser poets might be reduced to silence, or tear language to shreds, but Ferry‚Äôs provisional songs instruct, console, distract, remain to be admired. His collection, Bewilderment: New Poems and Translations, won the 2012 National Book Award: a fitting tribute to this 89-year-old outstanding poet, still singing ‚Äúlike the birds that gather in Virgil‚Äôs lines / In the park at evening, sitting among the branches‚Äù (‚ÄòThe Birds‚Äô). In 2017 his translationThe Aeneid: by Virgil, translated from the Latin by David Ferry, University of Chicago Press, 2017 of Virgil's Aeneid, published at the age of 93, was reviewed at length by the academic and poet April Bernard in the New York Review of Books. She considered that, \\"he has some sort of uncanny connection to the great poet [i.e. Virgil ]\\", and suggested his translation was superior to those of John Dryden, Robert Fitzgerald and Robert Fagles, because of its combination of vivid precision, metrical force, and cumulative effect.\\"Virgil Revisited\\", 23 November 2017 Writing in the TLS, classicist Richard Jenkyns called Ferry's Aeneid \\"the best modern version...both for its loyalty to the original and for its naturalness in itself.\\"Richard Jenkyns, \\"In full flow,\\" TLS, February 16, 2018, 15.

It was first built in 1838 and after going through four different bridges was finally torn down in 1970. The Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Company (R&P;) was chartered on March 14, 1836, with available capital of $800,000. The company was unique in that its bridges could also be used for \\"travel by horseback, carriage, sheep, cattle, and hogs\\" in addition to the regular use by the train. This condition was not allowed at the James River unless the consent of the owners of Mayo's bridge (the first bridge of the James at Richmond and in 1836 the only) was secured. Work on the railroad began in summer 1836 with Moncure Robinson as chief engineer. In May 1838 the railroad had completed a track running from the south bank of the James River at Manchester to the north bank of the Appomattox at Pocahontas and in September of that year a bridge was completed over the James. Originally, the R&P; did not have a bridge over the Appomattox River as they used the Manchester and Petersburg Turnpike Company's bridge to transport freight and passengers across the river. Thus, there was no railroad bridge over the Appomattox until 1867 when the R&P; ran a line over the river to connect with the Petersburg Railroad. The bridge was destroyed by the Confederate States Army on April 2, 1865 in anticipation of the Fall of Richmond. Shortly after the war ended, the federal government and the railroad company rebuilt the bridge over the James River, a , trestle bridge. It opened on May 26, 1866 and was built at a cost of $118,245. The bridge was burned again in 1882 when sparks from a locomotive caused a fire on the bridge. It was rebuilt the following year. In 1898, the R&P; merged with the Petersburg Railroad, which ran south from Petersburg, Virginia, to Garysburg, North Carolina (near the rail hub of Weldon), to form the Atlantic Coast Line of Virginia and in 1900 this company was merged into the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, creating a non stop railroad from Augusta, Georgia to Richmond. Beyond Richmond, the ACL used the tracks of the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad and other numerous railroads to extend their line to the Potomac River and subsequently Washington, DC and all points north. Two years after the founding of the ACL, in 1902, the bridge was rebuilt for the fourth time. For some reason, the new railroad company decided to forsake the old, tall granite piers in favor of new, shorter concrete piers. This may have been because of the age of the granite piers or perhaps the concrete was thought to be stronger. An interesting historical note about these newer stone piers is that some have fallen over in the years since the bridge was taken down in 1970 while all of the original 1838 brick piers still stand tall. Throughout the first 15 years of the 20th century, the ACL continued to use the old R&P; RR bridge at Richmond to transport passengers. Freight was transported on a connection line that split off from the RF&P; line west of Richmond and went south to join the R&P; line south of Manchester. This line predated the incorporation of the ACL and was operated jointly by both the RF&P; and R&P.; In 1916, this belt line was made into a double track to accommodate increased freight and passenger traffic (which was now too voluminous to go down the original connector railroad on Byrd St in the middle of Richmond). The line was serviced by the Broad Street Station which became a massive center of rail transportation in Richmond. The old connector railroad was torn up and the old R&P; rail lines in and near Richmond were discontinued although the ACL maintained its headquarters at Byrd St Station, the original Richmond station of the R&P.; In 1967, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company merged with its longtime rival, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad Company, to create a new railroad termed the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. This was brought upon by a decrease in passenger travel as the car became much more economical than a train. In 1970, the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad bridge was removed as it no longer served any purpose along with the original of the R&P; as they had been superseded by other adjacent lines owned by the same company. Today, the concrete and granite piers of the bridge can still be seen just upstream of the Manchester Bridge. Its south side has been used for rock climbing since the 1980s. The former railroad bed, once on the outskirts of Manchester, has been greatly encroached on by development. Yet, from an aerial map, the former route can be vaguely traced out; from the ground, very little can be seen of the second steam railroad to service Richmond as it has been overgrown by shrubs, trees, and other plant life.

A Trio and a Quartette (1894) is a short novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson and his stepson Lloyd Osbourne. It was published the year Stevenson died. Plot Three beggars operate in the port of Papeete on Tahiti. They are Herrick, a failed English businessman; Davis, an American sea captain disgraced by the loss of his last ship; and Huish, a dishonest Cockney of various employments. One day an off-course schooner carrying a cargo of champagne from San Francisco to Sydney arrives in port, its officers having been killed by smallpox. With no one else willing to risk infection, the U.S. consul employs Davis to take over the ship for the remainder of its voyage. Davis brings the other two men, along with a plan to steal the ship and navigate it to Peru, where they will sell the cargo and vessel and disappear with the money. Once at sea, Davis and Huish start drinking the cargo and spend almost all of their time intoxicated. Herrick, whose conscience is severely troubled by the plan but feels he has no other way to escape poverty, is left alone to manage the ship and three native crew members, despite having no seafaring experience. Several days later the would-be thieves discover they have been victims of a fraud: most of the cargo is not champagne but merely bottles of water. Evidently the shipper and the previous captain had intended to sink the ship deliberately and claim the full value of the \\"champagne\\" on insurance. Now sober, Davis discovers that his rushed preparations and drunkenness leave the ship with insufficient food to reach Peru. The only port they can reach without starving is Papeete, where they would surely be imprisoned for their actions. They sight an unknown island, where they discover an upper-class Englishman named Attwater. Attwater, a devout Christian, has been harvesting pearls here for many years with the help of several dozen native workers, all except four of whom have recently also died of smallpox. The three men hatch a new plan to kill Attwater and take his pearls, but Herrick's guilt-stricken demeanour and Huish's drunken ramblings soon betray them. Attwater and his servants force them back onto the ship at gunpoint. Unable to live with himself, Herrick jumps overboard and tries to drown himself. Failing even in this, he swims to the shore and throws himself on Attwater's mercy. The next day, Huish proposes a final plan which shocks even the unscrupulous Davis: they will go to meet Attwater under a flag of truce, and Huish will disable him by throwing acid in his face. Attwater is suspicious, realises what is going on, and forces Huish to fatally spread the vitriol on himself. Attwater threatens to kill Davis as well, but forgives him and tells him, \\"Go, and sin no more.\\" Two weeks later, the surviving men prepare to leave the island as Attwater's own ship approaches. Davis is now repentant and fervently religious to an almost crazed degree, and he urges the atheist Herrick to join him in his faith. Analysis The lengthy voyage of the stolen ship has been described as \\"a microcosm of imperialist society, directed by greedy but incompetent whites, the labour supplied by long- suffering natives who fulfil their duties without orders and are true to the missionary faith which the Europeans make no pretence of respecting\\".Roslyn Jolly, \\"Introduction\\" in Robert Louis Stevenson: South Sea Tales (1996) The strange and memorable character of Attwater, ruthlessly violent while talking always of Jesus' forgiveness, who alternately repels and fascinates the other characters, reflects Stevenson's own conflicted feelings about Christianity.

The trail follows the former Port Angeles Western Railroad grade along the shores of Lake Crescent. Built during World War I for the Spruce Production Division to transport spruce from the western Olympic Peninsula for the aircraft industry, it was completed in 1919, a year too late for its intended purpose. The trail is approximately one way, and trailheads exist at both ends. The trail is fairly level in most spots and could be hiked by most amateur hikers. Points of interest include the McFee Tunnel, a bridge that spans a bay called Devils Punch Bowl, and Harrigan Point. Throughout 2017 and 2018, the Spruce Railroad Trail has been upgraded to universal accessibility standards. Some areas of the trail were paved, and widened to approximately 10 feet wide. These upgrades will be completed in 2019.  McFee Tunnel  The McFee Tunnel is a railroad tunnel along the Spruce Railroad Trail which was blasted during World War I. Prior to its renovation, the tunnel was only accessible via off- trail access points, which were difficult to reach and largely unsafe. The tunnel itself was pitch-black and contained materials from when the railroad was being built, such as old railroad ties.left = Renovation = In April 2017, Bruch and Bruch Construction of Port Angeles received a $1.2 million contract to restore the 450-foot long tunnel, and widen the trail segment to roughly 12 feet. This began with blasting the south end of the tunnel, opening it from end-to-end. Debris was then cleared from the tunnel, and workers began reinforcing the inside by applying \\"shotcrete\\" to the tunnel walls. Next, a Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) wall was built around the arch pipe on the northeast entrance to the tunnel, with a facade added to represent the tunnel's original appearance. The McFee Tunnel was officially opened to the public on July 15th, 2017.

In the early 1990s the Tanzanian hip hop of Dar es Salaam was polarized with one side pushing for a populist hip hop that they hoped would become the dominant musical form in the area and the other concerned with a purist interpretation that aligned with the mission of American hip hop and was sung in English. Kwanza Unit is seen as the strongest progenitor of this style, which according to Rhymson was formed \\"in response to the outcome at Yo!

It was in this same year that he completed his far more infamous contribution to history: The Turk, a chess-playing automaton, later revealed to be a very far-reaching and elaborate hoax due to the chess-playing human- being occupying its innards.[4] But while the Turk's construction was completed in six months, Kempelen's speaking machine occupied the next twenty years of his life.[2] After two conceptual \\"dead ends\\" over the first five years of research, Kempelen's third direction ultimately led him to the design he felt comfortable deeming \\"final\\": a functional representational model of the human vocal tract.[3]  First design  Kempelen's first experiment with speech synthesis involved only the most rudimentary elements of the vocal tract necessary to produce speech-like sounds. A kitchen bellows, used to stoke fires in wood-burning stoves, was invoked as a set of lungs to supply the airflow. A reed extracted from a common bagpipe was implemented as the glottis, the source of the raw fundamental sound in the vocal tract. The bell of a clarinet made for a sufficient mouth, despite its rigid form. This basic model was able to produce simple vowel sounds only, though some additional articulation was possible by positioning one's hand at the bell opening to obstruct airflow. The physical hardware for constructing the nasals, plosives and fricatives that most consonants require was not present, however. Kempelen, like many other early pioneers of phonetics, misunderstood the source of the perceived \\"higher frequencies\\" of certain sounds as a function of the glottis, rather than as the function of the formants of the entire vocal tract, so he abandoned his single-reed design for a multiple-reed approach.[2][3]  Second design  The second design involved a console, similar to that of a musical organ of the period, in which the operator manned a set of keys, one for each letter. The sounds were produced by a common bellows that fed air through various pipes with the appropriate shapes and obstructions needed to produce that letter. Through experimentation, he came to find that the reed's resonant length was not crucial to the creation of the high-frequency components of certain vowels and fricatives, so he tuned them all to be the same pitch for the sake of consistency between letters. While not all letters were represented at this point, Kempelen had developed the technology required to produce most vowels and several consonants, including the plosive /p/, and the nasal /m/, and thus was in a position to begin forming syllables and short words. However, this immediately led to the primary flaw of his second design: the parallel nature of the multiple reeds allowed for more than one letter to be sounded at a time. And in the process of building syllables and words, the sonic ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù (now referred to as co- articulation) rendered sounds very uncharacteristic of human speech, undermining the intention of the design altogether. Kempelen comments: ‚ÄúIn order to continue my experiments it was necessary, above all, that I should have a perfect knowledge of what I wanted to imitate. I had to make a formal study of speech and continually consult nature as I conducted my experiments. In this way my talking machine and my theory concerning speech made equal progress, the one serving as guide to the other.‚Äù[3] \\"It was possible, following the methods I'd been using, to invent separate letters, but never to combine them to form syllables, and that it was absolutely necessary to follow nature which has only one glottis and one mouth, through which every sound emerges and which gives a unity to them.\\"[2][3] Thus, Kempelen began work on his third, and ultimately final design, which itself was in many ways a \\"close-as-possible\\" representation of the physiology of the vocal tract.  Third design  The third approach followed a similar design to the first, which was conceptually more faithful to the natural design of the human vocal tract than the second. It consisted, like before, of a bellows, a reed and a simulated mouth (this time made of India rubber, for better creation of vowel sounds via manipulation by hand), but also included a \\"throat\\" to which a \\"nasal cavity\\" was attached (complete with two \\"nostrils\\" for pronouncing nasal consonants), as well as several levers and tubes dedicated to pronouncing /s/ and / É/, a rod that would interfere with the reeds vibration to articulate /r/, and separate, smaller bellows that would allow air to pass the reed while the mouth was completely closed (a feature required for pronouncing /b/). At one point, a special valve intended to simulate /f/ was included, but was later removed when it was revealed that the same sound could be achieved by simply closing all of the orifices of the machine and allowing air to leak from the cracks. Similarly, at one point in the design, there was an alternate \\"mouth\\" assembly consisting of a wooden box with a pair of hinged shutters that acted as lips. Inside the box resided a hinged, wooden, string-operated flap that acted as a tongue. The purpose of this assembly was to mimic the mouth and tongue in the construction of plosives such as \\"b‚Äù and \\"d‚Äù, but was later removed when Kempelen recognized that without a proper tongue, the machine would never be able to produce /t/, /d/, /k/ and /…°/. He found his way around this entire problem by replacing /t/ and /k/ with the /p/, and /d/ and /…°/ with /b/ (which itself only differed in voicing from /p/). In the context of a familiar word, listeners often ignored the mispronunciation altogether (a phenomenon later explored by researchers in the field of cognitive science). Kempelen believed that people were more forgiving of the errors made by his machine due to the frequency of the reed and vocal tract resonant length he chose to use, which create a resonance much more like a young child, than that of an adult.[2][3] This third design, unlike those before it, was completely capable of speaking complete phrases in French, Italian and English (German was possible, but required a greater skill-level by the operator, due to the more frequent use of consonants in the German language). Its greatest limitation was the bellows, which, although they were six times the capacity of human lungs, ran empty of air much faster than that of its human counterpart. Because the design was based on a single reed as the glottal sound-source, he had none of the problems of co- articulation that came inherently with the second design. But that single reed also meant that the Speaking Machine had a monotone voice.[4] Kempelen expended some time to try and introduce several prosodic pitch-variation mechanisms into the reed assembly, but to no avail. He decided to leave the design to be improved upon by the next batch of experimenters. All of these important additions for the third design came from the two decades of intensive research of the vocal tract in relation to spoken languages by Kempelen, for which the behavior of each crucial physiological element of speech production was scrutinized and replicated acoustically and/or mechanically.[3]  A significant contribution  Shortly after the completion and exhibition of his Speaking Machine, in 1804, von Kempelen died, though not before publishing an extremely comprehensive journal of the past twenty years of his research in phonetics. The 456-page book, titled Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache nebst Beschreibung einer sprechenden Maschine (which translates to The Mechanism of Human Speech, with a Description of a Speaking Machine, published in 1791)[2][4], contained every technical aspect of both Kempelen's construction of the Speaking Machine (including the preliminary designs) and his studies of the human vocal tract.[3] In 1837, Sir Charles Wheatstone resurrected the work of Wolfgang von Kempelen, creating an improved replica of his Speaking Machine.[3][4] Using new technology developed over the previous 50 years, Wheatstone was able to further analyze and synthesize components of acoustic speech, giving rise to the second wave of scientific interest in phonetics. After viewing Wheatstone's improved replica of the Speaking Machine at an exposition, a young Alexander Graham Bell set out to construct his own speaking machine with the help and encouragement of his father.[4][5] Bell's experiments and research ultimately led to his invention of the telephone in 1876[4], which revolutionized global communication. In 1968, Marcel van den Broecke (University of Amsterdam) built a replica as part of an MA thesis, about which he reported in \\"Sound Structures\\", Marcel van den Broecke, Vincent van Heuven and Wim Zonneveld (eds.), chapter 2, p 9-19: \\"Wolfgang von Kempelen's Speaking Machine as a Performer\\", Foris Publications, Dordrecht-Netherlands/Cinnaminson-USA, 1983. Acoustic predictions using N-tube approximations of the vocal tract and applying them to the replica's characteristics showed what had already been established perceptually, namely that the machine could only produce two vowel-like sounds, viz. an /a/-like vowel and an /o/-like vowel. Of the consonants produced, the general purpose plosive is very convincing. A general purpose nasal can also easily be identified, but sibilants and the rattling /r/ are as unpleasant as eye witness von Windisch reported two centuries earlier.

He resided in Clearwater, Florida, and regularly videotaped members of Scientology coming and going from church activities in Clearwater. Lonsdale had initially intended to do a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater, but after an experience at a City Council meeting, he began to research Scientology. Lonsdale got into an argument with a Scientologist at the City Council meeting, and the Scientologist followed him home and the next day Lonsdale observed a van waiting for two hours outside his home. After researching the Church of Scientology on critical websites, he decided to expose information about the organization. He established a website, and filmed video footage of Scientologists going about activities in Clearwater, and aired edited footage on a local Public-access television cable TV station. After getting into a physical altercation with a Scientologist while filming, the Scientologist was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery, but was later released and the charges were dropped. The Church of Scientology hired private investigators and discovered a criminal record on Lonsdale, and this was subsequently publicized by a Scientologist on fliers and on a website. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology in 2006, and they accused him of being affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, a group critical of Scientology which was restricted in where it could protest in Clearwater. In 2007, Lonsdale appeared on the BBC Panorama program Scientology and Me and was interviewed by journalist John Sweeney. Later in the program, Sweeney lost his temper and shouted at a Scientology representative when he was accused of giving Lonsdale a \\"soft interview\\". Lonsdale died suddenly on February 16, 2008, and a Clearwater police spokeswoman stated that the death appears to be due to suicide. Critic of Scientology Lonsdale, never a Scientologist himself, became critical of the Church of Scientology in mid-2006, and often stood outside in downtown Clearwater near Scientology's spiritual headquarters wearing a sandwich board sign that read \\"Cult Watch\\". Lonsdale became interested in Scientology after getting into a fight with a Scientologist over redevelopment issues while at a City Council meeting. After the Scientologist followed Lonsdale's car home and Lonsdale noticed a van parked in front of his home for two hours the following day, he began to research the background of Scientology on anti-Scientology sites on the Internet and in the library. He taped hours of footage of Scientology staffers, security guards, and verbal confrontations with Scientologists, and edited clips into a pseudo-documentary which aired on local public-access television. Lonsdale dropped fliers outside downtown businesses and picked through trash from a Scientology-owned business and posted documents online. He parked outside a Scientology cafeteria with posters in his car window which stated that key Scientology texts were available for free on the Internet: \\"OT I-VIII for free at xenu.net.\\" On July 8, 2006, Lonsdale got into a physical altercation with a Scientologist while filming the Church of Scientology in Clearwater. A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology told Bay News 9 that Lonsdale had been harassing their staff members, and that the fight was not related to the church. Lonsdale stated \\"Basically, I'm filming a pseudo-documentary for one of our free-access Pinellas web channels,\\" and said that while filming a Scientologist came out of a coffee shop and yelled that Lonsdale was a religious bigot. Lonsdale stated \\"I picked up the camera again and started filming him ... He went right for my face and my head, backed me up into a pole to which I had no other choice but to defend myself.\\" The Scientologist was arrested by Clearwater police and charged with battery, but the State Attorney's Office of Florida decided not to pursue charges. After the incident the Clearwater police Deputy Chief viewed a videotape of the altercation, and concluded that Lonsdale was the victim and that his police officers made the right decision in arresting the Scientologist. After viewing the videotape, the Assistant State Attorney stated \\"it is just not going to be a prosecutable case,\\" and said that the video shows \\"pretty much mutual aggression\\" between Lonsdale and the Scientologist. The Assistant State Attorney stated that the video showed aggression on both sides, and that Lonsdale's criticism of Scientology on the internet made the case \\"unprosecutable\\". Lonsdale's attorney Luke Lirot stated \\"It is another example of the State Attorney's Office's historical reluctance to tangle with Scientology.\\" Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney said that church members had been told to avoid Lonsdale, and told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientologists had complained to police that they felt Lonsdale was stalking them. The police did not charge Lonsdale, stating that he had the right to take photos and video in public places. =Response by Church of Scientology= The Church of Scientology responded to Lonsdale's activities by hiring a private investigator to investigate him. The private investigator discovered that Lonsdale had two misdemeanor convictions for lewd and lascivious conduct dating back to 1999 and 2000, both related to public sex with men. In mid-July 2006, Posters with a mug shot of Lonsdale appeared in store windows warning that he had been arrested for sex crimes and was dangerous. The Church of Scientology told Bay News 9 that it did not hand out the fliers, but that they came from an organization calling the \\"Cleveland Street Safety League\\". The St. Petersburg Times reported that the man behind the \\"Cleveland Street Safety League\\" is \\"a longtime Scientologist known for confronting critics\\". The Scientologist behind the Cleveland Street Safety League created a website about Lonsdale and posted his arrest record and comments Lonsdale had made on a swinger site, and also called Lonsdale's family in New England claiming that Lonsdale needed mental help. Lonsdale's employer and landlord received phone calls from Scientology representatives who claimed that he was a religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: \\"I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted.\\" In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: \\"It was obvious to everybody he had nothing to do with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that.\\" Scientology and Me In May 2007, Lonsdale appeared on BBC's Panorama program in a piece titled \\"Scientology and Me\\", and was interviewed about his experiences as a critic of Scientology by journalist John Sweeney. When Sweeney asked Lonsdale why the Church of Scientology was publicizing derogatory things about him, Lonsdale replied: \\"They are trying to embarrass me. They try to paint you as crazy, so that no one will listen to you.\\" During their interview, Tommy Davis arrived, opened a folder, and began to read out loud Lonsdale's criminal record. Later in the program, Sweeney was accused by Scientologist Tommy Davis of giving \\"convicted sexual pervert Shawn Lonsdale\\" a \\"soft interview\\". Sweeney yelled at Davis and lost his temper, with both men shouting at each other back and forth. A Scientology-produced video of the incident was uploaded to YouTube and viewed over 856,000 times.  Death  In 2007, Lonsdale let his Scientology critique website lapse, and posted less frequently on his blogs and anti-Scientology message boards and chat forums. Spokeswoman Pat Harney stated that the Church had not heard from Lonsdale for months before his death. Former Scientologist Randy Payne told the St. Petersburg Times that Lonsdale \\"found it impossible\\" to make a living while spending the majority of his time as a critic of Scientology. Payne stated that in December 2007 Lonsdale had found steady work, and had planned to go back to school in order to get a private investigator's license. Clearwater police discovered Lonsdale's body after they were alerted by neighbors and found a garden hose connecting the exhaust pipe of Lonsdale's car with one of the windows of his home. Clearwater police spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that there were no signs of foul play involved, and that police found what they believed to be a suicide note. Daly- Watts said that \\"It does appear to be a suicide.\\" Police officially ruled Lonsdale's death as suicide on May 2, 2008. Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide \\"awful\\" and stated \\"It's just unfortunate anybody feels they have to go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody.\\" Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: \\"In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology.\\" On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: \\"Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he was a bit of a hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American\\".

Octagon Press, 78 York Street London He is known for his Maqamat al-Hariri (also known as the ‚Äò'Assemblies of Hariri'‚Äô), a collection of some 50 stories written in the Maqama style, a mix of verse and literary prose. Although the maqamat did not originate with al-Hariri, he elevated the genre to an art form. Biography Al-Hariri was born 446 AH (1054 AD) and died in his native city of Basra in AH 516 (1122 AD). Although his place of birth is uncertain, scholars suggest that he was probably born in Mashan (near Basra), where his family had a palm tree plantation.Preston, R., Makamat; Or, Rhetorical Anecdotes of Al Hariri of Basra, London, James Madden, 1850, pp 5‚Äì7; Chenery, T.

The street where he died, Banu Haaran, was a place where Bedouins were known to have settled and was a centre of Basra's silk manufacturing industry. His name, al-Hariri, probably reflects his residence (hariri = silk manufacturer or silk merchant).McGuckin de Slane, B., A Biographical Dictionary [ KitƒÅb WafayƒÅt Al-a øyƒÅn] (trans), Paris, Oriental Translation Fund, 1873, pp 492‚Äì93 He liked to boast of his Arab heritage: he was a descendant of Rabi‚Äôat al Faras, son of NizƒÅr, the son of Ma‚Äôadd, the son of Adnan al-Ya\`muri, who was a companion of Muhammad.Chenery, T.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. .2008-03-12 Various accounts of Al-Hariri's inspiration to write the Maqmat can be found in the literature. One account, which has become the established account, was related by Al Hariri's son, Abu al-Qasim Abdullah, is that the author and his servants, were seated in a mosque in Banu Haaran when an indigent man, by the name of Abu Zayd, dressed in ragged cloaks, entered and spoke with great fluency and elegance. The speaker related the story of his native city of Saruj being ransacked and his daughter taken captive.Nicholson, R.A., A Literary History of the Arabs, Richmond, Surrey, Curzon, Press, 1993, p. 329; Chenery, T. (trans), The Assemblies of Al Har√Æri, Volume 1, London, Williams and Norgate, 1867, p. 21 As soon as it first appeared, Al-Hariri's Maqamat attained enormous popularity across the Arab-speaking world,Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G., A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, John Wiley & Sons, 2017, p. 272 with people travelling from as far afield as Andalusia (Spain) to hear the verse read from the author's lips. The work's alternative title, ‚Äò'The Assemblies'‚Äô comes from the fact that maqamat were recited before an assembled audience.Meisami, J.S. and Starkey, P., (eds), Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, Volume 2, Taylor & Francis, 1998, p. 508 Even during the author's lifetime, the work was worthy of memorisation, public recitation and literary commentaries.H√§meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002,p. 208; Meri, J.W., Medieval Islamic Civilization: A-K, Taylor & Francis, 2006 p. 314; Decter, J.

Audience members would take dictation or make corrections to their own personal manuscripts. At the time, this type of public recitation was the main method for disseminating copies of literary works in the Arab speaking world.Maqamat Al-luzumiyah, BRILL, 2002, p. 2 When al-Hariri had written 40 maqamat, he collected them into a single volume and headed to Baghdad where he expected a triumphant reception. However, his opponents accused him of plagiarism; they claimed that the Assemblies were in fact the work of a writer from the Western Maghreb who had died in Baghdad and whose papers had fallen into Al-Hariri's hands. To test the merit of such claims, the Vizier sent for al-Hariri and invited him to compose a letter on a specified subject. However, Al-Hariri was not an improviser, rather he required long periods of solitude in which to compose his stories, and although he retired to a corner for a lengthy period, he was unable to produce anything and was ashamed. In an effort to redeem his reputation, al -Hariri returned to Basra where he composed ten additional maqamat in the following months.Chenery, T.

Temperatures in winter are low along the coast since Joam is located in the lower plains close to the Yellow Sea, where the water is shallow. Therefore, Joam's climate is classified as midwest coastal. Winters are generally dry, sunny and cold with temperatures in January averaging below freezing. Summer is hot and humid, and is the wettest season. Spring and fall are the mildest and most comfortable seasons and are also periods of flowering and agricultural activity. Because of Joam's abundant natural and agricultural scenery, spring and fall afford the best opportunities to appreciate the scenery around Joam.

The countryside is home to many pine and leafy trees, various flowers and birds, and edible plants that are collected by the local population. Many farms in the area are operated by small holders and families farming rice in fields and vegetables in greenhouses. In the late summer drying peppers are a common sight in front of many farmhouses. In the autumn, rice is harvested in vast quantities, as is celebrated at the Chuseok festival. In the winter, agricultural scraps are burned in the fields to restore nutrients and clear the way for spring planting. In the spring, the fields are flooded and planted with new rice seedlings which sprout first in greenhouses. The area is also home to many older traditional farmhouses that give it a unique historical flavor. When walking the many paths and country roads around Joam many traditional burial mounds can be seen.

If œÜ0 is any normal function, then for any non-zero ordinal Œ±, œÜŒ± is the function enumerating the common fixed points of œÜŒ≤ for Œ≤<Œ±. These functions are all normal.  The Veblen hierarchy  In the special case when œÜ0(Œ±)=œâŒ± this family of functions is known as the Veblen hierarchy. The function œÜ1 is the same as the Œµ function: œÜ1(Œ±)= ŒµŒ±. If \\\\alpha < \\\\beta \\\\,, then \\\\varphi_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma)) = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma) \\\\,. From this and the fact that œÜŒ≤ is strictly increasing we get the ordering: \\\\varphi_\\\\alpha(\\\\beta) < \\\\varphi_\\\\gamma(\\\\delta) if and only if either (\\\\alpha = \\\\gamma and \\\\beta < \\\\delta ) or (\\\\alpha < \\\\gamma and \\\\beta < \\\\varphi_\\\\gamma(\\\\delta) ) or (\\\\alpha > \\\\gamma and \\\\varphi_\\\\alpha(\\\\beta) < \\\\delta ). = Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy = The fundamental sequence for an ordinal with cofinality œâ is a distinguished strictly increasing œâ-sequence which has the ordinal as its limit. If one has fundamental sequences for Œ± and all smaller limit ordinals, then one can create an explicit constructive bijection between œâ and Œ±, (i.e. one not using the axiom of choice). Here we will describe fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy of ordinals. The image of n under the fundamental sequence for Œ± will be indicated by Œ±[n]. A variation of Cantor normal form used in connection with the Veblen hierarchy is -- every nonzero ordinal number Œ± can be uniquely written as \\\\alpha = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_1}(\\\\gamma_1) + \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_2}(\\\\gamma_2) + \\\\cdots + \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_k}(\\\\gamma_k), where k>0 is a natural number and each term after the first is less than or equal to the previous term, \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_m}(\\\\gamma_m) \\\\geq \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_{m+1}}(\\\\gamma_{m+1}) \\\\,, and each \\\\gamma_m < \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_m}(\\\\gamma_m) \\\\,. If a fundamental sequence can be provided for the last term, then that term can be replaced by such a sequence to get \\\\alpha [n] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_1}(\\\\gamma_1) + \\\\cdots + \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_{k-1}}(\\\\gamma_{k-1}) + (\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta_k}(\\\\gamma_k) [n]) \\\\,. For any Œ≤, if Œ≥ is a limit with \\\\gamma < \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta} (\\\\gamma) \\\\,, then let \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma) [n] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma [n]) \\\\,. No such sequence can be provided for \\\\varphi_0(0) = œâ0 = 1 because it does not have cofinality œâ. For \\\\varphi_0(\\\\gamma+1) = \\\\omega ^{\\\\gamma+1} = \\\\omega^ \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\omega \\\\,, we choose \\\\varphi_0(\\\\gamma+1) [n] = \\\\varphi_0(\\\\gamma) \\\\cdot n = \\\\omega^{\\\\gamma} \\\\cdot n \\\\,. For \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(0) \\\\,, we use \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(0) [0] = 0 and \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(0) [n+1] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(0) [n]) \\\\,, i.e. 0, \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(0), \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(0)), etc.. For \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(\\\\gamma+1), we use \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(\\\\gamma+1) [0] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(\\\\gamma)+1 and \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(\\\\gamma+1) [n+1] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta} (\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta+1}(\\\\gamma+1) [n]) \\\\,. Now suppose that Œ≤ is a limit: If \\\\beta < \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(0), then let \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(0) [n] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta [n]}(0) \\\\,. For \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma+1), use \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma+1) [n] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\beta [n]}(\\\\varphi_{\\\\beta}(\\\\gamma)+1) \\\\,. Otherwise, the ordinal cannot be described in terms of smaller ordinals using \\\\varphi and this scheme does not apply to it. =The Œì function= The function Œì enumerates the ordinals Œ± such that œÜŒ±(0) = Œ±. Œì0 is the Feferman‚ÄìSch√ºtte ordinal, i.e. it is the smallest Œ± such that œÜŒ±(0) = Œ±. For Œì0, a fundamental sequence could be chosen to be \\\\Gamma_0 [0] = 0 and \\\\Gamma_0 [n+1] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\Gamma_0 [n]} (0) \\\\,. For ŒìŒ≤+1, let \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta+1} [0] = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta} + 1 and \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta+1} [n+1] = \\\\varphi_{\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta+1} [n]} (0) \\\\,. For ŒìŒ≤ where \\\\beta < \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta} is a limit, let \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta} [n] = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta [n]} \\\\,. Generalizations =Finitely many variables= To build the Veblen function of a finite number of arguments (finitary Veblen function), let the binary function \\\\varphi(\\\\alpha, \\\\gamma) be \\\\varphi_\\\\alpha(\\\\gamma) as defined above. Let z be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma- separated zeros 0,0,...,0 and s be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma-separated ordinals \\\\alpha _{1},\\\\alpha _{2},...,\\\\alpha _{n} with \\\\alpha _{1}>0. The binary function \\\\varphi (\\\\beta ,\\\\gamma ) can be written as \\\\varphi (s,\\\\beta ,z,\\\\gamma ) where both s and z are empty strings. The finitary Veblen functions are defined as follows: * \\\\varphi (\\\\gamma )=\\\\omega ^{\\\\gamma } * \\\\varphi (z,s,\\\\gamma )=\\\\varphi (s,\\\\gamma ) * if \\\\beta >0, then \\\\varphi (s,\\\\beta ,z,\\\\gamma ) denotes the (1+\\\\gamma )-th common fixed point of the functions \\\\xi \\\\mapsto \\\\varphi (s,\\\\delta ,\\\\xi ,z) for each \\\\delta <\\\\beta For example, \\\\varphi(1,0,\\\\gamma) is the (1+\\\\gamma)-th fixed point of the functions \\\\xi\\\\mapsto\\\\varphi(\\\\xi,0), namely \\\\Gamma_\\\\gamma; then \\\\varphi(1,1,\\\\gamma) enumerates the fixed points of that function, i.e., of the \\\\xi\\\\mapsto\\\\Gamma_\\\\xi function; and \\\\varphi(2,0,\\\\gamma) enumerates the fixed points of all the \\\\xi\\\\mapsto\\\\varphi(1,\\\\xi,0). Each instance of the generalized Veblen functions is continuous in the last nonzero variable (i.e., if one variable is made to vary and all later variables are kept constantly equal to zero). The ordinal \\\\varphi(1,0,0,0) is sometimes known as the Ackermann ordinal. The limit of the \\\\varphi(1,0,...,0) where the number of zeroes ranges over œâ, is sometimes known as the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù Veblen ordinal. Every non-zero ordinal \\\\alpha less than the small Veblen ordinal (SVO) can be uniquely written in normal form for the finitary Veblen function: \\\\alpha =\\\\varphi (s_{1})+\\\\varphi (s_{2})+\\\\cdots +\\\\varphi (s_{k}) where * k is a positive integer * \\\\varphi (s_{1})\\\\geq \\\\varphi (s_{2})\\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\varphi (s_{k}) * s_{m} is a string consisting of one or more comma-separated ordinals \\\\alpha _{m,1},\\\\alpha _{m,2},...,\\\\alpha _{m,n_{m}} where \\\\alpha _{m,1}>0 and each \\\\alpha _{m,i}<\\\\varphi (s_{m}) = Fundamental sequences for limit ordinals of finitary Veblen function = For limit ordinals \\\\alpha, written in normal form for the finitary Veblen function: * (\\\\varphi(s_1)+\\\\varphi(s_2)+\\\\cdots+\\\\varphi(s_k))[n]=\\\\varphi(s_1)+\\\\varphi(s_2)+\\\\cdots+\\\\varphi(s_k)[n], * \\\\varphi(\\\\gamma)[n]=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{lcr} n \\\\quad \\\\text{if} \\\\quad \\\\gamma=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\cdot n \\\\quad \\\\text{if} \\\\quad \\\\gamma \\\\quad \\\\text{is a successor ordinal}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi(\\\\gamma[n]) \\\\quad \\\\text{if} \\\\quad \\\\gamma \\\\quad \\\\text{is a limit ordinal}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right. , * \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[0]=0 and \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n+1]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta-1,\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n],z) if \\\\gamma=0 and \\\\beta is a successor ordinal, * \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[0]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma-1)+1 and \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n+1]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta-1,\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n],z) if \\\\gamma and \\\\beta are successor ordinals, * \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma[n]) if \\\\gamma is a limit ordinal, * \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta[n],z,\\\\gamma) if \\\\gamma=0 and \\\\beta is a limit ordinal, * \\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma)[n]=\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta[n],\\\\varphi(s,\\\\beta,z,\\\\gamma-1)+1,z) if \\\\gamma is a successor ordinal and \\\\beta is a limit ordinal. =Transfinitely many variables= More generally, Veblen showed that œÜ can be defined even for a transfinite sequence of ordinals Œ±Œ≤, provided that all but a finite number of them are zero. Notice that if such a sequence of ordinals is chosen from those less than an uncountable regular cardinal Œ∫, then the sequence may be encoded as a single ordinal less than Œ∫Œ∫. So one is defining a function œÜ from Œ∫Œ∫ into Œ∫. The definition can be given as follows: let _Œ±_ be a transfinite sequence of ordinals (i.e., an ordinal function with finite support) which ends in zero (i.e., such that Œ±‚ÇÄ=0), and let _Œ±_ [0‚Ü¶Œ≥] denote the same function where the final 0 has been replaced by Œ≥. Then Œ≥‚Ü¶œÜ( _Œ±_ [0‚Ü¶Œ≥]) is defined as the function enumerating the common fixed points of all functions Œæ‚Ü¶œÜ( _Œ≤_ ) where _Œ≤_ ranges over all sequences which are obtained by decreasing the smallest-indexed nonzero value of _Œ±_ and replacing some smaller-indexed value with the indeterminate Œæ (i.e., _Œ≤_ = _Œ±_ [Œπ‚ÇÄ‚Ü¶Œ∂,Œπ‚Ü¶Œæ] meaning that for the smallest index Œπ‚ÇÄ such that Œ±Œπ‚ÇÄ is nonzero the latter has been replaced by some value Œ∂<Œ±Œπ‚ÇÄ and that for some smaller index Œπ<Œπ‚ÇÄ, the value Œ±Œπ=0 has been replaced with Œæ). For example, if _Œ±_ =(œâ‚Ü¶1) denotes the transfinite sequence with value 1 at œâ and 0 everywhere else, then œÜ(œâ‚Ü¶1) is the smallest fixed point of all the functions Œæ‚Ü¶œÜ(Œæ,0,‚Ä¶,0) with finitely many final zeroes (it is also the limit of the œÜ(1,0,‚Ä¶,0) with finitely many zeroes, the small Veblen ordinal). The smallest ordinal Œ± such that Œ± is greater than œÜ applied to any function with support in Œ± (i.e., which cannot be reached ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù using the Veblen function of transfinitely many variables) is sometimes known as the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù Veblen ordinal.

Early life and career Nashad Ali Shoukat was born in Delhi, British India, in 1923.Musician Nashad remembered Pakistan Today (newspaper), Published 3 January 2012, Retrieved 14 June 2019 He received his early academic education in a local high school in Delhi. He learned to play the flute. He moved to Bombay in the early 1940s. He composed under several names before finally settling for Nashad. Film director Nakshab Jarchavi changed Shaukat Ali's name to Nashad for his film Naghma (1953). He made his music debut under the name Shaukat Dehalvi in the 1947 action film Dildaar. The director was Shiv Raj, and it had lyrics by C.M. Muneer. The cast consisted of Sagina, Yashonat, Dev Radha and Deepak. He composed as Shaukat Ali for the 1948 film Jeene Do. Made under the banner of J. Hind Chitra, its director was A. F. Keeka and K. A. Majeed, and the cast included Monica Devi, Panalal, Harish, Ratan Piya, Laila Gupta and Shanta Kanwar. He used his real name Shaukat Ali to compose for the 1948 film Payal. In 1948, he also composed songs for film Toote Taare (1948) as Shaukat Dehalvi. Released under the banner of Sheikh Mukhtar's film production unit called \\"Omar Khayyam films\\", the director was Harish, and the cast included Shamim Banu and Motilal. In this film, he composed Mughal Empereor Bahadur Shah Zafar's famous ghazal \\"Na Kisi Ki Aankh Ka Noor Hoon\\" which became very popular throughout India. In 1949, he composed music for actor-director Yakub's film, Aiye. The film starred Yaqub and Sulochna Chatterji. In 1949, Nashad using the name Shaukat Ali Haideri composed songs for the film \\"Dada\\". The director was Harish, and it was released under the banner of \\"Omar Khayyam films\\", the cast included Sheikh Mukhtar, Begum Para, Munawwar Sultana, Shyam, Murad, Mukri, and Gullu. It was released in Jubilee cinema, Karachi. In 1953, film director, Nakshab Jarachavi, changed Shaukat Ali's name to Nashad, which he retained for the rest of his life. The story behind the name change has been written in the book \\"Naushad: Zarra Jo Aaftaab Bana\\" (Penguin). The director initially approached Naushad Ali for composing the music for his film. When Naushad Ali refused, the irate director Nakshab Jarchavi then changed Shaukat Ali's name to Nashad, to make it sound like Naushad. Nashad composed for Jarchavi's 1953 film Naghma, starring Nadira and Ashok Kumar. Interview from 1955 In August 1955, Nashad talked at length in an interview as to how composing film songs for Indian Film Industry was done back in those days. He said that when he was hired as a film music composer, his 'first job' usually was to sit with the film director and determine the musical situations in the upcoming film. After these discussions and back-and-forth suggestions, he would start composing the melodies to match with the mood of those situations in the film. Once the tune of the film song is agreed upon, then the lyricist writes the words of the approved tune.\\"I believe in Popular Film Music..\\" Shaukat Dehalvi Nashad cineplot.com website, Published 24 October 2010, Retrieved 13 June 2019 In this interview, Nashad described just one method of composing film melodies. As we know, people in the film industry sometimes also use just the opposite method of composing film songs - for example in Pakistan, the eminent poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz had written his famous nazm, Mujh Se Pehli Si Mohabbat Mere Mehboob Na Maang without having the foggiest idea that it would be later used in a 1962 Pakistani film Qaidi and then would go on to become hugely popular among the public. Of course some of the credit should also go to the music director Rasheed Attre and his son Wajahat Attre who worked very hard to come up with the final song composition (per Wajahat Attre's interview years later) and no doubt the singer Noor Jehan.

Hank heads out to Sunrise Hill and begins trying to bark up the sun, but in the process he attracts the coyote brothers Rip and Snort, who are hungry and angry. After a short, rather loony conversation the coyotes tell Hank that the sun comes up because they howl at it every morning, not because Hank barks at it.

Their efforts are a monumental failure, and it is not until JT the rooster, at the actual time of sunrise, begins crowing that the sun actually does come up. Hank gets mad and chases JT into the chicken house and, later, Pete the barn cat up a tree. Later on Hank sees a truck coming up the road. He makes the truck stop and a 'vampire' jumps out.

It was built in 1862 and is a major tourist attraction. Visitors are allowed between 1500 hours and 1630 hours on every weekday at an admission fee of 20 rupees for Indian citizens and 50 rupees for foreigners. This is the first of its kind in the Arabian sea coast of Kerala.  History  Alappuzha, the place where India's Alleppey Lighthouse stands, was one of the busiest ports and trade centres of Kerala. Alappuzha, a part of Travancore, was ruled by Rajas of Erstwhile Travancore before India's independence. After the arrival of the Portuguese, Dutch and English traders, Vizhinjam, Kollam, Travancore and Purakad were the main ports of Erstwhile Travancore through which foreign trade flourished. The decline of the Port of Purakkad necessitated the rehabilitation of the traders for which Alappuzha was selected as a port and infrastructure was developed. The port was opened to foreign traders in 1792. There was no regular lighthouse provided in the 18th century, only a light on the pier head served the mariners. As port activities increased, the authorities had to provide for a lighthouse. The construction of the present lighthouse began in the reign of His Highness Marthanda Varma-II Maharaja (ruler of Travancore) and was completed during the reign of His Highness Rama Varma Maharaja of Travancore. The first stone was laid by Mrs Mough Crawford on 26 April 1860. The 30' high lighthouse has a teak spiral staircase. A piece of first-order optical equipment with coconut oil double wick lamp light-source supplied by M/s. Chance Bros., Birmingham, was installed and commissioned into service on 28 March 1862. The same equipment continued to serve till 1952 when it was replaced by 500 mm drum optic and DA gas flasher of AGA make. The current 4th order optic with a 1000 watt electric lamp was installed in 1960. The mains supply was extended to the station in 1960, this enabled the installation of an electrically operated 4th order revolving optic system supplied by M/s BBT, Paris, this replaced the old equipment and was commissioned on 4 August 1960. The direct drive system was incorporated on 8 April 1998, and a separate emergency light in the 300 mm lantern on 30 December 1998. The incandescent lamp was replaced by 230 V 150 W Metal halide lamp on 28 February 1999. The lighthouse is still a manned station. and The lighthouse, which was painted plain white, was repainted in red and white bands in 2000.

The current Red Arrow services are routes 507 and 521, although the name was dropped from September 2009 to May 2016. History London Transport had instigated a Bus Reshaping Plan in 1966 to examine bus service operation, and settled on replacing some double- decker buses with long single-decker buses, which would have extra capacity by implementing a 'standee bus' model as used on the continent, whereby the fixed seating in the bus would be minimised to that required off-peak, with hand holds fitted to allow maximum standee capacity at peak times. These buses would also have dual doors. The concept was introduced with on 18 April 1966 with six AEC Merlin buses on a new express service, route 500, running between Victoria and Marble Arch, extended during shopping hours to Oxford Circus. On 7 September 1968 LT introduced these new buses on more Red Arrow routes, 501-507, along with wholesale introduction on several other route networks around the capital. The Red Arrow Network as of 1972 was: *500 Victoria station - Park Lane - Oxford Street - Marble Arch - Park Lane - Victoria station *501 Waterloo station - Aldwych - Holborn - St Paul's - Bank - London Bridge station *502 Waterloo station ‚Äì Aldwych ‚Äì Fleet Street - St Paul's ‚Äì London Wall - Liverpool Street station *503 Waterloo station ‚Äì Westminster Bridge - Victoria station *505 Waterloo station - Aldwych - Holborn ‚Äì Old Street ‚Äì Shoreditch Church *506 Victoria station ‚Äì Green Park ‚Äì Piccadilly Circus *507 Waterloo station ‚Äì Lambeth Bridge - Victoria station *513 Waterloo station - Aldwych - Fleet Street - St Paul's ‚Äì Cannon Street - London Bridge station From April 1981, London Transport started replacing Merlin buses on the Red Arrow routes with Leyland National IIs. Further expansions, contractions and renumbering of the route network occurred, but the core Red Arrow network remained into the 1980s, and into London Buses operation with the London General business unit, as part of the first stage of the privatisation of London bus services. On 2 June 2002, the remaining two Red Arrow routes 507 and 521, became the first London Bus routes to be converted to articulated buses. A fleet of articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaro O530Gs entered service from that date. Being commuter routes, and so little used outside peak times, these routes were suitable to test the articulated on, and resembled the original standee bus concept, now with off bus fare collection. Additionally, route 521 ran through the Strand Underpass making double decker operation impossible. The artics still carried the Red Arrow name, although it was much smaller and less pronounced than all the previous versions. As of 2008, the peak operating requirement was nine buses on the 507 and 19 on the 521.Buses Magazine, August 2008 issue, page 5, Ian Allan Publishing As part of the move to replace London's articulated buses, a commitment made in the 2008 London Mayoral election, the articulated buses on the 507 and 521 were replaced when their contracts expired in 2009. The articulated Citaros were replaced by new 12 metre rigid versions. On 25 July 2009 a weekend service was introduced on route 507, the first weekend service for a Red Arrow route. Route 521 converted to rigid operation on 1 September 2009. The new Citaros did not carry the Red Arrow name, as it was thought to be associated with articulated buses. This drew criticism, as there was nothing to distinguish the buses from normal services. Another criticism of bendy buses was the low number of seats, with only 49 per vehicle. A standard rigid Citaro has 44 seats, however the new ones for route 507 and 521 had just 21, with room for up to 76 standees, leading to criticism the new buses were \\"cattle trucks\\" and even more crowded than the buses they replaced.

Philip Railsback wrote the screenplay based on a 1993 New Yorker article by John Seabrook. The story focuses on Robert Kearns (played by Greg Kinnear) and his legal battle against the Ford Motor Company after they developed an intermittent windshield wiper based on ideas the inventor had patented. The film's title comes from the phrase \\"flash of genius\\" (like \\"stroke of genius\\"), which is patent law terminology that was in effect from 1941 to 1952, although Kearns's patent was filed in 1964; it held that the inventive act must come into the mind of an inventor as a kind of epiphany, and not as the result of tinkering. The film opened on 1,098 screens in the United States on October 3, 2008, and earned $2.2 million on its opening weekend. It remained in theaters for only three weeks, and eventually grossed only $4.6 million worldwide, coming up short against its $20 million budget. Plot On his wedding night in 1953, an errant champagne cork renders college engineering professor Robert Kearns (Greg Kinnear) almost completely blind in his left eye. A decade later, he is happily married to Phyllis (Lauren Graham) and the father of six children. As he drives his Ford Galaxie through a light rain, the constant movement of the windshield wipers irritates his troubled vision. The incident inspires him to create a wiper blade mechanism modeled on the human eye, which blinks every few seconds rather than continuously. With financial support from Gil Previck (Dermot Mulroney), Kearns converts his basement into a laboratory and develops a prototype he tests in a fish tank before installing it in his car. He patents his invention and demonstrates it for Ford researchers, who had been working on a similar project without success. Kearns refuses to explain how his mechanism works until he hammers out a favorable deal with the corporation. Impressed with Kearns' results, executive Macklin Tyler (Mitch Pileggi) asks him to prepare a business plan detailing the cost of the individual units, which Kearns intends to manufacture himself. Considering this to be sufficient commitment from the company, Kearns rents a warehouse he plans to use as a factory and forges ahead. He presents Ford with the pricing information it requested along with a sample unit, then waits for their response. Time passes, and when nobody contacts Kearns, he begins placing phone calls that are never returned. Frustrated, Kearns attends a Ford dealers convention at which the latest model of the Mustang is unveiled, promoting the intermittent wiper as a selling point. Realizing the company has used his idea without giving him credit or payment for it, Kearns begins his descent into a despair so deep he boards a Greyhound bus and heads for Washington, D.C., where he apparently hopes to find legal recourse. Instead, Maryland state troopers remove him from the bus and escort him to a mental hospital, where he is treated for a nervous breakdown. Finally released when doctors decide his obsession has subsided, he returns home a broken man, determined to receive public acknowledgement for his accomplishment. Thus begins years of legal battles, during which time his wife leaves him, and he becomes estranged from his children. At trial, Kearns represents himself after attorney Gregory Lawson (Alan Alda) withdraws from the case, because Robert refuses to settle. Eventually Kearns' ex-wife and children support him in his endeavor. Toward the end of the trial, Ford offers Kearns a $30 million settlement, but without admitting wrongdoing. Kearns decides to leave his fate in the hands of the jury, who determine that Ford infringed his patents, but that the infringement was not deliberate. The jury awards him $10.1 million. The closing credits indicate that Robert later wins an $18.7 million judgement from Chrysler Corporation as well. Cast Production Marc Abraham, who previously had produced The Road to Wellville (1994), Air Force One (1997), and Children of Men (2006), among many films, had long been drawn to the Robert Kearns saga for his directorial debut because the inventor believed more in fairness and honesty than the money offered to make him drop his lawsuit. \\"That's the reason I was passionate about it. It was about principle\\", the director said. \\"And principle is a very gray idea. And that's what I thought was exciting.\\" He submitted numerous revisions of the screenplay to Universal Studios chief Stacey Snider, who repeatedly told him, \\"This is not an easy script, and he's not a likable guy\\". Abraham believed what many might find unlikable in Kearns, with whom he consulted while developing the film, is what made him a distinctive character. When Universal underwent a change of management, the project finally was greenlit. The film was shot on location in Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario. The scene when Ford's new line of cars with the intermittent wiper is shown for the first time was shot in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia. The soundtrack includes \\"Too Many Fish In The Sea\\" by Liam Titcomb, \\"Green Onions\\" by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" by Aaron Zigman. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival before going into theatrical release in the United States. Critical reception Flash of Genius received mixed to positive reviews. As of January 2016, Rotten Tomatoes reports that Flash of Genius has a 60% approval rating with an average rating of 5.97/10, based on 106 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"The touching underdog story of a single guy against a massive corporation, Flash of Genius is a well-paced and well-written tale with a standout performance by star Greg Kinnear.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film \\"a meticulously constructed mechanism, one that wants to convey the same mixture of idealism, obsession and paranoia found in whistle-blower movies like Silkwood and The Insider\\", but thought it \\"has the tone and texture of a well- made but forgettable television movie\\". He added, \\"Flash of Genius would have been more gripping had it pinpointed events and conveyed the harrowing physical, emotional and financial cost of Kearns‚Äôs quest\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film tells its story in \\"faithful and often moving detail\\". He added, \\"If it has a handicap, it's that Kearns was not a colorful character, more of a very stubborn man with tunnel vision.... Kinnear, often a player of light comedy, does a convincing job of making this quiet, resolute man into a giant slayer.\\" Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said the film's problem \\"is that it wants so desperately to be a Hollywood-style story of the little guy triumphing over the big guy that it races past much of the subtlety of Kearns' story, smoothing things out so that it wouldn't be a spoiler to reveal the ending (though I won't) because it's blatantly marching in from a mile away. Flash of Genius wants so much to be liked, even with its prickly, difficult hero, that it misses the mark of nonobviousness necessary not only for a patent, but also for a thrilling, original work\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety agreed with Olsen and Holden, describing the film as \\"very small potatoes in the cinematic annals of inspiring little-guy-fights-the-system melodramas, to the point that it's a wonder it was thought to be strong bigscreen material; an old-style TV movie would have been more like it\\". He added, \\"Beyond the narrative shortcomings, the film is indifferently filmed, with uncustomarily flat visuals by cinematographer Dante Spinotti and listless pacing.\\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle said the biopic \\"is like watching Charlie Brown keep trying, even after the 30th time Lucy has pulled the football away. It's hard to tell whether Kearns is being noble or stupid, and halfway through the movie, most sane people in the audience will be rooting for him to give up his fight\\". He continued, \\"Marc Abraham has made a movie much like the Will Smith-as-plucky-homeless-guy drama The Pursuit of Happyness, where two hours of suffering may or may not lead to a single triumphant moment. It's a similar experience to watching a 1-0 soccer game that is decided in overtime. Sure, absolutely nothing resembling feel-good entertainment happens in the first 90 minutes. But oh, that overtime goal ...\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \\"Kinnear takes the star spot in Flash of Genius and rides it to glory...Kearns wasn't a movie hero. His halting courtroom delivery lacked Hollywood histrionics. Kinnear plays him with blunt honesty, sagging under the weight of stress but maintaining a bulldog tenacity that would win the day. Was the battle worth it? Kearns' conflict is readable in Kinnear's every word and gesture. His performance is worth cheering\\". Kinnear won the Best Actor Award at the 2008 Boston Film Festival.

Biography According to rumor an illegitimate son of Emperor Alexander II (), Alekseyev was raised by the family of Lieutenant Ivan Maximovich Alekseyev (1796‚Äì1849) in Sevastopol.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 32-33. At the age of 13 Alexeyev attended the Sea Cadet Corps and completed his training three years later. He was assigned as a midshipman for four years to the screw corvette Varyag on a world tour. Commissioned as an ensign in 1867, he served on numerous ships in the Imperial Russian Navy, and in 1878 received his first command: the cruiser Afrika, which he commanded on a voyage around the world from 1880 to 1883. From 1883 to 1888 Alexeyev served as a naval attach√© to France; he was promoted to the rank of captain in 1886. After his return to Russia in 1889 he was given command of the protected cruiser . In 1891 he made another round-the-world cruise, this time accompanied by the Tsarevich Nicholas (the future Tsar Nicholas II, ) - this was the Eastern journey of Nicholas II. Alexeyev was promoted to rear admiral in 1892 and served on the , becoming vice admiral in 1894 and deputy chief-of-staff in 1895. From 1895 to 1897 he commanded the Russian Pacific Fleet, initially at Vladivostok, and from December 1897, at Port Arthur in the southern Liaodong Peninsula leased from Qing-dynasty China. In 1898 he was appointed governor of the Kwantung Fortified Region, and was again named commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet from 1899. He participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901 in China as commander of an army corps, following an appointment by War Minister Aleksey Kuropatkin and was promoted to Adjutant general. The failure of Russia to withdraw its forces from Manchuria as scheduled after the end of the Boxer Rebellion further alarmed the Empire of Japan, still upset by the Triple Intervention, by Russian de facto annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula and by increasing Russian influence over Joseon dynasty Korea ‚Äì all of which the Japanese deemed detrimental to their interests and national security. Alexeyev was a key member of the \\"Bezobrazov Circle\\", a politically-motivated investment-group organized by Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov, whose investors included many members of the highest level in the Russian court. The \\"Bezobrazov Circle\\" aimed to establish a commercial enterprise reminiscent of the British East India Company which would reward its investors with financial benefits while setting the stage for the conquest of Manchuria and Korea. Alexeyev reassured the Emperor that increased aggressive action in the region would not provoke a military response from Japan. On August 13, 1903, Emperor Nicolas II appointed Alexeyev as , with all civil and military authority over Russian possessions in the Far East, including Russian-occupied Manchuria, the Liaodong Peninsula, and Russia's Amur Military District (present-day Primorsky Krai). As viceroy, he was beyond the jurisdiction of any ministry and reported directly to the Tsar; however, his exact functions remained poorly defined - historian Ian Nishstated: \\"he himself was unclear about the extent of his autonomy... In any event Alekseyev, who already had been given in May very great powers of coordination, did not greatly welcome the new title and almost declined to accept it.\\"Ian Nish, The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War (Longman, 1985; ), pp. 174-75. With the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War on February 9, 1904, Alexeyev became commander of all Russian land and naval forces in the Far East. He assumed direct command over the Russian Pacific Squadron after the dismissal of Vice Admiral Oskar Stark (February 24, 1904) until the arrival of Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov (March 8, 1904), and again after Makarov's death () until the appointment (April 1, 1904) of Vice Admiral Nikolai Skrydlov. On land, Alexeyev had serious and continual disagreements with General Kuropatkin, the former Minister of War, over the strategy employed against the Japanese. Alexeyev forced Kuropatkin to take a more aggressive position, despite Kuropatkin's insistence on waging a defensive war of attrition until the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, which would bring reinforcements and supplies. Following a direct order from the Tsar, Alexeyev left Port Arthur on May 5, 1904 for Mukden, and following the Russian defeat at the Battle of Shaho (5 to 17 October 1904, New Style), was relieved of his command and ordered back to St. Petersburg on October 12, 1904. In June 1905 the post of viceroy was abolished, and Alexeyev became a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. In his later years he moved to Russian Armenia and worked as a school teacher. In April 1917, in the wake of the February Revolution and the abdication of Emperor Nikolai II in March 1917, he retired from public life. He died a few weeks later in Yalta, on .

The department is headed by the Corporation Counsel, currently Jim Johnson, the 79th official to hold this position. The Law Department represents the mayor, city agencies, and city officials in all civil litigation, in juvenile delinquency proceedings in Family Court, and in prosecutions in the New York City Criminal Court under the New York City Administrative Code. Among the department's other duties are drafting contracts, leases, municipal bond issues, and other legal documents for the city; reviewing local and state legislation; and providing legal advice to city officials on a wide variety of issues. The New York City Charter, the New York City Administrative Code, and the Rules of the City of New York are published online by New York Legal Publishing Corporation under contract with the Law Department. The department's regulations are compiled in title 46 of the Rules. History The origins of the Law Department lie in the English office of the Recorder. After the City fell under British control following the Third Anglo-Dutch War, New York's Royal Governor Thomas Dongan created the Office of Recorder of New York City in 1683 to serve as legal and political counsel to the City Government. After the American Revolution, New York City continued to grow, and during the 19th century, the City Council began hiring private attorneys to do the internal legal work of the City. When this arrangement proved unsatisfactory, due to the chaos of shifting the city's caseload between various outside counsels,http://www.nyc.gov/html/law/downloads/pdf/NYLD%20History%20Card.pdf the City Charter was amended in 1849 to create the Office of the Corporation Counsel (so named because New York City is a municipal corporation). The revision established an independently elected chief executive officer known as the Corporation Counsel, and a staff of five, to be known as the Law Department. Later, the Corporation Counsel began being appointed by the Mayor of New York City, as is still the case today. Among the better-known cases that the department has litigated before the U.S. Supreme Court are Goldberg v. Kelly, Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, Ward v. Rock Against Racism, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, and Permanent Mission of India v. City of New York. The department also prepares amicus curiae briefs in many major court cases. Organizational structure The Law Department has 16 legal divisions and 5 support divisions. As of 2019, the department employs 1,000 lawyers and 890 support professionals in 20 offices located in all five boroughs, and an auxiliary office in Kingston, New York. The legal divisions are: *Administrative Law and Regulatory Litigation *Affirmative Litigation *Appeals *Commercial and Real Estate Litigation *Contracts and Real Estate *Economic Development *Environmental Law *Family Court *General Litigation *Labor and Employment Law *Legal Counsel *Municipal Finance *Special Federal Litigation (handles civil rights lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. 1983 brought against police, District Attorneys, or correction officers) *Tax and Bankruptcy *Tort *Workers' Compensation The support divisions are: *Administration *Electronic Discovery Group *Information Technology *Litigation Support and Information Management *Operations See also * The City Record * Rules of the City of New York * New York State Department of Law References Further reading *Press release for \\"Fighting for the City\\", a history book about the Office of the Corporation Counsel External links *New York City Law Department * Law Department in the Rules of the City of New York * CityAdmin, a collection of NYC administrative decisions from the Center for New York City Law Law Government agencies established in 1849 1849 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"New York City Law Department"},{"id":"16125419","text":"Amalgaid mac Fiachrae (died 440)all dates per The Chronology of the Irish Annals, Daniel P.

The asteroid was discovered on 4 August 2003, by American amateur astronomer and professor of geophysics, Joseph Dellinger at the Needville Observatory in Texas, United States. It was named for the town of Caripito in Venezuela.  Orbit and classification  Caripito is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.8 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,043 days; semi-major axis of 3.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery, published by the Digitized Sky Survey, was taken at Palomar Observatory in September 1953, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 50 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet is named for the Venezuelan town of Caripito in the northeastern Monagas State. It was the place where the parents of the discoverer, Thomas Baynes Dellinger (born 1926) and Mar√≠a de la Garza Cant√∫ (born 1928), met in 1949. At the time, the town was a base camp for the country's rich Quiriquire oil field. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 September 2005 ().  Physical characteristics  Caripitos spectral type is unknown. It is likely of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition due to its low albedo (see below). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Caripito measures 5.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.052. It has an absolute magnitude of 15.4. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Caripito has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

As part of the 1962 Route Reclassification Act, the Taylor Road portion of Route 220 was to be redesignated as part of an extended Route 191. However, in 1963, the decision was reversed and Route 220 remained intact with an additional westward extension along Elm Street to US 5.Connecticut Routes, Route 220 Major intersections References 220 Transportation in Hartford County, Connecticut 220 Transportation in Hampden County, Massachusetts ","title":"Route 220 (Connecticut‚ÄìMassachusetts)"},{"id":"16125808","text":"Bryan Kenneally (born 26 March 1942) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the VFL during the 1960s.

It lies on the banks of the perennial river Thamarabarani. This area is also known as Veeraraghavapuram, which is the hoary name of this place. It has been named after Veeraraghavan, the main and preceding deity (Moolavar), in Sri Varadharaja Temple. Sri Varadharaja perumal is the Usthava Moorthy. The temple is called on his name. Legend Few centuries back, a king by name Krishnavarma was ruling over this part of Tirunelveli. He held this region as his capital. He was a staunch devotee of Varadharaja perumal. He always used to pray Lord Varadharaja Perumal enthroned in his palace and chant the name of Lord Sri Rama. Observing the deep piety of this king, the neighbouring king utilized the chance to attack him. Legend says Lord Rama saved Krishnavarma from his foe. Lord appeared before king Krishnavarma as 'Veeraraghavan', the embodiment of bravery and valour. Deeply moved by the divine vision, the king sang a few slogas in praise of the Lord as stated in Thamirabarani Mahatmiyam (Ch:16-17 ). King Krishnavarma felt happy and constructed a temple for Lord Veeraraghavan to show his gratitude. He formed a city called Veeraraghavapuram around it and also called Veeraragha Theertha Kattam in river Thamirabrani, which flows as uthiravahini (towards north) in this kshetram.

A version was released for MS-DOS a short time later. The game featured all the sports included in the Summer X-Games of 1995, but it did not feature events like the half pipe in skateboarding. It was similar to Road Rash, which was a game published by Electronic Arts. The game was followed by two sequels, 2Xtreme and 3Xtreme. Like other titles released during the console's early life, the game was available in a large CD jewel case, like the ones used for the Sega CD and Sega Saturn games. The game was subsequently renamed 1Xtreme (as a way of indicating it's a predecessor to 2Xtreme) when it was released in the Greatest Hits line, as the ESPN license had expired. The ESPN logo and company name were removed from its title, and game content referring to ESPN was removed as well. Description The game featured many different sports, including skateboarding, roller blading, street luge and mountain biking. The tracks start at one end of a city, and progress along a linear path to another point of the city. Players kick and punch opponents while trying to obtain cash, attaining first place. The tracks are located in various parts of the world (I.e. including Tahoe and San Francisco). Video clips of broadcaster Suzy Kolber are displayed after each race, in which she offers words of encouragement or pointed criticism of your performance. Reception Roughly a year after the game's release, Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that ESPN Extreme Games was the biggest selling Sony-published PlayStation game worldwide. Reviewing the PlayStation version, Air Hendrix of GamePro said ESPN Extreme Games \\"doesn't push the limits of 32-bit graphics and gameplay, but it does take you on a thrilling ride.\\" He elaborated that the game suffers from \\"rocky\\" scrolling and overly pixelated graphics and has few tracks compared to the similar Road Rash, but that details in the graphics \\"keep the action realistic\\" and the racing is sufficiently intense. Maximum gave it four out of five stars, remarking that \\"being able to kick the stuffing out of anyone who dares to try and pass you (especially those racing bikes) makes it a wholly fulfilling experience.\\" They also praised the texture mapping and graphical details, though they criticized the small number of tracks and said the game does not measure up to Ridge Racer or Wipeout, both already released on the PlayStation. A brief review in Next Generation said it was \\"not bad\\" and scored it three out of five stars.

Incidents and Accidents  On August 24, 2014, at about 11:30 AM, a male trying out a newly bought experimental plane was spotted erratically taxiing down runway 6. After taking off, the pilot flew around the airport for about 5 minutes before going in to land. The approach was noted to be too steep and too fast. The plane eventually reached a good speed 1,000 feet down the runway, and leveled off before descending further at a high angle. The plane bounced and then exited the runway, stopping in some shrubbery. The pilot, despite being told not to, then got the airplane back on the runway and did a 180 to align with the runway. The pilot then applied full throttle and the plane abruptly turned right, veering off the runway. The airplane then continued going perpendicular to the runway. It was angled at a very high attack rate and rolled to the right. The plane then crashed into trees 100 yards South of the departure runway. The cause was determined to be pilot error. The pilot was killed in the crash. On January 19, 2015, a student pilot attempting a solo landing clipped pine trees short of the runway. The victim crashed on the driveway of a private residence, coming extremely close to the house. The victim was able to get out of the plane and go to the house for help, where he was sent to the hospital. The student pilot did survive the crash.

It is located in western Downtown Indianapolis. History Ever since the founding of Indianapolis in 1820, the grounds of Military Park, originally called Military Ground, have seen various uses. The first documented celebration of Independence Day in Indianapolis occurred at Military Ground on July 4, 1822. The United States Congress officially gave the land to the state of Indiana in 1827, for use in training the local militias. Before 1860, its greatest use for militia training was for the Black Hawk War in 1836.Bodenhamer 1008 Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs In accordance with the 1851 Indiana Constitution, the land that forms Military Park cannot be sold; only Monument Circle and half of the Indiana State Capitol share this distinction.Bodenhamer, David. The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis (Indiana University Press, 1994) pg.1008White River State Park . The first Indiana State Fair was held at the park in October 1852. Save for the years during which the fair traveled, the site was used for the state fair until it moved, in 1860, to the site where, during the Civil War, Camp Morton would be built. Stalls and exhibition halls were built on the grounds for such a purpose, surrounded by a large wooden fence. The State Fair made one last appearance on Military Park in 1863. Historical marker at the park During the Civil War, Union soldiers were encamped at the Park. Governor Oliver P. Morton renamed the park Camp Sullivan, after the 13th Indiana Infantry's Colonel Jeremiah C. Sullivan. It was the first designated camp for the Federal army in Marion County, Indiana. However, this use severely damaged the grounds, due to all of the different troops entering and leaving Camp Sullivan, as it was a marshaling center. Following the war, efforts by local resident George Merritt started to improve the grounds, with the addition of a fountain and a small pool with a considerable-size rock foundation. Relics from the war and playground equipment were also added, as was a pavilion that still stands.Camp Sullivan (Military Park) MarkerBodenhamer 443, 1008, 1009 William Jennings Bryan was notified that he would be the Democrat nominee for the Presidency of the United States on August 7, 1900.

Taxonomy Malagasy hippopotamuses were first discovered in the mid-19th century by Alfred Grandidier, who unearthed nearly 50 individual hippos from a dried-up swamp at Ambolisaka near Lake Ihotry, a few miles from the Mozambique Channel. In 1989, Scandinavian palaeontologist Solweig Stuenes described H. madagascariensis and H. lemerlei from these bones. It has been classified as a species of pygmy hippopotamus (genus Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon), though similarities may simply be due to convergent evolution. Other Malagasy hippos are classified into the genus Hippopotamus. Description Like the modern pygmy hippopotamus, the Malagasy pygmy hippo had eyes on the side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth of the common hippopotamus. The Malagasy pygmy hippo was similarly less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested highlands of Madagascar. Fossils of both the Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, and they would have been much better runners. Extinction Although there have been no remains dating to within the last thousand years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in Malagasy oral legends. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the , the , the , and the , all animals that resembled hippopotamuses. The strength of these oral traditions led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to classify H. madagascarensis as recently extinct (going extinct some time after the year 1500). At least seven hippopotamus bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, suggesting that they survived until humans arrived on Madagascar. Humans and hippos may have coexisted for about 2,000 years. It is possible overhunting by humans led to their extinction.

Plot overview  Hawkeye and Trapper are off to surgical clinic in Japan, but instead of attending seminars and meetings, they intend to spend their time golfing and picking up geisha girls. Once arriving in Japan, the two cohorts sit at a bar and chum up to a civilian medical consultant, Anthony Borelli (played by Robert Alda, Alan Alda's real-life father). They exchange stories, as Borelli is in Tokyo attending the same conference and has himself served as surgical doctor in both world wars. Trapper and Hawkeye invite Borelli to leave the \\"cozy locker room in Tokyo\\" and get some real game in a M*A*S*H unit or aid station. He politely declines and the three part ways. Back at the camp, Henry is enjoying a soak in a makeshift wading pool that has apparently been engineered by Radar. Frank saunters up and complains loudly that Hawkeye and Trapper did not attend a single lecture at the clinic. Henry avoids Frank by sinking under the water. Then, Trapper and Hawkeye walk out, decked in swimming shorts, flippers and floaties. They jump into the pool, making a big splash. As Henry broaches the topic of the clinic, a chopper arrives, and it carries Dr. Borelli who has come for a stay at the friendly 4077th. Borelli bunks in the Swamp and prepares for his stay as visiting surgeon. Frank and Margaret are excited to meet the new doctor and Margaret puts on her usual charms. More choppers arrive, this time with wounded. In the OR everyone is working on patients, including Frank who is about ready to amputate a patient's leg because of a collapsed artery. Borelli intercedes and explains the process of an arterial transplant. For this procedure a new artery is grafted in, resulting in preservation of the limb. In a tense moment, Frank objects because, \\"Somebody might get in trouble.\\" Eventually, Henry sends Radar to the phones so that they can track down a new artery. In the Mess, Hawkeye, Trapper, and Borelli sit at one table drinking coffee, while Frank and Margaret sit at an opposite table doing the same. Borelli and Margaret continue to eye each other. Radar barges in, announcing that he found the artery. Trapper and Hawkeye leave to retrieve the artery while Borelli ominously declines to make the trip. At the British Army M*A*S*H where the artery resides, Trapper and Hawkeye talk with a pompous and talkative British CO who is cordial enough, but takes his time signing over the artery. When Trapper and Hawkeye get back to the 4077th, they have Borelli paged to the OR and the two surgeons scrub in. Radar comes into the OR, looking upset and urges Hawkeye to go to the Swamp, where Borelli waits. In the Swamp Borelli sits with a scared, somber expression on his face, and Hawkeye realizes that the surgeon is drunk and unfit to operate. Borelli reasons that Hawkeye can handle the surgery if Borelli directs him, and Hawkeye grudgingly agrees to go through with the surgery, which is successful. Later, in the Swamp with tension in the air, Borelli explains how he wasn't prepared for the intensity of the M*A*S*H unit and he had to turn to drinking in order to recover. He says that his old age makes things harder to bear than they once were. He leaves, and Hawkeye sets aside his drink.

Drafted by the Red Sox in the second round of the 2006 MLB draft from San Diego State University, he made his MLB debut two years later. Masterson also played in MLB for the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Cardinals. Known for primarily throwing a sinking fastball, the right-hander stands 6' 6\\" (198 cm) tall, and weighs 250 lb (113 kg). A former All-Star selection, Masterson placed in the top-ten in the American League multiple categories in 2013, including wins, strikeouts, complete games, hits per nine innings pitched, and strikeouts per nine innings pitched. He was the first Red Sox pitcher since Fenway Park's 1912 opening to make his first four consecutive starts there and not lose any of them. Early life Masterson was born in Kingston, Jamaica, where his father served as Dean of Students at the Jamaica Theological Seminary. A few years later, Masterson moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana. He attended Beavercreek High School in Beavercreek, Ohio where he first played basketball and baseball as a catcher, pitcher, and first baseman. His mother works as a teacher and his father is a pastor. Masterson attended Bethel College in Mishawaka, Indiana, where he played as a starting pitcher. While at Bethel, he hit 10 home runs (HR) during his sophomore year. He then attended San Diego State University. In 2005, Masterson played collegiate summer baseball for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He posted a 1.15 ERA with 39 strikeouts in 31.1 innings pitched. In 2017 he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Professional career =Boston Red Sox= Masterson during his first tenure with the Boston Red Sox in 2008. Baseball America rated Masterson as the 64th-best overall prospect for their 2006 Major League Baseball draft projections. The Boston Red Sox selected him in the second round. Dan Madsen signed him. Masterson began as both a starter and reliever in his minor league career for the Lowell Spinners. In 2007, his second season, the club promoted him from the Class A Lancaster JetHawks to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. His twelve wins that season ranked second among all Red Sox minor leaguers. After joining the Sea Dogs, Masterson said, \\"I've had the confidence to be a great pitcher all along. I went to a smaller school and really proved that I had the ability to pitch, and whatever route I took to get me where I am I'm not worried about it.\\"The Daily Aztec In 2006, Masterson was named to Baseball America's short season all-star team. Masterson converted to starting pitching in early 2007, after a stint as a relief pitcher for Short Season Lowell in 2006. The Red Sox invited Masterson to spring training before the 2008 season. On April 24, he made his Major League debut against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in an emergency call-up start. He pitched six full innings (IP) and allowed one run. The Red Sox immediately sent him back to Portland following the game. The next month, on May 20, he made his second appearance, pitching innings, allowing three hits and one run with three walks and five strikeouts and picking up his first win in the Majors. After five starts with the major-league club, it was announced that he would stay in the majors through Daisuke Matsuzaka's return from the disabled list (DL) due to Bartolo Col√≥n's back injury. On July 7, 2008, Masterson was sent back to the Pawtucket Red Sox, a move manager Terry Francona stated was made to transition Masterson from a starter to a relief pitcher. Masterson was recalled on July 20 due to an injury to David Aardsma In his first relief appearance, he was solid against the Seattle Mariners, shutting down the hitters and working scoreless innings at Safeco Field in Seattle. Masterson picked up the first postseason win of his career in Game Five of the 2008 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching a scoreless ninth inning in the Red Sox' 8-7 victory. In 2009, Masterson began the season in the bullpen while also starting six games before being traded to the Cleveland Indians. =Cleveland Indians= Masterson pitching for the Indians in 2009 On July 31, 2009, Masterson was traded by Boston along with minor league prospects Nick Hagadone and Bryan Price to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Victor Martinez. Upon arriving to Cleveland, Masterson was inserted into the Indians rotation. He started 10 games, struggling to a record of 1‚Äì7 for the rest of 2009. Masterson enjoyed his first full season as a starter in 2010, but he once again failed to make an impact with the Indians and finished with a 6‚Äì13 record in 29 starts. Nevertheless, Masterson seemed to save his best stuff for when he was facing his former Red Sox teammates. He pitched the first shutout of his professional career on June 9 of that season, a two-hit, 11‚Äì0 victory against Boston at Progressive Field, in which he struck out six and allowed two singles and two walks. Masterson finished the 2011 season with a 12‚Äì10 record, having career bests in ERA (3.21), innings pitched (216) and home runs allowed (11). On August 4, he victimized the Red Sox for the second time, and also committed one of the rarer feats in baseball. In the bottom of the second inning, Masterson struck out Josh Reddick swinging before a wild pitch allowed Reddick to reach first base on the play. Then, Masterson proceeded to strike out Jason Varitek, Marco Scutaro and Jacoby Ellsbury in succession to end the inning, making him one of 68 pitchers in Major League history to strike out four batters in a single inning. Following the end of the season Masterson underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder. The surgery was required after enduring an injury in 2007 as a member of the Red Sox. On April 5, 2012, the Indians made Masterson the Opening Day starter for the first time in his career. The game was against the Toronto Blue Jays in what proved to be the longest Opening Day game in major league history, a 7‚Äì4 loss in 16 innings. He completed eight innings, giving up two hits and one run while striking out 10, and earned a no-decision. However, he regressed in his third season with the Indians, finishing 11‚Äì15 with a career-worst 4.93 ERA in 34 starts. The Indians hired Francona to be their manager the following October, reuniting the pitcher with his former manager. For the 2013 season, the Indians again named Masterson the Opening Day starting pitcher. He defeated Blue Jays' reigning NL Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey, acquired in the prior off-season from the New York Mets. In his next start, his second win came against the reigning American League Cy Young winner, David Price of the Rays. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Masterson became just the third player in MLB history to defeat both reigning Cy Young winners in the same season ‚Äì and the first to do so in his first two starts of the season. With his sixth campaign about to begin and no contract, Masterson was eligible to become a free agent for the first time in his career. He was also arbitration- eligible. Instead, Masterson and the Indians agreed to a one-year, $9.7 million contract in February, 2014, for the 2014 season. The two parties also began talks for a contract extension beyond 2014. However, the next month, discussions were ended until after the season. Masterson had offered the club extensions for $17 million per year in separate offers of two and three years, with option years, but that was more than the Indians were willing to pay. A pitcher with similar career achievements, Homer Bailey, had signed an extension for more years with the Cincinnati Reds at $17.5 million per year. Tapped for his third consecutive Opening Day start, Masterson pitched seven scoreless innings but did not qualify for a decision in a 2‚Äì0 extra innings victory against the Oakland Athletics. On June 2, he completed an immaculate inning against the Red Sox, striking out Jonny Gomes, Grady Sizemore, and Stephen Drew in order on nine pitches. Only 72 pitchers have accomplished that feat in Major League history. =St. Louis Cardinals= Masterson with the St. Louis Cardinals On July 30, 2014, the Indians traded Masterson to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder James Ramsey. To honor their former teammate, all Indians players donned Masterson's high-sock style for the next game after his trade against the Mariners. Masterson had been on the DL due to a knee injury for nearly a month when he was traded. The Cardinals activated him from the DL on August 1. He won his Cardinals debut against the Milwaukee Brewers the next day, a 9‚Äì7 victory, in spite of allowing five runs, seven hits and three walks in six IP. While batting, he collected his first hit and run scored of the season. =Return to Boston Red Sox= A free agent after the 2014 season, Masterson agreed to a one-year deal with Boston worth $9.5 million on December 11. On August 10, 2015, Masterson was designated for assignment by Boston. He was released on August 19. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Masterson agreed to a minor league deal with the Pirates on May 12, 2016. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On March 27, 2017, Masterson signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and he was assigned to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers to begin the season. He remained with them all year and was 11‚Äì6 with a 4.13 ERA in 25 starts. Masterson retired on December 11, 2018. Pitching profile Masterson pitched at a low three-quarter arm-slot (nearly sidearm) with a sliding motion, which some compare to Dennis Eckersley's delivery. His pitching arsenal included a fastball that reached , a sinker, a slider, and an occasional change-up. It has been claimed that his best pitch is his plus-sinker with a heavy drop. Masterson threw a variety of fastballs that varied in speed and break, with the speeds reaching between from the upper 80s to the mid 90s. The speed of his slider was in the low 80s, and his change-up ranged from . He varied his sinker at speeds of , sometimes catching batters off balance. Personal life Masterson married Meryl Ham on November 3, 2007. Masterson is a Christian and often speaks of the importance of God in his life. He spoke at the Pentagon's weekly prayer breakfast in June 2009. Philanthropy Masterson and his wife Meryl founded the non-profit Fortress Foundation in 2013 with the help of business partner Matt Zappasodi and Cullinane Law. In February 2013, they partnered with Not For Sale Team. In November 2013, they worked with the Feed Their Future campaign with Mark Zimmerman from Moody Radio Cleveland and Bright Hope in Nairobi, Kenya. They partnered again in April 2013.

Originally the road, aided by ferries, formed a nearly unbroken loop around the city. Today, it is interrupted by a lake and rerouted sections. Route description Old Hickory Bridge on Old Hickory Boulevard The road is named for President Andrew Jackson, who was nicknamed \\"Old Hickory.\\" The road intersects with each of Interstates 24, 65, and 40 in the Nashville area at least twice, which contributes to the misconception that there are many roads in Nashville using this name, rather than one. To the southeast, Old Hickory Boulevard was interrupted by the creation of Percy Priest Lake and is now partly underwater. Major road projects combined with the gap created by the lake effectively merged the identity of Old Hickory Boulevard with Bell Road, But the two are distinct; traffic continues from Old Hickory Boulevard straight onto Bell Road at an intersection about east of Nolensville Pike (US 31A/US 41A) while Old Hickory Boulevard itself turns right at the intersection toward I-24. From there, it proceeds north-northeast to intersect Murfreesboro Pike (US 41/US 70), and merging with Lavergne-Couchville Pike later, near where the old route of the road enters what is now the lake. On the west side, it terminates at River Road Pike and Old Charlotte Pike, north of Bellevue and south of the Cumberland River. A previous segment about to the northeast runs from Charlotte Pike (US 70) to the former Cleeces Ferry location on the south bank of the Cumberland River; this was renamed Annex Avenue after the ferry closed. Cleeces Ferry closed in 1990 after the opening of the Andrew B. Gibson Bridge on Tennessee State Route 155, which is also known as Briley Parkway. Old Hickory Boulevard south of U.S. 70 and the section renamed Annex Avenue never aligned. On the north side of the river, Old Hickory Boulevard terminates at the former ferry ramp, which is now a boat launch.

The New York Times, March 1, 2006. Accessed March 6, 2008. Early life Musto was born in West Hoboken (now part of Union City) on March 27, 1917. He had a brother, Patrick Roy Musto. His uncle, who was also named William Musto, was a druggist elected president of the North Hudson Pharmaceutical Association on June 10, 1956.\\"North Hudson Druggists Electo Musto President\\", Hudson Dispatch, June 11, 1956. He was a graduate of John Marshall Law School (now the Seton Hall University School of Law) in Newark. He served in World War II as a Captain in the 80th Division, 315th FA, Co C (as CO), General George S. Patton's Third Army, earning a Bronze Star. Career In 1946 Musto was elected to the New Jersey assembly, where he started his long political career. After three years in the assembly working alongside Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague, Musto allied himself with the John V. Kenny Victory Ticket in 1949, and by 1953 became the Democratic minority leader of the state assembly. By 1965, Musto was elected to the New Jersey State Senate. In 1970 he lost the city election to reform candidate William Meehan, and did not return to the mayoral seat until 1974, where he served in a second, non-consecutive term until the 1982 election. In 1972 Musto originated the North Hudson Council of Mayors, which was meant to offset Jersey City's \\"dominance\\" of county government. He is also responsible for originating the New Jersey State Lottery, and casino gambling in the area, funds from which were used for education.Mestanza, Jean-Pierre (June 11, 2011). \\"William V. Musto Cultural Center in Union City officially opens\\". NJ.com. He is also credited with revitalizing the New Jersey Meadowlands. He was known for being an advocate of women's rights and health care reform. Legal troubles In 1977 investigations began into the city's dealings with Rudolph Orlandini, who was hired for a $2.2 million project to construct additions on the city's two high schools at the time, Emerson High School and Union Hill High School, projects that ultimately incurred $12 million in spending. In 1979, with a trial looming, Deputy Public Works Director Bruce D. Walter and Board of Education Secretary Robert Menendez (both of whom would later serve terms as Mayor of Union City) formed the Alliance Civic Association, and publicly questioned the overrun costs on Orlandini's construction company. In April 1981, a grand jury indicted Musto and six others on 36 counts of racketeering, extortion and fraud. They were eventually convicted of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from Orlandini, in part due to testimony by Menendez, a former aide of Musto's.\\"15 Most corrupt politicians in N.J. history\\". NJ.com. March 10, 2014. Musto's conviction drew disbelief from some of his contemporaries, as well as skepticism at the validity of the accusations against him. On March 26, 1982, Musto and his co-defendants were convicted in skimming $600,000 in kickbacks from Orlandini contracts for the school construction projects. Musto was sentenced to seven years in prison. Despite his legal troubles, Musto still managed to maintain his adoration from Union City and continued his 1982 reelection campaign for the city commission, winning the election against Menendez on May 11, 1982, the day after his sentencing. The courts forced him from office, and his wife, Rhyta, won her husband's seat in a special election. He was succeeded in the New Jersey Senate by Christopher Jackman. After two years of appeals, Musto began serving his prison sentence in 1984 on a reduced sentence of five years. During the May 13, 1984 election, Commissioner Rhyta Musto was part of the incumbent Union City Together ticket.

He was created Earl of Suffolk in 1337. Early life Born 9 August 1298, Robert Ufford was the second but eldest surviving son of Robert Ufford, 1st Baron Ufford (1279‚Äì1316), lord of the manor of Ufford, Suffolk, who was summoned to Parliament by writ of the king dated 13 January 1308,Fisher, George, Companion and Key to the History of England, Lonndon, 1832, p.674 by which he is deemed to have become a baron. His mother was Cecily de Valoignes (died 1325), daughter and co-heiress of Sir Robert de Valoignes (died 1281Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, II (HMSO 1906), p. 247 no. 432 (Internet Archive).) and Eva (de La Pecche).It is debated whether Eva was Eva Pecche or Eva Criketot. See 'Prioratus de Ixworth' in W. Dugdale and C. Dodsworth, Monastici Anglicani, Volumen Alterum, De Canonicis Regularibus Augustinianis (Alicia Warren, London 1661), pp. 184-85. He had a younger brother, Sir Ralph Ufford (died 1346). On 19 May 1318 he had livery of his father's Suffolk lands. He was knighted and received some official employments, being occupied, for example, in 1326 in levying ships for the royal use in Suffolk, and serving in November 1327 on a commission of the peace in the eastern counties under the statute of Winchester. In May and June 1329 he attended the young Edward III on his journey to Amiens. He was employed on state affairs down to the end of the rule of Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, and on 1 May 1330 received a grant for life of Orford Castle in Suffolk, which had been previously held by his father; he also obtained grants of other lands. On 28 July he was appointed to array and command the levies of Norfolk and Suffolk summoned to fight \\"against the king's rebels\\". Nevertheless, in October he associated himself with William de Montacute in the attack on Mortimer at Nottingham. He took part in the capture of Mortimer in Nottingham Castle, and was implicated in the deaths of Sir Hugh de Turplington and Richard de Monmouth that occurred during the scuffle; that on 12 February 1331 he received a special pardon for the homicide. He was rewarded by the grant of the manors of Cawston and Fakenham in Norfolk, and also of some houses in Cripplegate that had belonged to Mortimer's associate, John Maltravers, succeeding Maltravers in some posts. He was summoned as a baron to parliament on 27 January 1332. From that time he was one of the most trusted warriors, counsellors, and diplomats in Edward III's service. Earl of Suffolk On 1 November 1335 Ufford was appointed a member of an embassy empowered to treat with the Scots. He then served in a campaign against them, and was made warden of Bothwell Castle. On 14 January 1337 he was made Admiral of the North; Ufford ceased to hold this office later in the year. In March he was created Earl of Suffolk, and was granted lands. During his absence in parliament the Scots retook Bothwell Castle. Hundred Years' War In opening moves of the Edwardian War, Suffolk was sent on 3 October 1337, with Henry Burghersh, the Earl of Northampton, and Sir John Darcy, to treat for peace or a truce with the French. Further powers were given them to deal with Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor and other allies, and on 7 October they were also commissioned to treat with David Bruce, then staying in France, and were accredited to the two cardinals sent by the pope to make an Anglo-French reconciliation. Next year, on 1 July, Suffolk was associated with John de Stratford and others on an embassy to France, and left England along with the two cardinals sent to treat for peace. He attended the king in Brabant, serving in September 1339 in the expedition that besieged Cambrai, and in the army that prepared to fight a major battle at Buironfosse that came to nothing, where he and the Earl of Derby held a joint command. On 15 November of the same year he was appointed joint ambassador to Louis I, Count of Flanders and the Flemish estates, to treat for an alliance. After Edward's return to England, Suffolk stayed behind with Salisbury, in garrison at Ypres. During Lent 1340 they attacked the French near Lille, pursued the enemy into the town, were made prisoners and were sent to Paris. Philip VI of France, it was said, wished to kill them, and they were spared only through the intervention of John of Bohemia. The truce of 25 September 1340 provided for the release of all prisoners, but it was only after a heavy ransom, to which Edward III contributed, that Suffolk was freed. He took part in a tournament at Dunstable in the spring of 1342 and at great jousts in London. He was one of the members of Edward's Round Table at Windsor, which assembled in February 1344, and fought in a tournament at Hertford in September 1344. he was one of the early members of Order of the Garter. Suffolk served through the English intervention in the Breton War of Succession during July 1342, and at the siege of Rennes. In July 1343 he was joint ambassador to Pope Clement VI at Avignon. On 8 May 1344 he was appointed captain and admiral of the northern fleet, and on 3 July accompanied Edward on a short expedition to Flanders. He continued admiral in person or deputy until March 1347, when he was succeeded by Sir John Howard. On 11 July 1346 Suffolk sailed with the king from Portsmouth on the invasion of France which resulted in the battle of Cr√©cy. On the retreat northwards, a day after the passage of the River Seine, Suffolk and Sir Hugh le Despenser defeated a French force. Suffolk was one of those who advised Edward to select the field of Cr√©cy as his battle-ground; in the English victory he fought in on the left wing. Next morning, 27 August, he took part in the Earl of Northampton's reconnaissance that resulted in a sharp fight with the unbroken remnant of the French army. Suffolk's diplomatic activity went on. He was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with France on 25 September 1348, and with Flanders on 11 October. The negotiations were conducted at Calais. On 10 March 1349, and again on 15 May 1350, he had similar commissions. On 29 August 1350 he fought in the naval victory, the Battle of Winchelsea. In May 1351 and in June 1352 he was chief commissioner of array in Norfolk and Suffolk. Poitiers campaign In September 1355 Suffolk sailed with The Black Prince, to Aquitaine. Between October and December he was on the prince's raid through Languedoc to Narbonne, where he commanded the rear-guard, William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, serving with him. After his return he was quartered at Saint-Emilion, his followers being stationed round Libourne. In January 1356 he led another foray, towards Rocamadour. Suffolk also shared in the Black Prince's northern foray of 1356, and in the battle of Poitiers which resulted from it, where he commanded, with Salisbury, the third \\"battle\\" or the rearward. The Prince's attempted retreat over the Miausson, threw the brunt of the first fighting on Suffolk and Salisbury. On the march back to Bordeaux he led the vanguard. Last years Now 58 years old, Suffolk took part in the expedition into the County of Champagne in 1359. After that he was employed only in embassies, the last of those on which he served being that commissioned on 8 February 1362 to negotiate the proposed marriage of Edmund of Langley to the daughter of the Count of Flanders. In his declining years Suffolk devoted himself to the removal of Leiston Abbey, near Saxmundham, to a new site somewhat further inland. In 1363 it was transferred to its new home, where some ruins remain. Suffolk died on 4 November 1369. By his will he requested burial beneath the arch between the chapel of St Nicholas and the high altar of the church of Campsey Priory, where his wife was also buried.(Abstract of wills of) 'Robert, Earl of Suffolk', and of 'William, Earl of Suffolk', in N.H.

It originally broadcast on February 4, 1975.  Plot overview In the OR Margaret is not performing up to par and is continuously chided by Hawkeye. Margaret admits that she is nervous about Colonel Reese, the most decorated nurse in the army, coming to the 4077th. Outside the OR, when Hawkeye, Trapper, Margaret, and Frank are washing up after the shift, Hawkeye again tells Margaret that she should keep her head in the game. Frank butts in and orders Hawkeye to \\"cease this harassing.\\" Trapper comes to Hawkeye's defense, and an argument erupts between the four of them. Margaret employs Frank to defend her honor, so he nonchalantly hits Hawkeye with a towel. Hawkeye pretends to wind up to return the hit with a towel slap of his own, only he punches Frank in the face. Frank threatens a court-martial. In Henry's office, the CO tries to convince Frank to drop the matter, but Frank persists. Then Radar explains that if Hawkeye is court-martialled, then he will be placed on house arrest. Hawkeye jumps at the opportunity for house arrest because it means he won't have to leave his tent, and instead can sleep and eat all day. Meanwhile, Colonel Reese arrives and Margaret greets her. Although tough, Colonel Reese isn't as uptight as Margaret, and even indicates that she doesn't have problems with a little doctor/nurse playtime with Hawkeye. Frank discovers that Reese will be bunking with Margaret and he despairs at the thought of not being alone with Margaret for the duration of Reese's stay. In Margaret's tent, Reese jovially questions Margaret on Frank and Margaret denies any \\"special relationship\\" between the two of them. Back in Henry's office, Trapper relates his version of the incident concerning Frank and Hawkeye, only he recalls the story as Frank slipping on a bar of soap and hitting his face on the corner of the sink. Klinger walks in, handing Radar a pair of pants that have been lengthened 3 inches. When questioned, Radar quickly answers that he's chafing and the extra length on his pants will help alleviate this ailment. In the Swamp, Hawkeye and Frank trade insulting banter as Hawkeye prepares for dinner by lying out a table cloth and polishing a martini glass. Trapper comes in bearing steak from the staff sergeant who was happy to hear that Hawkeye finally belted Frank. Frank leaves in disgust and Father Mulcahy comes in, bringing a \\"Prisoner Of War\\" package for Hawkeye. Father Mulcahy tells Hawkeye and Trapper that the next movie shown in camp will feature Gene Tierney, one of Hawkeye's favorite actresses, so the cooped up Captain asks Father Mulcahy if anything can be done so that Hawkeye can see the film. In Henry's office, Radar is on the phone trying to see what happened to the mail, which is 3-hours late. Apparently he is expecting a special package. After which Henry calls him a \\"good little fella\\" upon departure. Later that night, the Gene Tierney film (Leave Her to Heaven) is showing in the Swamp, so apparently Father Mulcahy pulled through. Frank arrives on the scene and is noticeably upset that his quarters is overrun with picture patrons. Back in Henry's office, we see what Radar has been waiting for: shoes that make him taller. Klinger, the ultimate high-heeled expert, helps Radar acquaint himself with the new footwear. Frank comes in, demanding to know where Henry is, and notices that there's something new about Radar. It's his glasses, he concludes. Frank heads to Margaret's tent looking for sympathy. Reese greets him and proceeds to comfort and flirt with him. Outside the swamp, Hawkeye steps out for a rest stop, with MPs in tow, and Radar crosses his path. Immediately, Hawkeye realizes that Radar is inexplicably taller, and after apologizing for picking on the corporal, Hawkeye gives Radar a confidence boost, and Radar decides that the shoes were a bad move. In Margaret's tent, Reese continues to try to put the moves on Frank, but he resists. Just when he begins to give in, Margaret enters and Reese immediately starts shouting, \\"Rape, rape!\\" Everyone in the camp rushes to the shouts and Reese accuses Frank of trying to pounce on her. Hawkeye refuses to share his house arrest with Frank, to which Margaret declares him innocent of punching Frank to begin with. Of course, Frank himself is placed on house arrest, only his stay isn't so cheery, and the episode ends with Hawkeye (whose record is clean again, with some help from Margaret) annoyingly reminding Frank that he can't leave the Swamp.

Work Majorana performed a long series of very sensitive gravity shielding experiments from 1918 to 1922, which have never been reproduced.

Other researchers have concluded from other data that if gravitational absorption does exist, it must be at least five orders of magnitude smaller than Majorana's experiments suggest. Critical of Albert Einstein's relativity theory, Majorana tried to disprove Einstein‚Äôs postulate on the constancy of the speed of light, but he failed, and therefore his experiments confirmed Einstein's postulate. Majorana also confirmed Isaac Newton‚Äôs law of universal gravitation to high precision.

As Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) for 15 years from 1984, he ensured that the airport had kept up with quality standards. He also introduced free local phone calls in the transit area and the famous '12-minute rule'. This means the first bag must be ready for retrieval 12 minutes after an aircraft grounds to a halt. And he also stressed that the different players - CAAS, immigration and customs authorities, airport retailers, eateries - must work together as a team for Changi to succeed.  Keppel Corporation  After Changi Airport, between 1984 and 1999, Sim also served as Chairmen of Keppel Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. While he initially intended to wind down Keppel as it was loss-making, he had a change of heart. Keppel renewed growth within 5 years. Sim continued the diversification of Keppel that was initiated by his predecessor George Edwin Bogaars into other fields like engineering, property, financial services as well as developing shipyards in other parts of the world.  Tanah Merah Country Club  As Sim and his wife Jeanette were avid golfers, Sim was also the founding chairman of Tanah Merah Country Club. Death In October 2007 his illness took a turn for the worse, and had to undergo chemotherapy. He died on 9 November 2007 at the Singapore General Hospital, after a 17-year battle with stomach cancer.

It was excavated in the late 1920s under the direction of Chester Stock. Unfortunately, Stock never published the fossil fauna from the excavations. Instead, R. P. Conkling, who had drawn scientific attention to the site, published very preliminary lists of mammals identified by Stock and birds identified by Howard. Several authors have done research on portions of the recovered fossil fauna. Excavated before modern dating techniques were developed, little is known about the chronology except some apparently is Holocene and much is Pleistocene in age. The site is located on the east side of Bishop's Cap, an outlier of the Organ Mountains. The entrance to the cavern is essentially vertical. The cave was described by Conkling as having been filled originally to 8 feet below the entrance. A vertical section of the cave is pictured in the Conkling paper from a photograph of an exhibit that had been displayed at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Conkling Cavern material was deposited at that museum. Some additional material has since been recovered from spoil from the original excavations and is housed in the Paleobiology Collection, UTEP Biodiversity Collections, Department of Biological Sciences, and Centennial Museum and Chihuahuan Desert Gardens, University of Texas at El Paso. The faunal list includes identifications from all known collections. Fragments of two humans were recovered, including parts of two skulls. One of these was at a depth of about 12 feet and the other at about 26 feet, about 26 inches beneath a layer of consolidated sandstone. The upper skull part was close to the ungual phalanges of a sloth. Gnawed human bones were found deeper in what was thought to be a dire wolf den. Names have been changed to the current nomenclature. Keep in mind that identifications are tentative and some may be Holocene rather than Pleistocene.

Dunkard Creek is a stream that flows U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed August 15, 2011 through Greene County, Pennsylvania and Monongalia County, West Virginia, near the towns of Mount Morris, Pennsylvania, and Blacksville, West Virginia. It flows into the Monongahela River northwest of Point Marion, Pennsylvania, approximately three miles north of the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. Mason-Dixon Historical Park is located on the banks of Dunkard Creek in an area where the creek crosses the border three times in less than one mile. The park grounds include Brown's Hill, the westernmost site from which Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon made astronomical observations during the original survey of the Pennsylvania‚ÄìMaryland border in 1767.Cope, Thomas D. \\"Degrees Along the West Line, the Parallel Between Maryland and Pennsylvania.\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 93 (May, 1949). p 129. The creek is named for members of the Dunkard Brethren, a pacifist, nonconformist group of Christians who settled in the region during the 18th century and practiced baptism by immersion. The Pennsylvania German word for \\"immerse\\" is dunke and people who immerse are called dunker. In September 2009, Dunkard Creek suffered a massive fish kill resulting in the death of more than 160 species of fish, salamanders and endangered mussels in the creek. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection determined that an algal bloom was responsible for the loss.http://www.wvpubcast.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=11415 The bloom is believed to have been possible as a result of high chloride and salt levels in the water. A Consol Energy mine discharge site on the creek is the likeliest source of contamination. The Shannopin Mine in the Bobtown area of Dunkard Township also discharges into Dunkard Creek. Since at least 2002, the West Virginia DEP had known about and been pressured by environmental groups to take action on high levels of chlorides and other contaminants in the Blacksville No. 2 outfall, but they took no action against Consol. In March 2011, Consol Energy reached an agreement with the US EPA and the State of West Virginia regarding damage done to Dunkard Creek caused by high levels of TDS in the discharge from their Blacksville No. 2 mine.http://blogs.wvgazette.com/coaltattoo/2011/03/14/consol-to- pay-5-5-million-in-dunkard-creek-deal As part of that settlement, Consol agreed to pay $5.5 million in civil penalties for pollution violations related to the 2009 fish kill. The settlement also describes requirements for Consol to complete a new, $200 million water treatment system to better control pollution discharges from its active and former mining operations in the area. In July 2015, Consol Energy reached a settlement with the PA Fish and Boat Commission, agreeing to pay $2.5 million for the damages to the Pennsylvania portion of Dunkard Creek. The commission plans to use this money to restore the fish population in the creek and support recreational fishing and boating projects. Mathews restoration site Dunkard Creek drains a rural watershed within nine townships in Greene County, Pennsylvania, and three districts in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The river is classified as a warm water fishery and historically supports a variety of fish, including smallmouth bass, sunfish, and muskellunge in all but the lower (from Taylortown to Poland Mines, Pennsylvania), which have been devastated by decades of unchecked acid mine drainage (AMD).http://www.epa.gov/reg3wapd/tmdl/pa_tmdl/DunkardCreek/DunkardCreekDR.pdf In 2007, thanks to the support of an EPA Targeted Watersheds Grant, the Greene County Watershed Alliance and the Friends of Dunkard Creek sought to reclaim part of the lower by creating a passive treatment system, or constructed wetlands, on the Mathews farm near Poland Mines. At this site, the abandoned Maiden #1 mine dumped over a million gallons of untreated AMD into Dunkard Creek each day. Working with Stream Restoration, Inc. and public/private partners from across the region, the Alliance created a passive treatment system consisting of: 1\\\\. An aerobic wetland (shallow water flowing over vegetation). Once established, an aerobic wetland produces large amounts of organic debris. The debris encourages anaerobic bacteria, which can revert sulfate ions into sulfide ions. Sulfide ions can then bind with heavy metal ions (such as iron) to remove them from the water. 2\\\\. Limestone ponds and channels. (Limestone, because of its high calcite content, reduces the acidity of AMD naturally.) When combined with man-made wetlands, it creates a self- renewing passive treatment system. In all, close to 12,000 tons of limestone were used at the Mathews Restoration Site. Volunteers started more than 2,000 plantings from 34 different species of plants, trees and shrubs. The combination of plantings and engineered flow ponds and channels is an example of how man and nature can work together to reclaim an area from AMD.http://orp.live.mediaspanonline.com/OR/Story/04_20_tree_planting 2007 observer-reporter.com article See also *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of rivers of West Virginia *Wadestown Covered Bridge References Rivers of Pennsylvania Rivers of West Virginia Tributaries of the Monongahela River Rivers of Greene County, Pennsylvania Rivers of Monongalia County, West Virginia ","title":"Dunkard Creek"},{"id":"16127018","text":"Mohamed Sakho (born 5 August 1988 in Conakry), is a Guinean footballer, who currently plays for the Moroccan side Olympique Safi.

A cemetery was established in 1866, and the wood frame building was replaced by a stone church in 1861. The church was designated a historic property by the Town of Milton in 2004. Haltonville was settled in 1845 when George Black built a home and shoemaker shop. In 1846, a general store and blacksmith shop were built, and in 1850, the Bee Hive Hotel was built. The first doctor settled in Haltonville in 1852, and in 1859 a second hotel was built. The early settlement also had an apiary, creamery, and money order and savings bank office.

Sixteen Mile Creek flows through the settlement, and the present-day Scotch Block Dam and Reservoir is located there. Scotch Block is located on the Niagara Escarpment, and a portion of the Bruce Trail passes through it. History =Original settlers= James and John Stewart, early settlers from Perth, Scotland, made a request to the government in 1819 for a Scottish settlement in Esquesing Township. That same year, James McNab, a land promoter living in Toronto Township, petitioned to bring 30 families of Scottish origin to Ontario from the economically depressed towns of Barnet and Ryegate in the US state of Vermont. Both towns had been founded by a group-migration from Scotland in the late 1700s, and many then migrated to the Scotch Block area. Other Scotch Block settlers arrived directly from Scotland, the majority from the Perthshire and Roxburghshire regions. Another Scottish family, the Laidlaws, moved first to York in Upper Canada, and then to Scotch Block. The settlement was at first referred to as \\"The Scotch Settlement\\" and \\"The Settlement\\", but eventually became known as \\"The Scotch Block\\". It was the most ethnically homogeneous region in the county, its first settlers \\"Scotch almost without exception\\". An early settler, James Laidlaw, described The Scotch Block in a letter to his son, Robert, in Scotland in 1819: > We are mostly all Scotchmen and have got a township to be all together, or > what is called a parish in Scotland.

In 1824, a meeting house (church), school and cemetery were built in the southeast portion of Scotch Block. The Stewarts' request for the establishment of Scotch Block in 1819 had described that the settlement would \\"support a regular bred Clergyman of their Persuasion and who understand their language\\". When it proved difficult to attract a permanent church minister, the Scotch Block residents petitioned the government for assistance, writing [sic]: > Their Sabbaths are silent, and in danger of being forgotton - The sound of > the gospel very seldom reaches their ears - But, in a land of Strangers, > they are wandering like shiip, without a Sheephard, and their rising > generation are in danger of sinking into a state of barborous ignorance. A permanent minister settled in Scotch Block in 1832. The meeting house was renamed Boston Presbyterian Church in 1844, in honour of Thomas Boston, a Scottish church leader. The area near the church eventually became a distinct community known as Boston. That same year, Peter Scott built the first brick house in Scotch Block. =Other events= The first doctor was Christopher Russell, who settled in Scotch Block in 1833 and married John Stewart's daughter. They remained there until 1841. Mail delivery on horseback began in 1836, and occurred twice weekly. In 1837, John Stewart participated in the Upper Canada Rebellion and was sentenced to transportation.As provided under Initially confined to prison at Fort Henry, Ontario, he escaped and fled to the United States, and was later pardoned.

New Zealand  New Zealand's countrywide meshblock framework was first set up in 1976, although the term dates back to at least the 1916 census. The meshblock pattern is updated each year. It comprised 41,376 meshblocks at the 2006 census, increasing to 46,637 meshblocks in 2013, and to 53,589 in 2018. Meshblocks are defined by Statistics New Zealand as being \\"the smallest geographic unit for which statistical data is collected and processed by Statistics New Zealand\\". It is a defined area, varying in size from part of a city block to large areas of rural land. Each of these borders another to form a network covering the whole country including inlets and coasts, and extending out to the economic zone. Meshblocks are added together to \\"build up\\" larger geographic areas such as area units and urban areas. They are also used to draw up and define New Zealand electorates and local authority boundaries.  Australia  In Australia mesh blocks were developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from 2006, and released in February 2008, although they were not fully implemented until 2011.

He was born in Vienna in 1904 and received his Ph.D. there in 1927. In the late 1920s he emigrated to the United States. In 1935 he founded the Saxl Instrument Company, which designed and manufactured tension meters for use in the textile industry, and later in other industries. The company, which Saxl ran jointly with his wife, Lucretia Hildreth Saxl, from their home in Harvard, Massachusetts, was renamed Tensitron in 1953. Saxl is reported as having stated that he worked under Albert Einstein.Maccabee, 1996.Sopka, 1979. He died in 1981. Saxl is most well known for a series of controversial experiments in which he measured unexpected changes in the period of a torsion pendulum under various conditions. In one series of experiments, the period of a torsion pendulum situated inside a Faraday cage, with the pendulum and the cage connected by a conducting path, was observed to increase as the voltage on the cage was increased. In another experiment, the period of the pendulum was seen to increase during an eclipse. Saxl is reported to have attempted, without success, to get this work published in the Physical Review; eventually the work was published in Nature.Saxl, 1964. In the early 1960s, Saxl began a collaboration with Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College. In 1971, Saxl and Allen published a report of anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that ‚Äúgravitational theory needs to be modified‚Äù.Saxl and Allen, 1971.Schilling, 2004 In addition, they observed unexplained diurnal variation in the period of the pendulum.Duif and Water, 1996 None of the effects observed by Saxl and Allen have obvious explanations in terms of well-established theories of gravity and electromagnetism. Although more subtle explanations, still using conventional physical theory, have been profferedVan Flandern and Yang, 2003 there does not appear to be general agreement as to the cause of the anomalies. Saxl and Allen's claim that general relativity must be modified, and earlier claims of a similar nature by Allais based on observations of anomalies in the behaviour of a paraconical pendulum, have not won acceptance by the physics community, and recent attempts to reproduce the phenomena have not been successful.

Biography =Early life and education= Mildred Allen was born in Sharon, Massachusetts to MIT professor C. Frank Allen and Caroline Hadley Allen. She had one younger sister, Margaret Allen Anderson. Allen graduated from Vassar College in 1916 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. She completed her doctoral studies in physics in 1922 at Clark University with Arthur Gordon Webster, with thesis research done at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. =Career= During the 1920s and early 1930s, Allen taught at Mount Holyoke, Wellesley and Oberlin Colleges and undertook post-doctoral work at the University of Chicago and at Yale University. She began working with William Francis Gray Swann at Yale and continued work under his direction with the Bartol Research Foundation between 1927 and 1930. She also did research at Harvard University before becoming a professor at Mount Holyoke, where she taught until her retirement in 1959. For nearly 20 years, starting in the early 1960s, Allen collaborated with Erwin Saxl, an industrial physicist living in Harvard, Massachusetts, on experiments with a torsion pendulum. Allen and Saxl reported anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that ‚Äúgravitational theory needs to be modified‚Äù. Their measurements, and similar anomalies earlier observed by Allais using a paraconical pendulum, have not been accepted by the physics community as in need of unconventional explanation, and subsequent experiments have not succeeded in reproducing the results.
