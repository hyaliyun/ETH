History Lava rock is a regional term for structures built using basalt. Building with lava rock in Jerome and Lincoln Counties of South Central Idaho was done by skilled immigrant stone masons from the 1880s until about the 1940s when the last large scale structures were built under the Works Progress Administration. Built in 1917 and 1918 for Arnold Stevens a farmer the house is significant historically for its architecture and craftsmanship.

It is located in Vaujany of Is√®re within the French Alps. The primary purpose of the dam is to serve as the upper reservoir for a pumped- storage hydroelectric scheme where Lac du Verney located lower in the valley is the lower reservoir. The dam was constructed between 1978 and 1985 with its power station being commissioned in 1987. With an installed capacity of 1,800 MW, it is the largest hydroelectric power station in France. Design and operation The Grand'Maison is an embankment dam with a height of from the riverbed and from foundation. It is long and has a fill volume of . The reservoir withheld by the dam, Lac de Grand Maison, has a storage capacity of . The power generation process begins with water stored in its reservoir at an altitude of . By means of a long head-race tunnel which splits into three long penstocks, water is sent down to the power station. It is located on the rear bank of Lac du Verney at which lies at an elevation of . The power station has above-ground and below-ground levels. On the above-ground level, there are four 150 MW Pelton turbine-generators which are used for normal conventional hydroelectric power generation. The below-ground level contains eight 150 MW Francis pump turbines which can be used for both power generation and pumping. After electricity is generated, the water is discharged into Lac du Verney, the lower reservoir. When storage in Grand'Maison needs to be replenished, the turbines reverse into pumps and move water from Lac du Verney back to the Grand'Maison Reservoir. The change in elevation between the reservoirs afford the above-ground station a maximum hydraulic head of and the below-ground station . The power station repeats the pumped-storage process as needed and acts as a peaking power plant. Power generation or pumping can be initiated within minutes. On an annual basis, the power station generates 1,420 GWh of electricity and consumes 1,720 GWh in pumping mode. Because pumping occurs during periods of low demand when electricity is cheaper than power generation during those of high demand, the power station is profitable.

In 1967 his expertise was cited in a case of counterfeit medals being sold in militaria shops in Sydney. It was claimed that he possessed the world's largest collection of military medals awarded to Australians.\\"Medals made him cross\\" Sydney Morning Herald, 10 July 1967 In the 1970s Clark was working at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra as one of the unofficial army historians connected with the museum due to his knowledge of military history and also due to his connections with military museums overseas. Certain militaria from these museums were found to be missing or replaced by copies, and Clarks was believed to be the only person who had accessed them during his visits. During this time, the medals of the Australian war hero Harold Edward Elliott, were discovered to be missing from the Australian War Memorial. These were never recovered. In April 1974, Clark was arrested by Australian Commonwealth Police in Canberra on a warrant for extradition to Britain. The extradition warrant said that Clark was accused of \\"conspiracy to steal, stealing, receiving stolen goods and bribery in the United Kingdom\\". The charges involved more than A$12,000 in goods.\\"Extradition of army man sought\\", The Age, 1 May 1974 The application for extradition was dismissed in May 1974 due to lack of evidence. Following an investigation in the disappearance of rare military relics and medals from collections and museums around the world, in 1978 Australian Commonwealth Police discovered duplicate military medals in Sydney and also recovered the original tunics of Sir John Monash and Sir Thomas Blamey, stolen from the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Clark was implicated in their theft and was believed to have duplicated medals after borrowing them from collectors. He was suspected of keeping the originals and returning copies to the unsuspecting collectors. Clark was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at his home in the Canberra suburb of Page, while still being under investigation.

It is located in the heart of the Mhadei river watershed. It was built and occupied by Shivaji Maharaj in the mid 17th century during his conquest of South India to defend from the Portuguese colonial troops who controlled Goa at that time. Location The fort sits on top of a rock outcropping at the crest of the escarpment overlooking the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and rising near vertically above the plains to the west. The defenses were almost entirely natural, requiring little additional construction. History Near the end of 1676, Chattrapati Shivaji besieged Belgaum and Vayem Rayim in current day northern Karnataka. From here he launched a wave of conquests in southern India with a massive force of 30,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. Bhimgad was one of the forts that Chattrapati Shivaji still held when he died in 1680. In 1719, the fort was included with the 16 districts given to a grandson of Shivaji Maharaj, Chattrapati Shahu, at the beginning of his own rule. About 1787, the fort was overtaken by the Nesagari chief but it was soon retaken. In 1820 it was observed by the British and in 1844 it was occupied by them to guard against insurgents who threatened Belgaum. Description There is one narrow stone-cut trail leading up to the fort. The ruins are long from north to south and broad from east to west. The fort has only one gateway and the walls are still mostly intact. The inside is overgrown with brush and there is one fresh-water spring on the west side and a small reservoir in the north, both of which are dry in the two hottest months of the year. The fort had an eight-pound gun and a three-pound gun plus a wall musket. Bhimgad was one of the forts that Shivaji maharaj still held when he died in 1680.

Origin of the term The term was first used notably in David M. Kreps' Notes on the Theory of Choice (1988). Kreps, in his preface, acknowledges Mike Harrison for first using the acronym Totrep. In his work on the theory of choice, Michael Allingham characterizes the notion \\"denoted by TOTREP\\" as something \\"both to admire and worry about\\".Allingham, Michael. Rational Choice, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 5 September 1999 Studies of the concept of the Trade-off Talking Rational Economic Person are now routinely conducted in the related fields of theory of choice, the mathematics of decision making,E.g.\\"The Logic of Preferences\\", assignment in Harvard University, Spring 2000 etc. Attributes Totrep denotes an agent of economic decisions with strict preferences. The setting of the preference relations presumes\\"Theory of Choice\\", University of Florida that * One, single person, i.e. Totrep, is making choices; * A set of finite choices of possible outcomes is proposed, each associated with a defined or undefined probability of happening; the sum of probabilities equals 1; * Totrep's preferences are defined axiomatically among the choices proposed; * The representation of Totrep's preferences is stated through a utility function, which is typically a function from Totrep's set of choice to real numbers; * The axioms defining Totrep's preferences must be both sufficient (if axioms hold, then representation is possible) and necessary (if representation holds, then axioms must hold); and finally * The axioms are consistent (axioms can be satisfied simultaneously), independent (no subset of axioms implies the others, i.e. there is no overlap), and intuitive (easy to understand). Ethical considerations In attempts to legitimatize economic theory as ethical, the question was asked about how to \\"teach or preach to economists or ethicists how to become more ethical\\".\\"Ethics and efficiency in organizations\\" by Kjell Hausken, Journal of Social Economics, 1 September 1996 In this, social scientist Kjell Hausken posits the notion that, \\"if acting virtuously contributes to a character or personality which subsequently and indirectly influences economic [agent]'s reputation beneficially in the long run, then this action is to be recommended if the long-term benefit of the beneficial reputation outweighs the short-term benefit of a more deceitful or vicious action.\\" Hausken observes that, the \\"ethical economic [agent]\\" is actually \\"a trade-off talking rational economic person\\", who constantly carries out \\"a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis where reputation is a relevant input, constantly focusing on her real interests in a broad sense, and constantly thinking long term.\\" Empirical objections Empirical research, from the 1970s onwards (research that eventually established the field of behavioral economics), showed that the Totrep model of rationality cannot be safely considered as representative of real-life human affairs. Kreps himself initially describes the models of choice presented in his book as both normative and descriptive but, in the final chapter of his book, where he briefly outlines the paradoxes of Allais (1953) and Ellsberg (1961), ultimately acknowledges that Totrep modelling should be presumed to be merely normative, since the \\"evidence [shows] individuals are very poor intuitive statisticians\\" and \\"use heuristic procedures which sometimes bias their choices in ways that the standard models don't capture.\\" See also References Further reading * Category:New classical macroeconomics Category:Choice modelling Category:Rational choice theory Category:Utility ","title":"Trade-off talking rational economic person"},{"id":"34375405","text":"Rising Star High School is a public high school located in Rising Star, Texas (USA) and classified as a 1A school by the UIL.

He was born in Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand in 1896. James Basil Wilkie Roberton was born in Auckland on 30 January 1896, the second of four children of Eliza Ann Wilkie and her husband, Ernest Roberton, a prominent medical practitioner. Educated at King‚Äôs College, Auckland, Jim excelled not only academically, but also in rugby and athletics. After leaving school he went on to the University of Cambridge in England in 1913 to study medicine. On the outbreak of the First World War, however, Roberton joined the King Edward‚Äôs Horse and, once commissioned, the 11th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, serving as a signal officer in France from August 1915, and in Italy. In 1918, as a lieutenant, he was made a DSO for leading his men through barbed wire to secure Treviso bridge north of Venice. During his service overseas he was twice wounded by shrapnel and had a brush with death when a bullet sliced through his pack, plate and mug. After the war Jim Roberton returned to his studies, graduating MB, ChB from Cambridge University in 1925. He later gained his FRCS and FRCP. On 27 April 1928 he married Gladys Muriel Christmas at Worthing, Sussex. They emigrated to New Zealand, where Jim gained a position at King George V Hospital in Rotorua. In 1929 he took up private practice in Te Awamutu. Gladys died on 29 August that year. On 9 February 1932 he married Marion Valetta Allwood in Morrinsville. They had five children: three girls and two boys. During the 1930s Roberton became well known within the Te Awamutu community. He served on the executive of the RSA, was involved in the town‚Äôs athletic and cycling clubs, was president of the Te Awamutu Golf Club and the beautifying society, and was a member of the town library committee. During the Second World War he served with the New Zealand Medical Corps at Guadalcanal and New Caledonia. In January 1941 he was appointed to the temporary rank of captain, and in October 1943 to the temporary rank of major. After his discharge the following year he returned to his practice in Te Awamutu. In 1949 Jim Roberton shifted with his family to the coastal settlement of Kawhia. He saw this move as an essential step in furthering his study into Tainui history ‚Äì an interest ignited through his involvement with the Te Awamutu Historical Society since 1936. From the mid-1940s he had researched Maori whakapapa, obtaining information from fellow society member Raureti Te Huia, and in 1949 he produced The tribes of Te Awamutu district. However, he did most of his work at Kawhia, and after years of meticulous research published a booklet in 1965 entitled Maori settlement of the Waikato district. This was revised in 1982 and was widely used by students. He wrote numerous articles on such topics as genealogies as a basis for Maori chronology, and the evaluation of Maori tradition as history, and argued that tribal traditions should be compared and analysed for their validity as historical evidence. He was the editor of the Journal of the Te Awamutu Historical Society from 1966 to 1975. As the doctor for the Kawhia district, Roberton often visited patients in remote areas. After practising medicine there for 20 years he retired and moved back to Te Awamutu. Retirement did not slow him down, though, and he continued with his research, which he typed up himself. In 1973 he completed a family history that traced his roots back to the twelfth century. After the death of his wife on 12 August 1974 Roberton lived alone, cooking and caring for himself and mowing his own lawns. A resourceful man, he designed and made his own hearing aid when his hearing began to fail. His final book, Kakepuku, was published in 1987. A foundation member of the Rotary Club of Te Awamutu, he was made a Paul Harris fellow in 1988 and the club‚Äôs first life member in 1993. He enjoyed the Anzac Day parades and would not miss one, even marching at the age of 99. He saw them as a way to catch up with his comrades and to be ‚Äòjust one of the boys‚Äô. Jim Roberton died 26 days short of his 100th birthday on 4 January 1996 in Te Awamutu. A slightly built man with a no-nonsense look, he was respected by Maori and Pakeha alike for his encyclopaedic knowledge of the pre-European history of the Tainui people and his wide community involvement. Although firm in his opinions, he was modest about his accomplishments and once said of his life, ‚ÄòI enjoyed it, but who is interested, I did not do much‚Äô. References 2\\\\. Carol Stevenson.

On 12 March 1872 in a ceremony at Cambridge, Roberts married Jessie , who was his cousin. Her father, Robert's uncle by marriage, was an officer in the New Zealand militia. After seeing considerable action across the North Island in the New Zealand wars, Roberts was appointed commander of the new New Zealand Permanent Militia in February 1887. After retiring as a soldier in 1888, he was a magistrate in Masterton and Tauranga and two Royal Commissions. Roberts died on 11 October 1928 in Rotorua at the age of 88. Buried in the Tauranga cemetery, he was survived by two sons and two daughters. His wife had predeceased him several years previously.

Born in Australia, Robin's family moved to New Zealand in 1861. A coachbuilder by trade, he was active in the local militia, before becoming a professional soldier in 1899. Commander of the First New Zealand contingent that fought in South Africa during the Second Boer War, Robin later served as General Officer Commanding New Zealand Military Forces from 1914 to 1919. For his service during the First World War he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to receive the French Legion of Honour decoration during the war. Early life Alfred William Robin was born on 12 August 1860 in Riddells Creek, Victoria, in Australia, to a baker and his wife. His family immigrated to New Zealand sometime in 1861 and settled in Dunedin, in the South Island, where his father set up a coach building business. In 1873, after completing a year of high school, Robin started working for his father and eventually became a partner in the business.O'Shea, 1996, pp. 437‚Äì438 Military career Robin had a keen interest in the military; while at school he participated in the cadet program and in 1878 joined the New Zealand Regiment of Volunteer Artillery. He later served with the Southland Hussars and the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers, and rose to the rank of sergeant major. In 1886, the Dunedin Cavalry Volunteers became the Otago Hussars and three years later he was commissioned as a lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in 1891 and took over command of his unit. He was a highly regarded officer and his unit was one of the most efficient in the Volunteer Corps. In 1897, he was selected to lead the New Zealand contingent to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. His last command in the Volunteer Corps was as a commander of a newly formed mounted rifle battalion. In 1899, Robin joined the New Zealand Permanent Forces as a professional soldier. He had resigned his partnership in the family business the previous year. His first posting was as an instructor to the South Island mounted rifle units and he established a tactical training school for officers. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he led the first contingent of New Zealand volunteers, which numbered 215 men and their horses, to South Africa in November 1899. Further contingents would follow. While there he commanded the 1st New Zealand Regiment, which was a combined formation of the first three contingents from New Zealand.McGibbon, 2000, pp. 59‚Äì61 Well regarded by the British officers that he served under in South Africa, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and mentioned in dispatches three times and on his return to New Zealand in May 1901 he became a national celebrity.McGibbon, 2000, p. 452 Robin was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the Otago Military District and in 1906 he became Chief of General Staff of the New Zealand Permanent Forces (soon to be reorganised as the New Zealand Military Forces) and a member of the newly formed Council of Defence. The council recognised the need to implement compulsory military training to improve the state of New Zealand's armed forces and Robin worked to achieve this. In 1910, following the dissolution of the Council of Defence, Robin became Adjutant and Quarter- master General. In this role he worked under Major General Alexander Godley, newly appointed as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. In 1912 he served overseas as New Zealand's representative in the War Office in London on the Imperial General Staff. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year. First World War Returning to New Zealand in 1913, Robin resumed duties as Quarter-master General. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he played a key role in preparing the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. An offer to serve overseas was rebuffed as the New Zealand Government felt he was better employed on the home front. While Godley commanded the NZEF in the Middle East and France, Robin took over his duties as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. He worked to ensure that the NZEF were well maintained with reinforcements and supplies, and his work in this regard was recognised by Godley who recommended that Robin be appropriately rewarded. Promoted to brigadier general in 1915, the following year he was promoted to major general and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. His service as commandant ended in late 1919. In recognition of his wartime service, Robin was appointed a Chevalier of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur by the French President in March 1922. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Robin was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war. Later life Robin served as the acting administrator of Western Samoa from 1920 to 1921, retiring from the military in January 1921. In his retirement he supported a number of charitable organisations including the Boy Scouts' Association and the St John Ambulance Brigade; shortly before his death he was made a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John. A memorial shield named for Robin is awarded each year to the winning cadet team at the annual New Zealand St John Youth competition. He was president of First New Zealand Mounted Rifles' Association and was also involved with the South African War Veterans' Association of New Zealand. He died in Wellington in June 1935. Having never married, he had no children. He declined a military funeral and is buried in Wellington's Karori Cemetery.

The movement's slogan \\"Home of the global revolution in Ottawa\\" refers to its inspiration by, and association with, the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and the global Occupy Movement, which protests growing economic inequality, corporate greed, and the influence of corporations and lobbyists on electoral politics and government. Occupy Ottawa seeks global economic, social, political and environmental justice. As of June 2012, Occupy Ottawa had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Global Day of Action On October 15, 2011, the Global Day of Action, over 700 demonstrators gathered around \\"Freedom Fountain\\" in Confederation Park for the movement's launch for its inaugural General Assembly. Founding facilitators Ben Powless (Mohawk, Six Nations, Ontario) and Brigette \\"the Rogue Page\\" Depape discussed the Occupy Movement's trademark consensus-based democratic processes of deciding and debating issues and protest actions. They discussed the Occupy movement's overriding commitment to participatory democracy, direct democracy, \\"majority consensus\\", and stressed the importance of a peaceful demonstration. They also voted to occupy Confederation Park indefinitely. Prominent Canadian public figures among the crowd that day include Green Party leader and Federal MP, Elizabeth May and activist Brigette DePape, a former Canadian Senate Page Program, who famously held up a \\"Stop Harper!\\" protest sign during the throne speech of the Government of Canada in the Senate in the summer of 2011. Encampment Immediately after the General Assembly, activists set up tents on the northeast corner of the park at the intersection of Laurier Avenue and Elgin Street. Within two weeks, the movement's \\"tent city\\" comprised more than 60 tents and tarp-covered shelters, including a kitchen, donations tent and media tent. Somewhere between 75 and 100 people consistently slept in the park. The kitchen, sustained through generous in-kind and cash donations from the public, served activists, visitors and the city's homeless. Protest actions An Occupy Ottawa gathering Occupy Ottawa or its allies in the capital region organized a series of high-impact public actions. For the most part the movement focused on the issues at the heart of the Occupy movement. However, Occupy Ottawa also undertook actions targeting the national legislative agenda. In fact, some of the actions raised the question whether the movement intends to eventually become political. For example, during its December 3 General Assembly, the movement approved the creation of a \\"Political Action Committee\\". The committee's mandate was to create a \\"political mandate\\", and spearhead political actions, for the movement. Second global day of action On November 17, Occupy Ottawa activists held simultaneous marches on four key and politically charged Ottawa landmarks. One group marched on the Human Rights Monument to highlight the movement's unequivocal commitment to human rights. The second marched on Sparks Street Mall, Ottawa's corporate and media hub. The group sought to restate the Occupy movement's expressed stance against unfettered corporate greed, growing economic inequality and the perceived mainstream media collusion with the dominant political and economic forces. The third group targeted two landmarks. First, it marched on the city's Novotel Hotel to protest the hotel's efforts to squash workers' rights too unionize. From there, the group marched through the Rideau Centre, the Byward Market. It finally converged on the United States Embassy on Sussex Drive to express solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, and protest the eviction and police brutality the movement faced at the time. Later, the three groups later converged on Parliament Hill. Omnibus crime bill C-10 On Saturday, November 26, an estimated 300 activists turned up to peacefully protest the controversial Conservative government's bill, which was currently under debate in the House of Commons. The protest was organized under the aegis of the \\"Occupy Ottawa Coalition to End Crime Bill C-10\\". The nine speakers of the day included Angus Toulouse, the regional Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Fran√ßoise Boivin, an MP from the New Democratic Party (NDP), Landon Pearson, a former Senator, and representatives of the John Howard Society of Canada, Odawa Native Friendship Centre and Muslims for Progressive Values. Solidarity actions As the crackdown on Occupy camps across Canada intensified, Occupy Ottawa seemed to expand its focus and reach. Solidarity visit to Occupy Kingston Tuesday, December 6, 2011, was a crucial day for Occupy Kingston. It was the day the Kingston City Council voted to evict the occupiers, who had been encamped in Confederation Park since October 15. Occupy Ottawa activists visited their fellow occupiers and were present in the council chambers when the council voted 7-6 against Occupy Kingston. Solidarity with Syria and Egypt On Thursday, December 8, Occupy Ottawa activists participate in a march in support of the struggle for democracy and political change in Syria and Egypt. Perth visit On Sunday, December 11, Occupy Ottawa speakers visited Perth, 83 km outside Ottawa to share their collective and personal experiences with the locals. Over 100 people packed a local pub, O'Reilly's, to hear the speakers. Following the visit, a new Occupy movement, Occupy Lanark County, emerged. Controversies Occupy Ottawa was initially met by a positive public-perception. Some citizens turned against the movement after issues were raised concerning hygiene, environmental impacts on the city park, drug use, and claims and complaints of rape and assault. The RCMP investigated Occupy Ottawa during the planning phases of the protest. Public response Occupy Ottawa's occupation of Confederation Park was largely peaceful with a commitment to nonviolence throughout numerous protest actions. Eviction and defiance After weeks of uncertainty, Occupy Ottawa's fate on Confederation Park was decided on the morning of November 21, 2011. The National Capital Commission (NCC), the Canadian Crown Corporation responsible for the park, served the movement with the notice of eviction. More than 300 people gathered for the movement's 6.30pm General Assembly, which unanimously voted to peacefully resist the eviction. In a statement, the movement said: > We began this movement because we want positive change and we know that the > old ways of political participation aren't working. These officials are > doing the bidding of the 1%. They don't want to listen or engage in dialogue > with us because they know we are already changing the conversation in this > city, in this country and globally. We will offer dignified and principled > resistance to those who try to force us out of public space. Eight protesters vowed to stay on the park and make a last, peaceful, stand. The rest vowed to stick around and support them. The deadline came and passed without any action from the authorities. Still, up to 100 protesters remained on the park throughout most of the night and waited. However, by the end of the next day, signs of fatigue began to appear. The numbers dwindled. Some of the protesters suggested that the authorities were playing mind games and sought to wear the protesters out. There is some truth to the allegation. By evening, the numbers had dwindled to less than 30. On the morning of Wednesday, November 23, 2011, around 2.00am, an estimated 150 officers from the Ottawa Police moved into the park and arrested the defiant protesters. While five of the protesters complied with the police order to willingly leave the park, three made another last stand and chained themselves together in a tent inside the fountain. The police dragged them out of the park. One of the protesters ended up in hospital. All were served $65 trespass tickets and released. After eviction Before the eviction, there had been predictions that the harsh Canadian winter would drive Occupy Ottawa out of Confederation Park. But, after losing the park, and the generous media coverage that came with it, Occupy Ottawa seems to have gained new strength. The numbers have dwindled but the movement still holds two to three General Assemblies a week. New committees, working groups or initiatives emerged in December 2011 and January 2012, including a Political Action Committee and \\"InterOccupy\\" and \\"Threads of Occupation\\" working groups. The committees and working groups meet regularly during the week and constantly engage in direct actions. Assisting these efforts is a robust media apparatus that includes a communally edited website that features a Community News page, Forums, Facebook Page, Facebook Groups, Twitter Profile and YouTube account. On March 1, 2012, Occupy Ottawa launched a blog that summarizes the movement's monthly news and events. Approximately a year after the initial occupation, the group changed its name to Occupied Ottawa.

Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. Accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986. It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular manuscript of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).Norton, Jonathan D. H., Contours in the Text (T&T; Clark International, 2011), p. 4. Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a translation is called the Vorlage of that translation.Freedman & Kuhlken, What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter? (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10. For example, the Luther Bible is a translation of the Textus Receptus, so the Textus Receptus is the Vorlage of the Luther Bible. Sometimes the Vorlage of a translation may be lost to history. In some of these cases the Vorlage may be reconstructed from the translation. Such a reconstructed Vorlage may be called a retroversion, and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the Vorlage may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of textual criticism. This reconstructed Vorlage may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses. Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed Vorlage of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible at parts to correct the Hebrew Masoretic version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.Albrektson, B., \\"Masoretic or Mixed\\" in Text, Translation, Theology (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125. Or, as another example, the Coptic fragments of Plato's Republic included among the Nag Hammadi library are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.Slings, S. R., Platonis Rempublicam (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii. For the bulk of the Gospel of Thomas, the Vorlage exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.Plisch, Uwe-Karsten Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar.

It forms part of the Cambrian Mountains massif, and is north-west of the Black Mountain (range) in the Brecon Beacons. It takes the form of an undulating plateau with steep slopes dropping away to the Towy valley to the east and those of the Gwenffrwd, Nant Melyn and Afon Cothi to the north and west. Its highest point of 1516 feet or 462m at OS grid reference SN 723455 is surmounted by two Bronze Age cairns known as Crugiau Merched (which translates from Welsh as ladies' barrows). Caeo Forest covers much of the southern flanks of the hill and smaller forests also cover its eastern slopes. Much of the native woodland consists of sessile oak groves, especially on the valley sides.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheet 187 Llandovery/Llanymddyfri The human population is very low, being restricted to hill farms engaged in sheep farming, and some holiday cottages. Geology The geology of Mynydd Mallaen is complex, comprising mudstones of the Claerwen Group together with sandstones of the Doethie and Glanyrafon Formations and the Caerau Mudstones Formation. Each of these Silurian rock formations is folded and faulted. Indeed it is an outcrop of conglomerate turbidite rock on the western limb of the Cothi Anticline which forms the summit of the hill. Glacial till and boulder clay from the last ice age occupies some of the hollows on the plateau, and there are many stones and boulders of white quartz scattered across the plateau, perhaps the remains of mineral veins eroded away. British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet (E&W; series) 195 Lampeter Archaeology In addition to several round barrows, there are many standing stones on the plateau, two being very near to Cregiau Merched; one is named as Maen Bach. Gold mining occurs on the south-eastern flank of the plateau, and was pioneered in the Roman period as soon as the area had been conquered ca 75 AD. The remains are visible at Dolaucothi and traces of the Roman aqueducts can be seen on the neighbouring parts of the mountain. They tap both the River Cothi and Afon Twrch, Carmarthenshire. The earlier earthen aqueduct shows several channels above the minehead, and tapped local springs. The channels led to water tanks above a single opencast near to Pumpsaint on the south western flank of the plateau. A larger one tapped the Twrch higher up the valley. The Cothi aqueduct tapped the larger river about 7 miles upstream, and fed a large reservoir at the minehead. Such tanks were used in hushing, a method of removing surface debris to find gold veins in the bedrock. They were also used for washing gold- bearing sand or other deposits, a form of placer mining or hydraulic mining, as well washing crushed ore on special gold washing tables. From dating evidence at Melin-y-Milwyr, a small reservoir above the minehead and the large Roman fort under Pumpsaint village, mining tailed off after 150 AD although some presence continued till circa 350 AD. There was also a very large lead mine nearby to the north of the plateau at Rhandirmwyn which was one of the largest in the world in the 1750s. There is also some evidence of earlier mining on a smaller scale at the head of the mine, at the outcrop of Pencerrig mwyn which may also be of Roman origin. Wildlife Red kite in flight in Gredos Mountains, Avila, Spain Common Buzzard in flight, Devon, England. There are around 40,000 breeding pairs in the United Kingdom There are numerous bird species present in the area, including large birds of preys like the red kite, common buzzard, raven, kestrel and carrion crow, as well as songbirds such as the skylark, among many others. The red kite retreated to this area after intense persecution by gamekeepers in the rest of the country. There are foxes and badgers especially in the woods and forests, and the local rivers are well stocked with salmon, trout and sewin. There is a wide distribution of mammals such as field voles and rabbits as well as many songbirds. The skylark is plentiful due to the extensive rough pasture present below the main peaks which allows ground nesting of the species. Pied wagtails are common near the streams and torrents running from the hill tops. The numerous sessile oak groves along the sheltered hillsides host the common bluebell in the spring, as well as offering sanctuary to wildlife. Access The entire hill is mapped as open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 so is freely available to those on foot. Additionally there is a bridleway which crosses the hill in an east-west direction and a further one approaching from the south. Large parts of the plateau is peat bog and wet underfoot, so care is needed in walking the top in the absence of clear footpaths. Apart from the two standing stones and large cairns, there are few obvious landmarks.

Two nuclides that have the same mass number (isobars) can both be stable only if their atomic numbers differ by more than one. In fact, for currently observationally stable nuclides, the difference can only be 2 or 4, and in theory, two nuclides that have the same mass number cannot be both stable (at least to beta decay or double beta decay), but many such nuclides which are theoretically unstable to double beta decay have not been observed to decay, e.g. 134Xe. However, this rule cannot make predictions on the half-lives of these radioisotopes. Technetium and promethium A consequence of this rule is that technetium and promethium both have no stable isotopes, as each of the neighboring elements on the periodic table (molybdenum and ruthenium, and neodymium and samarium, respectively) have a beta-stable isotope for each mass number for the range in which the isotopes of the unstable elements usually would be stable to beta decay. (Note that although 147Sm is unstable, it is stable to beta decay; thus 147 is not a counterexample). These ranges can be calculated using the liquid drop model (for example the stability of technetium isotopes), in which the isobar with the lowest mass excess or greatest binding energy is shown to be stable to beta decay because energy conservation forbids a spontaneous transition to a less stable state. Thus no stable nuclides have proton number 43 or 61, and by the same reasoning no stable nuclides have neutron number 19, 21, 35, 39, 45, 61, 71, 89, 115, or 123. Exceptions The only known exceptions to the Mattauch isobar rule are the cases of antimony-123 and tellurium-123 and of hafnium-180 and tantalum-180m, where both nuclei are observationally stable. It is predicted that 123Te would undergo electron capture to form 123Sb, but this decay has not yet been observed; 180mTa should be able to undergo isomeric transition to 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, electron capture to 180Hf, or alpha decay to 176Lu, but none of these decay modes have been observed.

The Supreme Court dismissed Waranaka's submission in October 2011. Controversies In 2005, the politician Gabriel Dusava challenged the appointment of Waranaka as Member of Parliament for Yangoru-Saussia. In the complaint lodged with the National Court, Dusava alleged that Wararu, his supporters and the Electoral Commission, had engaged in bribery and exerted undue influence ahead of Waranaka's election. The case was brought before the Supreme Court, but Dusava withdrew the matter in July 2005 on the grounds that the delay in a decision would have an adverse impact on the population of Yangoru Saussia. In 2007, Wararu lodged a police complaint against a Peter Kendino, after an alleged attack on Waranaka on the Sepik Highway. However, Police Superintendent Dominic Kakas called upon Waranaka for questioning in September 2011, after Kendino lodged separate allegations against Waranaka, for attempted murder and theft. Michael Somare Junior, the son of Sir Michael Somare was arrested in December 2010, for the attempted murder of Peter Waranaka. Sir Michael offered Waranaka's family PGK20,000 and two pigs by way of compensation, but the relatives of Waranaka demanded PGK5 million. Waranaka stated that the attack would not affect his membership to the National Alliance party. In April 2011, police were prevented from arresting Waranaka when an angry mob of villagers from his electorate assaulted the policemen and rendered one police officer unconscious. Acting Police Commissioner Anthony Wagambie stated that they were \\"investigating allegations against the Governor\\". The villagers stated that the arrest of Waranaka would result in the cessation of work on a vital road project from Tangori to other isolated villages in the Numbo and East Yangoru.

The establishment publisher arose from talks between Brault and Gauthier about the state of comics in Qu√©bec around 1997. Things seemed pessimistic, and it seemed unlikely that the small market in the province could sustain itself. The two wanted to invigorate comics publishing in Qu√©bec, and chose to adopt a different approach to that of Franco-Belgian or American comics by publishing artists who had more personal work. They are the main French-language publisher of a number of artists such as Michel Rabagliati, and have also revived older albums, such as Jean-Paul Eid's J√©r√¥me Bigras and R√©al Godbout & Pierre Fournier's Red Ketchup.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History Gloucester City Council purchased the assets of the horse-drawn Gloucester Tramways Company in 1902, with the intention of electrifying and extending the service. The horse tramway had been built to the 4' gauge, but the replacement electric service was built to the 3'6\\" gauge. The contractor for the rebuilding was George Law of Kidderminster. Edgar Allen and Company of the Imperial Steelworks and Yorkshire Steel and Engineering Works, Sheffield, provided the tramlines.The Electrical Engineer, Vol XXXII, 1903 The electric service opened on 7 May 1904. Thirty tramcars were delivered in two batches from Brush Electrical Machines of Loughborough. The livery was crimson lake and cream, but, during World War I, the livery changed to all-grey. This could have been due to a shortage of paint, or because the trams went to Brockworth Aerodrome, a sensitive military area. This all-grey livery lasted until the system's closure. The tram depot was located off Bristol Road at its junction with Lysons Road at . Routes Gloucester Corporation Tramway in Eastgate Street.The company operated tramways along the six main roads leading out of Gloucester. A portion of the Brockworth via Hucclecote route was owned by Gloucestershire County Council.Great British Tramway Networks, Wingate H. Bett and John C. Gillham, Light Railway Transport League, London, 1944. An extension from Churchdown Lane, Hucclecote, to the Victoria Inn, Brockworth, and into the new Brockworth Aerodrome took place during 1917, using recovered track from the little-used Westgate Street line. More track was laid into the Great Western Railway (GWR) sidings at Gloucester Docks, where much of the material was unloaded. Some of the trams were fitted out so that they acted as locomotives pulling several railway trucks, taking materials to the aerodrome. In the summers of 1922 to 1924, a passenger service ran to the Victoria Inn, transporting passengers to. what was then, the countryside. After this, the track extension, from Brockworth back to Churchdown Lane, was lifted. Closure As part of a programme of replacing the tramway services with buses, which had started in 1929, the final trams ran on 12 January 1933. In 1935, Gloucester City Council entered into an agreement with the Bristol Omnibus Co. to lease out its bus services. A joint committee administered these services. Bristol Omnibus and Gloucester Corporation both held their own Road Service Licences for the city (joint) routes. Until Stagecoach West took over the services in 1993, 35 Bristol/NBC/Western Travel buses always showed (CITY OF) GLOUCESTER on their sides, along with the city's Coat of Arms. In Bristol days, the bus depot was, and still is, in London Road, almost opposite Great Western Road.

Benvenuto was born in Gaeta where his father served as officer of Navy; his origins, however, are from Campania by his father's side and from Chieti by his mother Corsi. Soon afterwards his father was transferred to Pula. In 1943 the family went on holiday to their maternal grandparents in Chieti and never returned to Istria where they lost their home and all property. After September 8, the father went underground in Chieti and, wanted by the Germans, was hidden first in a cavity of the grandparents' house and then in the crypt of the Cathedral of San Giustino. Finally he crossed the front to Ortona. After the liberation of Chieti, Giorgio Benvenuto and the family joined their father in Messina where they lived from 1945 to 1947. He joined the Italian Labour Union (UIL) on 1 October 1955 where he held operational positions in the confederation and metalworkers' union. He was secretary general of the Italian Union of Metalworkers (UILM) from 1969 to 1976 and founded the Metalworkers Federation (FLM) with Pierre Carniti and Bruno Trentin in 1972. In 1976, succeeding Raffaele Vanni, he was elected Secretary General of the UIL where he remained until 1992, when he was appointed Secretary General of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

After leaving the Socialist Party, he was one of the founders of the Democratic Alliance together with Giorgio Bogi, Ferdinando Adornato and Willer Bordon. On the occasion of the 1996 general election, he joined with the Democratic Alliance the project of the Democratic Union of Antonio Maccanico, member of The Olive Tree coalition, and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the Turin-Mirafiori constituency . In early 1998 he joined the Democrats of the Left, subsequently, he was President of the National Directorate of DS as coordinator of the Reformers Movement for Europe, which was one of the founding components of the DS. In 2001 he was re- elected MP in the same constituency as the previous election. He was also a senator from 2006 to 2008.

Springer Verlag While living in Tarascon in 1365, Bonfils published the work for which he would become best known, Sepher Shesh Kenaphayim (Book of Six Wings) (), a manuscript on eclipses that featured astronomical tables predicting future solar and lunar positions (divided into six parts). The book included data for every important date on the Jewish calendar and even correction factors necessary for those who lived as far away as Constantinople. Breaking the tables into six parts was an allusion to the six wings of the seraphim as mentioned in the Bible in Isaiah 6:2, earning Bonfils the nickname master of the wings. For 300 years, Bonfils' calculations which were extensively used by sailors and explorers well into the 17th century. The book was translated from Hebrew into Latin in 1406 by Johannes Lucae e Camerino and into Greek in 1435 by Michael Chrysokokkes. The book inspired Chemist George Sarton to publish his own version of Six Wings nearly 600 years later. Bonfils translated a number of books from Latin to Hebrew.

In mid-2011, the Pirate Party Australia accused AFACT of intimidating ISPs after they threatened unspecified actions if they didn't engage with the organisation in talks on file-sharing. A classified WikiLeaks cable revealed that AFACT was acting as the MPAA's Australian subcontractor and that the MPAA wanted to avoid the view that the court case was about Hollywood trying to bully an Australian ISP. Members The organisation comprises Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Roadshow Entertainment, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, Warner Brothers and the MPAA. Court case The organisation brought a lawsuit to the Federal Court of Australia against Australian internet service provider, iiNet, on 20 November 2008, alleging that iiNet had authorised copyright infringement on its network. AFACT had used Dtecnet, a company that tracks online copyright infringement to discover users sharing copyrighted content through BitTorrent. The Federal Court decision cleared iiNet on 4 February 2010. Justice Cowdroy found that \\"mere provision of access to internet is not the means to infringement\\". AFACT lost its appeal to the Federal Court on 24 February 2011. It was ordered to pay iiNet's legal bills. AFACT lost a further appeal to the High Court of Australia on 20 April 2012.

Atop the grand pediment is a unique \\"dome\\" structure and atop both minor pediments are matching cupola. The measurements of the building are 243 feet (east to west) by 65 feet (East end) and 55 feet (West end) with walls that are 2 1/2 feet thick. The discrepancy in the measurements is due to renovations in 1883 after a fire destroyed the upper floors on the eastern end. The symmetry of the building was lost with the eastern addition of an auditorium, classrooms and dormitory space. The Chemistry Building is adjacent to Old Main and is a three-story building measuring 37 feet by 51 feet. It is connected to Old Main by a wrought iron and plank-board walk-way extending from the 2nd floor of each structure. It was built in order to separate dangerous laboratory conditions from the dormitory area of the Old Main building.

Since its inception in 2007, the organization has reached over 6.7 million total beneficiaries, and has helped mobilise communities to enrol close to 380,000 out-of-school girls in school. Executive summary Educate Girls promotes and supports girls‚Äô education. Educate Girls creates community ownership to help communities to prioritize girls' education. The model includes the following elements:Educate Girls: What We Do Facilitating community ownership through team Balika Educate Girls has over 13,000 Team Balika (community volunteers) who work as champions for girls' education in their respective villages. Team Balika members work with Government schools as well as village communities to spread awareness on girl child education. Team Balika are trained in community mobilization & outreach (door-to-door surveys, enrolment activities, conducting community meetings), learning curriculum (GKP) implementation, leadership and motivation. They are mostly between the ages of 18-30 and are often among the most educated members of their communities. Each Team Balika is given continuous training and hand-holding by Educate Girls throughout the year to facilitate their efforts. 'Increasing girls' enrolment After using existing Government data and door-to-door surveys (conducted by Educate Girls) to identify out-of-school girls in the area, responsibility is then distributed between the village leaders, elders, school administration, Team Balika and Educate Girls' staff to bring girls back to school. This often involves going door-to-door to convince parents to send their girls to school and rallying the community through Gram Shiksha Sabha‚Äôs and Mohalla Meetings. Supporting school administration At village meetings a 15-member council is elected to form the School Management Committee (SMC). This consists of parents, teachers and village leaders and is responsible for school governance and administration. Educate Girls handholds the committee members and provides them with support to prepare and execute School Improvement Plans (SIPs) and conduct school assessments. Improving learning outcomes Educate Girls trains its Team Balika (community volunteers) to implement a remedial learning curriculum, with the use of specially designed kits, called Gyan ka Pitara (GKP).Educating The Girl Child In India 10 October, 2018 The learning tools focus on building micro-competencies in English, Hindi and Math for children in Grades 3, 4 and 5. The GKP accounts for the needs of marginalised children and uses interactive tools, activities and games, and worksheets for individual children in the classroom, ensuring that no child is left behind. Tests are conducted before and after curriculum implementation to assess learning levels.Educate Girls CLT Report 2014-15Educate Girls - Creative Learning and Teaching (CLT) Center for Education Innovations, April 30, 2013 Creation of girl leaders Educate Girls facilitates the election of Bal Sabhas (Girls' Councils) in every upper primary school.

The co-inventors include Ramesh Raskar and Vitor Pamplona. It can be seen as the inverse of expensive Shack-Hartmann sensors. NETRA allows for the early, low-cost diagnosis of the most common refractive Refractive Disorders. The subject looks into the device and aligns patterns on the display. By repeating this procedure for eight meridians, the required refractive correction is computed. NETRA exploits the fact that aberrations are expressed using only a few parameters (Spherical, Cylindrical and Axis of Astigmatism) to create an easier user interaction approach. Leveraging mobile connectivity, the system can transmit test data to appropriate facilities for immediate action, aggregate data for use in analysis, or instruct a separate machine for automatic dispensing of spectacles. The key enabling factor for this new technology is the resolution of modern LCDs. The available resolution is now half of the width of the human hair. This is only a third of the working resolution of high-end ophthalmology instruments. At this level, LCDs available in modern mobile phones can be re-purposed to achieve performance that compares with the highest end scientific instruments. NETRA can be thought as a thermometer for visual performance. Just like the thermometer measures the body temperature at one's convenience, the device provides a quantitative measurement of the refractive error without the need of a physician on the ground. The test can be performed anywhere, enabling people to know when they need to see a doctor.

It is part of the comune of San Felice del Benaco, in the Province of Brescia, Lombardy, Italy. The island has a long and varied history, having been used as a Roman burial ground, pirate lair, a site for a Franciscan monastery, border fortification and as a residential villa. The island has been visited by numerous famous people over the centuries, reportedly including Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua and Dante Alighieri. Today, it is covered by a park and is dominated by the Venetian neogothic Villa Borghese Cavazza. Although privately owned by the Cavazza family, Isola del Garda has been open to visitors since 2001. Geography Isola del Garda is located in the southwest of Lake Garda, just south of the Gulf of Sal√≤, close to the town of San Felice del Benaco, in Brescia province. It is separated from Capo San Fermo by only about 220 meters of open water. It is by far the largest island on the lake. The island (or actually islands, since Isola del Garda includes some small outcroppings of rock and most of the park is divided from the house by a narrow channel) was initially just rocks jutting out from the lake. All the soil for the gardens was brought in over time by the inhabitants. The island is around long, but only around wide at the widest point. It is now mostly covered by a park and formal gardens with a large variety of plants. History The quay and leaning tower stump, built in the early 19th century, with the Rocca di Manerba in the background. The island has been known in turn as Insula Cranie (\\"Isle of Skulls\\"), Isola dei Frati (\\"Isle of Monks\\"), Isola Scotti, Isola Lechi, Isola de Ferrari and Isola Borghese. It has likely been inhabited since the Roman period. 130 Gallo-Roman tombstones found on the island indicate that it was at least used as a burial area at the time. Remains of votive temples have also been discovered. Reportedly, after having been abandoned during the period of decline of the Roman Empire, the island served for a long time as a hideout for pirates who preyed on the shipping on Lake Garda. The island is first mentioned in written documents in a decree by Duke Carloman of Bavaria, dated 879, which granted the island to the monks of San Zeno of Verona. Apparently, they did not hold on to the property because in 1180 it was mentioned again when Emperor Frederick I granted it as a fief to one Biemino of Manerba. Around 1220, Francis of Assisi travelled through northern Italy. Although it is not certain whether he actually visited the island, the Franciscans did establish a simple hermitage among the caves and rocks of the island at that time, after it was bestowed on them by Biemino. In 1224, the Bishop of Trent visited the hermitage and three years later so did reportedly Anthony of Padua in 1227. According to local legend, in 1304, Dante Alighieri came to the island and later referred to it in his Divine Comedy as: Loco √® nel mezzo l√† dove 'l trentino pastore e quel di Brescia e 'l veronese segnar poria, s'e' fesse quel cammino (Inferno, Canto XX) In 1422, Bernardino of Siena was on the island for the first of several visits and in that period a Franciscan convent was constructed. It was rebuilt and expanded in 1438, the added church was named Santa Maria dello Scoglio. In 1470, Father Francesco Licheto (1450‚Äì1520), a member of the noble Lechi family from Brescia, founded a school of theology and philosophy on the island. In 1517, a religious commentary he wrote was printed for him by Paganino Paganini on the island, and became the first printed book to be published in the whole region around Lake Garda. Giano Fregoso, Doge of Genua, and his son Alessandro used the island as a retreat. However, after Licheto's death the religious community there went into decline. From 1685 to 1697 it was a convent for novices. Villa Borghese- Cavazza viewed from the lake with 19th-century fortifications on the right. In 1795, the government of the Republic of Venice decided to suppress the monastery. Its last head, Bonaventura di Casalloro, was forced to close the monastery and leave the island with the remaining monks. The property was then requisitioned by a decree of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, after the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic. Its government sold the island to private owners in 1800. After passing through several hands, it was bought in 1817 by Count Luigi Lechi from Brescia. He ordered major construction and renovation works and the monastery was turned into a villa. Lechi was also a poet and among his guests were composers Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti, the writers Ippolito Pindemonte and as well as painter Luigi Basiletti and architect Rodolfo Vantini. The latter designed the island's small port with its tower. Lechi's lover, the singer Adelaide Malanotte, was also a regular guest. In 1837, Luigi Lechi passed the property on to his brother Teodoro (1778-1866), a former general in the Napoleonic army, who‚Äîamong other changes‚Äîadded the terraces at the front of the villa. In 1860, the island was expropriated by the newly unified Italian state and turned into a border fortification against the Austrians, who at the time still held the region of Venetia including the eastern shore of Lake Garda. Although some construction work was done, the idea to turn the island into a fortress was abandoned after the Austrians ceded most of their holdings in northern Italy to the Kingdom of Italy after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. After that, only the northern end of Lake Garda around Riva del Garda remained Austrian. In 1870, the island was sold at auction and purchased by Baron Scotti. He in turn sold it to Duke Gaetano de Ferrari (1818‚Äì1893) from Genoa. De Ferrari and his wife, the Russian aristocrat Maria Sergeyevna Annenkova (1837‚Äì1924),, moved to the island. Between 1880 and 1900 they had the park constructed, built containment walls to keep out the water and imported fertile earth and exotic plants. Whilst the park was designed from the beginning as an English-style garden, the area in front of the house was laid out as a more formal Italian garden. In 1893, the Duke died, but the couple had previously decided to build a new villa on the site of the old Lechi villa. This Venetian Gothic palace was constructed in 1890 to 1903, based on a design of architect . After the Archduchess died, her daughter Anna Maria (1874‚Äì1924), wife of Prince Scipione Borghese from Rome, inherited the island but she survived her mother by only a few months. In 1927, the prince died, leaving the island to his daughter, Princess Livia Borghese (1901‚Äì1969), who was married to Count Alessandro Cavazza from Bologna (1895‚Äì1969). Their youngest son, Count Camillo Cavazza dei Conti Cavazza married Lady Charlotte Sarah Alexandra Chetwynd-Talbot (born 1938), the eldest daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1965. They had seven children before Camillo Cavazza died in 1981. Today The villa and gardens viewed from the eastern end of the island. Today the island is owned by Lady Charlotte Cavazza. She lives on the island with her family (her seven children‚Äîfour brothers and three sisters‚Äîand their families). The family also owns properties on the nearby peninsula where they run businesses that include boat rental, olive growing, a camping site, an agriturismo and a riding school. Since 2002 the island has been open to visitors on guided tours. It can also be rented for special events.

Her 1917 novel The Road to Mandalay, set in Burma, was the uncredited basis for a 1926 American silent film, of which only excerpts survive. She was also a notable writer of ghost stories.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 248.Rosemary Cargill Raza: \\"Croker, Bithia Mary (c. 1848‚Äì1920)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) Retrieved 30 October 2015.

William Sheppard (died 1856), the Anglican Church of Ireland rector of Kilgefin, County Roscommon, who was also a writer and controversialist. She was educated at Rockferry, Cheshire and in Tours, France. She became famous as a horsewoman with the Kildare Hunt. In 1871, she married John Stokes Croker (1844‚Äì1911), an officer in the Royal Scots Fusiliers and later the Royal Munster Fusiliers. In 1877, Bithia followed her husband to Madras and then to Bengal. She lived in India for 14 years, spending some time in the hill station of Wellington now in Tamil Nadu, where she wrote many of her works, having begun to do so as a distraction during the hot season. After her husband's retirement with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1892, the couple moved to County Wicklow, then to London, and finally to Folkestone, Kent, where her husband died in 1911.There is a blue plaque that records her residence at 10 Radnor Cliff, Sandgate, Kent, from 1897 to 1908. Retrieved 30 October 2015. She had one daughter, Eileen (born 1872), who was also educated at Rockferry. Bithia remained immensely interested in reading, travel and theatre. She died at 30 Dorset Square, London, on 20 October 1920 and was buried in Folkestone. Writing Croker's prolific literary career spanned 37 years, from 1882 when she was 33 years old, until her death in London in 1920. Her last novel, The House of Rest, was published posthumously in 1921. She wrote 42 novels and 7 volumes of short stories.British Library Catalogue. Her first novel, Proper Pride (1880), was written secretly in Secunderabad in 1880, then read aloud to other women. The original manuscript was lost, but Croker rewrote it and had it published anonymously in the UK. Thought to be by a man, it received good reviews and had been reprinted 12 times by 1896. William Ewart Gladstone was observed reading it in the House of Commons. The book, according to a present-day account, \\"shows open sympathy with the male viewpoint and metes out punishing treatment to its spirited, horse-riding heroine, whose distrustful pride separates her from her devoted husband.\\" Croker's work has been praised in general for \\"a sensitive ear for speech, for idiom and the diction of different classes, which she reproduces in lively and entertaining dialogue.\\" Tension often derives from threats to conventional order in society. Her second novel, Pretty Miss Neville (1883), was as popular as the first. The burden of social convention for a woman in India unwilling to marry the man for whom she has been sent out is explored in The Cat's Paw (1902), and that of a man who sinks socially in The Company's Servant (1907). Her Village Tales and Jungle Tragedies (1895) reflect a parallel interest in Indian rural life. Altogether 17 of the novels were set in India, one in Burma, and seven in Ireland. There are intimations of Gothic fiction in some of Croker's work. Her 1905 story \\"The Little Brass God\\", for example, involves a statue of Kali, described as a \\"goddess of destruction\\", who brings various misfortunes on the Anglo-Indians who possess it. The curse is dispelled when the statue is stolen from them and dropped down a well.Patrick Brantlinger: Rule of Darkness.

Although the artists of the school were not formally organised, they were related by their common technique, which distinguished them from the broader field of contemporary landscapists. In particular the Birmingham School is notable for its emphasis on character as well as precision in its portrayal of nature; for example often depicting trees in a manner that has more in common with portraiture, and showing \\"a quest for the essential, the quiddity of what is observed\\". Many of the artists were also related by training: Bond taught in the 1760s and pupils of his exhibited at the Free Society of Artists in London in 1763; Joseph Barber opened a drawing academy in 1801 where pupils included Cox and Baker; and Samuel Lines opened another academy in 1806 where pupils included Creswick.

He notably served as Governor of the Bank of Scotland, Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire and Captain General of the Queen's Bodyguard in Scotland. He was described as \\"an outstanding and dedicated servant of Scotland. He was a gentleman of the old school with a genial wit and great generosity of spirit\\". Early life Colville was born in Glasgow, the only son of John Colville, Secretary of State for Scotland (1938‚Äì40), who became Governor of Bombay (1943‚Äì48) and acted as Viceroy and Governor-General of India on three occasions, who was raised to the peerage in 1948 as Baron Clydesmuir. Like his father he was educated at Charterhouse and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Military career Graduating from Cambridge in 1939 Colville was drawn, at the age of 22, into World War II. The tradition of service, already ingrained, left no room for hesitation and like so many thousands of his countrymen he joined a Scottish regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in which his father had served in World War I. Clydesmuir was in action with the regiment at Dunkirk, in Italy, and in the Normandy landings, was awarded the MBE and mentioned in despatches, serving throughout World War II and for a short time thereafter. The Cameronians were famously recruited from Glasgow and the Lanarkshire area, the industrial heart of Scotland. Clydesmuir's obituary noted \\"he always remained a West of Scotland man respecting and sharing the down-to-earth qualities of the men with whom he had fought. It was typical of him and of them that some of his merriest and most affectionate anecdotes, (and he was a master story-teller), had to do with the lighter off-duty events of these dangerous days and with the lifelong friends he made among his comrades in arms\\". His military experiences poignantly influenced his later life and after the war he continued his connections with the Army. Among his other appointments he became Chairman of Council of the Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer Associations (1969‚Äì73), and later President, (1974‚Äì81); commanded the 6/7th (Territorial) battalion of the Cameronians, and later became Honorary Colonel (1967‚Äì71); he was also Honorary Colonel of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, TA&VR; (1970‚Äì75). His obituary also noted \\"he never lost the upright and alert bearing, the directness of speech and method, and the disciplined self-control he had acquired in his army days. Nor did he forget the debts owed to the men who had served with him and, in many cases, suffered and died\\". Business career His obituary commented \\"that it was probably inevitable that Clydesmuir should join the family business on his return from the war and it was also in character that he should work his way up the hard way, successfully\\". He became a Director of Colvilles Limited in 1958. Meantime his lively personality, his abilities and his connections caused him to be in demand in many other spheres. One of these was the Scottish Council (Development & Industry), a body established in the thirties under the leadership of his uncle, Lord Bilsland, to encourage the introduction of new, lighter industries to reduce the over-dependence of central Scotland on declining heavy industry, and to develop export markets. After the war the efforts to this effect continued with considerable success. Clydesmuir joined the Executive Committee in 1954, became its chairman in 1966 and President of the Council in 1972, an appointment he held until 1986. In these entirely voluntary roles he worked tirelessly in productive association with successive chief executives, not least the redoubtable Dr Willie Robertson, and he led pioneering and successful trade missions to the Soviet Union and China. Despite being exceptionally generous with his time to various voluntary organisations, he became increasingly preoccupied with business interests particularly in the field of banking and finance and from an early stage in the developing Scottish oil and gas industry. Since his appearance on the scene after the war he had been in demand as a non-executive director and among his early appointments was as a director of the British Linen Bank, then a whollyowned subsidiary of Barclays Bank. He was appointed Governor of that bank in 1966 and on its merger with the Bank of Scotland in 1971 he became Deputy Governor of the merged bank. In 1972, on the resignation of Lord Polwarth to take up a political appointment, he was elected Governor of the Bank of Scotland, an office he held with distinction until his retirement in 1981. During his time as governor of the bank he was also a director of Barclays Bank. His period as Governor of the Bank of Scotland saw many changes and his leadership showed itself first in the successful and productive completion of the integration of the two banks and thereafter in the imaginative use of new technology and in the profitable expansion of the Bank's business, domestically within Scotland, in England and internationally. From an era when high business office is often associated in the public mind with self-seeking it is salutary to look back on his career which was one of impeccably unselfish dedication to the organisation he led, and served.Cameron, Alan (1996), ‚ÄòBank of Scotland (1695‚Äì1995)‚Äô Mainstream Publishing Honours His obituary noted \\"the distinctions and honours bestowed upon Lord Clydesmuir are indicative of the high regard in which he was held. In addition to his war-time awards he was appointed CB in 1965 and became a Knight of the Thistle in 1972. He was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1971 and 1972. He held office as Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire from 1963 to 1992, having been Deputy Lieutenant (1955‚Äì59) and Vice-Lieutenant (1959‚Äì63). He was a long-serving member of the Royal Company of Archers, Queen's Body Guard for Scotland, and from 1986 until shortly before his death he held the office of Captain General. He also held honorary degrees awarded by Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt Universities.\\" In 1978 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Family Clydesmuir, whose family name was Colville, was from a long- established Scottish family. He was a great-grandson of David Colville, founder of the huge iron and steel enterprise which, as Colvilles Limited, became a renowned and powerful force in the industrial development of the United Kingdom; and son of John Colville, a former Secretary of State for Scotland (1938‚Äì40), who became Governor of Bombay (1943‚Äì48) and acted as Viceroy and Governor-General of India on three occasions. He was raised to the peerage in 1948 as the first Baron Clydesmuir of Braidwood. He succeeded to the title in 1954 on the death of his father. Lord Bilsland another Scottish Industrialist was his uncle. He married Joan Booth, daughter of Lieutenant- Colonel E.B. Booth DSO, RAMC of Darver Castle, Dundalk, County Louth. Joan's younger sister was Lady McCorkell OBE who married Colonel Sir Michael McCorkell. Clydesmuir is survived by his children David, who inherited the title on his passing, Diana, Andrew and Anne.

It is a thick sequence of carbonate rocks of Middle Cambrian age. It was named for Cathedral Mountain in Yoho National Park by Charles Doolittle Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess shale fossils. The Cathedral Formation includes fossil stromatolites, oncolites, and other algal remains, as well as a few shale beds with trilobites. The Cathedral escarpment on its westernmost edge is thought to have played a major role in the deposition and preservation of the Burgess shale fossils. Lithology and deposition The Cathedral Formation consists primarily of massive, cliff- forming carbonate rocks. It was originally deposited as limestone, much of which may have been secreted by marine algae. Deposition took place in shallow water on an extensive algal reef or carbonate platform that had developed along the western margin of the North American Craton.Conway Morris, S. and Whittington, H.B. 1985.

Geoscience Canada, vol. 13, no. 2, p. 106-118. Cathedral escarpment The Cathedral escarpment is an abrupt cliff on the westernmost edge of the Cathedral Formation. It was probably a submarine cliff that marked the edge of the original carbonate platform. It is approximately 100 to 300 metres (330 to 1000 feet) high and extends for about 100 kilometres (62 miles) running through and around Yoho National Park, although only small portions of it are exposed. During the deposition of the Stephen Formation, mudflows ran down and along the escarpment, trapping the Burgess shale organisms and burying them quickly at the base of the cliff. This prevented their decay, preserving their soft tissues as well as their hard parts in the Stephen Formation shales. Distribution and stratigraphic relationships The Cathedral Formation is present in the southern Canadian Rockies of southwestern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia. It reaches a maximum thickness of about 610 metres (2000 feet) at Mount Stephen. It is in gradational contact with the underlying Mount Whyte and Naiset Formations, and with the overlying Stephen Formation. To the west, the Cathedral Formation terminates abruptly against the shales of the Stephen Formation at the Cathedral escarpment. The formation thins eastward, grading into the Earlie Formation beneath the Alberta plains. To the north it grades into the Snake Indian Formation. It is equivalent to the thinner Elko Formation to the south. Economic resources The Cathedral Formation hosts deposits of magnesite (MgCO3) at Mt. Brussilof, about 35 km (22 miles) northwest of Radium Hot Springs in British Columbia. The ore consists of magnesite-rich sparry carbonate massesSimandl, G.J. and Hancock, J.D. 1991.

It was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. The picture won the Special Jury Prize at Kinotavr. Plot The film consists of three novellas the plot of which is based on criminal stories that do not have usual logical motives. The people who become killers in all these episodes are the ones who at first glance seem to be completely incapable of murder. The First Story \\"Boiler Room No. 6\\" A modest employee brings a cupboard to the boiler room for his friend, Tikhomirov. He works as a stoker, writes poetry in his spare time and rents out a place for intimate pleasure to local homosexuals. During a normal conversation between old acquaintances, Tikhomirov time after time returns to the story of his unbearable neighbor who does not let him live in peace and even comes to his workplace in order to compromise him ... Tikhomirov gets interrupted and is not able to get to the point of his request by frequenters of the depraved corner, who by the way also see him as an object for pleasure and even offer money to him... In the closet lies the naked corpse of Tikhomirov's neighbor (she walked around the house like this), which he intends to burn in the boiler room. The Second Story \\"Ophelia\\" Ofa works in a hospital archive. She does not like men, women, or children: \\"I would rate this planet as zero.\\" Her attention is especially directed towards those mothers who abandon their children in a maternity hospital. A gynecologist makes advances towards Ofa whom she uses for an alibi at the moment she commits the murder of a disowning mother. Her literary ideal is Shakespeare's Ophelia, whose fate Ofa arranges for a single woman ‚Äì her own mother, Alexander Ivanovna Ivanova, who many years ago gave her up. The Third Story \\"Girl and Death\\" An elderly man in a wheelchair operates a coffee grinder. A little girl who lives nearby plays with him, irritating and annoying the old man from time to time. From the mouth of the baby resonates the neighbor's expectation, that after his death she together with her mother will get his room. The old man teaches the girl how to play chess, reads a book to her, and she in turn brings a glass of water containing rat poison. After drinking a cup of water, the old man dies.

A bomb, seemingly targeting Shia Muslims marking the festival of Arbain, killed at least 53 people and left more than 130 injured. Attacks The bomb exploded among crowds of Shia pilgrims at a security checkpoint in the city. The pilgrims were passing through the checkpoint on their way to a major Shia mosque in the Az Zubayr district, about 20km (12 miles) south-west of Basra. There were conflicting reports about the cause of the explosion, with some saying that a suicide bomber dressed as a police officer managed to reach the checkpoint after showing a fake ID card. Other reports blamed a powerful roadside bomb that had been planted close to the road. The attack occurred on the last of the 40 days of Arbain, where hundreds of thousands of Shia pilgrims visit the city of Kerbala and other holy sites. Security forces sealed off the main hospital after the attack, fearing further violence. Following the attack, the Iraqi military \\"intensified\\" its security around the country. 30,000 Iraqi soldiers were deployed in Karbala to protect pilgrims. Officials believe at least 16 million pilgrims have passed through the city of Karbala in the past two weeks. Other attacks took place throughout Iraq that day. Roadside bombings in Mosul, Baqubah and Al-Karmah left one policeman dead and at least nine people injured. A car bombing targeting a police patrol in Tikrit killed a bystander and injured two officers. Responsibility Ali Ghanim, the chief of the security committee in Basra, said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. He said, \\"There was a man who was holding a box and giving food to people, and one of our security officers found him suspicious and went to search the box and the man blew himself up\\".

The directive, passed in 1999, banned conventional battery cages in the EU from 1 January 2012 after a 13-year phase-out. Battery cages were already banned in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden prior to 2012. The directive does not apply to establishments with fewer than 350 laying hens or establishments rearing breeding laying hens. Such establishments are, however, subject to the requirements of Directive 98/58/EC. The directive is not supported with fines, penalties or export bans. As alternatives to battery cages, Directive 1999/74/EC allows non-cage systems and furnished cages. Furnished cages therefore represent a feasible alternative to battery cages in the EU after 2012. Under the directive, furnished cages must provide at least the following: 750 cm2 per hen, of which 600 cm2 is 45 cm high, a nest, a littered area for scratching and pecking, 15 cm of perch and 12 cm of food trough per hen and a claw shortening device. Austria banned battery cages in 2009 and is set to ban furnished cages by 2020. Belgium has also banned the battery cage ‚Äì and proposes to ban furnished cages by 2024. Germany has introduced a ‚Äòfamily cage‚Äô, which has more space than the furnished cages used in other countries, however, consumers in Germany have been rejecting these eggs. Outside the EU, Switzerland has already banned both the battery and furnished cage systems. In February 2010, the Polish government formally requested the EU to delay enacting Directive 1999/74/EC by 5 years until 2017, however, this was unsuccessful. According to figures submitted to the European Commission in 2011, 14 countries were expected to be battery cage free by 1 January 2012. However, six states including Portugal, Poland and Romania admitted they would not be ready, while Spain and Italy, among others, did not know or would not say whether they will meet the deadline. In France one third of egg producers have gone out of business and according to figures of the UGPVB (the industry association) 5% of producers were still not compliant as of January 2012 and have had their licences withdrawn. This has led to fears that cheaper, illegal eggs, particularly liquid egg products, from non-compliant states will flood the market undercutting compliant egg producers. John Dalli, the EU health commissioner, has issued legal warnings to 13 countries over their lack of readiness or effort to enforce the ban. The 13 member states already found to be in breach of the directive are: Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and the Netherlands. Compliance beyond January 2012 It is clear that beyond the date of the law coming into effect, many hens are still being housed in battery cages. European Commission figures show that more than 47 million hens are still (January 2012) in conventional battery cages across the EU, representing 14.3% of production, although it has been reported this figure might be as high as 23% of EU egg production ‚Äì equivalent to 84 million hens laying 70 million eggs a day. 15 EU states reported to the EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health that they had non-compliant producers. These states were Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, UK, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Romania. Some of these countries, such as Italy and Belgium, admit to having 30% of illegal production. In the UK, there are approximately 31 million egg laying hens. Over ¬£400 million has been spent to meet the standards. In January 2012, reports stated that figures from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) indicate 423,000 hens on 32 farms in the UK were still being housed in battery cages. This represents a non-compliance rate of 1%.

It is the most prominent interruption of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Azores and Iceland. It can be traced over more than 2000 kilometers, all the way from north-east of Newfoundland to south-west of Ireland. It took 90 million years for the fault to grow to this length. Structure The transform fault of the southern fracture zone displaces the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, coming from the Azores Triple Junction, to the west over a distance of 120 km. At longitude 31.75W a south to north seismically active rift valley with a length of 40 km connects the western end of the southern transform to the eastern end of the northern transform. The northern transform fault displaces the spreading ridge over another 230 km to the west before it connects to the northern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge going to Iceland. Thus the total offset of the system is 350 kilometers. Both transform faults continue eastward and westward as inactive fracture zones. Exploration In 1963 the existence of a transform fault near latitude 53N was first postulated on the basis of earthquake epicenter data by Bruce Heezen and Maurice Ewing. Also the study of ocean currents indicated that there should be a deep passage through the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In 1966 the area was investigated by on its return from an Arctic survey.Report on voyage of USCGC Spar The fault was named Charlie Fracture Zone after the USCG Ocean Weather Station Charlie at , athwart the fault. In July 1968 conducted a more extended survey. It was proposed that the fracture zone be renamed Gibbs Fracture Zone, as fracture zones are generally named for research vessels. The proposal was accepted only in part, and currently the official name is Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone. Note that the double name refers to the two parallel fracture zones together. The individual fracture zones have to be referred to as Charlie-Gibbs North and South. Seamounts The transform area contains two named seamounts: * Minia Seamount at .

Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Borneo. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The specific epithet hemsleyana honours English botanist William Botting Hemsley, who described N. macfarlanei and N. smilesii. Botanical history This species has a long and confused taxonomic history. It was first collected in 1877 by Frederick William Burbidge, who found it on \\"a rocky hill about five hundred feet [] high\\". The site was reached by a small stream and lay around from the Kedayan settlement of Meringit, located at the head of the Meropok branch of the Lawas River in Sarawak, Borneo. There the plant grew sympatrically with N. gracilis, N. hirsuta, N. rafflesiana, and N. veitchii. Burbidge informally called the plant N. rafflesiana \\"glaberrima\\", but there is no indication that this is the same taxon as the N. rafflesiana var. glaberrima described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873, Hooker, J.D. 1873. Ordo CLXXV bis. Nepenthace√¶. In: A. de Candolle Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis 17: 90‚Äì105. for which there is no representative herbarium material or description of pitcher morphology. Three of Burbidge's specimens are extant at the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: K000651484, K000651485, and K000651486. K000651485 is the designated lectotype and the other two isotypes. Nepenthes hemsleyana was formally described by John Muirhead Macfarlane in his 1908 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\". Macfarlane noted its similarity to N. rafflesiana but distinguished it on the basis of \\"the nerves of the leaves, the long and slender tendril, the slim and elongated pitchers, the heart-shaped lid with diffused glands, the deep off-leading surface\\" (translated from the original Latin). Twenty years later, B. H. Danser sunk N. hemsleyana in synonymy with N. rafflesiana in his \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", having apparently not examined the type material of the former. Subsequent monographs on the genus followed Danser's interpretation. Differences between this taxon and the typical form of N. rafflesiana were long recognised in the horticultural and botanical communities, and it was variously and informally known as the 'elongate form' of N. rafflesiana, N. rafflesiana var. elongata, or N. sp. \\"elegance\\". It was formally described as N. baramensis () in 2011 by Charles Clarke, Jonathan Moran, and Ch'ien Lee, who detailed its differing ecology. In 2013, Mathias Scharmann and T. Ulmar Grafe pointed out that this taxon had already been formally described more than 100 years earlier, as N. hemsleyana, and that this is therefore the correct name under the botanical rules of priority. The authors also synonymised N. rafflesiana var. subglandulosa with N. hemsleyana. Description A lower pitcher from a Bruneian plant Nepenthes hemsleyana is very similar to the typical form of N. rafflesiana, but is elongated in all respects. The upper leaves of N. hemsleyana have proportionally longer laminae (leaf blades) and proportionally shorter petioles than do those of N. rafflesiana, but these differences are not nearly as pronounced in the lower leaves. In N. hemsleyana the tendrils are always round in cross section, whereas in N. rafflesiana they may be flattened or even winged. Nepenthes hemsleyana also differs from that species in retaining a well developed waxy zone in its upper pitchers. It frequently bears multicellular, filiform appendages on the upper surface of the lid, similar to those of the N. tentaculata group of species; these have never been documented in N. rafflesiana. Leaf colouration also distinguishes the two species; in closed forest the leaves of N. hemsleyana are dark green or reddish, as compared to bright green in N. rafflesiana. Distribution Nepenthes hemsleyana is known with certainty from Brunei (Belait and Tutong districts) and coastal regions of northern Sarawak (Baram River region and Bintulu Division), including around Miri and in Gunung Mulu National Park. However, the full extent of the species's range may be much larger than currently appreciated. For example, an as yet undetermined herbarium specimen and recent photographic evidence \\"clipeata\\" 2008. tahun baru jalan2 di kalimantan. Tanaman Karnivora, February 1, 2008. point to its presence in the Kapuas region of West Kalimantan. The species may still be extant near its type locality in Lawas District, Sarawak, but much of the area's original forest has been destroyed since Burbidge's time and replaced by oil palm plantations. Two small hills have been identified near the Merapok River which may represent the type locality, but both have been logged and no plants of N. hemsleyana could be found. Natural hybrids Two natural hybrids involving N. hemsleyana are known: crosses with N. ampullaria and N. rafflesiana have been recorded in Brunei, but only in areas of human disturbance. The former cross differs from sympatric N. √ó hookeriana (N. ampullaria √ó N. rafflesiana) in possessing a waxy zone, a narrower peristome, and hairs on the upper surface of the lid. Relationship with bats Nepenthes hemsleyana appears to rely on different prey trapping strategies as compared to N. rafflesiana. Unlike the latter, the upper pitchers of N. hemsleyana have an expanded waxy zone and watery, less viscoelastic pitcher fluid. They also appear to lack UV patterns and produce less nectar and odour attractants. Hardwicke's woolly bats (Kerivoula hardwickii) commonly roost in the upper pitchers of N. hemsleyana.Youngsteadt, E. 2011. Carnivorous plant feasts on bat dung . ScienceNOW, January 25, 2011.Davies, E. 2011. Bats in Borneo roost in carnivorous pitcher plants. BBC Earth News, January 26, 2011.https://news.mongabay.com/2011/01/tiny-bats-trade-in-caves-for-pitcher- plants-in-borneo/ This relationship appears to be mutualistic, with the plant providing shelter for the bats and in return receiving additional nitrogen input in the form of faeces. It has been estimated that the plant derives 33.8% of its total foliar nitrogen from the bats' droppings. Nepenthes hemsleyana pitchers provide better roosts with a more stable microclimate as compared to those of sympatric N. bicalcarata, though they are less abundant. Hardwicke's woolly bats roosting in N. hemsleyana have on average a higher body condition and fewer parasites than those roosting in N. bicalcarata. The bats occupy N. hemsleyana pitchers longer and disturbance experiments have shown that they choose them preferentially over those of N. bicalcarata.Sch√∂ner, C., M. Sch√∂ner, G. Kerth & U. Grafe 2013. Supply determines demand: influence of partner quality and quantity on the interactions between bats and pitcher plants. In: Abstracts: 16th International Bat Research Conference & 43rd North American Symposium on Bat Research. San Jose, Costa Rica. August 11‚Äì15, 2013. pp. 141‚Äì142. The frequency of the bats' vocalisations (starting well above 250 kHz) is the highest known of any bat species and may be an adaptation to locate pitchers among dense surrounding vegetation. The bats are likely further aided by a parabolic structure found in the rear wall of N. hemsleyana upper pitchers. This structure shows far stronger echo-reflection than a comparable area in the most closely related pitcher plant species, Nepenthes rafflesiana. These reflecting structures are convergent with those of some Neotropical bat- pollinated angiosperms, such as Marcgravia evenia. References Further reading * Di Giusto, B., M. Gu√©roult, N.

Die Laughing are mainly remembered for their input to the 1990s goth scene with the classic lineup of Rachel Speight (vocals), John Berry (guitar) and Ian Holman (guitar). Between 1992 and 1999 this line-up went on to release several albums and headline major venues and festivals throughout the UK and Europe. Mick Mercer said in his book Hex Files: The Gothic BibleMercer, Mick. Hex Files: The Gothic Bible. London : Batsford, 1996 what they have \\"which virtually every other UK act lacks, is this knowledge of melody and how to twist things into delightful forms\\". They were notable from their contemporaries because of the way they combined driving female vocals with hard edged gothic rock, a style typically dominated by male vocalists. Their unique and influential sound would lead them to become one of Britain's most popular gothic ethereal bands in the 1990s. History 1986 to 1992 Die Laughing's roots go back into the mid 1980s when the band was formed in Nottingham, UK by John Berry and vocalist Alison. The name Die Laughing was chosen after Alison became hysterical with laughter during rehearsal. This line up was completed by bassist Stuart 'Rock God' Salt and a drummer, and played a number of live shows. The band released three demos over two years, and the track \\"Wake\\" featured on the rare compilation album \\"Underground Resistance\\". The band split in 1988 after the release of their final 4 track demo \\"Of Hearts & Tears\\" when Alison left the band. Auditions were held but a new vocalist was not found and the band remained in hiatus until 1992. 1992 to 1994 In 1992, John Berry met vocalist Rachel Speight and the second incarnation of Die Laughing was born. The pair began writing new tracks and further band members Dave Shiner and Ruth Tyson were recruited alongside a drummer to complete the live line up. The band recorded their first demo Poems of Your Life at Cage Studios in Sheffield which saw the group record four tracks from the first incarnation of the band. After purchasing a drum machine (Dr Duck), the band played their first live show on 12 February 1993, at The Narrow Boat venue in Nottingham. The band's second demo Love Amongst The Ruins was recorded in March 1993. Extended touring around the UK during the summer of 1994 with Children On Stun followed, with the band making the decision to enhance the live sound with the addition of second guitarist, Ian Holman. Ian was felt by the band to complement the songwriting dynamic and joined as a permanent member later the same year. October 1994 saw the release of the three track Shadows & Silhouettes demo on cassette which was engineered by Matt Howden (Sieben). 1995 to 1997 Ian made his recording debut with Die Laughing on the band's final visit to Cage Studios in 1995 after the band had been approached by independent London label Grave News Ltd and Gothic Rock's Mick Mercer. Following critical acclaim within the genre media, and growing popularity on the live music circuit, the band recorded two new songs which appeared on two important and notable gothic rock compilations, \\"Harlequin\\" for the \\"Dreams in the Witch House\\" compilation (Grave News), and \\"Safe Little World\\" for Mick Mercer's Gothic Rock Volume 2: 80's into 90's compilation (Jungle Records), both released in 1995. During this time they were interviewed by the BBC World Service for their views on the goth music scene whilst playing a live show at The Marquee, London. Die Laughing were now gaining worldwide fans and publicity, with the track \\"Nemesis\\" receiving regular club play in the goth venues of New York. The band was signed by Grave News 1995 and released a seven-track mini-album Glamour & Suicide which was notable in the fact that it sold out on pre-orders prior to release. The band chose to record the album at Purple Studios in Great Yarmouth which was owned and run by Richard Hammerton the vocalist of indie band Stare. Shortly after the album had been recorded it was announced that live keyboard player Ruth, and then a few months later bassist Dave, were both to leave the band due to work commitments. The band were signed to Grave News in 1995 for a second full-length album and EP releases. In January 1996 the band returned to Purple Studios in Great Yarmouth to record Heaven in Decline. The band spent one week recording the 13 tracks but opted for a month break before returning to finish and mix the album. The album was released in May and saw Die Laughing embarking on a short tour of Germany with Vendemmian to promote the album in Europe. The album received positive coverage in mainstream rock/metal magazine Kerrang! and global goth underground magazines. The band continued gigging throughout 1996 headlining the Marquee Club in London and playing The Drachma Club in Turin, Italy. At the same time, the band wrote a new single Queen of Swords which made its live debut in August at the Sacrosanct Festival at London Astoria where they played to a full house of 2000 people. They also made their first appearance at the Whitby Gothic Weekend. The album 'Heaven in Decline' had achieved significant sales in Japan on import which led Japanese label 'Belle Antique' to licence a limited edition version with the additional bonus rare track 'Plus ca Change' for this market only. 1998 to 1999 The Temptress EP (Queen of Swords) was recorded at The Vestry in Ealing, West London over the Christmas & New Year period 1996‚Äì97 but the recording was interrupted when Rachel was taken seriously ill and admitted to hospital with penicillin poisoning whilst in the studio. Once she had recovered the recording was completed, with the EP finally released later in the year alongside the album \\"Caged\\" which was a compilation of the band's discontinued 1992‚Äì1994 demo tapes. In 1998 the band were approached by U.S label Cleopatra Records to release a compilation of Die Laughing album tracks together with 4 new unreleased tracks from the third album which the band had already begun to write. Incarnations (a retrospective) became the final album the band would release in the 1990s. In 1998 Die Laughing headlined the Whitby Gothic Weekend playing to over a thousand people. In the summer of 1999 Die Laughing played their final gig at London's The Borderline. 1999 to 2012 The band drew to a close in the summer of 1999, and the members moved onto new projects. Despite no longer being active, Die Laughing continued to grow their fanbase due to their tracks being featured on a number of compilations including an album which was notable as \\"a definitive look at some of darkwave/goth-rock's most innovating female performers\\". John co-founded in Isolation, Rachel became a fashion accessories designer/illustrator and musically, a member of Pretentious, Moi?. Ian continues to write music. 2012 reunion 2012 saw the 20th anniversary of the second incarnation of Die Laughing featuring the core songwriting partnership of Rachel Speight and John Berry now joined by Mike Uwins (of Manuskript on bass) and Bob Malkowski (previously of The Modern/Inertia on rhythm guitar). Their acclaimed first reunion show took place at Whitby Gothic Weekend on 28 April 2012. A new limited edition single, \\"Tangled\\", was released to coincide with the festival.

The film stars James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel, and Rosario Dawson. The world premiere of the film was held in London on 19 March 2013. Plot Simon (McAvoy), an art auctioneer, becomes an accessory to the theft of a painting‚ÄìFrancisco Goya 1798 Witches in the Air‚Äìfrom his own auction house. When a gang attacks during an auction, Simon follows the house emergency protocol by packaging the painting. The gang's leader Franck (Cassel) then takes the package from him at gunpoint. Simon attacks Franck, who delivers him a blow to the head that leaves him with amnesia. When Franck gets home, he discovers that the package contains only an empty frame. After ransacking Simon's apartment and trashing his car, the gang kidnaps and unsuccessfully tortures him. But he has no memory of where he has hidden the painting. Franck decides to hire a hypnotherapist to try to help him remember. Franck makes Simon choose a hypnotist from a directory, and he chooses an American named Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson). As a first hypnotic exercise, Simon recalls where he put some car keys. Elizabeth exposes the gang's plan to have her hypnotize him, and demands partnership. In a next hypnotic episode, under gang supervision, Simon remembers that, shortly after the blow to his head, he awoke alone. On finding the stolen painting hidden in his suit, he left the art gallery. Distracted by a phone text message, while crossing the road, he was hit by a red car. The female driver tried to take him to hospital. Simon, in a kind of memory fugue, believed the woman was Elizabeth, recalling that she had made him forget her. The gang tries violently to force Simon to remember where he put the painting, and that ends the hypnotic episode. When asked by Elizabeth about how he met Franck, Simon confesses that he has a gambling problem. Franck helped him pay his debts in exchange for his help in stealing the painting. Francisco Goya's Witches in the Air (1798), the painting stolen in the film. In reality it is part of the collection of the Museo del Prado. To help Simon recover from the violence, Elizabeth stays overnight in his apartment. In the morning, Simon dreams of Elizabeth's having used a brain-scan behaviour-conditioning technique to erase an obsession that he had for her. Elizabeth tells Franck about that. Goya's Nude Maja (ca. 1795), a painting Simon discusses in the film. For the next step to recover the painting, Elizabeth tells Franck that she will sexually seduce Simon. Simon's feelings for Elizabeth recur, gently this time. At the same time, Franck and Elizabeth have unanticipated sex, and she steals his pistol from his bedside drawer. Nate, a gang member, sees them together and warns Simon, who confronts Elizabeth with it. She responds by touching his erotic mindspot, related to Goya's Nude Maja. Remembering where the painting is, Simon goes with Franck and his associates to reveal the location, but overhears their plan to kill him. He calls Elizabeth and tells her that the painting is in a red car in a certain car park, and unable to leave Franck's apartment, he returns and kills the gang members instead. After shooting Franck, Simon wakes up: this was all dream, and he still is in Elizabeth's apartment. Elizabeth takes the car keys and goes to get the painting, leaving Franck's revolver for Simon. While searching for Elizabeth, Simon finds Franck in her apartment. Nate and his associates intercept Elizabeth and bring her there. Franck takes Simon to get the painting, and as he kisses Elizabeth, she secretly passes three bullets into his mouth. On the elevator, Simon stops Franck with a fire extinguisher, and then with the revolver, now loaded with the three bullets. In the apartment, Nate prepares to rape Elizabeth. Heading back into the apartment, Simon shoots the three gang members. He takes the car keys from Elizabeth, and loads the revolver with the remaining three bullets. He takes Elizabeth to get the painting, and she tells him to let Franck come with them. With Franck driving, Simon leads them to a parking garage where the painting is. They collect the red car and drive it to a safe warehouse. During the trip, Elizabeth reveals that Simon was previously a client of hers. He had a gambling addiction he wanted to fix. They started an affair, and she found his erotic mindspot. However, he became obsessed with her, and eventually abusive. Fearing for her life, she re-directed the hypnosis to make him forget her. This led him back into his gambling addiction, which as previously stated, caused him to go in debt and to try to pay it off by stealing a painting, with the help of Franck. Simon recalls that, after the heist, when he was hit by the red car and mistook the female driver for Elizabeth, he strangled her. At the warehouse, in the car's trunk, Elizabeth finds the painting and the body of the female driver. Simon, having at last remembered his past and wanting to forget, douses the car in fuel with Franck zip-tied to the steering wheel, sets it on fire and tells Elizabeth to run away with the painting. She runs away but promptly returns driving a truck which she drives into Simon, pinning him against the other car, and ultimately sending Simon, and the car Franck is trapped in, into the river. Franck manages to escape, while it is implied that Simon is killed. The scene cuts to Franck swimming in his apartment while thinking of the event. He gets out of the pool and receives a package. He opens the package and finds an iPad that plays a video of Elizabeth talking about the painting, which is now hanging in her apartment. She reveals that when she hypnotized Simon to make him forget her, she also hypnotized him to go back into his gambling addiction and then try to steal a painting to pay off his debt. When this happened, he would instead give the painting over to Elizabeth. This explains why Simon took the painting away from Franck at the beginning and the text message he received before being hit by the car, which is revealed to be from Elizabeth telling Simon to deliver the painting to her. Elizabeth tells Franck that he can search for her and try to find her, but also gives him the option to forget the entire ordeal, and a button for an app called \\"Trance\\" appears as the video ends. Franck is shown debating whether to press the button just as the screen cuts to black. Cast Rembrandt's Storm on the Sea of Galilee (1633), a painting Simon uses to introduce and frame the film, drawing attention to the central self-portrait of Rembrandt, who calmly stares out at the viewer while chaos rages around him. * James McAvoy as Simon Newton * Vincent Cassel as Franck * Rosario Dawson as Elizabeth Lamb * Danny Sapani as Nate * Matt Cross as Dominic * Wahab Sheikh as Riz * Mark Poltimore (7th Baron Poltimore) as Francis Lemaitre * Tuppence Middleton as Young Woman in Red Car * Simon Kunz as Surgeon * Michael Shaeffer as Security Guard #1 * Tony Jayawardena as Security Guard #2 * Vincent Montuel as Handsome Waiter * Jai Rajani as Car Park Attendant * Spencer Wilding as 60's Robber * Gursharan Chaggar as Postman * Edward Rising as 60's Auctioneer Production Development After director Danny Boyle filmed Shallow Grave in 1994, Joe Ahearne sent the director his screenplay for Trance, seeking Boyle's encouragement. Boyle thought that the project would be \\"quite difficult\\" for a beginning screenwriter. Ahearne later turned the script into a 2001 television movie.Trance TV Movie Boyle never forgot it, and almost two decades after their original conversation he contacted Ahearne about turning it into a feature film. Partially based on Ahearne's 2001 British television film of the same name, Trance underwent script doctoring by screenwriter John Hodge ‚Äì marking the fifth motion picture collaboration between Hodge and Boyle. Casting In May 2011, Michael Fassbender was cast as Franck but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Colin Firth was considered for the part before Cassel was cast. Scarlett Johansson, Melanie Thierry, and Zoe Saldana were considered for the role that went to Dawson. McAvoy, who accepted the role in 2011, said that he almost turned down the part, while reading the script, because Simon seemed to be a victim, which didn't interest him. He told NPR's reporter Laura Sullivan, \\"And then I got about 15 or 20 pages in, and I started to sense that something else was coming in the character. And then something else did come. And then about every 10 pages, something else came. Until at the end, I was hungry to play this part.\\" Filming Principal photography began in September 2011. After filming wrapped up, the film was placed on hold in order for Boyle to work on the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Post-production was then picked up again in August 2012. Boyle said that this is \\"the first time I put a woman at the heart of a movie.\\" He also said that he originally intended to set the movie in New York City, but it was filmed in London and in Kent instead, as Boyle's Olympic ceremony duties meant he had to stay in the UK. Music On 4 January 2013, it was announced that Rick Smith of the band Underworld would be composing the music for the film. Underworld previously contributed tracks to other Danny Boyle films, including Trainspotting (1996), A Life Less Ordinary (1997), The Beach (2000), and Sunshine (2007). About the collaboration, Smith said, \\"After finishing the Opening Ceremony, I hardly knew what day of the week it was. I took a month off work, off music, off everything. Exactly one month and three days after we said goodbye in the stadium, I received a text from Danny that said, 'Do you ever want to hear from me again workwise and would that go as far as having a chat about Trance... Questions, questions.' Two Minutes later I was on board.\\" The soundtrack album for Trance was released in the United Kingdom on 25 March and in the United States on 2 April 2013. When asked by an interviewer about the secret of his 17-year-old creative partnership with Smith, Boyle joked, \\"He's cheap.\\" Then, answering seriously, he said that they both like electronic music and that he doesn't prescribe a sound for a scene, but lets Smith follow his own instincts. Release Boyle showed a teaser trailer and an extended version of an alternate ending at South by Southwest on 9 March 2013. The entire film could not be screened at the festival, as is usually done, because the producing studio Path√© owned the rights to the world premi√®re. The world premi√®re of the film was held in London on 19 March 2013. The film saw general release on 27 March 2013 in the United Kingdom, with a United States release date on 5 April 2013. Reception The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 68% based on reviews from 160 critics; the site's consensus is: \\"As stylish as ever, director Danny Boyle seems to be treading water with the surprisingly thinly written Trance -- but for fans of Boyle's work, it should still prove a trippily entertaining distraction\\". Washington Post writer Michael O'Sullivan describes Boyle as \\"playing fast and loose with reality.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 based on reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 61% based on 37 reviews. Retrieved 29 June 2013. Empire magazine in its review gave the film 4 out of 5 and called the film \\"a dazzling, absorbing entertainment which shows off Danny Boyle's mastery of complex storytelling and black, black humour.\\" Empire also ranked it 27 in its top 50 films of 2013.

It was first published in 1971 by Oxford University Press for the International African Institute. Divided into five chapters, the short book is devoted to Goody's argument that former scholars studying sub-Saharan Africa had made mistakes by comparing its historical development to that in Europe, believing the two to be fundamentally different due to technological differences between the two continents. In particular he criticises the idea that African political systems were ever feudal, believing that such a concept - while applicable to Medieval Europe - was not applicable to pre-colonial Africa. Synopsis Chapter One: Feudalism in Africa? In the first chapter, entitled \\"Feudalism in Africa?\\", Goody explores the various definitions of the word \\"feudalism\\", and the manner in which it has been used to describe historical societies across both Europe and Asia, and also the manner in which social anthropologists have used it to refer to contemporary societies in Africa. He proceeds to discuss the various definitions of feudalism, and the way in which it has been used by both noted sociologists such as Max Weber and Karl Marx and also by historians like Marc Bloch. Goody then goes into greater detail regarding how the term has been used to refer to various African states, such as S.F. Nadel's use of the term to refer to Nupe society in his book A Black Byzantium (1942), and Maquet's use of the term to refer to the states of the Ruanda in his work The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda (1961), believing that the use of the term \\"feudal\\" - which has its basis in historical investigation into Medieval Europe - is simply unnecessary in both of these cases. Moving on to look at the \\"economic approach to feudalism\\", Goody challenges the view championed by \\"orthodox Marxists\\" such as I.I. Potemkin that in Africa, feudal states emerged because land was controlled by powerful land owners to whom the peasants were indebted, having to pay rent or proving services in return for being allowed to farm the land. Instead, Goody argues, in much of Africa, land was plentiful and \\"of little economic importance\\", and that such a feudal system of land ownership was simply not applicable. Goody proceeds to argue that while Africanists should not adopt the term \\"feudalism\\" from historians of Medieval Europe, there should be greater interdisciplinary work on Africa from historians, anthropologists and sociologists alike.Goody 1971. pp. 1-20. Chapter Two: Polity and the Means of Production Goody devotes the second chapter to an examination of the economic and technological aspects of pre- colonial African society, which he argues distinguish it from Medieval Europe specifically and Eurasia more generally. He begins with a brief discussion of the complex trade networks across Sub-Saharan Africa that existed prior to contact with Europeans, noting that it certain respects Africa had a monetary economy that was similar to that of Western Europe. However, according to Goody it was in its \\"means of production\\" rather than its \\"productive relations\\" that Africa's economy differed greatly from that of Eurasia; describing the continent as a \\"land of extensive agriculture\\", Goody noted that it had a relatively small population, plentiful land, and poor soils, and that notably the majority of Africa did not have access to the plough, an invention that only reached as far south as Ethiopia. Goody goes on to look at the nature of land in Africa, arguing that it was both more plentiful and less productive than that in Europe, leading Africans to move their farms around more often. He argues that the nature of land in Africa meant that the concept of serfdom, a prominent part of Medieval European society, never developed there. He rounds up the chapter with a discussion of the role that horses and cavalry played in the African military.Goody 1971. pp. 21-38. Chapter Three: Polity and the Means of Destruction Chapter Five: Conclusions Main Arguments \\"Feudalism\\" in Africa In Technology, Tradition and the State in Africa, Goody presents his argument that the label \\"feudal\\" is not applicable when referring to African states, considering it to be a word that is primarily used to describe the societies of Medieval Europe. Although Goody accepted the possible existence of \\"broad resemblances between the states of medieval Europe and those of pre-colonial Africa\\", in particular similarities between their \\"monarchical systems of government\\", he dismisses the use of such a \\"vague and all-embracing concept\\" as feudalism, believing that it ignores the multiple differences - primarily regarding \\"economics and technology\\" - which differentiate the two continents.Goody 1971. p. 21. Goody criticised those Africanists, such as S.F. Nadel and J.J. Maquet, who have used such a term to describe societies which they are studying, but praised M.G. Smith, L.A. Fallers and L.P. Mair, who \\"make at least as adequate an analysis [in their own studies] without introducing the concept at all.\\" According to Goody, \\"This second approach seems preferable as a procedure. It is simpler; it minimizes the inevitable Western bias; and it helps to avoid the assumption that because we find vassalage (for example), we necessarily find the other institutions associated with it in medieval Europe.\\"Goody 1971. pp. 8-9. He notes the trend for orthodox Marxist scholars in particular to claim that certain African states were feudal, arguing that because of their adherence to Marxism, they are \\"apt to fall back upon the idea of universal progression from tribalism to slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and finally socialism, each stage being characterized by a particular set of social institutions.\\"Goody 1971. p. 13. Although he notes that the theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels - the founders of Marxist thought - gave much to the study of how society's progress, Goody believed that this orthodox Marxist approach when dealing with African history \\"blocks advance\\" because it held to a \\"rigid attachment to particular European-based schema, whether this be derived from an explicit ideological commitment or from an inability to see beyond our own cultural tradition.\\"Goody 1971. pp. 13-14. Although he rejected the term \\"feudalism\\", which he considered to be rooted to the study of Medieval Europe, Goody did however believe that \\"Africanists certainly have something to learn from the studies of medieval historians\\", noting that \\"valuable material for comparative analysis\\" can be found on such topics as \\"inheritance, marriage, [and] descent\\".Goody 1971. p. 15. by msela Humans as the primary resource References Footnotes Bibliography Category:1971 non-fiction books Category:History books about Africa Category:Sociology books ","title":"Technology, Tradition, and the State in Africa"},{"id":"34377232","text":"Reggie Myles is a former professional American football player who played defensive back for four seasons for the Cincinnati BengalsReggie Myles NFL & AFL Football Statistics - Pro-Football-Reference.com Career Myles played cornerback for the Alabama Crimson Tide.\\"Former UA star Marvin Constant recounts journey in new book\\".

Portrait painters such as Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, and Jean-Baptiste Greuze were influenced by his work.Corinne Maisant, Alexis Grimou, Grove Art online  Life  Grimou was born in Argenteuil on 24 May 1678, the son of a carpenter. He is often confused with Jean Grimou (1674-1733), an unrelated Swiss genre painter whose father served with the Swiss Guards at Versailles.Cyrille Gabillot, p. 7 Grimou probably trained with Fran√ßois de Troy, from whom he learnt to use a warm palette and simple pictorial compositions. Sometime in the late 1690s, he was apprenticed to the painter and engraver, Bon Boullogne.Fran√ßois Marandet, Alexis Grimou (Argenteuil, 1678 - Paris, 1733), in: 'Dossier de presse Bon Boullogne (1649-1717) Un chef d‚Äô√©cole au Grand Si√®cle', 5 d√©cembre 2014 ‚Äì 5 mars 2015 Mus√©e Magnin, pp 20-21 The Marquis d‚ÄôArtaguiette as a drinker In 1704, he married Marie-Gabrielle Petit, a niece of Procopio Cut√≤, founder of the Caf√© Procope, a meeting place for artists and intellectuals. Economics may have been a motive in the union, as a notary document in the Archives Nationales reveals that she owned a considerable amount of property on Mauritius; along with slaves and \\"autres effets mobiliers et immobiliers\\" (other assets, moveable and immoveable). His brother-in-law, Matthias Fran√ßois Petit, was the intermediary who, between 1740 and 1753, was commissioned to purchase art for the collection of King Friedrich II of Prussia. That collection would come to include numerous works by Boullogne and his students. In 1705 he was approved (agr√©√©) by the Acad√©mie Royale. In order to be admitted as full member of the Acad√©mie he was required to paint two reception pieces, being portraits of the sculptor, , who died before it was completed, and the painter, Antoine Coypel, whose portrait was still unfinished by 1709. As a result of his failure to present the reception pieces, he was removed from the list of the Acad√©mie. He then joined the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc instead. The four ages of man In 1709, he may have visited the Netherlands to copy the Dutch Masters. This is inferred from a sudden darkening in his palette and some copies after Dutch masters which he made later. Known to have a dissolute lifestyle, he was always in debt and often paid his creditors with small works done on the spot. He was in his time referred to as a weird and strange person, in particular for his heavy drinking. According to contemporary anecdotes he always had five bottles of good burgundy with him while he painted.Alexis Grimou in: Mercure fran√ßais, January 1777, pp. 190=197 He also was said to have live a life of dissolution and poverty. In 1805, he was the subject of a vaudeville entitled \\"Grimou ou Le portrait a finir\\", which was staged by Maxime de Redon in Paris. From 1720 until his death, for unknown reasons, he became much more responsible and productive. He died in 1733, well known and appreciated for his work. Work Grimou painted mainly portraits at half-length which are intimate in nature and often include a genre aspect. Because of the influence of Dutch genre and portrait painting and the use of chiaroscuro techniques similar to those used by Rembrandt in his works, he was sometimes called the \\"French Rembrandt\\". Grimou developed the moralistic traits in Dutch genre portraits into budding representations of new concept of aesthetic taste. The artist projected a refined image in his self-portraits as a drinker and as Bacchus. His fantasy portraits which are close to Dutch tronies were influential on French portrait painters in the 18th century such as Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, Charles Eisen, Joseph Ducreux and Jean-Baptiste Greuze. He was so successful that he often created many variations on the same types such as that of the Young Male and Female Pilgrims which he painted as pendants.

The continued fecundity of the land was ensured by the annual performance of the sacred marriage ritual in which the king impersonated Dumuzi-Ama-u≈°umgal-ana and a priestess substituted for the part of Inanna. According to the ≈°ir-namursa·∏°a, the hymn composed describing it in 10 sections (Kiru·∏°u), this ceremony seems to have entailed the procession of: male prostitutes, wise women, drummers, priestesses and priests bloodletting with swords, to the accompaniment of music, followed by offerings and sacrifices for the goddess Inanna, or Ninegala. The ceremony reached its climax with the assembly of the ‚Äúblack-headed people‚Äù around a dais specially erected for the occasion when the king and priestess copulated to gawking onlookers and is described thus: There are 4 extant hymns addressed to this monarch, which, apart from the Sacred Marriage Hymn, include a praise poem to the king, a war song and a dedicatory prayer.

The war was the culmination of Siam's move towards independence following subjugation after the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1584‚Äì1593). The war ended with a victory by Siam, which seized the cities of Tavoy and Tenasserim, and laid siege to two major cities of the Toungoo Dynasty.Fernquest, pp. 51-52. Background Ten years of defensive wars were fought since King Naresuan declared independence in 1584. Siam gained its independence with the death of Mingyi Swa, Burmese Maha Uparaja at the hands of Naresuan in the single combat on elephants, during the Battle of Nong Sarai in 1592. Naresuan then moved forward with plans to capture Tavoy, Tenasserim, and assist the Mon people in their revolt against the Burmese. By 1595, according to Damrong Rajanubhab, \\"every Siamese was conscious that the Burmese had come and pillaged Siamese territory very many times\\" and they should \\"repay the Burmese in the same coin.\\"Rajanubhab, pp. 148‚Äì149. Mon State campaign Battle of Tavoy and Tenasserim (1593) Early in 1593 King Naresuan sent two different forces to the cities of Tavoy and Tenasserim. The first, under the command of Phraya Chakri troops to attack Tenasserim. The second unit, under the command of Phraya Phra Khlang to capture Tavoy.Wood, p. 144. Tavoy and Tenasserim were cities in Thailand during Sukhothai period, which the Burmese had captured. However, the Governor of Tenasserim learned of the Siamese plans and sent an urgent message to the King of Burma, Nanda Bayin, who ordered an army to oppose the Siamese.Rajanubhab, pp. 139-140. Tenasserim resisted the siege for 15 days while the siege of Tavoy lasted 20 days, before the Siamese were successful in capturing both cities. Both consented to be subject to Ayutthaya as in the past.Rajanubhab, p. 140. After Phraya Chakri captured Tenasserim, he captured Mergui and the boats in the port, which included 3 foreign sloops and 150 other boats. He then sent Phraya Thep Archun by sea to Tavoy so as to assist Phraya Phra Khlang if the Burmese advanced that far. Phraya Chakri then marched force to Tavoy by land, leaving a garrison of 10,000 at Tenasserim under Phraya Sri Sainarong. Simultaneously, Phraya Phra Khlang sent 100 boats and 5,000 men under Phraya Phichai Songkhram and Phraya Ram Khamhaeng to assist Phraya Chakri.Rajanubhab, p. 141. The Burmese had sent 200 boats and 10,000 men under the command of Samin Ubkong and Samin Phataba. This Burmese flotilla was caught in the middle of the Siamese flotillas advancing from the north and south. Many Burmese boats were sunk, some beached their boats and fled, while the rest sailed away. Saming Ubakong was killed and 500 men were captured.Rajanubhab, pp. 141-142. Capture of Martaban (1594) In 1594, the Burmese governor of Martaban, Phraya Lao, suspected the Burmese governor of Moulmein of being in league with the Siamese. At that time, the chief of the Mon people lived in Ayutthaya. The governor of Moulmein defied Phraya Lao, and sent an urgent request to Naresuan for help. Accordingly, Naresuan sent 3,000 men under Phraya Si Salai. As a result, the small Burmese garrison at Martaban abandoned the town. The King of Burma then ordered the viceroy of Toungoo to suppress the revolt, but that force was defeated by a combined Siamese and Mon army. The Mon provinces then became subject to Siam.Wood, pp. 148-149.Rajanubhab, pp. 145-147.Kohn, p. 443.Dupuy, p. 561. Invasion of mainland Burma (1595‚Äì1600) King Naresuan enters an abandoned Pegu in 1600, mural painting by Phraya Anusatchitrakon, Wat Suwandararam, Ayutthaya. First siege of Pegu (1595) After evicting the Burmese from the Tenasserim coastal region, Naresuan took the offensive feeling that he might have an opportunity to repay the Burmese for those times in the past when they pillaged Siam. As such, in January 1595, Naresuan led an army of 120,000 men from the Siamese capital and initiated an invasion of lower Burma.Rajanubhab, pp. 149-150. At Martaban, he added the Mon army as an auxiliary force. Upon reaching Pegu, Naresuan invested the city for a period of three months until he learned that the viceroys of Prome, Ava, and Toungoo were coming to the aid of the city. Give the overwhelming strength of the Burmese relief forces, Naresuan ended the siege and retreated back to Siam.Kala, pp. 95-96.Rajanubhab, p. 150. Second siege of Pegu (1599) Taking advantage of the political turmoil in Burma in 1597-1598, Naresuan once again decided to invade Burma. Power in Burma at that time was held by Nanda Bayin as King of the Toungoo Empire in Pegu. Among the dependent provinces in Burma, however, two powerful provinces, Toungoo and Arakan had rebelled against Nanda Bayin and expressed an interest in allying with Naresuan. As such, Naresuan assumingly felt more confident in his battleplan as he believed that he had allied himself with the viceroys of two powerful Burmese provinces .Wood, p. 152.Rajanubhab, pp. 151-156. As Naresuan's army prepared for their march to Pegu, however, the Viceroy of Toungoo, Minye Thihathu had second thoughts about his alliance with Naresuan. Minye Thihathu's ambition was to independently rule Burma, but he came to the realization that the conquest of Burma by Naresuan would mean his Toungoo province would become a vassal state of Siam. As such, Minye Thihathu plotted with the Viceroy of Arakan to conquest Pegu and depose Nanda Bayin ahead of Naresuan's army. In executing his plan, Minye Thihathu first created unrest and revolt among the Mon in the Tenasserim coastal region so as to delay Naresuan's invasion force. Next, Minye Thihathu and the Viceroy of Arakan convinced Nanda Bayin to relinquish the city of Pegu and relocate to Toungoo. Nanda Bayin agreed. Before the armies of Toungoo and Arakan departed Pegu they confiscated everything of value and set the city on fire. When Naresuan arrived in Pegu, he found only an empty and burning city.Rajanubhab, pp. 157-162. Siege of Toungoo (1600) Feeling angry and betrayed, Naresuan marched his forces to Toungoo. He knew that he would now have to defeat the Viceroy of Toungoo to claim power in Burma. Upon reaching Toungoo, Naresuan was joined by his allies including the Viceroy of Chiang Mai. Toungoo was invested, the moat was drained, and the city was assaulted. For two months, Naresuan attempted to capture Toungoo but in May of 1600, he gave up the fight due in large part due to a lack of provisions and returned to Siam.Dupuy, p. 561-562.Rajanubhab, pp. 162-166.Wood, p. 153. Aftermath In December of 1600, Natshinnaung, the eldest son of Minye Thihathu, killed Nanda Bayin and his son Minye Kyawswa while they were held captive in Toungoo bringing the First Toungoo Empire to an end. Meanwhile Nyaungyan Min, Nanda Bayin's brother who had stayed out of the turmoil involving the downfall of Pegu, quietly traveled to Ava with his partisans where he was recognized as the King of Ava. In 1603, after founding the Restored Toungoo Dynasty (Nyaungyan Dynasty) and withstanding challenges from the Viceroys of Toungoo and Prome, Nyaungyan Min crowned himself King of Burma.Wood, pp. 154-155.Rajanubhab, pp. 173-176. Siam was then free of a Burmese threat for four years until the King of Burma went on a campaign to subjugate the Shan States. When Nyaungyan Min advanced as far as Theinni, Naresuan raised an army to counter the threat to Siam. Naresuan advanced as far as the Fang District of Chiang Mai Province before falling ill and dying three days later. His brother Ekathotsarot became his successor as the King of Ayutthaya.Wood, pp. 154-155.Rajanubhab, pp. 176-177. According to Damrong Rajanubhab, \\"The kingdom of Siam at that period was widest in extent, opulent and redounding in glory.\\"Rajanubhab, p. 178.

The events of his life are preserved in his collected memoirs which were posthumously published as The Memoirs of George Elers. Early life Elers was the son of Lieutenant Paul George Elers and Elizabeth Debonnaire. He was the second of three children, with the eldest, Hungerford Richard, having preceded him by four years, and the younger, Edward, arriving four years after George himself. Elers was born at Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury Square and grew up living in Filkins Hall. As a child, Elers found he had a greater love for his aunt than his parents as he spent much of his time with the former. At the age of eight, he attended a school in Chiswick for a time until he fell ill with measles and the head, a Mr. Crawford, died of dropsy. Elers then became a half-boarder at a school in Soho Square, overseen by Dr. Barrow. At the age of fourteen, he developed an attachment with his cousin, Sophia, whom he spent a holiday with in Oxford, but she did not accept his advances and died of tuberculosis a short time after they parted. 12th Foot After Hungerford join the 43rd Regiment and Edward the navy, George was offered a lieutenancy in the 12 Foot. His commission was officially dated as the 12 April 1796. It was at this time that he first met Colonel Aston who \\"until his lamented death, ever treated me like a father\\". Soon enough, he was bound for Madras, India and not long after arrival did a spate of duelling brake out. Elers himself sent a challenge in response to an insult, but the offender sent him a satisfactory apology. Elers was moved to Tanjore at one point and then onto Vellum, a military station seven miles from the former. There he bore witness to the practice of suttee, much to his distress. He would later recall in his memoirs how he had many a chance to save the woman, but British policy of none-interference meant that he would have faced scandal had he tried to do so. Elers was still at Vellum when the old Raja was deposed in a bloodless revolution and replaced by the younger Suffrajeh. He then held a dinner, as was English custom, which Elers attended. Fearing that the Tipu Sultan would not accept new regulations that were being enforced, the 12th Foot was moved to a military base called Arnee. It was a short time after this that Colonel Aston was killed in a duel, much to the grievance of Elers. In May 1803, Elers was promoted to the rank of Captain, a commission which he felt should have come a year sooner. Throughout his time in the 12th Foot, Elers had a number of encounters with the famed Arthur Wellesley, so much so that his memoirs go into much detail to describe the many encounters between the two. It was sometime after his promotion to Captain that Elers dined once again with Wellesley and sat at his right hand.

As a result of him nearly drowning, his father Dirceu Madruga enrolled him in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) swimming school at Urca. He wanted his son to be able to play in the water safely, but soon Djan Madruga's instructor realized that the boy had a gift for swimming and recommended him for the Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas team. In the petiz category, he improved his technique in all styles, particularly in the backstroke, where he won his first medals. However, by 11 years, Djan had become discouraged as his opponents had out-grown him, and the following year was frustrated when he lost a poll for the South American Championship. Djan decided to change clubs, and joined the Fluminense FC where he began to work with a new swimming coach. Under the guidance of Denir de Freitas, Djan now loved to train and a period of impressive developments began, when they concentrated on distance events. International career 1973‚Äì75 In 1973, at the age of 15 he won a place in the Brazil squad that competed in the South American Championships, in Medellin, Colombia and the following year he competed in both the Canadian Championship and the U.S. Open, in California. The structure, scale and technical levels were a surprise to Djan Madruga, and he returned to Brazil determined to work hard to come back, and win. In 1975, while competing in the III Latin Swimming Cup, at Las Palmas, Spain, he did a time of 15:56.20, becoming the first South American to swim the 1500-metre freestyle under 16 minutes. He also qualified for participation in the Montreal Olympics. The same year he competed at the 1975 World Aquatics Championships in Cali. In the 1500-metre freestyle, he led the race up to 1000 meters, but then got tired and lost power, finishing 11th. Djan did a time of 16:30.77, far from his South American record of 15:56.02. The head of the Brazilian delegation, Rubens Dinard, said Djan had \\"too much responsibility for being written in only one test, and by the time of inscription he had. Moreover, the Brazilians had problems with the training conducted in winter, where the most cooled down, unable to train normally\\".O GLOBO News Archive - July 26, 1975, Morning, Sports, page 24 and July 27, 1975, Morning, Sports, page 36 Djan also competed at the 1975 Pan American Games, in Mexico City, where he won the bronze medal in the 400-metre, 1500-metre and 4√ó200-metre freestyle, finishing 4th in the 200-metre freestyle race. 1976 Summer Olympics At the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics, Djan Madruga competed in two finals, finishing in 4th place in the 400-metre freestyle with a time of 3:57.18 and in the 1500-metre freestyle where his time was 15:19.84. During the competition before the finals, he became the first Brazilian to beat an Olympic record in swimming, and the first in the World to swim the 400-metre freestyle in the Olympics, under 4 minutes, when he swum his 400-metre freestyle qualifying heats in 3:59.62. He was to break the South American record in the 400-metre freestyle twice; in the heats, and in the finals, while in the 1500-metre freestyle, Djan Madruga improved his best time by 36 seconds. As a result of his Olympics successes, Djan received several offers of scholarships to universities, in the United States of America. These represented a spectacular opportunity for a number of reasons. Firstly, Djan Madruga's father had been an engineer in Petrobras, before the Brazilian military coup of 1964. Afterwards he was forced to take a job as a taxi driver making it difficult to provide for his family and to purchase exercise equipment. He had to send his children to a public school. Secondly, the logistics of everyday life in Rio de Janeiro made it difficult for Djan to travel to his swimming club and college. Precious time was wasted which should have been spent training, studying or resting. Thirdly, Djan was training alone at Fluminense, but in the U.S., he would train with colleagues at the highest level, and with a leading coach who was at the forefront of knowledge in biomechanics and physiology. And finally, studying at an American university would open up many more possibilities for Djan's working life, after his athletics career. He chose Indiana University, studying physical education and training with Doc Counsilman, Mark Spitz's coach. 1977‚Äì80 Djan Madruga went to Mission Viejo in 1977, to train with the renowned U.S. swimming coach, Mark Schubert, where he shared the pool with the Olympic champion and record holder Brian Goodell. The following year he participated at the 1978 World Aquatics Championships in West Berlin, where he won 6th place in his heat of the 1500-metre freestyle race, but failed to finish in the final, also failing to qualify for the final of the 400-metre freestyle. These poor performances, were due to Djan contracting Pharyngitis at Bordeaux, France, just before the World Championships. On their way to Berlin, the Brazilian swim team made this stopover to train with the French national team, and to adapt to the new time zone. In 1979, he successfully competed in the Pan American Games in San Juan, where he won three silver medals; in the 400-metre, the 1500-metre, and the 4√ó200-metre freestyle. He also won three bronze medals; in the 200-metre freestyle, the 200-metre backstroke, and the 4√ó100-metre freestyle. He was beaten in the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle races, by the world record holder Brian Goodell. However, in both the 200-metre freestyle and in the relays, he broke the South American records. He also competed at the 1979 Summer Universiade, in Mexico City, where he won the gold medal in the 400-metre individual medley, and the silver medal in the 200-metre backstroke. At the U.S. Open in April 1980 at Austin, Texas, Djan Madruga won the 800-metre freestyle and the 400-metre individual medley races, in the process achieving a goal he had set in Montreal 1976, by defeating the Olympic champion Brian Goodell. Djan broke the South American record in the 400-metre freestyle (3:53.91), in the 800-metre freestyle (7:59.85 the second best of all time), and in the 400-metre individual medley (4:25.30). In recognition of his achievements his picture appeared in Swimming World, the highly influential magazine. 1980 Summer Olympics Djan Madruga competed in the 1980 Summer Olympics, in Moscow, where he won the bronze medal in the men's 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay event, with Jorge Fernandes, Cyro Delgado, and Marcus Mattioli in a time of 7:29.30. He qualified for the 400-metre freestyle final finishing 4th (3:54.15), the 400-metre individual medley finishing 5th (4:26.81), but failed to qualify for the 1500-metre freestyle final. The 30-hour flight from Los Angeles to Moscow, left just five days to acclimatize and adjust to the new time zone, before the swimming competition began. Just before his first race the 1500-metre freestyle, Djan accidentally cut his foot. He failed to qualify, swimming 34 seconds worse than his time at the U.S. Open. It was a huge blow and a shock to his Brazilian fans. The 4x200-metre freestyle relay was next, but the team's 200-metre results did not indicate much chance of winning a medal. But Jorge Fernandes, Cyro Delgado and Marcus Mattioli all swam two seconds faster than they had in their individual events, and Djan finished like a champion, holding opponents and leading the team to Olympic podium, to win the bronze medal. They had swam 7:29.30, three seconds faster than the heats, and nine seconds faster than the previous South American record, set at the Pan American Games in San Juan. Their Moscow record stood for 12 years. Djan Madruga went on to qualify for the 400-metre freestyle final with the 3rd best time, narrowly coming 4th (3:54.15), 20 hundredths behind third placed. Swimming in lane 1 in the 400-metre individual medley; he was first at the end of the backstroke, lost ground in the breaststroke, and held on in the crawl to finish in 5th place (4:26.81). 1981‚Äì83 At the 1981 Summer Universiade, held in Bucharest, Djan Madruga won the silver medal in both the 400-metre freestyle and the 200-metre backstroke. He also won the bronze medal in the 200-metre freestyle. The 3 Brazilians relays (4√ó100-metre freestyle, 4√ó200-metre freestyle, 4√ó100-metre medley) won bronze too; Djan participated in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle and 4√ó200-metre freestyle. Djan Madruga competed at the 1982 World Aquatics Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador where he finished 7th in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle final, 10th in the 200-metre backstroke, and 12th in the 400-metre freestyle. Unfortunately he had competed while suffering from a serious health problem. Djan had contracted typhoid. Ricardo Prado was critical of their accommodation and the food. \\"The hotel we stayed at was not well attended. It was directly across [from] the Guayaquil bus station. I managed to reach the final of the 200-metre individual medley, but I was weak because food there was terrible, and finished the race in eighth place.\\" Prado returned home with gold in the neck and a big mycosis in the belly. Djan was well enough to compete at the 1983 Pan American Games, in Caracas, Venezuela where he won silver in both the 4√ó100-metre freestyle and the 4√ó200-metre freestyle events. 1984 Summer Olympics Djan Madruga attended his third Olympic Games, the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles where he finished 9th in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle, 10th in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle, and 12th in the 200-meter backstroke events. Marks and records Djan Madruga was one of the greatest swimmers in the history of Brazil. He was an early prodigy; at 15 years of age competing in the South American Championships and the U. S. Open in 1973 and 1974, he began his domination of long distance events on the South American continent. In August 1974, he became the South American record holder in the 400-metre, 800-metre and 1500-metre freestyle during competition in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In April 1975 he broke the 16 minutes barrier in the 1500-metre freestyle at Copa America in Las Palmas. At 16 he was the South American record holder of the 200-metre, the 400-metre, the 800-metre and the 1500-metre freestyle events. In 1979 Djan Magruga became the one and only Brazilian swimmer to simultaneously hold the records in all freestyle distances from 100- to 1500-metre. He also held the South American records in the 200-metre backstroke, the 200-metre individual medley, and the 400-metre individual medley, as well as holding the Brazilian record in the 200-metre butterfly. Djan Madruga was the first South American to swim the 1500-metre freestyle event in under 16 minutes (1975), the 800-metre freestyle event in under 8 minutes (1980) and the 400-metre freestyle event in under 4 minutes (1976). He was first Brazilian to beat an Olympic record in swimming, with a time of 3:59.62 during qualifying heats in the 400-metre freestyle, in Montreal 1976. In April 1980, while training with the USA team, he broke the South American record for the 800-metre freestyle with a time of 7:59.85, the second swimmer in history to break the 8 minute the barrier, after Vladimir Salnikov, the world record holder. This record stood for 29 years. It was broken in 2009 by Luiz Arapiraca wearing a new technology super-suit manufactured by Jaked in Italy. As a result, Djan Madruga offered a reward of $5,000.00 to anyone who could beat this record without wearing a super-suit. Djan Madruga also held the South American record for the 1500-metre freestyle for 19 years from 1976, until Luiz Lima, broke it in 1995, and the South American record for the 400-metre freestyle for 17 years, from April 1980 until it was equaled by Luiz Lima in 1997. He broke seven times the South American record in the 400-metre freestyle. After professional swimming Between 1983 and 1987 Djan Madruga was a professional triathlete. During this time he won the following titles: : two times Brazilian middle distance champion, : runner-up at the U.S. in the Olympic distance, : champion of the International Triathlon, Sendai, Japan. He competed in the Ironman Hawaii in 1984, where he broke the record of swimming stage (3.8 km), finishing 126th from 1500 competitors. In 1990 he returned to swim in the Master category, winning 12 world titles, and breaking three world records. For two years he was the National Secretary of Sports of the Federal government of Brazil with special responsibility for the Bolsa-Atleta program. He also participated in the campaign to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to Rio de Janeiro, when he assisted in planning and in presentations made to the International Olympic Committee. Djan Madruga owns a swimming academy in Rio de Janeiro built in the 1990s in the Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhood.

William de Burgh (c.1160‚Äì1205/06) settled in Ireland (1185) founding the Irish line of the family which included the Lords of Connaught, Earls of Ulster and Earls of Clanricarde. After the fourteenth century, the Irish line assumed the name Burke (sometimes, but only rarely, spelled \\"Burk\\"). William's younger brother, Hubert de Burgh, was Earl of Kent and Justiciar of England.C. A. Empey, ‚ÄòBurgh, William de (d. 1206)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 In England, the name was changed again to 'Burgh' some time after the Civil War in the seventeenth century (the 'de' having been removed to hide the family's connection to the nobility and Catholicism) but was returned to 'de Burgh' in the late nineteenth century. The de Burgh family include many prominent figures during The Middle Ages, The Crusades, The British Empire, World War One and World War Two. Coat of arms The de Burgh coat of arms is blazoned as Or, a cross gules (a red cross on a gold shield). Legend says that the red cross originated with the First Crusade: one story is that a de Burgh recovered a gold shield from a slain Saracen and marked a red cross on it with his own blood. Another story states that Richard I dipped his finger in the blood of a slain Saracen king, put a red cross on the gold shield of de Burgh, and said \\"for your bravery this will be your crest\\". The crest, a seated and chained 'mountain cat', is said to represent liberty and courage and is believed to be awarded for a de Burgh's courage and skill in battle during the Crusades. The motto has varied between A cruce Salus (Latin: 'salvation from the cross'), which would have originated in the Crusades, and ung roy, ung foy, ung loy (archaic French: 'one king, one faith, one law'), originating when the family moved to Ireland.

It is approx. 200 m (700 ft) high, and located 100 km (62 mi) offshore of Oregon.Johnson, J.E.; Goldfinger, C.; Tr√©hu, A.M.; Bangs, N.L.B.; Torres, M.E.; and Chevallier, J. \\"North-south variability in the history of deformation and fluid venting across Hydrate Ridge, Cascadia margin.\\" In Tr√©hu, A.M.; Bohrmann, G.; Torres, M.E.; and Colwell, F.S. (Eds.). Proc. ODP, Sci. Results, 204 (2006): College Station, TX (Ocean Drilling Program), 1‚Äì16. doi:10.2973/odp.proc.sr.204.125.2006. At hydrate formations, methane is trapped in crystallized water structures. Such methane transforms into the gaseous phase and seeps into the ocean at this site, which has been a popular location of study since its discovery in 1986. Hydrate Ridge also supports a methane-driven benthic community. Significance Hydrate Ridge and other hydrate formations store methane for extended periods of time. This methane can be released back into the ocean as a result of underwater seismic activity or other sudden movements. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and the study of hydrate formations can lead to information about their influences on the global carbon cycle and carbon sequestration.Archer, D. \\"Methane hydrate stability and anthropogenic climate change.\\" Biogeosciences Discussions, European Geosciences Union. 4.2 (2007): 993-1057. Web. Because it is one of the most easily accessible hydrate formations in the ocean, and because the global effects of oceanic methane release are still poorly understood, Hydrate Ridge has received significant scientific attention since its discovery. The presence of venting sites and a benthic community there, along with the ridge's association with the Cascadia Subduction Zone (as an accretionary formation), has made it a location at which gas hydrate and subduction zone characteristics are widely studied. Another motivation to study the ridge has been to uncover methane seeps as a potential source of fossil fuels.Milkov, A.V.; and Sassen, R. \\"Economic geology of offshore gas hydrate accumulations and provinces.\\" Marine and Petroleum Geology. 19.1 (2002): 1-11. Web. Research may reveal the economical value of these structures. History of observations The importance of Hydrate Ridge was recognized in 1986, with the discovery of low-temperature venting sites and a methane-driven biological community there.Kulm, L.D.; Suess, E.; Moore, J.C.; Carson, B.; Lewis, B.T.; Ritger, S.D.; Kadko, D.C.; Thornburg, T.M.; Embley, R.W.; Rugh, W.D.; Massoth, G.J.; Langseth, M.G.; Cochrane, G.R.; and Scamman, R.L. \\"Oregon subduction zone: venting, fauna, and carbonates.\\" Science, 231 (1986): 561‚Äì566. Web. Since then, information has been collected on bubble emission frequencies, plume heights, etc. at the ridge, particularly via the use of ROVs, to further our scientific understanding of it.Denny, Alden R.; Solomon, Evan A.; Kelley, Deborah S.; and Philip, Brendan T. \\"Time-Series Measurements of Bubble Plume Variability and Water Column Methane Distribution above Southern Hydrate Ridge, Oregon.\\" Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems G¬≥. 17.3 (2016): 1182-196. Web. A 2001 bubble plume study suggested that the free gas zone (see \\"Methane Venting\\") under surface sediments at Hydrate Ridge is thick. If this is the case, and if other active hydrate formations share this characteristic, more methane may be released (and influence climate change) than was anticipated prior to the study, according to researchers.Trehu, Anne M.; and Flueh, Ernst R. \\"Estimating the Thickness of the Free Gas Zone beneath Hydrate Ridge, Oregon Continental Margin, from Seismic Velocities and Attenuation.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth. 106.B2 (2001): 2035-045. Web. A 2016 study indicated that gas fluxes at Hydrate Ridge are affected more by diurnal patterns than by seasonal ones. The impacts of this require further study. Subsurface structure In 1996, the Ocean Drilling Program deployed ocean bottom hydrophones and ocean bottom seismometers around Hydrate Ridge. The data from these tools was analyzed in a 2001 study, in which the velocities of refracted seismic waves helped scientists estimate the subsurface contents of the site (e.g. the relative thickness of its free gas zone). Methane venting Methane is being released at Hydrate Ridge, particularly through cold seeps. The Southern Hydrate Ridge (SHR) is believed to be an especially active part of the formation. However, a 2016 study has asserted that the Summit of the SHR is not the sole structure involved in subseafloor gas and fluid transport. Smaller fluxes occur elsewhere. The free gas zone is a zone of freed methane in a hydrate formation, beneath the hydrate stability zone. It can influence the rate of methane output at a ridge or ridge region. A large free gas zone makes more methane available to be released into the open ocean, and, thus, can likely be more influential on climate change than a smaller one. Biology Hydrate Ridge houses several species of methane-utilizing benthic organisms, including Calyptogena clams and microbial mats. A 2001 study proposed that the microbial mats at this site correlate to heavy outflow at cold seeps. It claimed, too, that Calyptogena function with the help of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (sulfide is a product of methane oxidation).Tryon, Michael D.; and Brown, Kevin M. \\"Complex Flow Patterns through Hydrate Ridge and Their Impact on Seep Biota.\\" Geophysical Research Letters. 28.14 (2001): 2863-866. Web. The aforesaid aligns with a 1986 study, which stated that several large organisms at Hydrate Ridge work symbiotically with microorganisms to produce energy from methane. Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array Part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array has been assembled on the Southern Hydrate Ridge. The cabled array collects and sends data on shore in real time. As a result, it enables scientists to make more, continuous observations of seasonal effects on vent activity, and of links between changes in methane flux and biochemical cycles at this specific location.

Biography Early life Nyai Ahmad Dahlan was born Siti Walidah in Kauman, Yogyakarta, in 1872 to Kyai Haji Muhammad Fadli, an ulama (Muslim religious leader) and member of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta; the area housed many religious figures from the palace. She was homeschooled in various aspects of Islam, including Arabic and the Qur'an; she read the Qur'an in the Jawi script. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan married her cousin, Ahmad Dahlan. As he was busy developing the Islamic group Muhammadiyah at the time, she followed him in his travels. However, as some of Ahmad Dahlan's reformationist views on Islam were considered radical, the couple at times received threats; for example, before a scheduled trip to Banyuwangi in East Java they received death threats from conservatives there. Sopo Tresno and Aisyiyah In 1914 she established the prayer group Sopo Tresno (literally Who Loves); she and her husband took turns leading the group in reading the Qur'an and discussing its meaning. Soon she began focusing on passages in the Qur'an that dealt with women's issues. By teaching reading and writing through the group, the couple slowed the Christianization of Java through schools sponsored by the colonial government. With her husband and several other Muhammadiyah leaders, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan discussed the formalization of Sopo Tresno as a women's group. Rejecting the first proposal, Fatimah, they decided on the name Aisyiyah, derived from Muhammad's wife Aisha. The new group was formalized on 22 April 1917, with Nyai Ahmad Dahlan as its head. Five years later the organization became a part of Muhammadiyah. Through Aisyiyah, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan founded girls' schools and dormitories, as well as literacy and Islamic education programs for women; she also preached against forced marriage. She would also visit branches throughout Java. In contrast to the traditionally patriarchal Javanese society, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan argued that women were meant to be their husbands' partners. Aisyayah's schools were influenced by Ahmad Dahlan's educational ideology of the Four Tenets (): education at home, education at school, education in society, and education at places of worship. Leadership and later life After Ahmad Dahlan's death in 1923, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan continued to be active in Muhammadiyah and Aisyiyah. In 1926, she chaired the fifteenth Muhammadiyah Congress in Surabaya; she was the first woman to chair such a conference. As a result of widespread media coverage in newspapers such as Pewarta Surabaya and Sin Tit Po, more influential women joined Aisyiyah, while branches opened on other islands in the archipelago. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan continued to lead Aisyiyah until 1934. During the Japanese occupation, with Aisyiyah banned from working with women by the Order of the Japanese Military in Java and Madura of 10 September 1943, she worked at schools and struggled to keep the students from being forced to worship the sun and sing Japanese songs. During the Indonesian National Revolution, she ran soup kitchens out of her home for soldiers and promoted military service amongst her former students. She also participated in discussions about the war with General Sudirman and President Sukarno. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan died at 1 p.m. local time (UTC+7) on 31 May 1946 and was buried behind the Great Mosque of Kauman in Yogyakarta four hours later. State Secretary Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo and Minister of Religion Rasyidi represented the government at her funeral. Legacy On 10 November 1971, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan was declared a National Heroine of Indonesia by President Suharto with Presidential Decree Number 42/TK of 1971; Ahmad Dahlan had been declared a National Hero ten years earlier. The award was accepted by her granddaughter, M Wardan. She has been compared to women's rights advocate Kartini and guerrillas Cut Nyak Dhien and Cut Nyak Meutia. In Hanung Bramantyo's 2010 film Sang Pencerah (The Englightener), Nyai Ahmad Dahlan was played by Zaskia Adya Mecca; Ahmad Dahlan was played by Lukman Sardi. Personal life Nyai Ahmad Dahlan had six children with Ahmad Dahlan.

In a career that lasted from April 1846 to 1849 he competed twelve times and won ten races, including one walk-over. In the summer of 1846 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning The Derby. After a disappointing year in 1847 he returned to form as a five-year-old and was undefeated in his last seven races. He was retired after winning his only race as a six-year-old and went on to stand as a stallion in England and France. Background J.P. Neale Pyrrhus The First was a \\"golden\\" chestnut horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs, who stood 15.3 hands high. He was bred at Delapre Abbey in Northamptonshire by Colonel Bouverie. Pyrrhus The First was from one of the first crop of foals sired by Epirus, a winner of twelve races, out of Fortress, an unraced mare. According to one account, Pyrrhus The First was sent to the Doncaster sales where was bought for 300 guineas by the trainer John Day, in a deal which also included his dam, Fortress. Day immediately sold a half share in the colt to his patron John Gully a former prize fighter who later became a Member of Parliament: Day sold the other half share to Gully in 1845. William Day, the trainer's son, writing some years later, gave a different account. According to William, his father bought the foal and mare direct from Bouverie for 250 guineas, and Gully was never more than the part-owner of the horse. John Day trained the colt at his stable at Danebury in Hampshire. Racing career 1846: three- year-old season Early in 1846, Pyrrhus The First was offered for sale to a Mr Clifton for ¬£500, but Clifton instead purchased his stable companion, Old England. The colt was unraced as a two-year-old and had leg problems that made him difficult to train, leading one report in the Illustrated London News to claim that he took \\"more walking exercise than any Derby winner on record\\". He was not seriously tested until April when he impressed Day in a trial gallop. He was then sent to the Newmarket Spring Meeting, where he won the Newmarket Stakes, beating Iago by half a length. Pyrrhus The First then produced another impressive training gallop to establish himself as a leading contender for the Derby. At Epsom on 27 May, Pyrrhus The First started second favourite for the Derby at odds of 8/1 in a field of twenty-seven runners. Fancy Boy was made 5/1 favourite, while the 2000 Guineas winner, Sir Tatton Sykes started at 10/1. Ridden by his trainer's uncle, the forty-four-year-old Sam Day, Pyrrhus The First was not among the early front-runners, but had moved up to join the leading group on the turn into the straight. Sir Tatton Sykes, who had made up a great deal of ground after being left behind at the start, was sent into the lead by his jockey Bill Scott a furlong from the finish, but Day produced his colt with a strong run in the stretch to overtake the Guineas winner in the last strides and win by a neck, with Brocardo third. Later reports claim that Scott had missed the start because he was drunk and was in no condition to ride a finish, making Sir Tatton Sykes an unlucky loser. The race was the first Derby to be officially timed, with Pyrrhus The First covering the one and a half mile distance in 2:55.0. The result of the race, together with the Classical origins of the winner's name, inspired a poem published in Bentley's Miscellany, ending with the stanza: :\\"Aloft on circling wing, the feathered heralds spring, ::O'er many a town and hamlet, to waft the winner's fame, :How Mr Gully takes as his own the Derby stakes, ::And Pyrrhus is the First in fact as well as name.\\" Pyrrhus The First was withdrawn from the Welcome Stakes at Ascot and did not appear in another competitive race as a three-year-old. He walked over in the Foal Stakes at Winchester Racecourse when no other horses opposed him and in October, his owners paid a forfeit of ¬£100 when he failed to appear for a scheduled match race at level weights against a Grimston, a four-year-old colt who had won the Gold Vase. 1847: four-year-old season Pyrrhus The First was beaten in his only race as a four-year-old, losing a match race at Newmarket in April against The Traverser, one of the colts he had beaten in the Derby. At Newmarket in October he failed to appear for a match race against a three-year-old filly named Bridle. 1848: five-year-old season As a five-year-old, Pyrrhus The First ran in the ownership of a Mr Harrison, although he remained at Day's stable. He was beaten on his debut, when he finished second to Inheritress in the Cheshire Stakes at Chester, but won his remaining six races. He won the Cup at the Bibury Club meeting and then beat the Duke of Richmond's Red Hart (the previous season's leading money winner) by a head in a one-mile Sweepstakes at Goodwood on 29 July. Pyrrhus The First beat Red Hart again in a race for a Queen's Plate at Brighton on 2 August, conceding seven pounds and winning by four lengths. On 16 August he appeared at Egham Racecourse, where he beat Fugleman by four lengths at weight-for-age in another Queen's Plate. At Canterbury on 22 August, he ran a dead-heat with the filly Alpheia in a two-mile Queen's Plate, with The Oaks winner Miami in third, and then won the run-off \\"in a canter\\". Pyrrhus The First went on to win a further Queen's Plate at Lewes Racecourse, beating Miami again. 1849: six-year-old season On his only appearance as a six- year-old, Pyrrhus The First won the Lansdowne Trial Stakes at the Somerset County Meeting and was then retired to stud. Stud career Pyrrhus The First retired to Harrison's stud at Easby Abbey in Yorkshire, where he stood at a fee of 10 guineas and was advertised as \\"the best untried stallion of the present day\\". In 1851 he was moved to stand at Willesden Paddocks where he replaced The Libel. His most successful achievement as a stallion was to sire Virago who won the 1000 Guineas in 1854 and went on to defeat colts and older horses in the Goodwood Cup, Doncaster Cup, City and Suburban Handicap and Great Metropolitan Handicap. Pyrrhus The First was later sold and exported to stand as a stallion in France, where in 1859, he was reported to be \\"in great favour\\" and covering at a fee of ¬£20.

It is located in the wood between Marklowice and Jankowice. The history of Studzienka Jankowicka refers to historical events which are based on the folk tales concerning the Hussite wars and the history of Father Valentine killed by the Hussites in 1433. History In 1433, penetrating (The Upper) Silesia, the Hussites reached Rybnik. They were slaughtering local people, plundering houses and burning everything that was within their sight, especially the symbols of Christianity. In those terrible times, a dying woman wanted the priest to come with the sacramental ministry. Her husband, ignoring the danger, that is, the prowling Hussites, decided to comply with her request. Ultimately, he managed to reach the church and there, he asked the rector for the sacramental ministry for his dying wife. Father Valentine, as a very saintly person, was sent to the woman‚Äôs house. He was a man of great faith, that is why he did not hide with his pious intentions. Therefore, the group of Hussites noticed him going with The Holy Sacrament. They were only waiting for an opportunity to profane the symbol of Christianity. Father Valentine noticed the Hussites dashing towards him but he was not afraid of losing his life, he only wanted to protect the Holy Sacrament from insulting. He found an oak and therein a big, spacious hollow. On the spur of the moment, he put there The Sacred Host. Delighted with his act of heroism, Father Valentine started to worry about his life, but it was already too late. The Hussites caught up with him and inflicted truly martyr‚Äôs death. The man was observing this incident from the distance, and as soon as the Hussites went away, he buried the body of the heroic priest. After some time, when the Hussites left Silesia, people began to emerge from their hiding places. The rumour about the heroic priest spread among neighbouring villages and in the place where he was buried, the source of crystal clear water (which later proved to be healing water) ejaculated. Since then, pilgrimages of believers began to head there. According to the folk tales, there were thousands of people who were healed thanks to this water. Years passed, but nobody knew where Father Valentine had hidden The Holy Sacrament. Until one day, some shepherds noticed the brightness over the oak. They informed about this the neighbouring people and priests, and The Sacred Host was found. People associated this fact with the death of Father Valentine. The rector of that time put the cross there to commemorate those events. Since then, the wood, in which the cross and the source of healing water is settled, has been a place of numerous pilgrimages. Architecture of Studzienka Jankowicka and the chronological outline 1433 ‚Äì Father Valentine was murdered ‚Äì In the place of his tomb, the source of crystal clear water ejaculated ‚Äì the commemorative cross was built 1895 ‚Äì the chapel in the honour of The Blessed Virgin Mary was built (often compared to the sanctuary in Lourdes) ‚Äì the then priest of Jankowice parish ‚Äì Edward Bolik, made a promise that if he recovers from serious illness, he will build a chapel in Studzienka The Chapel consists of the altar, above it, there is the cross and the three-metre-high statue of The Blessed Virgin Mary called by people of Jankowice ‚Äì The Holy Virgin from Studzienka, and the statue of Bernadette (the girl, who saw The Blessed Virgin in Lourdes) Similarities to the sanctuary in Lourdes: \\\\- statues of The Blessed Virgin Mary and Bernadette \\\\- the healing water In 1932-1935 the grotto was built, the chapel was enlarged and two side-chapels were added. In the main chapel, the sculpture of The Blessed Virgin and the sculpture of kneeling Bernadette are settled. In the left-side chapel, we can see the statue of Father Valentine ‚Äì the tomb of the priest, and the right-side chapel is devoted to another version of The Blessed Virgin surrounded by angels. The architecture of Studzienka is also enriched by two grottos: one of the Saint Barbara ‚Äì patron of miners and the other - the so-called grotto of the unemployed. Within the sanctuary, the Stations of the Cross, the wooden cross, and benches for pilgrims can be found. Until 1949 and after 1956 Studzienka was the favourite place for Saturday-Sunday picnics After 1957 ‚Äì religious ceremonies took place in Studzienka After 2001 ‚Äì Studzienka was renovated The hermit Before The Second World War, the hermit ‚Äì Izydor Mirek, lived in Studzienka (precisely, in one of its grottos). In the public opinion, he was an extremely pious and kind man. He was tiding up there and leading the prayers during pilgrimages. He donated a bell from money he received from pilgrims. The war period and the communist era did not encourage the cultivation of the sanctuary. Today the history of Studzienka Jankowicka and the place itself fall into oblivion. More often we can meet there people looking for peace and quite than pilgrims.  See also  * Jankowice Rybnickie  Bibliography  1\\\\.

It triggered controversy and hype with its portrayal of the lives of the privileged in Korean society, exploring themes of sex and money, greed and ambition. A decadent and sensational film that presents biting commentary on the rich and famous, it is Im Sang-soo's seventh film. Plot In a luxurious house outside Seoul lives one of the country's richest families: company president Yoon, his wife Baek Geum-ok, their divorced daughter Nami, and son Chul. Yoon is company president but the reins of power are held by his wife Geum-ok, whose aged father was once a powerful businessman, and whom Yoon married for her money and influence. Yoon's private secretary is Joo Young-jak, from humble origins. His current job is making sure a U.S. businessman, Robert Altman, is kept happy with hookers, as part of a major business deal that could prove crucial to the family's fortunes. When Geum-ok sees Yoon having an affair with their Filipina maid, Eva, on her hidden CCTV, she beds Young-jak in revenge. When Chul is arrested for organizing a slush fund for Altman, Geum-ok decides to further punish her husband for his \\"mistake\\" in bringing the family's name into public disrepute, by having Eva killed. At the same time, Nami and Young-jak, start an affair. Yoon commits suicide over Eva's death (and takes the blame for his son's activities). After his funeral, Young-jak quits the family, glad to be rid of their influences. He accompanies Eva's coffin to the Philippines, where he is joined on the plane by Nami.

You can say that it‚Äôs the story of the children of The Housemaid who've grown up.\\" It is his exploration of the world outside the household portrayed in that movie ‚Äì \\"What Hoon does outside the home, what kind of parents he has, an expansion of the scope of The Housemaid.\\" At the end of The Housemaid, a young girl Nami is in shock at witnessing the suicide of her nanny Eun-yi. Fully grown up as a divorc√©e with a child of her own, Nami is now a main character in this film.Korean Films at Berlinale 2012 She is the only member of the family with a moral sense. If The Housemaid asserted through a self-immolating woman the impossibility of overturning the classes, The Taste of Money asks the question of whether a beautiful and happy life really might be impossible in a dark society. The conclusion seems to be that money makes it impossible live a happy life, and makes one troubled and abusive even to those nearest. Release Cannes The film was invited to screen in competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, where it received the lowest mark out of the 22 works vying for the Palme d'Or according to Screen International, which aggregates reviews of the most respected critics worldwide. Before and after the closing ceremony, director Im Sang-soo said to various Korean media that his failure to win was a personal \\"tragedy\\" and his participation a mistake because he was telling a \\"very Korean story\\" that foreigners can't understand. Critical reception When released in the United States, The Taste of Money received mixed to negative reviews; it currently holds a 22% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 16 September 2013 Metacritic, which uses a \\"normalized\\" scale to rate films, the film has a 57/100 rating, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Retrieved 16 September 2013 A positive review comes from A.O. Scott of The New York Times, who blurbs: \\"Even as The Taste of Money swerves toward a frantic climax and a sentimental denouement, it remains intriguing. It feeds an insatiable curiosity about how the other half - or, in current parlance, the 1 percent - lives, and what it shows us is gorgeous, grotesque and disconcertingly human.\\" Box office Since its theatrical release on 17 May 2012, the film has grossed over 7.9 billion Korean won (around 6.8 million U.S. dollars), occupying 33% of the domestic box office sales as of 29 May, according to the Korea Box Office Information System (KOBIS).

The Society formally purchased the land in 1875. The Home of Peace Cemetery Association now maintains the grounds. It is the oldest active cemetery in Helena and the oldest active European ethno-religious cemetery in Montana. There are three major sections of land owned by the Association: the cemetery, undeveloped adjacent land, and land leased to the Helena School District since 1975. The portion leased by the school district is a practice football field for Capital High School and contains unmarked graves from the earliest days of the cemetery. The original wrought iron fence erected in 1867 still stands except on the north side and is in disrepair in places. A granite gateway erected in 1910 is at the main entrance. The east gate also has granite markers. There is a water tower, pump house, and landscaping shed. Twelve broken tombstones lie at the base of the water tower. The northwest corner has remained undeveloped and in its natural wild state. In 1910 cottonwood trees were planted along the driveway. Home of Peace cemetery, Capital High School is the brick building visible in background Jewish immigrants arrived in Helena as early as 1864. Most of the Jewish immigrants to Helena had come from Germany or Prussia in the wake of the Montana Gold Rush. Most of them practiced Reform Judaism and worked as merchants, providing goods and services to the miners. As of November 2005, there are 204 tombstones and over 240 recorded burials in the cemetery. There are no markers remaining from the 1860s. The oldest remaining marker is that of Hattie Jacobs who died in 1873. Most markers are made from local sandstone or granite, a few of imported marble. Markers are found both lying down and standing upright. As the Jewish population of Helena peaked in 1900 with 138 adults, burials in the cemetery are no longer as frequent as they once were. When the cemetery first opened in 1867 it was well outside the city limits at that time. The first Jew known to have died in Helena was Emanuel Blum, who died on May 5, 1865. He was buried in the City Cemetery because there was no Hebrew Cemetery at the time. Blum also became the first burial in the Home of Peace cemetery as the HBS voted on December 5, 1867 to have Blum's body moved there. In 1916, in response to a request to allow non-Jewish spouses and their unmarried children to be buried in the cemetery, the Board also approved non- Jewish burials even if there was no connection to someone who was Jewish. Several of the Jews buried in the cemetery were Freemasons. In many cases, the cemetery plots were arranged by family groups. The Jewish population of Helena declined steadily over the years and there are now more Jewish people buried in this cemetery than there are living in Helena.

Constructed in the 1840s for workers in a company town, it was home to a congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church until the community faltered following the company's closure. Situated at the southern end of the company town, it remains prominent because of its architecture, and it has been named a historic site. History In 1838, Caleb Howard and Hosea Williams bought a watermill on the Olentangy River near Delaware, with the goal of converting the property into industrial use as a pair of paper mills. Desirous of avoiding the poverty and slums so closely associated with burgeoning industry in the United Kingdom, the owners established a mill village with amenities to assist the workers. The first new buildings in the settlement were constructed by Howard and Williams, for it was to be a company town; they retained the tavern that was already on the property, and their contractors residences and a church for the workers. Continued growth mandated a more formal existence for the community, so it was platted in 1850 and given the name \\"Stratford\\" in honor of the Bard's hometown.Davies, Sandra. '. National Park Service, 1991-05-07. The company's fortunes fell soon after the end of the Civil War; the 1870s saw production falter, as the mills were operating for just nine months per year in 1880, and by 1890 one was closed entirely. The company closed in 1896, and five years later the mills were sold to a local railroad company. Stratford Methodist Church was built in 1842 with money from Hosea Williams and Hiram Andrews, who had replaced Caleb Howard in the company partnership; it was constructed on land given by one of its charter members, Forrest Meeker, who had sold to Williams and Howard most of the land needed for the mill village. Organized circa 1845, the congregation was attached to St. Paul's Methodist Church in Delaware during the latter half of the Civil War.History of Delaware County and Ohio. Chicago: O.L. Baskin, 1880, 404. Being financially dependent on the paper mill, the congregation closed in 1896 following the closure of the mills. Architecture Stratford Methodist Church is built primarily of stone; the roof is metal, and various elements are made of asphalt and wood, but the dominating appearance is stone ‚Äî limestone was used for the foundation, and the walls are composed of a mix of limestone and sandstone. The gabled facade is divided into three bays, with windows in the first-story side bays and in the second-story central bay. A short tower once sat on the peak of the roof near the front of the building;, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-10. it was a frame structure. Among the most prominent components of the architecture are the large semicircular arches around the windows, piercing walls thick. Inside, the gabled roof is supported by an unusual structural system of king post trusses. Preservation In late 1991, the former Stratford Methodist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its place in local history. It was part of a multiple property submission of buildings erected in Stratford's earliest years; all of the other buildings were residences. Crucial to its historic significance was its contribution to the community's built environment: the church is surrounded by a large open lot, which helps to demonstrate the rural context in which the village is located. Situated on the corner of the junction of U.S. Route 23 and State Route 315, the church lies at the southern end of the old village; an old boarding house sits just to the south, but all of the other original buildings, including several worker houses, are located well to the north.

Exploring the Fantastic in Mark 6:45-56 is a book written in 1999 by George W. Young, Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at Queen's College, Newfoundland, Canada. He interprets the New Testament episode of Jesus' walk on water (Mark 6:45-56) by literary critical methods related to fantastic literature.  Topics covered   Historical critical exegesis  In the first chapter Moving beyond tradition, a historical overview on mainstream exegesis is given. Young criticizes that naturalistic explanations depend on a historical critical worldview. However, this method of exegesis would fail to capture the full meaning of the text, just like a factual interpretation. Instead, Young proposes to investigate the pericope as narrative art and to apply literary-critical methods to the text in its final redaction by Mark. Hence, he takes the text as fiction, and he chooses tools and terms often associated with fantasy literature.George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry. Exploring the Fantastic in Mark 6:45-56. Brill, Leiden 1999, p. 1-6, 23. . Online preview.  Literary studies of Mark  Mark as narrative art gives an overview of literary criticism of Mark. The following chapters highlight methods and parameters of fantastic studies (Introduction to Fantastic Studies and Contours of Fantasy).  Interpretation of the narrative  In Reading Mark 6:45-56 as fantastic discourse, Young gives a verse by verse interpretation of the episode. He underlines bidimensionality as a main feature of fantasy: It is situated between the poles of realism and the marvelous or mythic. The episode is anchored in Palestinean geography: The disciples start at the northwestern side of the Sea of Galilee (compare Mk 6,1 and 6,32f.), and they are told to cross the lake in easterly direction to Bethsaida. The first three verses accentuate a three-dimensional separation between Jesus on a mountain and the disciples below in the midst of the sea. This polarization creates a narrative void, where unpredictable events can happen. The concrete spatial structure begins to dissolve, when in v. 48 the disciples' rowing against the wind is described from their perspective; this should not be explained by Jesus' view from a high altitude or his supernatural sight.George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, 1999, p. 115-123. Verses 48b - 51 confront two irreconciliable levels of reality: Whereas the disciples remain in the boat, the character of Jesus appears superior to the laws of nature. His sea-walk can only be conceptualized, any placement in three-dimensional space would be absurd, e.g. the question ‚ÄúDid Jesus move with the waves?‚Äù. A cardinal theme of fantastic narrative is introduced: Vision provides the main epistemological criteria for the ontological question of the real and unreal. The disciples' ‚Äúconventionalized reality is subverted‚Äù. Their reaction is fear and astonishment, but they have no words to identify the unspeakable. This astonishment is plausible. Together with the certification via the act of seeing it gives to the marvelous event a high degree of verisimilitude. According to Aristotle,Aristotle: Poetics, Bk 24, ¬ß¬ß 8-10. this is a ‚Äúfalse inference‚Äù: Such rhetoric asserts ‚Äúprobable impossibliities‚Äù.George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, 1999, p. 124-129, 181. Jesus' comforting words in v. 50b are rendered in direct speech and present tense. They convey dramatic immediacy at the climax of the story. For a first- century reader, his ·Ω≤Œ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ (‚ÄúI am‚Äù) without predicate makes allusion to the divine name appearing 175 times within the Septuagint in this form. Young is more interested in the open-ended aspect of the phrase. Together with the absence of the name ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù between Mk 6:30 and 8:27, it creates semantic instability. This ‚Äúallows the reader to write and re-write endless predicates, since none are given.‚ÄùGeorge W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, 1999, p. 129-133. The arrival at Gennesaret at the opposite side of Bethsaida has no rational explanation. Once again, it breaks readerly assumptions and even is reported to contradict Jesus' intention. The power operating such a fantastic journey is not named ‚Äì in ancient narrative the sea was a place of chaos and disorder.George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, 1999, p. 135-142.  Structures of Mark's discourse  The Penrose triangle symbolizes the mutual challenge of different perspectives on reality. The chapters Rhetoric and the reader and Summary and conclusion raise more general issues of Mark's discourse. The narrator's comment (v. 52) refers to a hidden meaning of the story and the previous feeding of the multitude. In contrast to Jesus' words, the rhetoric narrator accuses the disciples to not recognize Jesus' supernatural, messianic power explicitly, due to their lack of perception. Young considers this condemnation as illogical, since it does neither refer to their realistic view nor to their astonishment as adequate reaction to the supernatural. A monological ‚Äúhyper-reality‚Äù is opposed to the open fantastic structure of the text. The comment may be seen as an instance of an unreliable narrator, which motivates the reader to reconsider his and the narrator's point of views. Overall, the ‚Äúnarrative episode [...] is structured upon a conflicting system of perspectives between the disciples, Jesus/the phantom, and the rhetorical narrator‚Äù, like an ‚Äúimpossible triangle‚Äù. Reality is beyond objectification. Mark created a multilevel story world with inherent contradictions, ‚Äúbut a world that gropes for superior realities, perceptible only through œÜŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ±‚Äù (phantasia).George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, 1999, p. 149f., 157f., 181-184. The character of Jesus appears as secretive and capricious, his actions as unpredictable and scandalous. In v. 45f., e.g., there is a gap: Jesus only says, but is not reported to really dismiss the crowd (the relative pronoun Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·øñœÇ in ‚Äúand after he had taken leave of them‚Äù grammatically refers to the disciples, not the crowd). It appears to be an excuse to separate from the disciples. V. 48c. has often been an enigma: Jesus wants to pass by the disciples, whereas v. 48a suggests that he intends to help them ‚Äì 8 hours after having seen their distress. Similarly, unsettles and contradicts vv. 23 and 35; contrasts with Jesus' mission directed to everyone (). George W. Young notes parallels to a Greek ‚Äúcapricious god toying aimlessly with his subjects‚Äù.George W. Young: Subversive Symmetry, p. 160-169.  Reception  The book has been cited by several Old and New Testament studies.On 14 january 2012, Google scholar lists 9 books and one unpublished manuscript. Douglas W. Geyer analyzes Mark 4:35-6:56 under the aspects of ‚Äúthe anomalous frightful‚Äù, uncertainty and indeterminacy, which foreshadow the crucifixion. He gives many parallels in ancient historical and literary works.Douglas W. Geyer: Fear, anomaly, and uncertainty in the Gospel of Mark. Scarecrow Press, 2002. . Cited after a recension by Malbo Elizabet Struthers in Theological Studies, Vol. 64, 2003. Camille Focant cites Young's interpretation that in v. 48 the usual spatial structures are dissolved and a fantastic element is introduced into the text when Jesus sees the disciples far away. Furthermore, Jesus' walk on water resists concrete representation. He also judges Jesus' intention to pass by the disciples as curious, but interprets this against the background of Old Testament narratives of theophany like Ex 33:19-22, following John P. Meier and others. Focant criticizes Young's explication of the arrival at Gennesaret as a fantastic event, but does not explain the contradiction to the original destination, Bethsaida, as due to an inattentive compilation of two sources by Mark. Instead, he accepts the narrative analysis by E.S. Malbon: the spirit of the disciples has to be opened to the pagan world before they can arrive in a non- Jewish territory.Camille Focant, L'√©vangile selon Marc, Cerf, Paris 2004, pp. 255-257, 262. .

Between 1973-1981 Djerassi was ranked in the United States' top ten hammer throwers, being number one in three different years. He was selected for the Olympic team in 1980, but the United States boycotted the Moscow Games and Djerassi was unable to compete in the Olympics. He also competed at the World's Strongest Man finals. Early life Boris Djerassi was born in Haifa, Israel. Sporting career Djerassi came to the US in the early 1970s enrolling at New York University.Profile at the All- American Chiropractic Center official site However, when NYU dropped their athletics program in his sophomore year he moved on to Northeastern University in 1973. Known as \\"Dov\\" (Hebrew for Bear) he won All America honors in 1975, indoors in the weight and outdoors in the hammer. In the hammer he began dominating the New England, Eastern and eventually the national collegiate hammer event. In 1975 he defeated defending champion Pete Farmer for the NCAA crown in Provo, Utah in 1975 by just three inches. This proved to be the first of the fabled quadruple sweep, when he went on in 1975 to win the Penn Relays, the IC4A Championships, and the AAU Championships. He was the first athlete to perform this feat in one year. In 1980, he earned one of three berths in the hammer for the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, but was unable to compete when the USA boycotted the games. Djerassi did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. In total, he was three time national champion and four time All-American. In 1989 Northeastern University later inducted Boris into their Hall of Fame for his accomplishments in the sport of track and field.Northeastern University Athletics official website - Hall of Fame profile - Boris D.

It was built by Petri Camera Company, Japan, from 1974. It is unknown when the production stopped.  Features  The Petri TTL was a no-frills and very conservative camera. It was quite big and of heavy, all-metal construction. The only 'luxury' item found on the camera was a self-timer. The camera was fully manual, with a built-in CdS light meter. The battery was only for the metering circuit. The user needed to push a button on the front of the camera to close the aperture, and then set the aperture ring on the lens to a value where the meter needle would fit inside a marker ring. After this, the user could let go of the button, and have full light in the viewfinder to compose the picture. On release of the shutter, the aperture would close to the correct setting. As soon as the film was wound forwards, the light meter would switch on. It was not possible to switch it off manually, so the only way to conserve battery would be to delay advancing the film until the next exposure. It was not possible to attach a winder or motor to the camera. The shutter was a horizontal cloth-curtain focal-plane shutter with a speed range of 1/1 to 1/1000 second. As it was fully mechanical, the camera could be used even if the battery was dead. Flash sync was set for 1/60 second. The release button was placed in an uncommon spot, halfway down the front of the camera. If the user used the middle finger for the shutter release, it was possible to have an unusually solid grip on the housing. For reasons unknown, it did not activate the self-timer: the timer had a separate release button that became available when the self-timer arm was cocked. Even with the self-timer ready, the camera could be used in the normal mode. There were a wide range of lenses, bellows and other accessories available, both from Petri and from third-party producers. Image:petri_ttl_nolens.jpg|The camera housing alone.

The edifice was constructed in an exclusive residential neighborhood at the beginning of the twentieth century, and it has been designated a historic site. It was home for most of its history to a Disciples of Christ congregation, and is now the seat an Ethiopian Orthodox congregation. History In 1870, some of the city's New Lights formed a church that soon built a building downtown on Gay Street at Third Street. This building remained in use for approximately thirty-five years, acquiring the nickname of \\"Old Central\\", before its replacement by the present structure in 1907.

December 2009, 4. Accessed 2015-07-05. Architecture The church is primarily a stone building: walls, foundation, and smaller elements are all stone, although terracotta tiles cover the roof. Rather than ashlar, the stone blocks of the walls are rough-hewn, and only the trim is smoothed. The overall appearance is that of the Arts and Crafts movement; besides the rough-hewn stonework, the style is displayed through elements such as the bracketed shelters over the entrances and the eaves over the edges of the building. Other major components include a square corner tower with a hip roof, round turrets on the other corners, short but thick Tuscan columns, rounded arch windows of stained glass, and an arcade sheltering the main entrance. Overall, the two-story building possesses a rectangular floor plan. Historic site In 1986, the Broad Street Christian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in the community's history. A historic district and twenty-three other buildings, including the nearby East Broad Street Presbyterian Church and Saint Paul's Episcopal Church, were listed with it as part of a multiple property submission of significant buildings on East Broad Street.

The budget forecast a return to surplus in 2012/13. Projections were based on a successful passing of the Resource Super Profits tax based on a 40% of mining company profits. The budget featured changes to regulation regarding savings from 1 July 2011. Tax will only have to be paid on half of the total interest earned so as to encourage people to save. There were changes to the way millions of Australians do their tax returns by decreasing their reliance on tax agents. Sport in Australia is set to receive a funding boost described as the largest in Australian history. The budget was the first ever to be released under a Creative Commons license. Forecasts Deficit The deficit for the 2010‚Äì2011 financial year was expected to be A$40.8 billion or 2.9% of gross domestic product. Revenue mix The total revenue is expected to be $321.8 billion. Taxation The Resource Super Profits tax (RSPT) was expected to generate $3 billion in revenue in 2011/12. However Julia Gillard replaced the RSPT with the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT). The new tax was expected to generate $10.5 billion in revenue during its first two years of operation beginning in 2012. By increasing the taxation on mining super profits the company taxation rate can be dropped to 29% in 2013‚Äì14 and 28% in 2014‚Äì15. Those able to save will receive a 50% tax discount on the first $1,000 of interest earned on their deposits. Expenditure mix The forecast total expenditure is $354.6 billion. General government More than $1 billion is planned to be spent on securing Australian borders. $120 million will be spent on improving the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. Airport security is receiving $759 million over four years and to combat illegal fishing $163 million will be spent over the same period. After recommendation which were made in the Ahead of the Game report the budget allocated funds for improving service delivery. More than $1 billion is to be spent on public-sector technology projects, particularly on applications development and simplification of interacting with clients using the internet. Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre is to receive extra funding so it can target of serious and organised crime, tax evasion and fraud. Social security and welfare Compulsory superannuation rates are to increase from 9% to 12%. Infrastructure, transport and energy $652 million was allocated to the Renewable Energy Future Fund which will develop solar, wind, geothermal and clean coal technologies. According to the Clean Energy Council the purpose of the fund is to \\"leverage private venture capital by encouraging partnerships between the Government and the private sector in the commercialisation of new renewable technologies and to encourage energy efficiency measures\\". As part of the national road-building program New South Wales received the largest share at $717 million, then Queensland with $539 million and $260 million in Victoria. Education Funding for an extra 70,000 vocational education places has been provided for in the budget. Defence Defence spending was boosted $4.3 billion. $9.7 million was to be spent on combating domestic terrorist threats. Money was allocated for the establishment of the Counter Terrorism Control Centre and on an improved and more secure passport issuing system. Health $2.2 billion in new funding was allocated to the National Health and Hospitals Network after agreement was reached with the states. $355 million was to be provided for the establishment of GP Super Clinics. An increase of 25% on the tax for cigarettes is expected to raise $5 billion over five years to help fund primary health care expenses. Payments will be made eligible so that every doctor's practice in the country may employ a nurse. These rebates were previously only available in rural area and were capped at $40,000. Aged care received a boost of $132 million. Some of the money will be spent on investigating a national licensing and regulation system for personal care workers and $90 million was allocated to upgrading the qualifications of aged care nurses and personal care workers. $467 million has been set aside for the provision of electronic health records to those who want it. Changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will see $2.5 billion being saved over five years from the beginning of the 2010/11 financial year. Community services and culture Elite sports in Australia have been allocated $237 million over four years and $71 million is planned to support community sports. Opposition and crossbench response Opposition Leader Tony Abbott focused his attack on the mining industry tax, indicating he would rescind the tax if he could. Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey claimed the budget was \\"based on false assumptions\\". Hockey suggested the budget was too reliant on a \\"great big new tax\\" and lacked any serious reform. Reception The election year budget was described as an exercise in restraint that contained few surprises. The budget was faulted because it relies on strong terms of trade, demand from Asia, in particular China and a global recovery. It was praised by health and financial services sectors. The Australian Medical Association welcomed the extra funding for health. Catholic Health Australia reacted positively to the measures aimed at training and retaining medical and aged care staff. The Business Council of Australia was disappointed the MRRT would be used to return to surplus.

It is located in the Discovery District neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio at 212 S. 5th Street. The ‚ÄúMother Church of Columbus‚Äù, Holy Cross Church is a Gothic Revival church building that was constructed in 1848 making it the oldest Christian church building in Columbus. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History Statue of Christ on the Via Dolorosa on the church exterior During the early 1800s, the first Catholics in Columbus were visited only occasionally by traveling priests of the Dominican order. When Father Thomas Martin, OP visited Columbus in May 1833, a group of five local landowners (Samuel and Margaret Crosby, Nathaniel and Caroline Medbury, and Phoebe Otis) met with him and proposed to gift property at Fifth and Walnut streets to the Catholic Church provided that a church building be constructed and in use within five years‚Äô time. That building, Saint Remigius Church, was dedicated on April 29, 1838. Measuring at just 55 feet long and 30 feet wide, Saint Remigius Church was planned as a temporary place of worship that would later be turned into a school. The pastors at Saint Remigius also served the Catholics in neighboring cities in addition to the parish's own primarily German congregation. Father William Schonat became the first resident priest in 1843. By then, the growing Catholic population in Columbus necessitated a larger church building. At Father Schonat's request, the parish was renamed ‚ÄúHoly Cross‚Äù. The present structure was completed in 1848, just as Irish immigrants began to arrive in Columbus to escape the Great Famine. This influx of migrants eventually split off to form Saint Patrick Church, though they continued to share Holy Cross while the new church was being built. Exterior The property is located on 0.165 acres at the corner of South 5th and East Rich Streets in Columbus. The church is constructed of over 800,000 bricks. It features a prominent statue of Jesus on the Via Dolorosa with the inscription ‚ÄúFollow Me‚Äù, and clock tower with a steeple and belfry. The ‚ÄúFollow Me‚Äù statue covers an inscription that reads ‚ÄúGod forbid that I should glory, but in the Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world‚Äù, a quote from the Epistle to the Galatians. The rectory and the school were built of brick in 1861 and 1871, respectively. Interior Church sanctuary decorated for Laetare Sunday Many murals adorn the church interior. Two murals near the sanctuary depict Saint Helena finding the True Cross and the presentation of the True Cross to Pope Saint Sylvester. Other murals along the sides of the nave include the Annunciation, the Nativity of Jesus, the Finding in the Temple of the Child Jesus, the Resurrection of Jesus, and the Ascension of Jesus. The two manual, six rank pipe organ was built by Page Organ Company in 1928. It was installed in the Fayette Theater (Washington Court House, Ohio) before it was moved to Holy Family Church in Franklinton, Ohio in 1947. The organ was moved to Holy Cross in 1981. The Munich-style stained glass windows were created by Zettler Studios. The windows were stored on a German dock during World War I until they were finally shipped to Columbus after the war.

One of the oldest black churches in the city, it has been active since the 1860s, and its 1920s building has been named a historic site. Built of brick on a concrete foundation, the Gothic Revival church features limestone details and is covered with an asphalt roof. The major part of the church is on the second story, sitting above a basement with windows at ground level; the main part of the building is entered through large doors atop a flight of exterior stairs. Squat rectangular towers with pyramidal roofs sit on the front corners of the building, with simple rectangular windows above small doorways. The plan partially reflects traditional ecclesiastical architecture, with a gabled roof being interrupted by cross gables on the sides. Many of the windows, as well as the doorways, are wide ogive arches., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-25. Shiloh Baptist Church was formed by a group of former members of the city's Second Baptist Church. Seeing the city's black population increasing rapidly, especially on the near east side, Second Baptist leaders asked for volunteers to leave and form a new church; these volunteers formed the entire charter membership of the new Shiloh church. From their first meeting in 1869 until 1871, they worshipped in a rented property at Gay and Fourth Streets downtown, after which they moved a few blocks eastward to Cleveland Avenue and Long Street. The congregation again moved in 1923 upon the completion of the present building on Mount Vernon Avenue, significantly farther east than the previous houses of worship.Betti, Tom, et al. Columbus Neighborhoods: A Guide to the Landmarks of Franklinton, German Village, King-Lincoln, Olde Town East, Short North & the University District. Charleston and London: The History Press, 2013, 180. A minister, James Burks, was responsible for the design, with additional work being performed by the A.O. Day Construction Company. The congregation came close to losing the building during the Great Depression, due to its inability to pay the mortgage, but was delivered by an unexpected act of mercy: upon obtaining title through foreclosure, the bank promptly contracted to return the property to the church. Since that time, the building has become recognized as one of the premier components of the surrounding neighborhood, Mount Vernon.Shiloh Baptist Church, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. As the third oldest black church in Columbus, younger only than the parent church and a congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the congregation has long played a significant part in the life of Mount Vernon. In recognition of its significance in local history, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The congregation remains active in the wider Baptist community as a part of the Eastern Union Missionary Baptist Association.\\"Member Churches\\", Eastern Union Missionary Baptist Association, 2015.

Used as a church only for a few decades, the building has seen many uses over the ensuing decades, ranging from commercial to government-affiliated to social services. Because of its architecture, the building has been named a historic site. Founded in 1849, the Welsh Presbyterian Church first worshipped one block away from its second location. Work began on the second church building in 1887 and was finished in the following year. This building, in turn, closed in 1919 after the congregation moved farther away, and for many years the property was employed for commercial purposes. Among its tenants since that time have been the offices of Commercial Motor Freight, a factory, a store of the M.C. Lilley Company, and the offices of the Community Action Organization for the Columbus metropolitan area.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 514-515. Built of brick, the Romanesque Revival building rests on a foundation of limestone, is covered with a slate roof, and features elements of sandstone. Two entrances are placed on the front of the building: one at the far left, and one at the far right, with large windows between them. The roof is steeply gabled, with an oculus near the peak on the front gable, while the single-story side walls feature both small and large windows at various heights. Cylindrical components are placed at the corners as well as occasional points on the facade., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-12-13. These elements combine to produce somewhat of the appearance of a fortress with turrets and buttresses. In 1980, the Welsh Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its architecture. Its significance derives partly from its location, as almost no 19th-century structures have survived in its immediate vicinity, and comparable examples of Romanesque Revival architecture are rare in downtown Columbus.

Municipally, it serves as the administrative center of Lyubytinskoye Urban Settlement, one of the two urban settlements in the district. Population: History The Msta River was an important waterway connecting Novgorod to the lands in the north, at least from the 9th century. The chronicles mention that Olga of Kiev traveled up the Msta River in 947 and founded a pogost which is believed close to the current location of Lyubytino. Numerous ancient graves with tumuli were raised in Lyubytino and can be still today noticed in the several places around the settlement. The area eventually went under control of the Novgorod Republic, and in the 15th century, after the fall of Novgorod, it was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the end of the 19th century, Lyubytino, then known as the selo of Beloye, was the center of Belskaya Volost of Borovichsky Uyezd, Novgorod Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Belsky District was established, with the center in Beloye. The district belonged to Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. On March 11, 1931, the district center was renamed to Lyubytino, and the district was renamed into Lyubytinsky District. On July 5, 1944, Lyubytinsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and has remained there ever since, with a brief interruption between 1963 and 1965, when the district was abolished as a part of aborted Khrushchyov administrative reform. On June 23, 1965, Lyubytino acquired a status of an urban-type settlement. Economy Industry In Lyubytino, there is a factory producing paint, as well as timber industry and food industry enterprises. Transportation In Lyubytino, there is a railway station on the railroad connecting Nebolchi and Okulovka. This minor railroad connects two major branches. Nebolchi is located on the railroad connecting Sonkovo and Mga, whereas Okulovka lies on the main line connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Lyubytino is connected by roads via Nebolchi and Boksitogorsk with A113 highway which connects Vologda and Saint Petersburg, via Antsiferovo with Khvoynaya, with Borovichi, and via Malaya Vishera with M10 highway which connects Moscow and Saint Petersburg. There are also local roads. Culture and recreation The district contains one cultural heritage monument of federal significance and additionally twenty-one objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monument is a living house. There is a local museum in Lyubytino.

Journal of Molluscan Studies. 81: 1-23 Distinguishing characteristics The Tucker & Tenorio 2009 taxonomy distinguishes Kohniconus from Conus in the following ways: * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Kohniconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate in shape. The protoconch is multispiral. The shell is ornamented with cords and nodules which may persist or become obsolete. The anal notch is deep. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is large. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth is much shorter than the posterior section, and a short blade is present. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The shaft fold is blunt at the anterior end. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the West Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions. ::Feeding habits :::The species in this genus are vermivorous (meaning that these snails prey on marine worms). Species list This list of species is based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list. Species within the genus Kohniconus include: * Kohniconus arcuatus (Broderip & G.B.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Kohniconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

Constructed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, it is no longer home to the congregation that built it, but it remains a significant component of the area's built environment, and it has been named a historic site. The Auburn Free Will Baptist Church was formed in 1839 or 1840, led by an Elder Miller as the first pastor. The congregation was able to build a church building by the end of 1840, but forty years later the congregation remained weak enough that they were forced to share their pastor with another church.Pioneer and General History of Geauga County, with Sketches of Some of the Pioneers and Prominent Men. Burton: Historical Society of Geauga County, 1880. Before the building was finished, the church often worshipped in a schoolhouse or in a barn belonging to farmer Richard Slitor. After its construction, it was used both by Baptists and by the Methodists for most of the rest of the century, and the Baptists continued worshipping in it until the era of the Second World War.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Accessed 2013-11-24. the church is most distinctive for its roofline and the roof's structural support. From the outside, the roof resembles an ordinary gable roof, but an unusual system of trusses and diagonal bracing supports the underside of the roof. Local historians have deemed this construction style particularly rare in the Connecticut Western Reserve. With this exception, it is typical of the region's vernacular Greek Revival churches; three windows appear on the sides and on the second story of the front, while the main entrance is centered between a window on each side of the front's first floor. A tower once sat atop the front of the building. In May 1976, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically distinctive architecture and because of its place in local history. It is the only National Register-listed location in Auburn Township, and one of three Geauga County churches with this designation, along with the Claridon Congregational Church in Claridon Township and the South Newbury Union Chapel in Newbury Township.

The plane had a rear cockpit and a distinctive tandem wing. Design and development The Arsenal-Delanne 10-C2 two-seat fighter, designed by Maurice Delanne and built by the Arsenal de l'A√©ronautique, was of so-called Nenadovich biplane or tandem wing configuration, the tandem-mounted wings providing a continuous slot effect and offering exceptional center of gravity range. The fighter was of all metal stressed-skin construction, which used a sandwich technique, with a smooth dural skin welded to a corrugated sheet. Pilot and gunner sat in tandem under a single canopy at the rear of the fuselage, which was level with the rear wing, which carried twin tailplanes. This arrangement gave the gunner a clear field of fire for his planned armament of two 7.5 mm machine guns, which was to be supplemented by a 20 mm cannon firing through the propellor hub and two more machine guns in the wing. The aircraft was fitted with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and was powered by a single Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs 12-cylinder liquid-cooled engine.Green 1969, pp. 24‚Äì25. The Arsenal-Delanne 10-C2 prototype was virtually complete at Villacoublay when German forces occupied the factory in June 1940. Work on the aircraft continued in a desultory fashion and the first flight test was made in October 1941. After completion of the initial test programme, the aircraft was ferried to Germany for further trials. Specifications References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Green, William.

Her name was used to mean happiness with prosperity and abundance. She is usually shown with greenery to depict the abundance of seasonal decorations that many sites would include. Wreaths of flowers or leaves are commonly worn at festivals or holy rituals, similarly Laetitia would be shown wearing a garland to mean celebration. She was sometimes depicted on Roman coinage with an anchor, as a representation of stability, or, like Fortuna, a ship's rudder symbolizing guiding fortune or the actions chosen to steer one towards prosperity, fortune favors the strong which was used to be used synonymously with social class, it was also used to describe fertile land. Laetitia, engraved Felicitas Temporum, the happiness of the times, has children playing across the four seasons on different coins, the limes denarus holds Laetitia at an alter sacrificing near lit candles while the back features a half-moon and seven stars. Coins of the limes denarus are issued by Elagabalus, this meant they were indicating the divine, at behest of Septimius Severus. Saecvli Felicitas, the happiness of the age, happiness followed abundance and the virtue of Roman and Egyptian destiny whole and by necessity included large stores of grain imported from Egypt, with some coins showing Laetitia having an infant Horus suckling at her breast, it could mean Roman-Egyptian ancient goddess Isis may have been prominent in Rome at the time, further coins reveal children on the thrown, and an emperor with a spear and orb. The trade in surplus foodstuffs was a sign of wealth, used symbolically with the child Plutus, the virtue of abundance is food and prosperity for all of society, food precedes and may follow prosperity. A new lineage is born of abundance, this is a joy depicted on the following coins and the beliefs of Romans where suggested similarly to be joyful of their new heirs. Laetitia Publicae, \\"the happiness of the times\\", produced and preceded \\"the happiness of the age\\" and it founded a \\"Established\\" joy. Roman and Egyptian destiny is made complete and altered to make anew, this is necessary for Established joy. Roman Laetitia publ, or Publius, most likely meaning Publius Vellaeus, the commander of the provincial army in Moesia in otherwise unknown activities of Roman administrators and Moesian army oÔ¨Écers in the period in AD21, and Laetita Fvndat, or fundat, now personified by a rudder next a globe, symbolically means trade is now part of the globe, the sea routes which now transport more food, corn. A rudder is also shown behind an altar, as such a divine victory and gain of food through the sea is establishing a joy that is public, a public joy is a religious thanksgiving. These are denarus of Julius Maesa showing us the goddess Laetitia. Also named Laetitia Fundata, after 3rd century CE under Augustus, Laetitia Fundata means \\"Established\\" or \\"Well-Founded\\" Joy; these coins usually show Her with a ship's rudder, often resting on a globe. Again, these depictions hammer home the idea that the foundation of the Empire's happiness was built on its ability to dominate and direct the course of events, though they may also, more practically, make reference to the Empire's dependence on imported grain to keep its people fed. Goddess Ceres is shown with her daughter Proserpina (perhaps better known by their Greek equivalents Demeter and Kore or Persephone), under Emperor Pius rule instead of Laetitia. She is also depicted with ears of wheat in Her right hand; but in Her left She holds the hasta pura, literally a \\"blameless spear\\", a prized military award for saving the life of a soldier. A symbol of divine power the hasta pura was also carried by the Goddesses Pax (\\"Peace\\") and Providentia (\\"Providence\\" or \\"Foresight\\"), indicates righteous victory, or the peace and prosperity that can flourish when a war is won. Laetitia, or more accurately, a \\"groundless\\" version of Her is mentioned by Ovid in his Metamorphoses as being a friend of the Rumor- Goddess Fama; in this case, Laetitia represents the unfounded joy gossip can quickly bring and just as quickly dash.

Gyorgy was also well known for his research into the protective factors of human breast milk, particularly for his discoveries of Lactobacillus bifidus growth factor activity in human milk and its anti-staphylococcal properties. He was a recipient of the National Medal of Science in 1975 from President Gerald Ford.  Early life and career  Gyorgy was born on April 7, 1893 in Nagyv√°rad, Hungary to a Jewish family. He was said to be an avid reader and musician as a child. His father was a general practitioner in the community. Influenced by his father's occupation and with his parents' encouragement, Gyorgy began to pursue a career in medicine. He attended the University of Budapest Medical School and graduated with Doctor of Medicine degree in 1915. In 1920, after the end of World War I, Gyorgy was offered a job at the University of Heidelberg as an assistant to the physician and researcher Ernst Moro. He remained at the University of Heidelberg until 1933, obtaining full professorship in 1927 at the age of 34 years. It was at the University of Heidelberg that Gyorgy first discovered and isolated riboflavin along with his colleague Th. Wagner-Jauregg and the Nobel-winning chemist Richard Kuhn. Gyorgy remained at the University of Heidelberg until 1933, when the political unrest in Germany spurred his move to the Nutrition Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England. He stayed as a researcher in there until 1935, during which time he discovered vitamin B6. In 1935, Gyorgy went to the United States as a visiting assistant professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University. Two years later he was appointed as an associate professor at the university as well as an associate pediatrician at two hospitals within the University Hospitals of Cleveland system. He isolated biotin in 1940 while at Case Western Reserve University. In 1944, Gyorgy moved to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, this time as an Associate Research Professor of Pediatrics. His research at this time involved looking at the protective factors found in human breast milk. He was promoted to Professor of Pediatrics in 1946, later becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1963. From 1950 to 1957, he was also Pediatrician-in-Chief at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and later on, Chief of Pediatrics at Philadelphia General Hospital from 1957 to 1963.  Scientific research  Gyorgy was responsible for the discovery of three B vitamins, work he conducted with others during his time at Heidelberg, Cambridge, and Cleveland. Later in his career, Gyorgy investigated the protective factors found in human breast milk at the University of Pennsylvania.  Discovery of riboflavin  By 1927 a series of experiments, performed in part by Elmer McCollum and others, had shown that water-soluble vitamin B was primarily made of two parts: the anti-neuritic factor B1 (now known as thiamine) and the more heat-stable factor B2. By 1932 Gyorgy had found that the heat-stable B2 was not in fact a single substance, but actually a complex made up of two factors: the growth-promoting factor (later found to be riboflavin) and the anti-pellagra factor (later found to be vitamin B6). Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician Th. Wagner- Jauregg at the University of Heidelberg, had noticed that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of concentrated B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that when fed to the rat, restored normal growth. The amount of growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescent product. The bright yellow substance had been previously found in milk by scientists Warburg and Christian, who had described the it as 'yellow oxidation ferment' but were unable to discover its function. Gyorgy, Kuhn, and Warner-Jauregg suggested the name 'flavin' for their yellow pigments and proposed that they were likely the same as the yellow pigments seen by Warberg and Christian. By 1933, the Heidelberg team were the first to isolate crystalline flavin from milk and accordingly, termed the substance lactoflavin. They, along with other teams, went on to isolate similar flavins from many other sources such as egg white (ovoflavin) and liver (heptoflavin). All these compounds were found to be chemically identical and in 1937, the name riboflavin was formally adopted by the Council of Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association.  Discovery of B6  During his experiments with riboflavin, Gyorgy noticed that rats already on a thiamine-only diet developed pellagra-like symptoms, even when given pure riboflavin. The symptoms were only relieved when rats were given supplements derived from a flavin-free extract of bakers' yeast. In contrast, rats given this extract but no riboflavin failed to exhibit pellagra-like symptoms but were unable to gain weight until riboflavin was added back into the diet. These results confirmed the presence of an 'anti- pellagra' factor that was biologically distinct from the newly discovered riboflavin. In 1934, Gyorgy named this new anti-pellagra factor B6 in order to distinguish it from other B vitamins and set about isolating and characterizing it during his time at the University of Cambridge. In 1936, Gyorgy and his colleague, Thomas William Birch, were successful in isolating crystalline B6 from fish and wheat germ.  Discovery of biotin  By 1927, scientists such as Margarete Boas and Helen Parsons had performed experiments demonstrating the symptoms associated with egg-white injury. They had found that rats fed large amounts of egg-white as their only protein source exhibited neurological dysfunction, dermatitis, and eventually, death. Gyorgy began investigating the factor responsible for egg-white injury in 1933 and in 1939, was successful identifying what he called vitamin H. Further chemical characterization of vitamin H revealed that it was water-soluble and present in high amounts in the liver. By this time, multiple groups had independently isolated the same compound under different names. In 1936, K√∂gl and T√∂nnis had isolated what they called biotin from egg yolk and in 1939, West had isolated what he called co-enzyme R. By 1940, it was recognized that all three compounds were identical and were collectively given the name biotin. Gyorgy continued his work on biotin and in 1941 published a paper demonstrating that egg-white injury was caused by the binding of biotin by avidin.  Protective factors in breast milk  In 1950, Gyorgy began investigating the microbial properties in human breast milk. He began by comparing the intestinal flora of normal breast-fed infants to those who were fed cow's milk formulas. He found that the breast-fed infants had a prevalence of a certain variant of Lactobacillus bifidus, a bacterium considered to be an essential part of normal human gut flora. Further testing revealed the presence of factors in human breast milk that acted as essential growth promoting factors to the L. bifidus variant. In 1962, Gyorgy also discovered anti-staphylococcus properties of human breast milk. He injected mice with different doses of virulent Staphylococcus aureus and found that those given human breast milk obtained protection from infection, resulting in a higher survival rate than those that were given only cow's milk.  Personal life  Gyorgy married Margaret John on October 23, 1920 in Weimar, Germany. The couple had three sons: Hans, who became an organic chemist, Michael, who became a physicist, and Tilbert, a surgeon. Gyorgy enjoyed classical music and was also an avid painter and gardener.  Awards and honors  Gyorgy received the 1975 National Medal of Science from President Gerald Ford for his \\"discovery of three vitamins and related research that have greatly improved human nutrition\\". Gyorgy had already died by the time of the 1976 award ceremony and his medal was accepted by his wife, Margaret John. Other awards included: * Borden Award of the American Institute of Nutrition (1951) * Borden Award of Nutrition by the American Academy of Pediatrics (1952) * Goldberger Award of the Council of Foods and Nutrition by the American Medical Association (1957) * Osbourne-Mendel Award of the American Institute of Nutrition (1958) * John Howland Award for the American Pediatric Society (1968)  Later years and death  Gyorgy's later life revolved around his work in Southeast Asia, where he was involved in conducting nutritional field studies aimed at improving nutrition, particularly in Thailand and Indonesia. During this time, he was an organizer of the Protein Advisory Group of the World Health Organization and UNICEF, eventually becoming President of the group from 1960 to 1964.

An emphasis on the defence of ethnic identity was shown by naming the troops after important Slovene poets and writers, following the example of the Ivan Cankar battalion.≈†tih, P.; Simoniti, V.; Vodopivec, P. (2008) A Slovene History: Society, politics, culture. In≈°titut za novej≈°o zgodovino. Ljubljana. p.426. Slovene Partisans were the armed wing of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, a resistance political organization and party coalition for what the Partisans referred to as the Slovene Lands. The Liberation Front was founded and directed by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ), more specifically its Slovene branch: the Communist Party of Slovenia. Being the first organized military force in the history of Slovenes, the Slovene Partisans were in the beginning organized as guerrilla units, and later as an army. Their opponents were the occupiers of Slovenia, and after the summer of 1942, also anti- Communist Slovene forces. The Slovene Partisans were mostly ethnically homogenous and primarily communicated in Slovene. These two features have been considered vital for their success. Their most characteristic symbol was a triglavka. They were subordinated to the civil resistance authority. The Partisan movement in Slovenia, though a part of the wider Yugoslav Partisans, was operationally autonomous from the rest of the movement, being geographically separated, and full contact with the remainder of the Partisan army occurred after the breakthrough of Tito's forces through to Slovenia in 1944.  Background  During World War II, Nazi Germany and Hungary occupied northern areas (brown and dark green areas, respectively), while Fascist Italy occupied the vertically hashed black area (solid black western part being annexed by Italy already with the Treaty of Rapallo). After 1943, Germany took over the Italian occupational area, as well. After World War I ended in 1918, the Slovene-settled territory partially fell under the rule of the neighboring states Italy, Austria and Hungary. Slovenes there were subjected to policies of forced assimilation. On 6 April 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers. Slovenia was divided among the occupying powers: Fascist Italy occupied southern Slovenia and Ljubljana, Nazi Germany took northern and eastern Slovenia, while Horthy's Hungary was awarded the Prekmurje region. Some villages in Lower Carniola were annexed by the Independent State of Croatia. The Nazis started a policy of violent Germanisation. In the frame of their plan for the ethnic cleansing of Slovene territory, tens of thousands of Slovenes were resettled or chased away, imprisoned, or transported to labor, internment and extermination camps. The majority of Slovene victims of the occupation authorities were from the regions occupied by the Germans, i.e. Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Central Sava Valley, and Slovenian Carinthia. The Italian occupation policy in the Province of Ljubljana gave Slovenes cultural autonomy, however the Fascist system was systematically introduced. After the establishment of the Liberation Front, the violence against the Slovene civil population in the zone escalated and easily matched the German.Ballinger, P. (2002). History in exile: memory and identity at the borders of the Balkans. Princeton University Press. p. 327 The province was subjected to brutal repression. Alongside summary executions, the burning of houses and villages, hostage-taking and hostage executions, the Province of Ljubljana saw the deportation of 25,000 people, which equaled 7.5% of the total population, to different concentration camps.  Formation, organisation, and ideological affiliation of the membership  Main staff of National Liberation Army in 1944. From left to right: Boris Kraigher, Jaka Av≈°iƒç, Franc Rozman, Viktor Avbelj and Du≈°an Kveder. In both Slovene Partisans squads and in the \\"field committees\\" of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation the Communists were indeed in the minority. During the course of the war, the influence of the Communist Party of Slovenia started to grow. Nowhere else in Yugoslav territory did the Partisan movement have a plural political composition like it did have in Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, so the Yugoslav Communist Party wanted that the Slovene partisans should be brought under more exclusive Communist control. This was not officially declared until the Dolomite Declaration of 1 March 1943. The High Command of the Slovene Partisans (Supreme Command at first) was established by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia on 22 June 1941. The command members were the commander Franc Lesko≈°ek (a.k.a. Luka), the political commissar Boris Kidriƒç (succeeded by Miha Marinko), deputy commander Ale≈° Bebler (a.k.a. Primo≈æ), and members Stane ≈Ωagar, Oskar Kovaƒçiƒç, Milo≈° Zidan≈°ek, Du≈°an Podgornik, and Marijan Brecelj. The decision to start armed resistance was passed at a meeting on 16 July 1941. The first partisan shot in the Slovene Lands was fired by one Miha Novak on 22 July 1941 at a former Yugoslav policeman who was claimed to have collaborated with the Germans and to have betrayed to them local supporters of the Communist Party. The man was attacked by the ≈†marna Gora Partisan group from an ambush at P≈°atnik Forest near Tacen. The Germans arrested about 30 people and executed two of them. In the latter Socialist Republic of Slovenia, 22 July was celebrated as the Day of the National Rising. The historian Jo≈æe De≈æman stated in 2005 that this was a celebration of a day when a Slovene wounded another Slovene by shooting and that it symbolised the victory of the Communist Party over its own nation. In addition to the war against the occupying forces, there was a civil war going on in the Slovene Lands and both the Communist and the anti-Communist side tried to cover it, according to De≈æman. At the very beginning the Partisan forces were small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure, but Spanish Civil War veterans amongst them had some experience with guerrilla warfare. Some of the members of Liberation Front and partisans were ex-members of the TIGR resistance movement. Autonomy A triglavka, as used by the Slovene Partisans The partisan activities in Slovenia were initially independent of Tito's Partisans in the south. In autumn 1942, Tito attempted for the first time to control the Slovene resistance movement. Arso Jovanoviƒá, a leading Yugoslav communist who was sent from Tito's Supreme Command of Yugoslav partisan resistance, ended his mission to establish central control over the Slovene partisans unsuccessfully in April 1943. The merger of the Slovene Partisans with Tito's forces happened in 1944. The Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and Slovene language as commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language. From 1942 till after 1944, they wore the triglavkas, which was then gradually replaced with the Titovka cap as part of their uniform. In March 1945, the Slovene Partisan Units were officially merged with the Yugoslav Army and thus ceased to exist as a separate formation. The General Staff of the Slovene Partisan Army was abolished in May 1945. Cooperation with Allies In June 1943 Major William Jones arrived at the high command of the Slovene resistance units located in the Koƒçevje forest as the envoy of a British-American military mission, and one month later the Slovene Partisans received their first consignment of arms from the Allies. Number of combatants The estimates of the number of Slovene Partisans differ. Despite solid support among Slovenes, the numbers of Slovene Partisans was quite small and increased only in the latter stages of the war. There were no more than 700‚Äì800 Slovene Partisans in August 1941, about 2000 in the end of 1941, 5,500 in September 1943, at the time of the capitulation of Italy. According to Slovene Historical Atlas, published in 2011, in summer 1942 there were 5,300 Slovene partisans and 400 members of the Home Guard, a year after in summer 1943 there was unchanged number, i.e. 5,300 Slovene partisans, but the number of members of the Home Guard increased to 6,000, also there were 200 members of the Slovene Chetniks, in autumn 1943 (after the capitulation of Italian army) there were 20,000 Slovene partisans, 3,000 members of the Home Guard and no Slovene Chetniks left, while in summer 1944 there were 30,000 Slovene partisans, 17,000 members of the Home Guard and 500 members of the Slovene Chetniks, and in winter 1945 the number of Slovene partisans increased to 34,000, while the number of members of the Home Guard and members of the Slovene Chetniks was unchanged. In December 1944, there were 38,000 Slovene Partisans, which was the peak number. Partisans who were ethnic Germans Although majority of the Gottschee ethnic Germans obeyed the Nazi Germany which issued an order that all of them should relocate from Province of Ljubljana, which was occupied by the Fascist Italy, to the \\"Ranner Dreieck\\" or Bre≈æice Triangle, which was in the German occupation zone, some of them (fifty six) refused to leave their homes and, instead, decided to join Slovene Partisans fighting against Italians together with their Slovene neighbours.Zdravko Troha (2004) Koƒçevski Nemci - partizani [fotografije Zdravko Troha, Pokrajinski muzej Koƒçevje, Arhiv Slovenije]. Ljubljana: Slovensko koƒçevarsko dru≈°tvo Peter Kosler. Ulrich Weinzierl (2003) Wald und Wald und Wald, Spectrum - Die Presse, 15. November 2003. Logistics In December 1943, Franja Partisan Hospital was built in difficult and rugged terrain, only a few hours from Austria and the central parts of Germany. Civil war and post-war killings The civil war that broke out in Slovenia during the occupation was, ideologically and politically, the result of the conflict between two authoritarian ideologies: Bolshevik communism and Catholic clericalism. Communists were unreceptive to warnings of harmful consequences of the rash elimination of opponents. With the success of the Slovene Partisan movement in spring and summer 1942, they began to be convinced that the national liberation phase was to be continued with the revolutionary one, which had already led to violent encounters with Catholic activists, who began to leave the Partisan ranks. The Communist security service killed 60 people in the first few months of 1942 in Ljubljana alone; people who the Communist leadership had proclaimed as collaborators and informers. After the assassination of Lambert Ehrlich, and 429 shot by VOS (varnostno-obe≈°ƒçevalna slu≈æba; security and intelligence service) agents in May 1942, and especially the murder of a number of priests, Bishop Ro≈æman rejected the OF (osvobodilna fronta; liberation front) and Partisans outright. Part of the clergy continued to support the Partisan movement and performed religious ceremonies for them, burying killed Partisans in church graveyards, etc. Gottschee ethnic German priest Josef Gliebe, who preferred to stay with those who did not want to be moved away, has been helping Partisans with food, shoes and clothes, being labelled \\"red one\\" by Slovene Home Guard.Igor Mekina (2004) Germans who were Partisans, Mladina, 27 February. Ljubljana. In the summer of 1942, a civil war between Slovenes broke out. The two fighting factions were the Slovenian Partisans and the Italian-sponsored anti-communist militia, known as the \\"White Guard\\", later re-organized under Nazi command as the Slovene Home Guard. Small units of Slovenian Chetniks also existed in Lower Carniola and Styria. The Partisans were under the command of the Liberation Front (OF) and Tito's Yugoslav resistance, while the Slovenian Covenant served as the political arm of the anti-Communist militia. The civil war was mostly restricted to the Province of Ljubljana, where more than 80% of the Slovene anti-partisan units were active. Between 1943 and 1945, smaller anti-Communist militia existed in parts of the Slovene Littoral and in Upper Carniola, while they were virtually non-existent in the rest of the country. By 1945, the total number of Slovene anti-Communist militiamen reached 17,500.Slovenski zgodovinski atlas (Ljubljana: Nova revija, 2011), 186. Over 28,000 Partisans were killed due to the war, compared to over 14,000 anti- Communists, most of which were killed after the war. The Slovene Partisans and revolutionary forces killed over 24,000 Slovenes during and after World War II, and contributed to the killings of 15% of all Slovene victims of the war. The anti-communist forces killed about 4,400 Slovenes in their independent actions, not including those killed in joint actions with the occupying forces; those are attributed to the occupiers. Notable members Members of Slovene Partisans who are today internationally most notable include: *Jo≈æe Brilej (1910-1981) politician, diplomat, President of the United Nations Security Council, Chief Justice of the Slovenian supreme court *Karel \\"Kajuh\\" Destovnik (1922-1944) poet and literary hero *Boris Pahor, a writer and public intellectual, Nazi concentration camps survivor, who opposed Italian Fascism and Titoist Communism, as well.

The book contains eight separate papers produced by scholars working in the field of anthropology, each of which focuses in on a different society in Sub-Saharan Africa. It was the intention of the editors to bring together information on African political systems on a \\"broad, comparative basis\\" for the first time. Background Describing the purpose of African Political Systems, Fortes and Evans-Pritchard related that it offered \\"both an experiment in collaborative research and an attempt to bring into focus one of the major problems of African sociology. Many dogmatic opinions are held on the subject of African political organization and are even made use of in administrative practice; but no one has yet examined this aspect of African society on a broad, comparative basis.\\" They expressed their hope that the anthology would prove to be \\"the first stage of a wider enquiry into the nature and development of African political systems\\", which would ultimately include not only \\"native political systems\\" but also \\"the study of the development of these systems under the influence of European rule.\\"Fortes and Evans-Pritchard 1940. p. vi. Synopsis Radcliffe-Brown's \\"Preface\\" The preface to African Political Systems was authored by A.R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881-1955), then an Emeritus Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford, who argued that the \\"comparative study of political institutions, with special reference to the simpler societies, is an important branch of social anthropology which has not yet received the attention it deserves.\\" Proceeding to argue that the \\"comparative method\\" can be used \\"as an instrument for inductive inference\\", he believed that doing so would allow scholars to \\"discover the universal, essential, characters which belong to all human societies, past, present and future\\". Despite this, he did note that scholars must be careful not to \\"pass directly from empirical observations to a knowledge of general sociological laws or principles\\", believing that before this, all known societies must be \\"reduced to some order of classification\\".Radcliffe-Brown 1940. p. xi.

Lockard (June 24, 1920 - December 12, 2011) was an African-American Criminal Court Judge in the U.S. State of Tennessee for Shelby County. He was born in Ripley, Tennessee, and was raised on a farm in the nearby town of Henning to Albert and Lucille Lockard, also of Ripley. He had four brothers, Emmitt, Lorenza, Limuel, and Albert, Jr., and a sister, Lydia. He grew up during segregation and attended public schools in Memphis, Tennessee, 50 miles southwest of Ripley because African-Americans were not allowed to attend the all-white public schools in Ripley. After serving in the U.S. Army in the early 1940s, Lockard returned to school and completed college at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. He then applied to law school at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) but was denied admission because of his race. Lockard attended Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, which had been established by the Missouri General Assembly as a law school for African-Americans. After graduating in 1950, he returned to Tennessee and was admitted to practice law in 1951. In 1955, Lockard became president of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP and served in that position until 1958. He headed up their legal committee, and during this time, he was joined by Russell Sugarmon, Vasco and Maxine Smith, Jesse Turner, Billy Kyles, the late Benjamin Hooks and A.W. Willis in fighting for and achieving success in the desegregation of Memphis Street Railway Co., public buildings, restaurants and the University of Memphis. He built a successful law practice and became the first African-American member of a Tennessee governor's cabinet, serving as administrative assistant to Gov. Buford Ellington from 1967 to 1971. He advised President Lyndon B. Johnson on civil rights issues and matters pertaining to race relations. As a judge, he served on the Shelby County Criminal Court from 1975 to 1994 and remained active in the legal community until physical ailments and a stroke slowed him down. Judge Lockard expressed the desire for young African Americans to \\"not take their rights and privileges for granted\\" and to view what others went through with a sense of reflection and appreciation. Judge Lockard was married to Ida Walker Lockard for 49 years. He died in his sleep of natural causes.

History Map of the route of the Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Electric Railway The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Light Railway Order of 1898 authorised the construction of a tramway from Colwyn Bay to Deganwy. There were substantial delays in construction and only a short section of line had been built by 1904. The original company was taken over in July 1906 by the Llandudno and District Electric Construction Company. Work restarted in 1907 and the line from Llandudno to Rhos-on-Sea was soon ready. On 26 September 1907 the company got permission for services to start, and it opened on 19 October 1907. The section of line to Colwyn Bay, top of Station Road was completed by 7 June 1908 and the final extension to Old Colwyn was opened in 1915. In 1913 the Gloddaeth Avenue (West Shore) to Dale Road was abandoned and the Colwyn Bay - Old Colwyn section was closed in September 1930, being cut back to Abergele Road/Greenfield Road corner on the (then A55).

Her newborn child inspired her to sing the song \\"√âdes kisfiam\\" (My Sweet Little Son) to the tune of the Italian instrumental hit Soleado, which became one of her major hits. In the 1980s, she disappeared from the musical and public life. She claimed that she had been victim of professional jealousy which surrounded her.

During the series, parodies of Serial have targeted several of the show's aspects, including the podcast's sponsor (especially the meme \\"MailKimp\\").  Mandrill controversy  In February 2016, Mailchimp announced it was merging Mandrill transactional email service into Mailchimp as an add-on feature, and gave customers 60 days' notice to switch to the new pricing structure or find an alternative service platform. The new pricing structure required a paid Mailchimp plan before being able to purchase Mandrill credits, resulting in customers paying for two products in order to access Mandrill. Previously, customers were able to purchase Mandrill credits for sending emails without signing up on Mailchimp. The credits were originally priced at $9.95 for 25,000 emails but increased to $20 for the same number of emails under the new pricing scheme. In addition to needing to purchase Mandrill credits, customers now need to be on a paid Mailchimp monthly plan (the minimum monthly plan being $10 a month), even if the customer has no need for Mailchimp services and only wants access to Mandrill.

White moves first. Hexdame (or HexDame) is a strategy board game for two players invented by Christian Freeling in 1979. The game is a literal adaptation of the game international draughts (checkers or DameIn most non-English languages, draughts is called dames or a similar term that refers to ladies. (For more background on word dames, see Draughts#Naming.)) to a hexagonal gameboard. Game overview The Hexdame board is a regular hexagon consisting of 61 cells, with each player having 16 men in the initial setup as shown. A man can move forward one step to an adjacent empty cell (three directions for moving), or can capture an enemy piece on an adjacent cell by jumping in the same line to the empty cell immediately beyond it (six directions for capturing). A king's movement and jumping are along rows of adjacent hex cells (six directions - two vertical and four oblique). Other than the above, the rules for Hexdame can be taken directly from those for international draughts (checkers). For convenience, these have been summarized below. (Else see International draughts#Rules.) Summary of international draughts rules * White moves first, then moves alternate; a player may not pass (skip) a turn. * Men move forwards (not backwards). If a man reaches the last row of the board (the row nearest his opponent) at the conclusion of a move, it promotes to king; the promoted man is crowned for identification as king by placing a second checker of the same colour on top. * Jumping (capturing) is mandatory, including making multiple jumps if available. If there are jumping options, the player must always select the option that captures the maximum number of the opponent's pieces (men or kings); if two options capture the same number, the player may choose. * A multi-jump can consist of single jumps having a combination of different directions. * Pieces jumped in a multi-jump are removed from the board only after the jumping move is complete. * A king can make a flying king move (move any number of contiguous empty cells) or capture (capture a piece any number of empty cells' distance away). * When a king jumps, it may land on any empty cell beyond the jumped piece. (Unless there is a requirement to land on a particular cell, in order to continue jumping according to the rule mandating that all jumps capture maximum pieces.) * During a multi-jump, a piece may not be jumped more than once. (Empty cells, however, may be visited or jumped any number of times.) * A player whose pieces all become captured, or is unable to make a legal move, loses the game. * If the players agree, or if the same position repeats three times with the same player having the move, the game is a draw. Strategy differences Though Hexdame precisely mirrors the rules of international draughts, the hex board geometry introduces important differences in play dynamic: * Greater complexity, since men have three directions for moving forward, instead of two; and kings have six directions of movement, instead of four on the 10√ó10 board. * A single man cannot thwart an opponent's man from advancing through the threat of being jumped, as it can in international draughts, since the opponent will always have another option for moving forward. * Each side has nine possible promotion cells on the hex board (versus five on the 10√ó10 orthogonal board). * Draws are fewer, since three kings defeat one king in Hexdame. (Three kings versus one in international draughts is a declaration of draw; four are usually needed.)

He received a BA in Judicial Law from the University of Tehran, and since then he had been lived in Tehran. He died on 13 March 2017 at the age of 92.  Early life  Public life Abdol Ali (Adib) Boroumand was born on June 1924 in Gaz, Borkhar, Esfahan, Persia (now Iran). His father was a historian and a writer, while his mother was interested in education and culture. At the age of six, Adib gained literacy. He began to attend school at the age of eight, and eventually earned his high school diploma, while studying literature. He began writing prose at the age of sixteen, eventually creating poems, and forming an interest in poems written by constitutionalists. Mohammad Mosaddegh, the founder of the National Front and the overthrown Prime Minister of Iran. Adib was a supporter of Mosaddegh's movement. Mosaddegh gifted this image to Adib. The text on the image: \\"Dedicated to Mr. Adib Boroumand. Prison of 2nd Armorial Division, Tir 20 1333 [July 11, 1954]. He began his political career during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He wrote about Iranian nationalism, while criticizing the rule of Reza Shah and calling it a dictatorship. He also criticized the invading forces by writing against capitalism and promoting nationalism and patriotism. His poems could be found in print while reading Tehran's newspapers at the time. During this time, he published his first book, titled Groaning of Homeland. Its popularity led him to gain the title of the \\"National Poet of Iran\\". After the war, Adib obtained his bachelor's degree in judicial law from the University of Tehran, while still studying literature and learning French and Arabic. He then began to write about what he believed to be a need for reform in Persia, acquainting himself with political parties and politicians in the nation. He then wrote his second book named Iran Opera in Tumult, a controversial piece of writing which complained about the bad conditions that many people believed were in place in the country at the time. Adib refused his appointment to public prosecutor in the Ardabil Administration of Justice, instead becoming an independent lawyer an eventually becoming a lawyer for the Iranian national bank. He also refused offers for any position in government. During the Iran crisis of 1946, Adib once again became politically active by writing in opposition to the Azerbaijani Democratic Party and Ja'far Pishevari, even though he had previously established close relations to the communist Tudeh Party of Iran. Adib became a strong supporter of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh's national movement and his nationalizing of the oil industry, along with many other Iranians at the time. He also created many poems in favour of Mosaddegh. His poems were used as propaganda by Mosaddegh's government and supporters by being read out on radio broadcasts and passed out on paper pamphlets. During the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, Adib, alongside the National Front, fought against the newly established regime. He called Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule a \\"dictatorship\\", which landed him in prison. He was then jailed two more times.

Its old alignment was replaced by NC 22 (now US 301) to Lumberton and then NC 70 (now NC 41). In 1928, its southern terminus was rerouted again from Elizabethtown to Delco, replacing NC 231; its old route to Whiteville became part of NC 23 (now US 701). In 1929, its northern terminus was extended on new primary routing to Creedmoor, ending at US 15/NC 75. From 1929-1932, NC 21 was rerouted several times through downtown Raleigh.

Unauthorised use of any of our brands potentially damages both their reputation and that of Merlin as a whole, and we will always take whatever steps are required to stop such use.\\" In August 2012 The Times of India reported that the state urban development department had identified a two-acre plot, alongside the Hooghly River, belonging to the Kolkata Port Trust.

Hakim said the department had already acquired land for the project, and that as well as selecting private players for the project, the government also intended to get in touch with UK-based experts for technical assistance.Govt to start mission Kolkata Eye today In May 2014, by which time overall height had been reduced to and estimated cost had risen three-fold to 300 crore rupees, Banerjee said in a Facebook post \\"It is already underway and is expected to be ready in a year's time.\\" However, Hakim stated that \\"The project will be completed within 18 months of the date of commissioning,\\" with commissioning likely to occur in three months, while urban development department officials estimated construction would take about two years.UK firm to build London eye The Telegraph reported that the bid to build the attraction was won by a UK-based firm on 21 May. According to Hakim, the CMDA, Calcutta Port Trust, which is providing the land for the project, and the UK- based firm, formed a consortium to set up the structure. The Telegraph also reported that Sun Consultancy Investment and Consortium was selected through a tendering process in which the only other bidder was an unnamed Bhubaneswar- based company.

American Fisheries Society: Bethesda, MD (USA). . IX, 526 + cd-rom pp. Description The small, bluish-white shell has an elongate-ovate shape and is semitranslucent. The length of the shell measures 2 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which half of the tilted edge of the last volution only projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded and feebly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by very slender, poorly developed, decidedly retractive, axial ribs, of which about 30 occur between the sutures upon the last two volutions. In addition to these axial ribs, the whorls are marked by low, feebly rounded, rather broad spiral cords, of which 6 occur between the sutures, on the second, and 7 upon the third and fourth whorl. The spaces separating the spiral cords are narrow, impressed lines. The intersections of the axial ribs and spiral cords form weak tubercles, while the spaces enclosed between them are roundish pits. The sutures are moderately constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by a cord equaling the one posterior to it in width, and separated from that by a line as wide as those on the spire. The base is moderately prolonged and well rounded. It is marked with 12 low, rounded spiral cords, which decrease successively in width from the periphery, anteriorly. The spaces separating these cords are also narrow impressed lines. The oval aperture is moderately large. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is strongly curved showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is slightly curved, oblique, reflected over and adnate to the base. It is provided with a slender fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.

The whorls of the protoconch are small and deeply, obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The six whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, rather high between the sutures, and slightly shouldered at the summit. They are crossed by numerous fine, decidedly retractive lines of growth. The spiral sculpture is strong on the early whorls, becoming gradually finer with the growth of the shell. The first two turns are divided into five, almost equal areas by four equally, strongly incised, spiral Iines, between the sutures. On the third whorl the spiral lines are increased to about a dozen and are considerably less strong; on the succeeding turn they are probably almost tripled and still weaker; while on the penultimate volution the sculpture consists of somewhat wavy, closely spaced, spiral striations. The periphery of the body whorl is obscurely angulated, and somewhat inflated. The base of the shell is moderately long, curving gently to the anterior portion of the shell. It is marked like the body whorl with fine, spiral lines. The sutures are somewhat constricted. The oval aperture is moderately large. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip is rather long, slightly curved, and somewhat revolute. It is provided with a strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.

(The whorls of the protoconch are decollated.) The whorls of the teleoconch are flattened on their outer three-fourths, rounding suddenly to the closely appressed summit, on the posterior fourth. The entire surface of the shell is marked by lines of growth and numerous equal and equally spaced, well marked spiral striations, of which about 28 occur between the sutures of the penultimate whorl. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery of the body whorl is somewhat angulated. The base of the shell is elongated, rounded, and marked like the spire. The aperture is ovate, and slightly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is short, strongly curved and reflected. It is reinforced for the greater part by the attenuated base and provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.Dall, William Healy & Bartsch, Paul (December 13, 1909). \\"A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks\\".

The whorls of the protoconch are obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects, which is marked by three strongly elevated spiral threads. The six whorls of the protoconch are well-rounded, moderately contracted at the sutures, and strongly slopingly shouldered. They are marked by weak rounded axial ribs which are best developed near the edges of the shoulder. Of these ribs about 24 are indicated on the. first turn, 18 upon the second to fourth, and 20 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial sculpture the whorls are marked between the sutures by a number of spiral keels of diverse strength, of which 4 occur upon the first and second, 5 upon the third, 6 upon the fourth and the penultimate whorl. Of these spiral ridges the second one below the summit is the strongest and marks the angle of the shoulder. The junction of the ribs and cords form feeble nodules best shown at the shoulder. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a low cord. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by four low, broad cords and seven exceedingly fine incised lines, the latter about the umbilical area. The narrow, strongly incised grooves which separate the cords are crossed by numerous fine axial threads, which give them a pitted appearance. The aperture is oval, and slightly effuse anteriorly.

It has an elongate-ovate shape. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, and deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the turns of the teleoconch above which the tilted edge of the last volution only projects. The spire of the protoconch is so obliquely placed that it gives the apex of the shell a truncated appearance. The 4.8 whorls of the teleoconch are very slightly rounded, and not appressed at the summit. They are marked by rather strong, and deeply incised spiral lines ; one a little heavier than the rest is situated a little below the summit and gives to this the appearance of being slightly keeled. In addition to this sculpture the whorls are marked by rather coarse lines of growth. The periphery of the body whorl is angulated. The base of the shell is short, well rounded, and lacks an umbilicus. It is marked by the continuation of the axial ribs and incised spiral lines which equal those on the spire in strength. The aperture is pear-shaped. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is slightly curved, reflected over and appressed to the base for its posterior two-thirds. It is provided with a strong, oblique fold opposite the umbilical chink. The parietal wall is covered with a heavy callus.P.

Description The milk-white shell has an elongate-conic shape. Its length measures 6.5 mm. It is umbilicated. The whorls of the protoconch are small, obliquely immersed in the first of the turns of the teleoconch, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The seven whorls of the teleoconch moderately rounded, with a narrow tabulatedly shouldered summit. They are marked by equally spaced, rather strong, spiral striations, of which about 32 occur between the summit and the periphery on the penultimate turn. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are inflated, and well rounded. They are marked with spiral sculpture equal in strength and disposition to that on the spire. The sutures are strongly impressed. In addition to the spiral sculpture, the whorls are marked with curved retractive lines of growth. The aperture is pear-shaped. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip is slender, curved, and somewhat revolute. It is provided with a strong oblique fold a little anterior to its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thick callus. Paul Bartsch (1912), Additions to the West American Pyramidellid Mollusk Fauna with Descriptions of New Species, Proc.

Sea shells of Tropical West America. Marine mollusks from Baja California to Per√∫. (2nd edit.). Stanford University Press pp. 1064: Description The bluish-white shell is of medium size and has an elongate- ovate shape. Its length measures 2.8 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are deeply immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, which gives the apex a truncated appearance. The 5.8 whorls of the teleoconch are appressed at the summit, the later ones overhanging. They are marked by exceedingly strong, very distantly spaced axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the second and third, 14 upon the fourth, and 12 upon the penultimate turn. These ribs are well rounded and have a slightly retractive slant. The spiral sculpture consists of five raised bands, which are a little wider than the spaces that separate them. The first of these is at the appressed summit of the whorls, while the fifth is immediately posterior to the angulated periphery (for in the adolescent stage, as shown by the overhanging portion of the whorls the periphery is angulated, though this is not the case in the body whorl of the adult shell). While these raised threads pass upon the sides of the ribs they do not pass over their summit in sufficient strength to render these tuberculated. The spiral pits between the axial ribs and spiral threads appear as oblong impressions, their long diameter being parallel with the spiral sculpture. The suture is rather poorly marked, not at all channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is slightly produced, well rounded, narrowly umbilicated. It is marked by the continuations of the axial ribs, which extend feebly almost to the umbilical region, and eight spiral threads, of which the first two below the periphery are as strong as those occurring on the spire, while the rest become successively weaker and more flat anteriorly. The aperture is ear-shaped. The posterior angle is decidedly channeled. The outer lip is thin and slightly reflected. The inner lip is curved, somewhat sinuous and slightly reflected over the umbilicus. The parietal wall is covered by a very strong callus, which is free at the parietal wall covered by a very strong callus, which is free at the edge and renders the peristome complete by connecting the posterior angle of the aperture with the insertion of the columella.P.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History Tramway schemes in Lytham St. Annes had been proposed since 1878, but no progress was made until The Blackpool, St. Annes and Lytham Tramway Order of 1896. Under this order, a tramway was constructed from the terminus of the Blackpool tramway at South Shore Railway Station. The new line opened on 11 July 1896, operated by the British Gas Traction Company.The Belfast News- Letter, Monday, 13 July 1896 The extension to Lytham opened in February 1897, and the fleet of compressed coal gas trams eventually reached 20. The gas powered trams were not successful, and horse cars were also obtained. The scheme was eventually unsuccessful and the company sold out. The Blackpool, St. Annes and Lytham Tramways Company purchased the assets of the former company for ¬£115,000 (), and in 1900 an act authorised an electric tramway to rebuild the route. The newly electrified tramway was opened on 28 May 1903.The Tramways of Lytham St. Annes, Donald F. Phillips, The Tramway Review, VOl. 2, Issue 14, 1954. On 28 October 1920 St. Annes Council purchased the assets of the company for ¬£132,279 (). The trams were rebranded with the inscription \\"St Annes Council Tramways\\". In 1922 the borough of Lytham St. Annes was incorporated. The trams were re-branded with \\"Lytham St. Annes\\" and later \\"Lytham St. Annes Corporation\\" Future It is hoped that the Blackpool Tramway could be extended south to Lytham St Anne's from the current terminus at Starr Gate.

The remainder of the system closed on 28 April 1937. Lytham 43 is being restored by its private owner and once the lower saloon is complete. It is expected to be transferred to Blackpool where it will ultimately be finished as an open balcony double deck car in fully operational condition, as a valuable addition to the town's heritage tram fleet. The first stage has been to put together the surviving parts and to reassemble the bottom deck, and this is already at an advanced stage.

In 1841, Christie was for a short time private secretary to Lord Minto at the admiralty, and from April 1842 to November 1847 represented Weymouth as Member of Parliament. In 1843 he proposed a Bill for removing the religious tests in the old universities; it was quickly defeated.The London Library and the Circulation of French Fiction in the 1840s J Atkinson - Information & Culture, 2013 -Martha McMackin Garland, Cambridge before Darwin: the ideal of a liberal education, 1800‚Äì1860 (1980), p. 77; Google Books. In 1844 he proposed a motion in order to allow presence of \\"strangers\\" (journalists) in the House of Commons and the recognition of the right of the journalists to publish reports on the Parliamentary debates. This motion was defeated. Hansard, 12 February 1844 In May 1848 Christie was appointed consul-general in the Mosquito Territory, and from 1851 to 1854 was secretary of legation, frequently acting as charg√© d'affaires, to the Swiss Confederation. In 1854, Christie was made consul- general to the Argentine Republic, and in 1856 minister plenipotentiary. In 1858, he was despatched on a special mission to Paraguay, and in 1859 became envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Empire of Brazil. This post involved him in constant difficulties with the Brazilian government, partly arising from his efforts to enforce the treaties relating to the slave trade, and partly from claims for compensation on the part of British subjects. Christie's position wasn't helped by a quarrel at cards with James Watson Webb, the American ambassador, at the Russian embassy. The situation came to a head in 1863 when Christie sent an ultimatum for reparations for two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862.See: * ; * ; * . The Brazilian government refused to yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity.See: * ;  .

He then made two unsuccessful attempts to re-enter parliament, at Cambridge in 1865 and Greenock in 1868. After a serious illness, he died in Marylebone on 27 July 1874.

In the Introductory Note on the ballot he sketched the earlier parliamentary history from his own perspective: George Grote had introduced a motion on it in 1833, and up to 1839 there had been increasing support, with Thomas Babington Macaulay arguing on its side. Henry George Ward took up the cause in 1842, when Grote no longer was an MP. James Mill and Fonblanque were supporters in print; William Empson and John Allen were encouraging about the initial essay of 1839. Only Sydney Smith's witty barbs are mentioned on the other side of the argument.William Dougal Christie, The Ballot, and Corruption and Expenditure at Elections, essays (1872), pp. 4‚Äì5; archive.org. Christie revisited his diplomatic career in Notes on Brazilian Questions (1865). In retirement he concentrated on the history and literature of the seventeenth century. He had in 1859 edited a volume of original documents illustrating the life of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury up to 1660, and in 1871 he published a complete if partisan biography, largely based on the posthumous papers of Shaftesbury and John Locke, and other manuscripts. He wrote a memoir of John Dryden, prefixed to his edition published in the Globe series (1870). In 1874 Christie edited the correspondence of Sir Joseph Williamson, Charles II's secretary of state, for the Camden Society. Christie became involved in a personal controversy with Abraham Hayward, who had attacked the memory of John Stuart Mill; it included a now-mysterious incident in the whist room of the Athenaeum Club in May 1873.

The highway traveled from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1), now May Street, northward through portions of Manly and Southern Pines to an intersection with NC 22 (now US 1). The highway was first listed as part of the Moore County road system by at least 1930. The route was improved to a paved surface by 1936. NC 2A was numbered sometime between 1945 and 1949. By 1952, it was cancelled and Highway 2 was designated over the route. It has since been numbered Secondary Road 2029 (SR 2029). Route description In 1951, NC 2A started at an at-grade intersection with US 1 (North May Street) in the southern portion of the community of Manly. From there, the highway ran northwesterly across the Seaboard Air Line Railroad to an intersection with a primitive trail (now Clark Street) in Southern Pines. The roadway continued northwestward to a bridge over a small, unnamed creek (now nonexistent). Turning slightly westward, the road proceeded to its northern terminus, an intersection with NC 2 (now an interchange with US 1). History By 1930, a highway in the location of NC 2A was added to the Moore County Highway System as a class C road, a county highway of the lowest importance. The entire length of the route was graded with an earthen surface, as was much of the highway system. During the mid-1930s, the route was designated as a primary county highway. The route was shifted slightly northerly and had been extended to approximately in length, as well as being improved to an asphalt surface. Between then and 1938, the route's southern terminus was shifted southward and the entire length of the highway was resurfaced as bituminous. Between 1945 and 1949, NC 2A was designated along Yadkin Road as a connector route between NC 2 and US 1. During that same period the route was also slightly straightened near its southern terminus. By 1952, NC 2A was decommissioned and replaced by NC 2. The road was shortened to in length, and its entire length was paved. NC 2's route was replaced by NC 22. By the next year, Yadkin Road has been shifted to its current location. Before 1972, NC 2 was rerouted away from Yadkin Road and the route had been designated as SR 2029.

He was born in Mercer, Waikato, New Zealand in 1886.  Family life  He was born on 29 July 1886 to Mary Ashley (died 16 Nov 1942, aged 82), who moved from Shropshire in 1898, and (Caesar) Henry Roose (died 29 July 1925, aged 77), who moved from Germany in the 1880s, Their eldest son, Caesar junior, helped on the Tuoro Island (in the Waikato River) family farm until he lost an appeal against military service and had to go to Trentham and Featherston military camps in 1918. In 1913, as his shipping business flourished, he had a 5-bedroomed kauri house built on Tuoro Island. His younger brother, Maurice, who was also qualified as an engineer on small launches, was wounded in World War I and died in 1922. His sister, Mary, married Eric F. Taylor, of Papatoetoe and lived in Claudelands. On 3 March 1931 Roose married Australian-born Gladys Ethel Fortescue Wiseman (n√©e Hoare) at Glendale, California; their only child, a daughter, Jeanette Thomas, was born in 1934. He spent his honeymoon observing oil wells and shipping in the United States and Europe. Caesar and Gladys divorced in 1946, a year after her mother died, and on 8 April 1947 he married Fanny Hill (died 1956) in Auckland; there were no children of this marriage. He died in Epsom on 6 July 1967, survived by his daughter. He is buried at Mercer public cemetery.  Shipping  Caesar borrowed ¬£100 to buy his first boat in 1902. In 1904 he ordered the Rawhiti from the shipbuilders Bailey and Lowe, of Auckland. He had a motor launch in 1908. He earned his river steamer master's certificate in 1909, his engineer's certificate in 1911 and started a regular shipping service between Port Waikato and Cambridge in 1915, but became the representative for a new cooperative, the Waikato Shipping Company (WSC), selling his 2 steamers, 3 launches and 7 barges to them in 1916. In 1918 he built and launched the Aurora to cater for picnickers, duck-shooters and fishermen. When WSC went into liquidation in 1922, Roose Shipping Co was formed to buy all the viable assets, including the Huntly coal mine and 6 vessels, which continued regular services on the Waikato and its tributaries. The largest in the fleet was the 1894 400-passenger steamer, Manuwai, brought from the Whanganui in 1920. In 1924 it ran a Cambridge to Port Waikato excursion 2 or 3 times a year, taking 12 to 14 hours downstream and a few hours longer upstream. Manuwai sank at her moorings in 1938, but was taken to Mercer for repair in 1939, where she was converted to a barge. In 1924 Caesar visited Glasgow, where he ordered a , long, wide, steamer, with a wide stern paddle, also named Rawhiti, assembled at Mercer in 1925. She was able to steam at in still water. Rawhiti and Manuwai carried passengers and goods. In 1926 the Company assembled a steam tug to tow barges. The hulks of former steamers of the Caesar Roose fleet, lie on the Waikato bank opposite Mercer - 2019 photo Trade on the river was also helped by improvements to Hamilton wharf, by Northern Steamship starting a Port Waikato-Onehunga route in 1926 and by Holm Shipping linking to Lyttelton in 1923. Services were disrupted in 1927 by low river levels, partly caused by filling Arapuni. Whilst on honeymoon in Germany in 1931, Caesar bought the Argus (later the Holmglen - not the later ship which sank, MV Holmglen) on behalf of Holm Shipping, in which he was a major shareholder, until Union Steam Ship took control of it. He began a ferry at Mercer in 1932. By 1939 there were 4 ships and a dozen barges. The timetabled services ended in 1946 and the Rawhiti was converted to a barge. In 1947 an American tank-landing ship became the third of Caesar's ships to be named Rawhiti. It could carry 3,000 tons of cargo to Australia and the Pacific islands and Roose liked its roll on/roll off capability as a means of avoiding the cost of unionised stevedores. In 1948 he founded C. Roose (Fiji) Ltd, but, after the 1951 waterfront dispute, sold the Rawhiti. Several of the old steamers remain under, or beside the river, including the Manuwai, 1925 Rawhiti and Freetrader, on the west bank just south of Mercer.  Other businesses  Caesar took several photos for the Auckland Weekly News between 1905 and 1908. In 1906 he bought a flax mill on the Waikato. By 1922 he had a timber mill at Mercer and also Katikati, later supplying a box factory in Tauranga with kahikatea. In 1933 he patented the Roose‚ÄìAtkins Grab, used for coaling ships, loading and unloading barges, and salvage work; Roose Shipping Co manufactured the grabs in a workshop on Tuoro Island. The Roose Shipping Co bought a coal mine in 1922, started an open-cast one in 1945, built Fairfield Bridge (1937), helped to build NgƒÅruawƒÅhia bridge (1956) and formed a trucking fleet.  Public life  He unsuccessfully stood for election to Mercer Town Board in 1914. His lifelong association with Te Puea Herangi began at Mercer School and, in 1921, he helped transport her and about 170 of her people from Mangatawhiri to T≈´rangawaewae. In 1924 Caesar was appointed to a provisional board to control the river. During the 1960s he campaigned vigorously for the dredging of the Waikato, in 1939 campaigned for a dam at Taupo and always supported building a Waiuku‚ÄìWaikato canal.

This includes \\"shipmasters, officers, cadets, ratings, yacht crew, VTS officers, harbourmasters, river boatmen, nautical college lecturers, maritime lawyers and even ship-based medical personnel.\\". History Nautilus traces its roots back more than 150 years, when the Mercantile Marine Service Association was founded in 1857 in response to the harsh laws of the 1850 Merchant Shipping Act. In 1936, the MMSA merged with the Imperial Merchant Service Guild and retained its name. Six years later, it became a member of the Officers‚Äô Federation, which was established in 1928 in an attempt to foster cooperation between all the organisations representing British and Commonwealth officers. Meanwhile, the Association of Wireless Telegraphists was established in 1912 in response to the growing use of telegraphy at sea. Mergers and name changes down the years culminated in the formation of the Radio and Electronic Officers' Union (REOU) in 1967. Representation for ships' engineers began in the late 19th century, and two unions came together to form the Marine Engineers‚Äô Association (MEA) in 1899. The Navigating & Engineer Officers' Union (NEOU) was born in the mid-1930s and in 1956, following more than a decade of cooperation on issues of common concern, the MEA and the NEOU joined to form the Merchant Navy & Airline Officers' Association (MNAOA).  NUMAST to Nautilus International  In 1985, the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers (NUMAST) was established through a merger between the MMSA, REOU and MNAOA. The union formerly included aviation personnel, such as flight navigators and flight engineers, however these members were transferred to BALPA, the airline pilots' union by 1990. In 2006, the Union became a partner with the Dutch union Federatie van Werknemers in de Zeevaart and, on 2 October 2006, changed its name to \\"Nautilus UK\\" to reflect the increasing globalisation of shipping in the new millennium. FWZ became Nautilus NL at the same time. The two unions also launched of the Nautilus Federation, through which Nautilus NL and Nautilus UK worked closely together on an industrial and political level. In 2008, members of Nautilus UK and Nautilus NL voted overwhelmingly in favour of proposals to create a new single trans-boundary union for maritime professionals. Nautilus International was born on 15 May 2009. In 2011, Swiss maritime professionals and boatmen, formally represented by Swiss union Unia, voted to join Nautilus International. In 2015, FNV Waterbouw also became part of the union.

He was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1901. He was a gifted middle-distance runner and came from a family of athletes, but lacked ambition and hardly ever trained. In his first year of competitive running, he won a three-mile race at Wellington's Basin Reserve with so much ease that he jumped the finish tape. Disqualified by officials, he became an instant celebrity. He was Wellington champion in 1922, the New Zealand champion in the following year, and the Australasian champion in 1924. He missed the 1924 Summer Olympics as he had been operated for appendicitis in March 1924. When American runner Lloyd Hahn, who had come sixth in the 1500 metres at the Olympics, visited Wellington, they had five one-mile races. In front of crowds of up to 16,000, Hahn won the first race. This spurred Rose on to train for the first time in his life, and he won the four subsequent races. In the fourth race, he set a British Empire record. The New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association held national fund- raising events to be able to send Rose to Europe to compete there, and while he broke the French record over 3000 metres in 1926, he was then struck by influenza and missed all the important races. Rose did not want to go to the 1928 Summer Olympics; he declared himself \\"unavailable\\". He retired to his farm, did some more running for New Zealand, but finally retired in 1931 due to painful varicose veins. Rose married his cousin, Doreen Burkitt Rose, on 8 August 1931 at Masterton; they were to have three children. He farmed with his brother near Whangam≈çmona in Taranaki. Rose was a shy and private man who would later work in Inglewood. His wife died in 1977. In the same year, he was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. He died on 4 March 1989 at Bell Block. Rose made the New Zealand public interested in running, and inspired many others to take up athletics.

He had earlier served as the ambassador of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to the English court (May 1550 to October 1553). Early life Jean was the son of Jean Scheyfve and Jeanne de Berchem. He studied at Leuven University, graduating doctor of law.Vander Linden, Herman, \\"Scheyfve (Jean)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 21 (Brussels, 1913), 707-710.

In 1548 he was appointed to the Brussels Privy Council. Ambassador to England Scheyfve was resident ambassador at the courts of Edward VI and Mary I of England. His letters are mostly concerned with commercial issues and rarely say much of the doctrinal religious controversies in England. Scheyfve was sent to London before the departure of the previous ambassador, Fran√ßois van der Delft, in May 1550. London was not regarded as a good posting in the diplomatic community and he thought his mission would last only three months.Tyler, Royall, ed., Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.10 (1914), preface p.xi-lxi. Scheyfve and Princess Mary Edward VI mentioned Scheyfve once in his journal, writing that the Imperial ambassador came to him on 5 September 1551, asking that his sister, the Princess Mary, should be allowed to attend the Mass and have her household officers restored to her. As the changes to Mary's household had happened so recently, Scheyfve's master Charles V could not have authorised him to make the request, so Scheyfve was refused. It was said that Edward VI was acting in his rights by English law, and Philip Hoby, the ambassador to the Emperor, had reported the understanding on the matter of the Mass was not as Scheyfve represented it.Jordan, W. K., ed., The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI, London (1966), 80 After speaking to Princess Mary, Scheyfve sent a letter to Charles V on 12 September describing the incident in detail. Mary had felt compelled to dismiss her chaplains. On 5 September, Scheyfve had first addressed the Earl of Warwick who deferred to Edward VI in person, considering the King was now of age. Warwick and the Marquess of Northampton discussed his business with Edward while Scheyfve was not present, and then told him Edward thought he ought to be satisfied with the answer already given. Mary would not be allowed to hear the Mass with her ladies, and although Scheyfve said Nicholas Wotton and William Paget had made a promise otherwise to Charles V, they and Hoby denied this was possible. The three men from her household would not be reinstated. Scheyfve had to tell Mary not to practice the Catholic religion.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.10 (1914), pp.356‚Äì364. Mary's three household servants at Kenninghall in High Suffolk, mentioned by Scheyfve were a chaplain, Pooly and Lyonel. In July 1549 the English Privy council had heard that they were somehow involved in Kett's Rebellion nearby in Norfolk. Mary replied that it was a case of mistaken identities. Her chaplain, Dr Hopton and the Comptroller of her household had been summoned before the council in June over matters of religion.Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol.2 part 2, Oxford (1822), 238‚Äì9, 276‚Äì8. The Princess Elizabeth In November 1550, Scheyfve heard that Lord Warwick would divorce his wife and marry the Princess Elizabeth. When Scheyfve heard in January 1551 that the Venetian and French ambassadors had paid their respects to Elizabeth at court, he asked if he might do the same. The Treasurer and Admiral said they would ask, and consulted with Warwick. They told Scheyfve that Edward was busy with Elizabeth, so Scheyfve left the court, saying, \\"Some other time then.\\" In June 1551 he was told of a plan that she would marry the Duke of Enghien, the brother of Antoine de Bourbon. A portrait of Elizabeth had been hastily made and sent to France with Philip Hoby and Thomas Goodrich, Bishop of Ely. In July there were rumours Elizabeth would marry the Duke of Aumale brother of the Duke of Guise or the Prince of Denmark. In March 1552 he heard she refused to marry the recently widowed Earl of Pembroke, and he guessed the Duke of Northumberland was directing his suit.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.10 (1914), 186, 203, 299, 325, 493. News of Sebastian Cabot Scheyfve wrote to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, Bishop of Arras on 10 April 1553, with news of a voyage planned by Sebastian Cabot. Three ships would sail north from Harwich by the \\"Frozen sea\\" to \\"Camchina.\\" The plan was to trade English kersey cloth and velvet for spices. Scheyfve had spoken to Cabot and pointed out that China ought to be a possession of the Empire. Cabot replied that he would like to have an audience with Charles V regarding his future employment by the Empire. A month later Scheyfve found himself discussing this voyage with a Portuguese messenger. Cabot did not sail with these ships himself, and continued to discuss employment with Charles V. An offer from Charles arrived on the day of Edward VI's death, which Scheyfve was therefore unable to refer to the English court. Later, as Cabot had a salary from the English crown, and was well-respected in England, Scheyfve and his colleague Simon Renard considered that detaching him from Mary's service might foster ill-will.Royall, Tyler, ed., Calendar State Papers Spanish, vol.11 (1916), pp.30‚Äì32, 38‚Äì39, 51, 204‚Äì5. Edward's illness Scheyfve's letters detail the progress of Edward VI's illness. On 12 May Scheyfve reported to his master that he had a tumour on the lung and broke out in ulcers. At the end of May, the King was wasting away daily and not expected to live. It was thought to be the same sickness that had killed his half-brother, the Duke of Richmond. In June, the people of London were told that he was better, but Scheyfve knew these rumours were not believed and the nobility were preparing for a struggle. At court there were rumours that Edward had been poisoned, on the day that Princess Mary last visited him. Edward was shown to a crowd from a window at Greenwich Palace on 27 June. On 4 July, Scheyfve heard of the will that made Lady Jane Grey his heir. Scheyfve was joined by three colleagues on 7 July and news of the death of Edward was certain. The Imperial ambassadors were officially informed of the King's death on 10 July by William Petre and William Cecil.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.11 (1916), 40, 45, 48, 69, 70, 75. Queen Jane The four Imperial ambassadors acted of behalf of Princess Mary's cousin, Charles V. While they waited to be informed who was now the monarch of England, by 10 July 1553 they had heard Princess Mary had been proclaimed Queen in Norfolk, news which had made Jane's mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Duchess of Northumberland weep. They were wary of the Venetian ambassador, Giacomo Soranzo, who had tried to canvas Scheyfve's reaction to the news, and avoided communicating with Mary so as not to raise suspicions against her. George Brooke, Lord Cobham, and John Mason told the ambassadors their mission had ended at Edward's death, but they argued it had not, referring particularly to the assurances of international friendship made by Andrew Dudley. They repeated this argument to Jane's Privy Council, and then were constrained to tell Cobham and Mason they would leave on 20 July, as insisting on remaining would have been suspicious. On 19 July Mary was proclaimed, to rejoicing in London, and Mason, now accompanied by the Earl of Shrewsbury, asked them to stay in London.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol.1 (1916), 82‚Äì93, 95‚Äì6, 104. Queen Mary Charles V recalled Scheyfve, whom he called the Master of Requests, and his colleague ambassadors, the Chevaliers Jean de Montmorency Sieur de Courri√©res, and Jacques de Marnix Sieur de Tholouse, on 14 September 1553, nominating Simon Renard, the Lieutenant of Aumont, as their successor in England. Simon Renard had recently written to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, Bishop of Arras, noting Scheyfve's jealousy when Renard was spokesman and minute-taker for the four ambassadors during their audiences with Mary. Renard, not Scheyfve, was entrusted with sounding out Mary's marriage to Philip II of Spain.CSP Foreign Mary, (1861), 12: CSP Spanish, vol.11, (1916), 212‚Äì4, 228, 231‚Äì232. Later career On his return from England Scheyfve resumed his duties as a privy councillor. He was appointed Chancellor of Brabant on 17 February 1557. During the Iconoclastic Fury of 1566, Calvinists seized power in 's-Hertogenbosch, one of the four chief cities of Brabant. Scheyfve attempted to negotiate with them, but for several weeks in March and April 1567 effectively became a hostage in the city. He did not support the Duke of Alva's response to the Dutch Revolt, and in 1576 backed the Pacification of Ghent as a basis for restoring peace to the Low Countries. With the failure of conciliation he retired as chancellor on 26 November 1579. A collection of his letters on a controversy with Granvelle, who was now a Cardinal, was published in 1580. In 1575 he commissioned the sculptor Jacques Jonghelinck to make his portrait medallion, which shows him wearing a cuirass and mantle with the motto \\"danger.\\" Jonghelinck also made a portrait medal for his literary opponent Granvelle. Jean Scheyfve died in Antwerp on 13 July 1581 and was buried in Antwerp Cathedral.

The most obvious routes for this invasion would be through the Khyber Pass or Bolan Pass, and thus it was suggested that strategic railways be built in both of these passes. In 1879, a reconnaissance survey was conducted with an aim to find the feasibility of laying railways through the Khyber Pass and Bolan Pass (Sind‚ÄìPishin State Railway) to thwart any Russian invasion. In 1905, the North Western State Railway began construction of the line at the village of Kacha Garhi, located between Peshawar and Jamrud.

In 1932, the Landi Kotal to Landi Khana section of railway was closed down at the insistence of Afghan government. Regularly scheduled rail service continued between Peshawar and Landi Kotal until 1982, due lack of commercial value.

Biography Early life He was born in Oystermouth, Glamorganshire, Wales in 1864. His family migrated to New Zealand when he was eight years old and grew up in the Auckland suburb of Newton. Upon completing his education, Rosser became a builder by trade. Whilst working as a carpenter he married Sarah Louisa Craig on 30 November 1886. Trade union career After he was blacklisted by conservative building contractors due to his links with the Liberal Party, Rosser took up a new career as a union organiser, the first in Auckland. Within twelve years he was involved in the formation of nine new trade unions and was himself the secretary of many of them, demonstrating a skill for arbitration. Over time arbitration was overtaken by collective bargaining as most new unionists favored method. As a result, Rosser's more moderate views were at increasing odds with the more militant forces in the labour movement. This came to a head in 1910, when he was replaced as the president of the Auckland Trades and Labour Council by the more radical Michael Joseph Savage. Political career Through his role as a union secretary Rosser openly participated in politics. In the early 1900s he played a key role in establishing the Independent Political Labour League in Auckland, the first New Zealand Labour Party and the United Labour Party. Throughout his career, Rosser was an advocate of the moderate wing of the labour movement, arguing that organised labour should improve rather than replace capitalism. In the , he stood in the three-member electorate and came fourth. At the next election in , he came seventh. He was one of three candidates in the in the electorate and stood for the Independent Political Labour League when he came last. Rosser was elected to the Auckland City Council in 1901 but lost his seat in 1903 and later failed to secure re-election in 1907, 1913 and 1931. He regained a seat in 1933, though in 1938 he lost his seat on the council, after standing as an independent. He was unexpectedly denied re-nomination by the Labour Party alongside sitting councillors Ted Phelan and George Gordon Grant. The next year he was expelled from a Labour Party as he had stood against Labour's official municipal candidates. Later life and death Rosser died at Auckland on 15 February 1954. He was survived by three daughters.

He fled from his native country to avoid conscription after having sworn an allegiance to Adolf Hitler. He then lived in Grenoble, where he was later imprisoned as an enemy alien. His mother managed to organise a permit for him to emigrate to New Zealand, and he arrived in Wellington in April 1940. He immediately became politically active in left-wing circles, but was forbidden by the Department of Justice to take on official positions, as he was classed as an enemy alien.

(September 12, 1909 ‚Äì January 20, 2000) was an American Catholic priest, Jesuit, and philosopher who served as president of Georgetown University from 1969 to 1976. Born in Iowa, Henle entered the Society of Jesus in 1927, and was educated in philosophy and theology at Saint Louis University. After teaching high school classics and publishing a series of widely used instructional books on Latin grammar, he earned his doctorate at the University of Toronto. Henle began his academic philosophy career at Saint Louis University, where became one of the leaders in the revival of Thomistic philosophy and theology. He also served in various administrative positions at the university, including as dean of the graduate school and academic vice president. In this latter capacity, he oversaw Saint Louis University's growing independence from, but continuing affiliation with, the Jesuit order. In 1969, Henle was named the president of Georgetown University. He presided over an era of rapid growth and diversifying demographics of the student body. Henle stabilized the university's finances by significantly increasing the student population. Women were admitted to Georgetown College, the last all-male school at the university, for the first time, while the number of black students increased. He also hired John Thompson, one of the first black coaches of a major collegiate basketball team, who would later lead the team to a championship. Henle's tenure also encompassed a highly fractious period of student unrest and protest of the Vietnam War. Georgetown maintained a policy of official neutrality on contentious social and political issues, while often appeasing student demands, to the discontent of faculty. Henle suspended the remainder of the 1970 academic year, fearing violence on campus after the Kent State shootings. The following year, the Metropolitan Police fired tear gas from helicopters onto non-student protesters on campus, without permission of the university. Henle's presidency ended in 1976, following increasing tensions with the board of directors and a publicized dispute with a vice president, who was later committed to a psychiatric ward. He returned to Saint Louis University, where he resumed teaching philosophy for the remainder of his career. A student residence at Georgetown, whose construction began during his presidency, was named Henle Village in his honor.  Early life  Robert John Henle was born on September 12, 1909, in Muscatine, Iowa. He attended St. Mathias School in Muscatine, before moving with his family to Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from Loyola High School. Henle then enrolled at Creighton University in 1926, and entered the Society of Jesus the following year in Florissant, Missouri. He completed his undergraduate work at Saint Louis University, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1931. He continued his education at Saint Louis University, earning a Master of Arts in 1932 and a Licentiate of Philosophy in 1935.  Saint Louis University  After completing his licentiate, Henle began teaching classics at St. Louis University High School in 1935. After two years, he left to teach education at Campion Summer School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he remained until 1941. During this time, he published a series of instructional books on Latin, one of which became one of the most widely used Latin grammar books in education. Henle was ordained a priest in 1940, and earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology the following year from St. Mary's College in Kansas, the Jesuit theological school of Saint Louis University. From 1941 to 1942, he studied at the St. Stanislaus Novitiate in Cleveland, Ohio, and then at the University of Toronto from 1942 to 1945. Beginning in 1943, he took intermittent leave of the University of Toronto to serve as an instructor in philosophy and dean of the School of Philosophy and Science at Saint Louis University. He also became the editor of The Modern Schoolman in 1945, holding this position until 1950. Henle became an assistant professor of philosophy at Saint Louis University in 1947, and simultaneously became the dean of the Graduate School in 1950. He served as the chairman of the American Catholic Philosophical Association's committee on research from 1949 to 1950, and as the president of the Missouri State Philosophical Association from 1950 to 1951; he was also a member of the American Philosophical Society. Henle returned to the University of Toronto to earn his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy in 1954, where he had Jacques Maritain and √àtienne Gilson as professors. After earning his doctorate, he resumed teaching at Saint Louis University, and was promoted to full professor in 1958. As a philosopher, Henle became known as a leading figure in the revival of Thomistic philosophy and theology, and elucidated Aquinas' relationship to Platonism and neo- Platonism. The author of more than 200 articles and many books, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. That year, Henle also became the academic vice president of the university, a position he would hold for the next 11 years. He was regarded as a capable administrator and talented academic at Saint Louis University, while some students viewed him as inaccessible. As vice president, he oversaw the relocation of St. Mary's College from St. Marys, Kansas, to the campus of Saint Louis University in 1967. The university sought to improve the academic standards of the seminary by moving from the countryside to an urban area, where it could become integrated into the university and take advantage of the its greater resources. Along with the move, the school was transformed from a seminary exclusively for Jesuits into a graduate-level school of divinity that admitted students of any religious denomination. Henle also worked with the university's president, Paul C. Reinert, to shift Saint Louis University away from governance exclusively by Jesuits. While the board of trustees was transformed from one composed of senior Jesuit administrators to one of laymen and Jesuits unaffiliated with the university, Henle proposed that the university publicly reformulate the relationship between the Jesuits and the university. Rather than describing the university as \\"owned by\\" the Jesuits, he proposed that the Jesuits \\"supported\\" or \\"sponsored\\" the university. He also recommended that the Jesuit community sever its dependence on the university. Henle was a promoter of the humanities, at a time when federal funding of universities was increasingly being allocated for scientific and technical fields. In 1957, he addressed the International Congress of Philosophy, arguing that the modern priority of philosophy should be to encourage the use of \\"reflective intelligence,\\" and urging philosophers to not excessively rely on empirical fields, such as psychology and psychiatry.  Georgetown University  Henle in front of alt=Robert Henle at Healy Hall, Georgetown University Henle was appointed the president of Georgetown University on January 6, 1969, succeeding Gerard Campbell. He was the first president to be selected by a search committee, rather than by the Jesuit superiors, and was the first since Louis William Valentine Dubourg to have no prior connection to Georgetown. Henle was chosen in part because of his comfortability in dealing with politicians as vice president of Saint Lous University; the chairman of Georgetown's presidential search committee, Edwin A. Quain, desired someone who would become active in Washington, D.C.'s social and political circles.  Stabilization of finances  Henle's most immediate project was to bring the university's budget under control. Indeed, he accepted the position only after being allowed to examine the school's finances, and concluding that they could be meaningfully reformed. He replaced the senior financial officers, and successfully reduced the budget deficit by increasing enrollment, which increased dramatically in the early 1970s. This is largely the result of a decision to rely on tuition for revenue. During this time, demographics of the student body changed as well, as the university began actively recruiting students outside the Northeastern United States and outside of Jesuit and Catholic high schools. The university also implemented affirmative action programs for women and racial minorities. Plans to admit women to Georgetown College, the last all-male school at the university, were put into place in 1968, and the first female students were entered the college in 1969. By 1972, the number of female undergraduate students at Georgetown was greater than the number of male students for the first time in the university's history. Henle also made a concerted effort to increase the admission and retention of black students. Upon entering office, one of Henle's concerns was the lack of long-term planning for the university's expansion and development. Therefore, he created the Office of Institutional Research, to disseminate information about university planning. An architectural master plan was also drawn up that called for expansive construction of classroom and housing accommodations on campus, to support a growing student population. Of this plan, the portion that came to fruition was the construction of parking garages, which resulted in a marked reduction in the number of green spaces on campus. Georgetown faced a significant shortage of on-campus housing, with the vast majority of students living off- campus. Henle purchased Alban Towers to alleviate this shortage, and began construction on a new housing village, which was completed in 1976, after his presidency, and named the Henle Student Village.  Faculty and student affairs  alt=Alban Towers in Washington, D.C. Henle also sought to reform the structure of the faculty. With only one endowed chair (in pharmacology) existing at the time he took office, Henle sought increase the number of endowed chairs to raise the quality of the faculty. He also capped the percentage of faculty who could receive tenure. The Woodstock Theological Center became affiliated with Georgetown and relocated to the university's campus in 1974. Plans to establish a Center for Contemporary Arab Studies were developed, and Henle solicited funds from a wide array of Arab countries, including those with whom the United States did not have diplomatic relations; the center opened in 1975, after Henle's presidency. Following the recommendation of a search committee, Henle decided to hire John Thompson as the coach of the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team. One of the first black coaches of a major collegiate basketball team, Thompson went on to lead the team to become the 1984 NCAA Champions. Henle's presidency encompassed an era of student protests of the Vietnam War. He attempted to defuse tensions by declaring a university policy of neutrality on any controversial issue. Conflict came to a head in 1970, following President Richard Nixon's announcement of the invasion of Cambodia and the subsequent killing of four students at Kent State. With student anger increasing, a widespread strike of classes, and the threat of violence on campus becoming apparent, Henle announced on May 7 that classes would be suspended for the rest of the semester. The faculty denounced working in an environment of intimidation by students and condemned what they viewed as a threat to the very purpose of a university‚Äîdetached, objective learning. The faculty senate considered a resolution that would require any future suspension of the academic calendar to be approved by two-thirds of the faculty, but Henle vetoed this resolution before it could be brought to a vote. Georgetown's campus was host to another conflict in May 1971, when several thousand protesters (who were not affiliated with Georgetown) sought refuge on the university's campus after being pushed back by police for trying to shut down the Key Bridge and other major arteries of Washington, D.C. At the time, Henle was in Rome, and the campus was under the direction of the vice president, James Kelly. Kelly allowed the protesters to remain on campus, and provided them with food. Without the university's permission, the Metropolitan Police then fired tear gas from helicopters onto the protesters, as well as Georgetown students who were walking to their final exams, causing the exams to be postponed. The campus atmosphere began to change in the 1972‚Äì1973 academic year, as protests died down, and student attention became less motivated by national politics. Rather than focus on politics, the student government increasingly became a service provider to students, and created The Students of Georgetown, Incorporated in March 1972. That year, Henle became involved in an administrative dispute with a vice president and the board of directors. He hired Edmund Ryan as vice president for educational affairs, effectively the chief academic officer, outside of the formal procedure and without the consent of the board. Soon thereafter, Henle and Ryan had a falling out, in which in the former accused the latter of trying to force him into retirement. Ryan became convinced that Henle was forming a coalition to undermine him, and that Henle was bugging his office; Ryan refused to meet in the president's office, and insisted that they meet in his room in the Jesuit community. Eventually, Henle fired Ryan, who would be committed to the psychiatric ward of Saint Vincent's Hospital in New York City two months later, but later became the president of Seattle University. Unaware of its basis, the faculty senate and student body protested the firing. As a result, the board became increasingly scrutinizing of Henle, who by this time had also become an alcoholic. While commending his leadership, the board ultimately decided that 1976 would be his final year as president. Henle submitted his resignation as president of Georgetown on June 30, 1976.  Later years  Following his presidency of Georgetown, Henle returned to Saint Louis University as the McDonnell Professor of Justice in American Society, as which he taught in the philosophy department and law school. He held this appointment until his retirement in 1982. During this time, he wrote on Thomistic epistemology, ethics, and legal theory. Henle died on January 20, 2000, at the Jesuit infirmary residence in St. Louis, Missouri. The Robert J. Henle Chair of Philosophy was established in his honor at Saint Louis University, and its inaugural holder, Eleonore Stump, founded the Robert J. Henle Conference in 1993, which convenes scholars to discuss matters of philosophy.

Ethnic groups of Sarawak  A Modern Iban Longhouse, built using new materials and preserving essential features of communal living Gawai festivals in Debak, Betong region, Sarawak In general, there are six major ethnic groups in Sarawak: Iban, Chinese, Malay, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu, Melanau and several minor ethnic groups placed collectively under 'Others', such as Indian, Eurasian, Kedayan, Javanese, Bugis, Murut and many more. Unlike Indonesia, the term Dayak is not officially used to address Sarawakian's native ethnicity.

Iban is native to Sarawak and Sarawak has the highest number of Ibans in Borneo. Formerly reputed to be the most formidable headhunters on the island of Borneo, the Ibans of today are a generous, hospitable and placid people.Journey Malaysia. Journey Malaysia. Retrieved on 12 August 2011. Because of their history as farmers, pirates and fishermen, Ibans were conventionally referred to as the \\"Sea Dayaks\\". The early Iban settlers migrated from Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo south of Sarawak, via the Kapuas River. They crossed over the Kelingkang range and set up home in the river valleys of Batang Ai, the Skrang River, Saribas, and the Rajang River. The Ibans dwell in longhouses, stilted structures with a large number of rooms housing a whole community of families. An Iban longhouse may still display head trophies or antu pala. These suspended heads mark tribal victories and were a source of honour. The Dayak Iban ceased practising headhunting in the 1930s. The Ibans are renowned for their Pua Kumbu (traditional Iban weavings), silver craft, wooden carvings and bead work. Iban tattoos, which were originally symbols of bravery among Iban warriors, have become amongst the most distinctive in the world. The Ibans are also famous for a sweet rice wine called tuak, which is served during big celebrations and festive occasions.Tourism Malaysia USA . Tourism Malaysia USA. Retrieved on 12 August 2011. The large majority of Ibans practise Christianity. However, like most other ethnic groups in Sarawak, they still observe many of their traditional rituals and beliefs. Sarawak Iban celebrates colourful festivals such as the generic all-encomposing Gawai Dayak (harvest festival) which is a recent invention and thus held by all Dayak tribes including Iban, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu regardless of their religion. The major festivals of the Iban people are Gawai Bumai (Rice Farming Festival) that includes at least four stages i.e. Gawai Batu (Whetstone Festival), Gawai Benih (Seed Festival), Gawai Ngemali Umai / Jagok (Farm-Healing Festival), Gawai Matah (Harvest-Starting Festival) and Gawai Basimpan (Paddy Safekeeping Festival), Gawai Tuah (Fortune Festival) that comprises Gawai Namaka Tuah (Fortune-Welcoming Festival), Gawai Tajau (Jar Festival) and Gawai Pangkong Tiang (House Post Banging Festival), Gawai Sakit (Healing Festival) including Pelian by a manang shaman, Renong Sakit and Sugi Sakit by a lemambang bard, Gawai Antu (festival of the dead) to honour ancestors and the rarely celebrated but the most elaborate and complex Gawai Burong (Bird Festival) with nine ascending stages in the Saribas/Skrang region or Gawai Amat (Real Festival) in the Baleh region with eight degrees as listed by Masing. Due to the natural culture of (sojurn) among Ibans mainly in search of jobs, there is a thriving Iban population of between 30,000 and 40,000 in Johor, found mostly in the area between Pasir Gudang and Masai on the eastern end of the Johor Bahru metropolitan area. Sizeable Iban communities are also present in Kuala Lumpur and Penang, likewise seeking employment. Most will return home during the Gawai Dayak.  Bidayuh  Concentrated mainly on the west end of Borneo, the Bidayuhs make up 8% of the population in Sarawak are now most numerous in the hill counties of Lundu, Bau, Penrissen, Padawan, Siburan and Serian, within an hour's drive from Kuching. Historically, as other tribes were migrating into Sarawak and forming settlements including the Malays from the neighbouring archipelagos, the Bidayuhs retreated further inland, hence earning them the name of \\"Land Dayaks\\" or \\"land owners\\". The word Bidayuh in itself literally means \\"land people\\" in Biatah dialect. In Bau-Jagoi/Singai dialect, the pronunciation is \\"Bidoyoh\\" which also carry the same meaning. The traditional community construction of the Bidayuh is the \\"baruk\\", a roundhouse that rises about 1.5 metres off the ground. It serves as the granary and the meeting house for the settlement's community. Longhouses were typical in the olden days, similar to that of the Ibans. Typical of the Sarawak indigenous groups, the Bidayuhs are well known for their hospitality, and are reputed to be the best makers of , or rice wine. Bidayuhs also use distilling methods to make , a kind of moonshine.LongHuse . Longhouse.org.my (15 October 2009). Retrieved on 12 August 2011. The Bidayuhs speak a number of different but related dialects. Some Bidayuhs speak either English or Sarawak Malay as their main language. While some of them still practise traditional religions, the majority of modern-day Bidayuhs have adopted the Christian faith with a few villages embracing the Islamic faith as a minority group within the Bidayuh community.  Salako & Lara  This ethnic group forms a small minority with very little or no comprehensive studies done by any party on their dialect, culture/customs and history. Although classified as Bidayuh by the Malaysian government for political convenience, the Salako and Lara culture have nothing in common with the other Bidayuh groups and their oral tradition claim different descent and migration histories. It is understandable that since this group is living within Bidayuh-majority areas and the fact that they also prefer to stay in one permanent inland area, most probably for agricultural reasons instead of branching out to other locations as opposed to the other races, they are grouped together as Land Dayaks. This tribal community is believed to have originated from Gajing Mountain, at the source of Salakau River, near Singkawang in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Their language is completely different and not intelligible with the other spoken Bidayuh dialects in the other districts. They are mainly found concentrated in the Lundu area. In August 2001, the Salako and Lara community set up the Salako- Lara Association to safe guard and preserve their culture and custom for the future generations.  Orang Ulu  A young Sarawakian playing the sapeh Orang Ulu is an ethnic group in Sarawak. The various Orang Ulu groups together make up roughly 5% of Sarawak's population. The phrase Orang Ulu means upriver people and is a term used to collectively describe the numerous tribes that live upriver in Sarawak's vast interior.

They are believed to be distantly related to the Visayan of the Philippines. Legend belief is such that in the distant past, there were large migration of Bisaya to The Philippines. However the Bisaya dialect is more related to Malay language than the Philippines Visaya language.

The Melanaus were believed to originally summon spirits in a practice verging on paganism. Today most of the Melanaus are Muslims whilst some were converted to Christianity (especially around Mukah & Dalat areas). However some still celebrate traditional animist festivals such as the annual Kaul Festival in Mukah District.  Tagal  Also known as \\"Murut Sabah\\", \\"Tagal\\" or \\"hill people\\", this indigenous subgroup of the Murut people can be found inhabiting the lowland areas around Lawas & Limbang. They are part of an interstate ethnic group that is found highly concentrated along the borderlands and inland areas of Sabah, Brunei, Kalimantan and Sarawak, with the majority in the former. The Tagal are mostly shifting cultivators, with some hunting and riverine fishing on the side. They use the Tagol Murut language as the lingua franca of the whole group. It belongs to the North Bornean subdivision of the Austronesian language family. A majority of the Tagal people are Christians, with a few Muslims.  Punan Bah  Not to be confused with the Penan, the Punan Bah or Punan is a distinct ethnic group found in Sarawak, Malaysia. They are mostly found around the Bintulu area and also in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. They live on a mixed economy, engaging in swidden style of agriculture, with hill paddy as the main crop & supplemented by a range of other tropical plants. Hunting, fishing, and gathering of forest resources are the other important contributors to their economy. In recent times, many of the educated younger generation gradually migrated to urban areas such as Bintulu, Sibu, Kuching and Kuala Lumpur in search of better living & returning home occasionally, especially during major festivities such as Harvest Festival / or Bungan festival. At the moment, the term Punan is often indiscriminately & collectively used to refer to the then unknown or yet to be classified tribes as such as Punan Busang, Penihing, Sajau Hovongan, Uheng Kareho, Merah, Aput, Tubu, Bukat, Ukit, Habongkot and Penyawung. There has been no effort to comprehensively study or research on this ensemble of tribes; these communities lack the privilege and are deprived of their rights to be recognised as individual & unique races (with their own tradition, language & cultural heritage) within the nation's list of ethnic classification, resulting to more than 20 different tribes / ethnics (unrelated to one another) found on the island of Borneo being lumped together into one ethnic group, which includes; * Punan Busang * Punan Penihing * Punan Batu * Punan Sajau * Punan Hovongan of Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan * Punan Uheng Kereho of Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan * Punan Murung of Murung Raya, Central Kalimantan * Punan Aoheng (Suku Dayak Pnihing) of East Kalimantan * Punan Merah (Siau) * Punan Aput * Punan Merap * Punan Tubu * Punan Ukit/Bukitan * Dayak Bukat * Punan Habongkot * Punan Panyawung  Kedayan  The Kedayan are an ethnic group residing in parts of Sarawak. They are also known as Kadayan, Kadaian or simply badly spelled as Kadyan by the British. The Kedayan language is spoken by more than 37,000 people in Sarawak, with most of the members of the Kedayan community residing in Lawas, Limbang, Miri and Sibuti areas. A sizable community also exists in Brunei Darussalam. The Kedayans is believed to have Javanese origins. The British Resident Malcolm McArthur attests to their Javanese origins in his Report on Brunei 1904.McArthur, M. S. H. (1987). Report on Brunei in 1904. Ohio University Center for International Studies. Meanwhile, historians such as Pehin Jamil claimed the Kedayans were bought over from Java to Borneo by Sultan Bolkiah the 5th during his famous conquests of Borneo.Al-Sufri, M. J., & Hassan, M. A. (2000). Tarsilah Brunei: the early history of Brunei up to 1432 AD (Vol. 1). Brunei History Centre, Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports. This was due to the Kedayan's prowess in padi farming and other agricultural abilities. Other researchers consider them indigenous to Borneo, having accepted Islam and influenced by Malay culture, primarily by Bruneians. Kedayan are mainly padi farmers or fishermen. They have a reputation for knowledge of medicinal plants, which they grow to treat a wide range of ailments or to make tonics. The Kedayan tend to settle inland in a cluster pattern, with houses built in the centre and with fields radiating outwards. The Kedayans traditionally tended to be a rather closed community, discouraging contact with outsiders. Intermarriage among relatives was encouraged for economic and social reasons.  Suluk  The Suluk people are one of the smallest minority groups in Sarawak, estimated at less than 200 people throughout the state. Their presence and existence were noted significantly after the illegal intrusion and terrorist act committed by Suluk gunmen from the southern part of the Philippines during the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff in Sabah. They are believed to be descendants of the same ethnic group who had migrated from Sabah to Sarawak over the years. Most of the people within the Sulu community can be found living in Limbang, Lawas and Kuching areas. The vast majority of Suluk people are Muslims and very few are Roman Catholics.  Malay  The Malays make up 26% of the population in Sarawak. Historically, they were associated with the Bruneian Malay Empire and the Sriwijayan Empire in Sumatra's and thus a sizable share of the population today are of ethnic Malay Bruneians and Minangkabauan (Saribas District). Today they call themselves Sarawakian Malays. Traditionally fishermen, these seafaring people chose to form settlements on the banks of the many rivers of Sarawak and Sambas, Indonesia. Today, many Malays have migrated to the cities where they are heavily involved in the public and private sectors and taken up various professions. Malay villages, known as Kampungs, are a cluster of wooden houses on stilts, many of which are still located by rivers on the outskirts of major towns and cities, play home to traditional cottage industries. The Malays are famed for their wood carvings, silver and brass craftings as well as traditional Malay textile weaving with silver and gold thread (). Malay in Sarawak have a distinct dialect which is called Sarawak Malay (in some official cases, it is recognised as a separate language). It has many elements of the Sambas language spoken before contact with the Bruneian sultanate. The culture of Sarawakian Malay is also somewhat unusual such as , Sarawak , and weaving. It is possible, though insufficient studies exist, that these are remnants of the Sambas sultanate‚Äôs culture, prior to a change in identity and the speaking of a unique hybrid of Malay-Sambas by the previously Sambas speaking natives. In Federal Constitution, Malays are Muslim by religion, having been converted to the faith some 600 years ago with the Islamification of the native region. Their religion is reflected in their culture and art and Islamic symbolism is evident in local architecture ‚Äì from homes to government buildings. In Malaysia, people of Indonesian descent: Javanese, Bugis, and Banjar are constitutionally classified as Malays, and have the same rights should they become a citizen.  Javanese  The present generation are descended from the original ethnic Javanese people, the majority from the province of Central Java, who arrived in Sarawak as \\"kuli kontrak\\", indentured servants who were brought in by the Dutch via Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) during the late 1800s to the 1940s & transferred to a British company to work in the rubber plantations. After the end of their contracts, some of them had decided to settle down & work on land no longer producing rubber. Over the years, these labourers were prosperous & were later given the right of ownership to several hectares of land. An estimated 50,000 Javanese people are found all over the state, establishing their own villages, with the majority concentrated in Kuching & its surrounding areas. Some of the younger generation still carry traditional Javanese names & are identified as ethnic Javanese in their birth certificates. They are proud of their heritage; the current population still speak the language of their parents & retaining their age-old traditions & practices of their forefathers. The friendly Javanese are traditionally Muslims, so they have a strong affinity with the Malays, with many of them intermarrying & living within Malay-majority areas & also other communities. They use Sarawak Malay or English as a common lingua franca to communicate with the other ethnic groups.  Bugis  The Bugis are an ethnic group which had originated from the southwestern province of Sulawesi, Indonesia. They are renowned around the archipelago as adventurous seafarers and merchants, establishing trading routes with other ports along Sarawak's coastal areas over the past few centuries, eventually settling down with their families or taking up local spouses. The Bugis artisans are noted for their expertise in building tongkangs & proas, plying their skills at the fishing villages and local dockyards. They are also skilled farmers, construction workers, traders and fishermen. The Bugis population in Sarawak is scattered throughout the state. Many can be found living along the coast alongside or within other communities and also opening up small agricultural settlements further inland, especially in the Sarikei district. They are predominantly Muslims and many have amalgamated with the local Muslim society through marriage.  Indian  The Indians in Sarawak are a small community, estimated to be between 5000 & 7000 people (figure also includes those of mixed parentage & professionals/students/residents from other parts of Malaysia), found mainly in the urban exteriors of Kuching & Miri division. The Indians encompass a wide spectrum of religions, being represented in the Hindu, Muslim (from Tamil Nadu, Malabari & Andhra Pradesh subethnic groups), Christian, Sikh, Buddhist & Baha'i faiths. The Sikhs were among the earliest Indians to set foot on Sarawak's soil, recruited by the first White Rajah, Sir James Brooke in Singapore as police officers to bring peace, law and order during the 1857 Chinese uprising in Bau. At a much later stage, the Sikhs were employed as security personnel for the Sarawak Shell Company in Miri & also as government-appointed prison wardens. It is also believed that there were a few Sikhs in the Sarawak Rangers, which was formed in 1872. As for the Tamil, Malayali, Sindh & other Indian ethnic groups, their history in the state began during the 1860s, when they were brought in from South India by the second White Rajah Charles Brooke to work in the tea & coffee plantations in the Matang Hills. There were also traders & travellers visiting the state for religious, educational or business opportunities. After many years, the Indian community is extended to include newer immigrants from Sri Lanka & other areas in India. The Indian Muslims were prominent in the restaurant business, textile trade & Indian food production. They were also instrumentally significant in their contribution to the Islamic fellowship & religious welfare in the state with their Muslim Malay brethren. Many of the present-day Sarawak Indians are from mixed marriages with the Malays, Chinese & other Sarawak native ethnic groups, with many of the younger generation using English, Sarawak Malay or one of the native or Chinese dialects to communicate with everybody else. They have assimilated well within the state's general population as a culturally distinct group in Sarawak that is rather unusual as opposed to the Indian diaspora of Peninsular Malaysia & the Asian region in general. A number of Sarawak Indians can be found working as doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers & other professional careers in the government & private sectors.  Eurasian  Mixed marriages/unions between Europeans and local spouses have been going on for centuries, since the time European traders, sailors and colonists first set foot on Sarawak's soils. The Eurasians in Sarawak continues to be the smallest of minorities, with many of them rather identifying themselves with the major racial denomination of their local parent rather than that of their European, Australian or American parent, as the local state government does not formally classify them as an official ethnicity. At the moment, the exact number of people in the local Eurasian community is not known, as many of them registered themselves (for administrative and social ease) as Iban, Bidayuh, Chinese, Malay, Melanau, Orang Ulu, Indian or simply under \\"others\\". Besides assimilating themselves into the general populace, many of them had also migrated to Peninsular Malaysia or their foreign parents' countries of origin. The local Eurasians established the Sarawak Eurasian Association (SEA) in the year 2000 to foster closer ties among members of this community and also to raise awareness on the existence of this distinct group. Their association is quite unique, if compared to the Eurasian associations of Peninsular Malaysia, as it is composed by members of different religious faiths.  Chinese  Chinese people first came to Sarawak as traders and explorers in the 6th century. Today, they make up 24% of the population of Sarawak and consist of communities built from the economic migrants of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The first Hakka migrants worked as labourers in the gold mines at Bau or on plantations. Through their clan associations, business acumen and work ethic, the Chinese organised themselves economically and rapidly dominated commerce. Today, the Chinese are amongst Sarawak's most prosperous ethnic groups. The Sarawak Chinese belong to a wide range of dialect groups, the most significant being: * Hakka * Hokkien * Chaoshanese * Teochew * Shanghainese * Hainanese * Kwongsai * Cantonese * Minnanese * Fujianese * Foochow * Puxian Min Whereas Hakka is spoken predominantly by the farmers in the interior, Hokkien and Teochew are the dominant dialects spoken within the major trading towns and among early traders and businessmen. Hainanese (a.k.a. Hailam) were well known as coffee-shop operators, the Henghua are famous as fishermen. The notable difference between the Sarawakian Chinese and those presiding in West Malaysia is the latter‚Äôs common use of Cantonese. Malaysian Mandarin however, has become the unifying language spoken by all the distinct Southern Chinese groups in both East and West Malaysia, replicating China. The Hakka people in Kuching, Sarawak came from Jieyang, Guangdong. The Hokkien came from Zhao'an, Fujian. The Teochew came from Shantou and Chaozhou in Guangdong, the Shanghainese came from Shanghai, Hainanese from Hainan, Cantonese from Guangdong, Foochow from Fuzhou, Fujian. The Kwongsai people came from Guangxi, Chaoshanese people came from Chaoshan, Minnanese people came from Xiamen, Lastly the Henghuas or Hinghwa or Puxian people from Putian, Fujian. The Chinese maintain their ethnic heritage and culture and celebrate all the major cultural festivals, most notably Chinese New Year, the Hungry Ghost Festival and Christmas. The Sarawak Chinese are predominantly Buddhists and Christians.  Religions of Sarawak  Sarawakians practice a variety of religions, including Islam, Christianity, Chinese folk religion (a fusion of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and ancestor worship) and animism. Christianity is the largest religion in culturally and religiously diverse in Sarawak.Tititudorancea. Tititudorancea. Retrieved on 12 August 2011. Religion in Sarawak is a predictive indicator of political support, with 76% of Muslim bumiputera, who are constitutionally Malays believing Sarawak to be better off since joining the Malaysian Federation in 1963, but among the non-Muslim indigenous peoples and the Chinese, only 35% believed that Sarawak was better off and 34% who polled it as worse off. Unsurprisingly, the issue of Islam as state religion divides the Muslim and non-Muslims with a contrasting 85% supporting and opposing, respectively. Nevertheless, 63% of Sarawakians consider their regional Sarawak identity to be their first choice in defining themselves which is in stark contrast to Peninsular Malaysia where 55% see religion as their most important identity marker. This is in line with the Malaccan Sultanate from which the Malay language and culture stems Sneddon, James N.

Adopting a common name, language and religion has united the various West Malaysian indigenous communities and many Sambas indigenous people of Kuching. Sarawakians across all religions express majority support for increased autonomy for the state - at 76% overall.  Christianity  St. Joseph's Cathedral, Kuching, a Roman Catholic cathedral in Kuching, Sarawak. Christianity makes up the largest religion in Sarawak. Sarawak is the state with the highest percentage of Christians in Malaysia and the only state with a Christian majority. According to 2010 census, Christian make up 39.06% of total population of Sarawak. Major Christian denominations in Sarawak are the Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Borneo Evangelical Church (or Sidang Injil Borneo, S.I.B.) and Baptists. Many Sarawakian Christians are non-Malay Bumiputera, ranging from Iban, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu, Murut and Melanau. Denomination of Christians in Sarawak may vary according to their race, although this is not necessarily true. For example, most Chinese Christians are Methodists, most Ibans and Bidayuhs are either Roman Catholics or Anglicans, whilst most Orang Ulu are S.I.B.s. Church plays an important part in shaping morality of the communities, while many Christians view the church as a religious place. Professing Christianity has led to the abolition of some previous rituals by indigenous ethnics such as headhunting and improper disposal of dead bodies. Since the majority of people indigenous to Sarawak are Christians, these people have adopted Christian names in English or Italian, such as Valentino, Joseph, and Constantine. Almost 90% of the Iban, Kelabit, and Bidayuh have changed their traditional names to English names since they converted to Christianity. Many young indigenous Iban, Kelabit, and Bidayuh people in Sarawak will not practice the ceremonies of their ancestors such as Miring, the worship of Singalang Burung (local deity), and celebration of Gawai Antu. The Bidayuhs are mainly Pagans or animists before they convert to Christianity and they believe in ancestral worship and in the ancient spirits of nature. Due to this, they have big celebrations like the Gawai (1 June), which is a celebration to please the padi spirit for a good harvest and nowadays, since 60% of the population has converted to Christianity, the young Bidayuh generation will celebrate only Christmas as their first priority. Christians among indigenous ethnics have also embraced many Christian values such as preserving modesty and dedication to God. Christianity has also contributed to the betterment of the education system in Sarawak. There were a lot of missionary schools built during the 1950s to early 1980s.Travel Malaysia. Go2travelmalaysia.com. Retrieved on 12 August 2011. Christianity has gained popularity throughout Sarawak, transcending race and religion. Due to federalisation of the education system, most of these missionary schools have been converted into government national schools. Participation of the church in these schools has been reduced.

Many of the Sarawakian Chinese community, which comprises the bulk of the Buddhist population, actually practise a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folk religion. As there is no official name for this particular set of beliefs, many followers instead list down their religion as Buddhism, mainly for bureaucratic convenience. Buddhists from other ethnic especially Bumiputera are rare and almost insignificant to be related with, perhaps in small community with humble and low profile practice of the Buddhist ceremony among some Bumiputra people in Sarawak. Buddhists in Sarawak observe Wesak Day. It is a public holiday in Sarawak. Hinduism Unlike their fellow Peninsular Malaysians, Sarawak Hindus are very small in number. Almost all Hindus in Sarawak are Indians, while some are Chinese and other indigenous people through inter-marriages. There are less than 10 Hindu temples throughout Sarawak, most of them are located in Kuching and Miri. Hindus in Sarawak observe Deepavali and Thaipusam. However, none of these festivals are public holidays in Sarawak.  Sikhism  The first Gurdwara was built in 1911 in Kuching, built by the Sikh community of pioneers in the state, mainly police and security personnel. At the present, there are four known Gurdwaras in the state, with one each located in Kuching, Miri, Sibu and Bau, with the latter no longer in existence since the late 1950s, due to the fact that there were no longer any Sikhs in that area. Besides being used as places of worship, the Gurdwaras also hold weekly Gurmukhi classes and also serve as community centres for the thriving Sikh community.  Baha'i  Baha'i is one of the recognised religions in Sarawak. Various races embraced the Baha'i Faith, from Chinese to Iban and Bidayuh, Bisayahs, Penans, Indians but not the Malays or other Muslims. In towns, the majority Baha'i community is often Chinese, but in rural communities, they are of all races, Ibans, Bidayuhs, etc. In some schools, Baha'i associations or clubs for students exist. Baha'i communities are now found in all the various divisions of Sarawak. However, these communities do not accept assistance from government or other organisations for activities which are strictly for Baha'is. If, however, these services extend to include non-Baha'is also, e.g. education for children's classes adult literacy, then sometimes the community does accept assistance. The administration of the Baha'i Faith is through local spiritual assemblies. There is no priesthood among the Baha'is. Election is held annually without nomination or electioneering. The Baha'is should study the community and seek those members who display mature experience, loyalty, are knowledgeable in the Faith. There are more than 40,000 Baha'is in more than 250 localities in Sarawak.  Animism  Many Dayak especially Iban continue to practice traditional ceremonies, particularly with dual marriage rites and during the important harvest and ancestral festivals such as Gawai Dayak, Gawai Kenyalang and Gawai Antu.

Originally published by Yankelovich Partners, Grant Lukenbill's book, Untold Millions, applied the theory to help explain marketing opportunities to gays and lesbians. In Brigg's original research, he observed higher levels of stress, skepticism and self-protection needs among minority groups. The psychology of disenfranchisement theory suggests that there are three components that drive the psychology of disenfranchisement: alienation, cynicism and perceived victimization. These components interact and intensify each other. Alienation, Briggs argues, may be due to negative perceptions, stereotypes and discrimination condoned and practiced by the dominant culture. The perception of separation from the mainstream culture can create severe stress and can be considered the impetus for the psychology of disenfranchisement. Cynicism is one of the inevitable offshoots of alienation, resulting in the conviction that things will go wrong, that harm is to be expected. It involves a sense that the institutions of society (from which one is alienated) are not only remote, but inimical. Victimization is the feeling the develops out of the perception of intentional or unintentional undeserved mistreatment by other individuals, organizations, or institutions. Victimization is a logical outgrowth of feelings of cynicism and alienation from the dominant culture. The perceived victimization legitimizes and justifies the cynicism, and over time this cycle can become entrenched, thereby increasing the feelings of alienation. The resulting needs include: self-understanding (recognition of and respect for one's individuality), association (a sharing of occasions with \\"people like me\\"), security (emotional, social and psychical), independence, stress relief (self-indulgence, escapism).Grant Lukenbill, Untold Millions, Positioning your business for the gay and lesbian consumer revolution, pg 103-106 HarperCollins Oct 1, 1995, All the Rage: The Story of Gay Visibility in America Preview. cites Briggs' psychology of disenfranchisement theory as a launching point to discuss how advertising can offer inclusion in its messaging, so as to resonate better.

It is used in the pyrotechnic industry. Barium perchlorate decomposes at 505 ¬∞C.  Structure of barium perchlorate trihydrate  Gallucci and Gerkin (1988) analyzed the structure of the hydrate isomer barium perchlorate trihydrate (Ba(ClO4)2‚Ä¢3H2O) by X-ray crystallography. The barium ions are coordinated by six water oxygen atoms at 2.919√Ö and six perchlorate oxygens at 3.026√Ö in a distorted icosahedral arrangement. The perchlorate fails by a narrow margin to have regular tetrahedral geometry, and has an average Cl-O bond length of 1.433√Ö. The space-group assignment of the structure was resolved, with the centrosymmetric assignment of P63/m confirmed. Each axial perchlorate oxygen is hydrogen bonded to three water molecules and each trigonal oxygen is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules. This interaction is the reason that the perchlorate fails to be tetrahedral. Gallucci and Gerkin surmised that the water molecule H atoms lie in the plane at z = and . Preparation Barium perchlorate can be prepared using many different reagents and methods. One method involves evaporating a solution containing barium chloride and an excess of perchloric acid. The dihydrate form is produced by recrystallizing and drying to a constant weight. Additional drying over sulfuric acid yields the monohydrate. The anhydrous form is obtained by heating to 140 ¬∞C in vacuum. Dehydration of barium perchlorate that does not occur in vacuum will also result in hydrolysis of the perchlorate. Other reactions that produce barium perchlorate are as follows: perchloric acid and barium hydroxide or carbonate; potassium perchlorate and hydrofluosilicic acid followed with barium carbonate; boiling solution of potassium chlorate and zinc fluosilicate. For large-scale manufacturing purposes, barium perchlorate is synthesized by evaporating a solution of sodium perchlorate and barium chloride. Another method of preparation involves the digestion of a saturated solution of ammonium perchlorate with hydrated barium hydroxide in 5-10% excess of the theoretical amount.  Applications  Due to its characteristic as a powerful oxidation agent, one of barium perchlorate‚Äôs primary uses is in the manufacture and preparation of explosive emulsions and other explosive compounds. Using an emulsifier makes the process of transporting and handling of the explosive material while still retaining its destructive properties at the end point of use. Perchlorate explosives were mainly used in industrial applications, such as mining during the 1920s. Barium perchlorate is also able to complex with the quinolone antibacterial agents ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. FTIR data suggests that CIP and NOR act as bidentate ligands, using the ring carbonyl oxygen and an oxygen of the carboxylic group. This coordination is significant because it increases the solubility of the antibiotics in water and other polar solvents, increasing their uptake efficiency. Because of its high solubility in water, anhydrous barium perchlorate can be used as a dehydrating reagent for other compounds. Due to its high solubility, ease of preparation, low cost, stability at high temperatures, and relatively ease of regeneration, barium perchlorate is a favored compound for dehydrating compounds. The need for dehydrating compounds has increased with the use of chemical reactions employing gases under pressure, as the water must be removed from the air prior to the reaction taking place. Barium perchlorate is also used for the determination of small concentrations (down to 10 ppm, with an accuracy of +/- 1 ppm) of sulfate. In order for the titration to be successful, a high concentration of a nonaqueous solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, 2-propanol, or methanol, must be present. Thorin is typically used as the indicator.

Those studies were put on hold as she focused on her music career. She later returned to Carleton as the university's Artist-in-Residence. Career In 2004 Evans won second place at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition, where Quincy Jones, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Al Jarreau were among the judges. In 2006, she released her debut album Fight or Flight? for which was nominated for a 2007 Juno award. Her Juno award winning album Nina was inspired by the life and work of Nina Simone and was recorded after the French record label Plus Loin Music, who invited her to spend two days in their recording studio to record whatever she wanted. The record was released the same year as her album The Good Girl, all while homeschooling her three children under ten years of age On tours she has opened for George Benson, Tony Bennett, Chris Botti, Dianne Reeves, Maceo Parker, Derek Trucks and Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings.

In November 2015, Evans then fainted while getting out of the bath, causing a head injury followed by post-concussion syndrome. As a result of breathing difficulties and dizziness she was unable to sing. However, eventually Evans returned to singing in 2018 and that year was nominated for the JUNO Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year for her album Come On.

The score, its second movement in particular, is well recognized as one of the most famous scores in film history. It scored for an original orchestra's string section.  Psychos shower scene The score was composed for the famous \\"shower scene\\", the murder of Janet Leigh's character, Marion Crane. Hitchcock originally wanted the sequence (and all motel scenes) to play without music, but Herrmann insisted he try it with the cue he had composed. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed that it vastly intensified the scene, and he nearly doubled Herrmann's salary.Leigh, pp. 165‚Äì166 Movements The score is divided into three main movements: ;1st Movement The first movement of the score is made up of multiple runs, trills, and short, staccato stabs played agitato. While there is no direct melody, the fast-paced runs constantly switch around between the keys of F, F#, C#, and D, with a few sections played in G. A notable feature that Herrmann implemented is the use of alternating eighth-note semitones to create a sense of approaching and imminent danger. John Williams made this technique famous 15 years later in his score for Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975). The movement ends with a high Dbmaj7/Bb chord that crescendoes to an abrupt fermata cutoff. ;2nd Movement The second movement is the most recognizable piece of the score: directly after the first movement's fermata, a lone first violin launches directly into a series of discordant, screechy glissandos before being joined by the rest of the string section.

The book was conceived and promoted by Progress. There are many proposed policies in the Purple Book such as: education credit, universal childcare, insurance-based welfare state, the abolition of higher- rate tax relief, the remutualisation of Northern Rock and other state-owned banks, the extension of directly-elected mayors, the abolition of DCLG, extension of cooperatives and a new Department for the Nations and 'hasbos'. The book was endorsed by many in the Labour Party including Ed Miliband, David Miliband and Maurice Glasman but received criticism from Roy Hattersley and Michael Meacher, who in particular felt it was a repetition of Conservative Party policies, though this was rejected by Rachel Reeves. The book was designed to bring together policy proposals for Labour but to delve into its revisionists roots before Old Labour looking at ideas stemming from the Christian Socialist Movement and R. H. Tawney, calling for an effective and active government not a big state. It also shares some themes from Tony Crosland's book on The Future of Socialism. The book is broadly very supportive of the ideas promoted by Blue Labour; however Peter Mandelson wrote a chapter criticising it.

They lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Taxonomy William Buckland was the first to describe Cycadeoidea William Buckland originally gave the name to two species he described, C. megalophylla and C. microphylla, in 1828, seeing characteristics akin to living cycads. Robert Brown and Mr. Loddiges of Loddiges Nursery in Hackney had seen living cycads and urged him to name the fossils after them. The original type specimens of both taxa have not been located, so new type material has been chosen. Classification of species within the genus is very difficult, as several trunks have been described as species, and a further fourteen species are known from detached leaf remains, but there is no way of telling which leaf remains go with which trunk remains (if any). Description Cycadeoidea stems were \\"short and barrel-shaped,\\" with a \\"crown of pinnate leaves\\" atop the stem. The majority of Cycadeoidea species were \\"bisexual\\". The genus may have undergone self-pollination, although it is also possible that insects were involved in the process. The size and shape of the trunk has been used to distinguish species, however forms intermediate between two species suggest the two might be merely different-sized or aged plants can't be excluded. Fossil sites and species The following species have been described: *Cycadeoidea cylindrica (Brongn. ex Mantell) *Cycadeoidea deshayesii (Saporta) *Cycadeoidea duvalii (Pomel) Doweld *Cycadeoidea gibsoniana (Carruthers) Seward *Cycadeoidea maccafferyi *Cycadeoidea megalophylla Buckland *Cycadeoidea microphylla Buckland The Isle of Portland was the site of the first specimens recovered, described by Buckland as C. megalophylla (the type species) and C. microphylla. Cycadeoidea gibsoniana is a species collected from Lower Greensand from Luccombe Chine on the Isle of Wight, notable for the remarkable state of preservation of its plant parts. The original specimen was found by Thomas Field Gibson and was extensively broken and sliced to examine its anatomy. Four well preserved cones of a species C. maccafferyi were uncovered in the Upper Cretaceous Haslam Formation on Vancouver and Hornby Island in British Columbia.

Smaller \\"impulse\\" sets could build models of other household fixtures, such as tables and chairs, a television, an armoire, a grandfather clock and a fireplace.

The arm pieces, which attached to the same special brick, could be made of one or two lengths to represent either children or adults. Hair and other attachments were also provided to complete the figure.
