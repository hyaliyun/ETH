It was developed in collaboration with research groups from the University of Utah (MRL, SCI) and Columbia University (MBL). FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and boundary conditions that are relevant to numerous research areas and specializes in the analysis of 3D multiphysics models that can undergo large deformations. Users can solve problems in solid mechanics, contact analysis, porous media problems, fluid mechanics, and as of version 2.8, fluid-solid interaction (FSI) problems as well. FEBio supports both quasi-static and dynamic analyses. A more detailed overview of FEBio's features follows below. The source code for FEBio is publicly available and, as of version 2.9, distributed under the MIT opensource license. (Older versions are available under a custom license and are not considered Open-source software because they are only free for non-commercial use.) FEBio supports a plugin framework that allows users to easily extend and customize the set of features for their specific needs. Using this plugin framework users can develop new constitutive models, boundary conditions, body loads, nonlinear constraints, and even new finite element solvers (see e.g. the FEBioChem plugin, which implements a reaction- diffusion solver for solving chemical reactions in mixtures ).  Overview  A brief overview of the available features (as of version 2.8) follows. A more complete list can be found in the FEBio User's . *Solid Mechanics **Non-linear (quasi-) static, non-linear dynamic, energy conserving time integration schemes **Hyperelastic materials (isotropic, transversely-isotropic, anisotropic), visco-hyperelastic materials, damage models, fiber materials. **Rigid body mechanics and rigid-deformable coupling. **Prescribed displacements, surface loads (e.g. pressure, traction), and body loads. **Multiple tied and sliding contact formulations with or without friction. **Solid 3D linear and quadratic elements (tetrahedral, hexahedral, pentahedral). **Linear and quadratic shell elements that can be free, or placed on top or between solid elements. *Multiphasic mechanics **Biphasic, biphasic-solute, triphasic (two solutes), and multiphasic materials with multiple solutes. **Steady-state or transient analysis conditions. **Special contact formulations that take solvent and/or solute flow across contact interface into account. **Solid-bound molecules that deform with the solid phase. **Chemical reactions between solutes/solid-bound molecules. **Specialized shell formulations for biphasic/multiphasic analyses. *Fluid mechanics **Steady-state and transient fluid dynamic analysis. **Viscous fluid flow (Newtonian, Carreau, Carreau-Yasuda, Powell-Eyring, Cross). **Flow stabilization algorithms. **Fluid-solid interaction (FSI) *Heat Transfer **Steady-state and transient linear heat transfer analysis. **Isotropic Fourier material. **Prescribed and initial temperature boundary condition, heat flux and convective heat flux, heat source.  FEBio Studio  FEBio is a command-line application that only implements the solver algorithms. To assist with setting up FEBio models and analyzing the results, the FEBio Studio software was developed. FEBio Studio is the newest development platform for creating, running, and analyzing FEBio models. It is currently available under a beta release from . It allows users to import geometry and meshes from various file formats, including some CAD formats (BREP, STEP) and offers some tet mesh generation capabilities. Users can then setup boundary, loading, and contact conditions, and define material and analysis parameters. The models can be run with FEBio directly from the FEBio Studio interface, or exported to the xml-formatted FEBio input file. Models can be run locally or send to a remote server. After FEBio completes, the results can be loaded directly into FEBio Studio for visualization and analysis.  Legacy tools  Prior to FEBio Studio, users used the PreView software to setup FEBio models and PostView for visualization and analysis. Since FEBio Studio combines these two software packages, in addition to providing many more features, the PreView and PostView software are considered obsolete. PreView is no longer under active development since it is replaced by FEBioStudio. We highly encourage PreView users to switch to FEBio Studio. PostView will continue to be developed for the time being as it remains a convenient tool for analyzing and visualizing FEBio model results.  Support  Support for FEBio comes in various forms. A Theory manual and User manual are provided as part of the installation and are available online as well . Users can also ask questions on the FEBio User forums , as well as report bugs and make new feature requests.

The first Canadian music video ever made is said to be that of an Esquires song. The band is also notable as having had Bruce Cockburn as a later member, and also for one of its hit songs, \\"It's a Dirty Shame\\", having been written by William Hawkins. History The Esquires (not to be confused with the same-named R&B; group The Esquires from Milwaukee, Wisconsin) were co-founded in Ottawa, in 1962, by Clint Hierlihy and Gary Comeau, while both were still in high school. The band developed a strong local following during the 1962-1963 period, modeling their sound on that of Cliff Richard and the Shadows. The group attracted the attention of Montreal singer Marty Hill. They were asked to back Montreal singer Andy Kim for his performance during Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars in Montreal, where the band played on the same bill as Gene Pitney, The Dovells, Paul and Paula and The Tymes.Jaimie and Sharon Vernon, with notes from Cliff Hierlihy, Don Norman and Richard Patterson, Profile of The Esquires . The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia; www.jam.canoe.ca. The Esquires were signed to Capitol Records in 1963, and are considered to have been the first Canadian pop band to be signed to a major label. In 1964, they received the RPM Award, a predecessor to the Juno Awards, as Best Vocal and Instrumental Group. They became the opening act for some of the major performers of the day, including The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, The Dave Clark Five and Roy Orbison. The Esquires issued a series of singles, the biggest hit of which was \\"So Many Other Boys\\" (1964) and one album, Introducing The Esquires.John Bush, [ Portrait of The Esquires]; www.allmusic.com. Lead singer Don Norman, who had succeeded Bob Harrington as vocalist, split acrimoniously with the group in 1965, leading to a lawsuit when he named his new group Don Norman and The Esquires. Norman gave up his claim to The Esquires name, but his departure from the group is said to have cost them their contract with Capitol Records. Norman continued as Don Norman and The Other Four, with ex-Esquire Gary Comeau joining him.Portrait of Don Norman and The Other Four; www.garagehangover.com. The Esquires switched to Columbia Records, issuing two singles (including \\"It's a Dirty Shame\\" by William Hawkins),At the time, Hawkins had formed the band The Children, which included Bruce Cockburn and which had rapidly developed a national reputation; see William Hawkins. Cockburn later became a member of one of the final versions of The Esquires. prior to breaking up in 1967.

The episodes, which originally aired as a two-part one hour story on CBS-TV on October 16, 1977, was written by Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf, and directed by Paul Bogart. The episode depicts a man who, while posing as a police detective, attempts to rape the Bunker family matriarch, Edith, on her 50th birthday. This all happens while her family, unaware of what is happening in the Bunkers' living room, prepares for a surprise party next door (at Gloria, Edith's daughter's, house) to honor Edith. The scenes following the assault depict Edith struggling to deal with the aftermath, and her family's attempts to both comfort her and help bring her assailant to justice. The episodes, the 161st and 162nd of the series, were one of the first on television that portrayed an attempted rape. Plot On Edith Bunker's 50th birthday, her family plans a surprise party for her at her daughter Gloria's and son-in-law Mike Stivic's house next door. As Edith is in the process of baking her own birthday cake and waits for her cue to go to the Stivics' house, two visitors come over. The first one is her friend, Sybil, who complains to Edith for not inviting her to her party, thus spoiling the surprise. Sybil soon realizes that Archie (who hates her) was the one who invited all of the guests and not Edith. Edith invites her and the both of them chat for a while. As Sybil leaves, a handsome man in his early 30s and dressed in a suit arrives. The man identifies himself as a police detective named Lambert, claiming to be searching the neighborhood for a rapist. During his explanation, the man describes the clothes he's wearing himself and locks the door; Edith quickly realizes that Lambert is himself the rapist. Lambert tries repeatedly to assault Edith, and despite all her attempts to get away from her attacker, he is too strong and too smart for her. Edith offers the man coffee (he declines), explains that she has a party to go to and rambles on about her plans (he keeps her restrained, but with a stunned look on his face), tries to go to the bathroom (he offers to escort her), and has a panicked telephone conversation with one of her friends (Lambert waves a gun at her, warning her that letting slip about her predicament will mean death). Later, when her husband Archie appears to retrieve a punch bowl, the man hides in the closet and threatens to kill them both if Edith says anything. Once they are alone for the final time, and it appears Edith has exhausted all of her getaway attempts, the two smell something burning from the kitchen. It is the cake Edith was baking, and Lambert escorts her to the kitchen to pull it out. However, Edith uses this final opportunity as her chance to escape her ordeal, pushing the burned cake directly into her attacker's face. With his face burned, and before he can regain his senses, Edith pushes him out of the kitchen and onto the porch and slams the door behind her. Edith then flees the house and runs to Mike and Gloria's, where‚Äîjust as the party is about to get underway‚Äîshe breaks down in Archie's arms. As the second half-hour opens, Edith confides to her family what has happened. Gloria tries to press Edith to call the police, reminding her mother that she herself had suffered a similar attack three years prior. Archie reminds Gloria that, after being told by police that the lawyers would \\"turn it around\\" and make it look like Gloria \\"asked for it\\" if the case went to court, the family had decided to not press charges. Nonetheless, a confused and shaken Edith wants to just forget the ordeal. Archie and Mike then go inside the Bunker household to see if Lambert might still be inside. Mike finds his clothes in the closet, and Archie tells him not to \\"put his fingerprints all over the evidence\\". Mike then enters the kitchen and slips on the burnt birthday cake. Later, two police investigators arrive at the Bunker house, announcing they had picked up an apparently injured man wandering around in a back alley who fit the description of a subject wanted in a series of sexual assaults. At first, they mistakenly restrain Archie - thinking he is the rapist but Mike clears that up almost immediately. When the investigators attempt to get a statement from Edith, she immediately flees the room in a panic when she is shown the tie Lambert left behind in the closet with his shirt, jacket and fake badge. Two weeks then pass since the attempted rape, and Edith has entered into a state of constant fear and depression. Even Archie's unusually sensitive attempts to bolster her self-esteem (he kisses her) do no good. When they find out the same man has been arrested for attacking another woman, Gloria urges Edith to identify Lambert in a police lineup, or else the police will have to drop the pending charges against him; Edith continually changes the subject and refuses to listen. Eventually, an exasperated Gloria declares her mother \\"selfish\\" and shouts, \\"My mother always helps other people. You're not my mother anymore!\\" Edith slaps her, and her shock at having done so snaps her out of her depression; after expressing remorse for her action, Edith realizes she must identify her attacker. She leaves for the police station with Archie, hoping that her actions may put the rapist away for good. The episode closes on a comedic moment, where Gloria loudly whines from the pain of her slap, and Mike comforts her. Production \\"Edith's 50th Birthday\\" originally aired as a one-hour episode. In syndication, it is aired as a two-part episode. Norman Lear consulted with Gail Abarbanel, the founder and director of the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica Hospital, and hosted advance screenings for police and hospitals across the country.McCrohan, p. 75 It was originally suggested that this storyline be written so that Ann Romano (portrayed by Bonnie Franklin) would be the one attacked on an episode of One Day at a Time. However Norman Lear changed it to Edith Bunker because he wanted to make a statement that this could happen to anyone, even someone as simple and naive as Edith. The episode mentions events from the third season's \\"Gloria The Victim\\", in which Gloria was sexually assaulted while walking home from work. In that episode, Edith relates an incident where she herself had been the victim of an attempted date rape as a teenager in the 1940s, during a double date visit to Rockaway Beach, but due to the social norms of the time she had not pursued justice. Response The New York Police Department showed this episode, along with other films, to convey the woman's side of rape. It was also shown at rape crisis centers.McCrohan, p. ? In 1996, TV Guide included this episode as part of its \\"100 Most Memorable Moments in TV History\\", ranking it # 64.TV Guide's \\"100 Most Memorable Moments in TV History\\" 1996 According to an interview in the E! True Hollywood Story, which covered All in the Family, the scene where Edith uses the burnt cake to attack the rapist and then escape prompted the loudest cheers and applause from the studio audience in the history of the entire series.

It first appeared in the March 1955 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. In 1969 it was reprinted by Gollancz in the collection Off Centre.Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections The title is a play on the first words of Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, the Latin phrase meaning \\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country.\\"  Synopsis  Fred Jones is a writer. One day his British friend Walter Wallace comments on the strange pattern of Jones's typographical errors. Jones becomes obsessed with the topic, and finally discovers that his non-random errors produce almost meaningful sentences, like \\"JONS RISIV MESSG DLC\\". By this time Wallace has gone to Arizona; he sends a letter to Jones admitting that he has made a similar discovery about his own typing. Wallace's \\"messages\\" end in DCRM and Jones's in DLC; after failing to discover any meaning in the letters, Jones starts to think of them as abbreviations for names, \\"Dulcie\\" and \\"Decorum\\". Both men become increasingly distracted and disconnected from the world. Back home, Jones starts to speak in foreign languages, sometimes Russian, and he constructs an object in his garage that resembles a miniature building or maze. His wife tries unsuccessfully to break through the mental barrier with help of a friend. Jones comes to understand what has happened to him: sometime in the future, computers, originally designed to help humans with warfare, are given the power of command. They become all-powerful and all-controlling and lose sight of their original purpose. One of the two computers, \\"Dulcie\\", which Jones thinks of as a female, finds a way to simplify \\"her\\" work: > Probing into the mysteries of the human brain‚Äîso convenient and puzzling a > model of her own‚Äîshe found the pattern that could fix a mind forever in one > unreasoning conviction. She chose the simplest and best for her purpose: I > love Dulcie. She insinuated that pattern into the mind of every man, woman > and child within her reach. The two computers decided to simplify their war games by simulating the battles, with each killing the humans under their control that ‚Äúdie‚Äù in a simulation. When all the humans are gone, Dulcie, and her counterpart on the \\"Other Side\\" Decorum, begin to reach back in time for more humans to control, so that their simulations may have more humans as playing pieces, to kill when each loses a battle. As Jones realizes this, the computers ask him to die as a piece in their simulation. He does so happily.

Lee Pogostin and starring James Coburn and Lee Remick. It premiered on April 30, 1969 in Panavision. Plot synopsis CIA assassin John Cunningham (James Coburn), a cold-blooded killer with nerves of steel and no conscience, kills a man on election day, votes in the local election and spends the rest of the afternoon with Ellen (Karen Black), a prostitute. The next day, Cunningham goes to see James Ramsey (Burgess Meredith), his mobilizer, a CIA man whose cover is a job as a college physics professor. Ramsey offers one final, lucrative job, or \\"hard contract\\" as he calls it, that can allow Cunningham to retire from the business for good. This consists of three hits, two in Spain and Belgium, with the last victim to be revealed after the first two are dispatched. On his way to Spain to make the first hit, Cunningham meets two women in Tangier who will change his life: American tourist and jet setter Sheila Metcalfe (Lee Remick), and her naive but good-hearted friend, socialite Adrianne (Lilli Palmer). He does kill the first two victims, but later, as remorse slowly takes hold over him, Cunningham can't bring himself to knock off his third target, former top CIA hit-man Michael Carson (Sterling Hayden). A more vicious and effective hit-man in his day than Cunningham is now, Carson has become so passive, he wouldn't even defend himself. Ramsey flies to Spain to persuade Cunningham to complete the job, and promises Cunningham that if he does not do so, he will himself be killed, and so will Sheila. Cunningham drives Ramsey, Sheila, Carson, and everyone else who knows about him back down a mountain, and is close to deliberately causing a car crash that would free him for all time, only to relent at the last moment, telling a confused Ramsey afterwards that murder is obsolete. Ramsey is then romanced by Adrianne, much to his bemusement, and it's unclear if he has also weakened in his resolve. The ending is enigmatic, with Cunningham and Sheila running off together and beginning to make love, as Cunningham tells her that the worst deeds can be done for the best motives. The final image of them narrows to a circle around their heads, reminiscent of the image one would see in a rifle scope.

Pogostin instead pitched Hard Contract and Schwarz was enthusiastic. Pogostin insisted on directing. Schwartz financed the writing of the script over 15 months. Box office According to Fox records the film required $7,200,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $3,200,000 so made a loss to the studio.

It was the 41st edition of the bowl game. Game summary Freshman quarterback Chip Ferguson threw for 338 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and Tony Smith added 201 yards rushing as Florida State defeated Oklahoma State, 34‚Äì23, in the 41st annual Gator Bowl. FSU, which entered the game without its top three receivers, tricked Oklahoma State's defense by throwing on 15 of its first 20 plays. Derek Schmidt field goals of 23 and 39 yards, and a 39-yard touchdown catch by Herb Gainer sandwiched in between, gave FSU a 13‚Äì0 halftime lead. Oklahoma State got on the scoreboard following the intermission when a 63-yard drive ended in a 33-yard field goal by Brad Dennis. Ferguson, who was named Florida State's MVP, went back to the air, taking the Seminoles 73 yards on the next series before handing off to senior fullback Cletis Jones for a three-yard touchdown run. An interception by Deion Sanders gave the ball back to FSU, and Ferguson used just five plays before hitting Gainer with a 19-yard touchdown pass. That made the score 27‚Äì3, Florida State. Oklahoma State didn't give up with Cowboy quarterback Ronnie William passing 29 yards to All-America tailback Thurman Thomas for an Oklahoma State touchdown. Following a Ferguson fumble, Williams handed off to Thomas, who threw back to the quarterback for a 12-yard touchdown that closed the score to 27‚Äì17. Early in the fourth quarter, Ferguson scored from one yard out to give the Seminoles a 17-point cushion. The Cowboys added a late touchdown on a 31‚Äìyard pass from Williams to Hart Lee Dykes. Sophomore wide receiver Randy White, who had never caught a pass at FSU, grabbed four passes for 87 yards in the first half while Gainer, who had caught just five during the regular season, hauled in seven for 148 yards and two touchdown. Smith's 201 rushing yards came on 24 carries. The Seminole defense held Thomas in check the entire game, limiting him to 97 yards on 26 attempts.

He also did groundbreaking work in the field of anthropology. He studied at the wrong time; the Depression was the worst time for an anthropologist regardless of color to find work. Due to the circumstances King was pushed to the sidelines to become known as \\"The Anthropologist Who Never Was\\" (Harrison 1999:70). Anthropology and Vindication Anthropology is a broad field that includes many subsets. The main fields are Archeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic, and Cultural. However Dr. Louis Eugene King focused on the cultural field. Dr. Louis Eugene King is a little-known but important participant in the field of anthropology in the 20th Century. Focusing on the field of cultural anthropology, Dr. King emphasized the significance of cultural vindication, that is, proper documentation and study used to disprove harmful stereotypes, in his work at Columbia University and Howard University. Dr. King centered his studies on testing and subsequently disproving previously accepted ideas regarding intelligence level disparities between African American communities during the Great Migration period in the United States of America (1910-1930). If research like his, was not done to prove things like drapetomania wrong, then society would never had advance. Biography ''' Early Life Dr. Louis Eugene King was born in Barbados in 1898, the last of nine children. His parents died when he was a child, so he moved around a lot.(Harrison 1999:72) He was partly raised by his sister and her husband. He was a good student. He attended Dewitt Clinton High School, and Morgan College Academy.(Harrison 1999:72) Education Howard University \\"He taught school for a year before he attended Howard University. He was the editor of the student newspaper at Howard which was later renamed The Hilltop (newspaper).(Harrison 1999:72) He was the president of the student body at Howard. He was a general studies major and earned a Bachelor of Science degree while he was there. He was admitted into Howard medical school but was forced to drop out due to family responsibility\\".(Harrison 1999:72) Columbia University He attended Columbia to attain a PhD in Anthropology so that he could teach at Howard University.(Harrison 1999:72) He was a lab assistant for Otto Klineberg and Melville Herskovits.(Harrison 1999:72) He also studied under famous anthropologists such as Franz Boaz and Ernest E. Just.(Harrison 1999:72) He was a good student and hard worker but was constantly plagued by financial difficulties. He was constantly working to support himself; he managed to gain grudging respect from his peers despite being a negro.(Harrison 1999:73) To help with his financial troubles, he applied for the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial.(Harrison 1999:73) He used Franz Boaz as a reference, who gave him positive recommendations > \\"It seems to my mind that the opportunity for applying his knowledge is not > unfavorable. I understand there is a good opportunity that he may be > appointed at Howard University but I imagine that other Negro Universities > will hardly be able to get along very long without some work in this line. I > wish to repeat that I consider him well worthy of any support which may be > given to him\\" (Harrison 1999:73) He was invited to come back to teach at Howard but once he received his grant he decided to finish his work to receive a PhD.(Harrison 1999:73) Dissertation Louis Eugene King was one of, if not the first anthropologist who covered the African American communities in the United States. During the time that he was studying the black communities, it was more accepted to study Native American culture, as it was looked as a higher form of study than black culture.(Harrison 1999,75) He wanted to write objectively write about black community and family. He also focused on whether northern blacks were smarter than southern blacks, which is what popular belief indicated, that nature controlled intelligence. But he found through his studies that northern blacks didn't necessarily score better, but that intelligence was based on the environment of which the individual was raised in. This is all covered in his dissertation which was called \\"The Negro Life in Rural Community\\".(Harrison 1999,75) Later Life During the Depression there were very few jobs available for anthropology graduate students.(Harrison 1999:77) But he managed to get hired in 1934, as a junior historian at the Gettysburg National Military Park, but since he was the last the hired, he was the first fired.(Harrison 1999:76) In 1942 got a pick and shovel job at the Naval Supply Depot in Pennsylvania. He tried to resign when the war was over, but instead he became a management analyst.(Harrison 1999:81) One of his officers heard his story and contacted Columbia and printed three dissertation copies.(Harrison 1999:81) He received his diploma in 1965; thirty years later he finally received his PhD.(Harrison 1999,80) After not finding an academic job, he left the anthropological field and worked at the Naval Supply Depot.(Harrison 1999:81) Accomplishments Theses were Dr. King's major accomplishments:Harrison Faye V, Harrison Ira E, African American Pioneers in Anthropology.

His dissertation was his most significant accomplishment because his was the first that focused on the community studies and fieldwork on the African American community.(Harrison 1999:80) Also shed light on migration and intelligence.(Harrison 1999:81) Selective migration is when a certain culture or \\"race\\" moves to a new region to live. Back then it was believed that northern blacks were smarter than southern blacks, and that they were because they were smart enough to move out of the south.(Harrison 1999:81) King concluded in his dissertation that it is the result of one's environment and not one's \\"innate intellectual abilities\\".(Harrison 1999:81) 3\\\\. His points toward political nature of academic study because policy makers needed information on southern black life, but by the time he finished the climate changed and he did not receive credit.(Harrison 1999:81) 4\\\\.

A specialist in mining and veteran of both the Second Balkan War and World War I, he made a fortune in interwar Greater Romania. Gigurtu began his career in politics with the People's Party (PP) and the National Agrarian Party, moving closer to the far right during the 1930s, and serving as Minister of Industry and Commerce in the cabinet of Octavian Goga. Shortly after the start of World War II, Gigurtu was affiliated with King Carol's National Renaissance Front, serving as Public Works and Communications Minister and Foreign Minister under Premier Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu, before the territorial losses incurred by Romania in front of the Soviet Union propelled him as TƒÉtƒÉrescu's replacement. Gigurtu's executive was primarily noted for realizing the inability of France and the United Kingdom to guarantee Romania's borders and, accordingly, for the alignment with Nazi Germany. As part of this program, Gigurtu most notably enforced official antisemitism and racial discrimination, implementing locally a version of the Nuremberg Laws. Despite such measures, the government fell after being compelled by Germany to accept the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary, and was consequently forced to resign amidst nationwide protests. Gigurtu retreated from public life for the rest of the war, and, following the pro-Allied King Michael Coup, was arrested, investigated and released several times. Ultimately prosecuted by the newly proclaimed Communist regime as part of a show trial, he eventually died in prison. Biography Early life Born in Turnu Severin to General Petre Gigurtu and his wife Olga, the daughter of Barbu BƒÉlcescu, he attended primary school and gymnasium in his native city, followed by high school in Craiova. BƒÉlcescu, Barbu at the site of the Alexandru and Aristia Aman Dolj County Library He then went to the German Empire, pursuing secondary studies at the Freiberg Mining Academy and the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg and becoming a mining engineer. From 1912 to 1916, he worked as an industrial inspector at the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Commerce. During the Second Balkan War in 1913, he was a sub- lieutenant gathering intelligence for Army Corps I headquarters. From 1916 to 1918, he fought in Romanian campaign of World War I, first as a lieutenant and then as a captain.Neagoe, p.326 He was a founding member of the Romanian Society of Industry and Commerce (SERIC) in October 1919, and was head of the Mica Society from its founding in the spring of 1921 until October 1944. He was also president of the Nitrogen Society and of the Discount Bank (Banca de Scont).Neagoe, p.325 Joining Alexandru Averescu's People's Party after World War I, Gigurtu was not particularly active in politics during the 1920s and into the '30s, although he did serve in the Chamber of Deputies from 1926 to 1927. In mid-1927, he was part of the Romanian delegation to the Geneva Naval Conference. In April 1932, he followed Octavian Goga into the National Agrarian faction, a splinter group of the PP. In July 1937, the Industry and Commerce Ministry nominated him as a specialist on the Superior Economic Council. Aside from this party and the PP, he helped finance the mainstream National Peasants' Party and National Liberal Party, as well as the fascist National Christians and the Iron Guard.Nicolescu, p.162 During Goga's brief leadership of a National Christian cabinet (December 1937-February 1938), he was Minister of Industry and Commerce. The 1930s also saw him involved in journalistic activity on economic, domestic and foreign policy issues; he was founder and owner of the magazine Libertatea (January 1933-December 1940). Gigurtu, as a \\"pro-Nazi industrialist\\", was a friend of Hermann G√∂ring.Radu Ioanid, The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944, Ivan R. Dee, 2008, p. 38, Rise to power Gigurtu (left) with Joachim von Ribbentrop in Salzburg, July 1940 Following his imposition of a royal dictatorship, Carol II reconfirmed Gigurtu as a member of the Superior Economic Council in April 1938. He then made him Public Works and Communications Minister (November 1939-June 1940), Foreign Minister (June 1-June 28, 1940) and state secretary with ministerial rank (June 28-July 4, 1940) in successive cabinets led by Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu.Neagoe, p.326; Nicolescu, p.162 This coincided with a dire situation, in which the Soviet Union pressured Romania into ceding the regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina). As a member of the specially-convened Crown Council, Gigurtu himself participated in the decision to accept Soviet demands. As the country was left isolated when its alliance with the United Kingdom and France crumbled, and came under increasing pressure from Nazi Germany, Carol dismissed TƒÉtƒÉrescu. Earlier, Gigurtu's appointment as Foreign Minister had marked a turn toward Germany: he was replacing the Western-oriented Grigore Gafencu, who favoured a continuation of Romania's policy of official neutrality, and this immediately led to a treaty committing delivery of a fixed quantity of Romanian petroleum to Germany in exchange for military equipment.Keith Hitchins, Rumania : 1866-1947 (Oxford History of Modern Europe), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994, p.445. ; Marshall Lee Miller, Bulgaria During the Second World War, Stanford University Press, Palo Alto, 1975, p.29. The king turned to Gigurtu to be his next prime minister‚Äîhe was by then a wealthy industrialist who, aside from being a committed Germanophile well liked by Nazi circles, had good economic relations with important German businessmen. Gigurtu was also seen as a politically sound choice from a domestic viewpoint: loyal to the dictatorship, he had been part of the leadership of the ruling National Renaissance Front since the previous January, and oversaw its transformation into the overtly totalitarian Party of the Nation shortly before becoming premier. With this move, Carol hoped to reverse or at least delay implementation of Germany's decision to grant part of Transylvania region to Hungary.Deletant, p.23; Neagoe, p.326; Nicolescu, p.162-163 The part played by political circumstances in bringing Gigurtu to the premiership was highlighted by National Peasants' Party leader and Carol opponent Iuliu Maniu, who described the new head of government as \\"the most accidental prime minister of Romania\\". The cabinet too was meant to please the Axis: Foreign Minister Mihail Manoilescu was well-perceived in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and the pro-German Iron Guard was given three portfolios, one of which was initially held by its leader Horia Sima.Deletant, p.51, 56, 293; Nicolescu, p.163; Ornea, p.325 The latter resigned just three days after taking over leadership of the Culture Ministry, when Carol rejected his demand for an all-Guardist cabinet.Deletant, p.51, 293 The longest-held such office was the specially-created Ministry for the Inventory of Public Wealth, presided upon by Vasile Noveanu until September 3.Ornea, p.325, 330 Policies, loss of Northern Transylvania and downfall After his appointment, Gigurtu announced he would work to integrate Romania into the Axis sphere, taking a series of steps in that direction: withdrawal from the League of Nations (11 July); the signing of a new accord with Germany, assigning all grain surplus to that country and its allies (8 August); a ban on strike actions; arrests and detention in prison camps of left-wing politicians; and suspension of an already rubber-stamp legislative assembly.Nicolescu, p.163 One of the most far-reaching of these consequences targeted the Jewish Romanian community, and expanded on previous antisemitic legislation passed by the Goga executive. He thus upheld a decree-law revising the citizenship status of Jews, around a claim that many of them had illegally settled in Romania after 1919 (about a third of the total, or 225,222 individuals, had been stripped of their citizenship).Nicolescu, p.163; Ornea, p.392 Gigurtu also officially imposed racial antisemitism, adopting laws which defined as Jewish any third-generation descendant of a Jew (as opposed to Romanians \\"by blood\\"), and declaring that the definition of a Jew no longer depended on affiliation to Judaism (and was not altered by conversion to Christianity).Ornea, p.392 The law also instituted racial segregation, banning Jews from public service, removing them from all walks of life, and preventing marriages between Jews and Christians.Deletant, p.103; Ornea, p.392-393 Male Jews were no longer allowed to perform service in the army, but instead were required to perform community work for the state (muncƒÉ de interes ob»ôtesc).Deletant, p.103 This was in effect the application of criteria borrowed from Nazism and the German Nuremberg Laws.Deletant, p.103; Ornea, p.392 This antisemitic legislation, comprising two decrees, was enacted on 9 August 1940, available for all of the Romanian territories.Jonathan C. Friedman, Taylor & Francis, 2010, The Routledge History of the Holocaust, p. 279 In spite of these measures, he was unable to change Adolf Hitler's attitude toward Carol, whom the former considered to be hampering German interests in Romania. From late June to mid-July, the king exchanged several letters with Hitler who, using an ultimatum-like tone, demanded that Carol make territorial concessions to Hungary and Bulgaria, promising to guarantee Romania's new borders. Gigurtu, accompanied by Manoilescu, met Hitler and Ribbentrop at Berghof on 26 July. The Germans recommended the Romanian side immediately satisfy Hungary's demands through proposals and direct negotiations. The following day, they met Duce Benito Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano in Rome, suggesting that negotiations with Hungary and Bulgaria should start with population exchanges, with the borders adjusted later. A key point of Gigurtu's mandate was to convince the Germans that Romania considered Transylvania much more important than Bessarabia, a position stated by the premier in his August 27 letter to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs.Deletant, p.23 In the face of pressure and threats from the Axis, separate negotiations took place with Hungary and Bulgaria in August; the former necessitated intervention by Germany and Fascist Italy and resulted in the loss of Northern Transylvania in the Second Vienna Award, while the latter led to the cession of Southern Dobruja and a population exchange in early September after the signing of the Treaty of Craiova.Nicolescu, p.163-164 Following numerous protests against what was popularly labelled the \\"Vienna Diktat\\", Gigurtu's cabinet resigned on September 4, replaced within a few days by the monarch's rival Ion Antonescu.Deletant, p.48sqq; Nicolescu, p.164; Ornea, p.325-328 The Iron Guard, which had been plotting a coup d'√©tat against Carol after September 3, negotiated a partnership with Antonescu, setting up the fascist-inspired National Legionary State (which was to crumble during Sima's 1941 rebellion).Deletant, p.48sqq; Ornea, p.325sqq Reportedly, Gigurtu's decision to resign had been taken after the infuriated king told him to execute fifteen arrested Guardists, therefore aiding the rapprochement between Carol's opponents.Deletant, p.48 Final years, arrests and death Gigurtu stayed in Romania for the remainder of World War II. Arrested on October 5, 1944, after the King Michael Coup and ConducƒÉtor Antonescu's fall, he was held under house arrest in a Bucharest building starting in January 1945. He was held under a special law allowing for the arrest of those who \\"had conducted pro- German policies and who ceded Transylvania\\"; following Northern Transylvania's retrocession to Romania, the investigation stopped, his file was closed and Gigurtu was freed in June 1946. After this, he wished to return to direct his businesses, but pro-Communist prime minister Petru Groza advised him it would be better both for him and for his firms if he remained well away from them, which he did. Over the next two years, he was arrested and freed a number of times, his penultimate arrest being in December 1948, a year after the imposition of a Communist regime.Neagoe, p.327 Finally, on the night of May 5‚Äì6, 1950, Gigurtu was arrested, together with other former dignitaries of the monarchical period, and sent to Sighet prison. In the summer of 1956, most surviving political detainees were freed, except for former prime ministers, justice ministers and interior ministers, who were accused of \\"intense activity against the working class\\". Gigurtu had been held without trial at Sighet for nearly six years, but was finally judged in a public show trial and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. His appeal was rejected, and three years later, gravely ill and in serious pain, he died in the penitentiary at R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat. Gigurtu was rehabilitated by the Romanian Supreme Court in 1999.Martin Jung, Frank & Timme GmbH, 2016, In Freiheit: Die Auseinandersetzung mit Zeitgeschichte in Rum√§nien (1989 bis 2009), p. 245Wolfgang Benz, Brigitte Mihok, Metropol Verlag, 2009, Holocaust an der Peripherie: Judenpolitik und Judenmord in Rum√§nien und Transnistrien 1940-1944, pp. 204 and 207Eduard Ni≈æ≈àansk√Ω, Univerzita Komensk√©ho v Bratislave.

Biography  He was the MP many times. He was Minister of Justice in the Ionescu cabinet (December 17, 1921 - January 19, 1922), the »òtirbey cabinet (June 4 - 20, 1927), the Seventh Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu cabinet (June 22 - November 24, 1927) and the VintilƒÉ I. C. BrƒÉtianu cabinet (November 24, 1927 - November 9, 1928). He ran the Universul newspaper for 1915-1945, transforming it into one of the most readable newspapers of the interwar period. Being a right-wing journalist, the newspaper remained influenced by this ideas, which attracted many adversities, especially from the social- democratic or socialist newspapers, such as the newspaper ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù( Adevarul). He criticized the governments of the time, came into conflict with king Carol II of Romania, and at the beginning of the 40s he unconditionally supported Marshal Ion Antonescu. On his initiative, between 1926 and 1930, the Universe Palace was built, the headquarters of the editorial and typography of the Universul newspaper. In 1933, the \\"Anti-revisionist League\\" was founded in Romania, led by Stelian Popescu, a nationalist with an audience in Romania, who was fighting against Hungary's claims on Transylvania, in writing and in public events. The activity of the Anti-revisionist League was banned by Carol the IInd on March 7, 1939. In 1944 Stelian Popescu took refuge in Switzerland, the newspaper's management remaining in the hands of one of his sons-in-law, Ion Lugosianu. After the World War II, in Romania, he was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was included in the \\"group of 14 journalists\\", along with, among others, by Pamfil Sheicaru, Nichifor Crainic and Radu Gyr. All were accused that \\"through newspaper articles, brochures or conferences, they were serving to Fascist or Hitler propaganda or they contributed by their action to support a hateful regime and a bad foreign policy, a policy that had to have the consequences of Romania implication in a disastrous adventure and the political and military collapse of the country‚Äù. Before the war, his influence had become so great that his hometown was renamed \\"Stelian Popescu\\" by the Liberal government. Regarding this naming, Marta Breaban wrote the following in her journal: ‚ÄúIt was called Stelian Popescu because the director of the Universe newspaper at that time was born in this commune, his father being a priest here. In his native village, Stelian Popescu built the church, school, town hall and dispensary. The church was painted by the painter Norocea who has followed the desingof the Court of Arge»ô.‚Äù Stelian Popescu had a house in Bucharest, on Dionisie Lupu street (today Tudor Arghezi) no. 10 bis, built in 1911, that was built according to the design of architect Paul Smarandescu. Stelian Popescu also had the villa in Balchik, built in 1936 by the architect Henrieta Delavrancea - Gibory. The villa was demolished in 2009, because it was inclined due to the settlement of the land, and on that land a hotel was built. In 1933 Eusta»õiu Stoenescu painted the portrait of Stelian Popescu. The Student House of Culture in Bucharest, on Calea Plevnei, was built by public subscription of Stelian Popescu, who donated it to the University, on November 18, 1937, with the same destination that it has today.

Lorca bets that if he can impress Lazar with his collection, Lazar must agree to let him keep the specimen. Lazar agrees and is initially impressed but when they enter Lorca‚Äôs private study they find the 4 jars broken and the specimens gone, leaving tracks to a vent shaft. Lorca locks down his castle with a special security system while Sheila holds the four at gunpoint. After no one will confess to taking the specimens, Lorca locks them in a closet and goes to search the castle. A tapping on the wall draws the prisoner‚Äôs attention. Talking through the wall, they‚Äôre able to guide ‚Äúthe tapper‚Äù (the specimens) with yes or no questions into prying open the locked door. Lorca returns and the four specimens are finally revealed to everyone. When Yost goes to gather the specimens, she falls on the skeletal creature and is stuck with its spine-like hair while the hairless ape creature attacks Sheila. The blob grabs the gun and shoots at the humans. They barricade themselves in a bedroom, for some time. Elvina is sleeping on the bed when the hairless ape creature sneaks under her blanket and begins breast feeding on her. She wakes and panics, running out of the room where she trips and falls over a balcony railing, to her death below. The remaining five go below in search of the creatures. Lorca and Lazar each try luring the creatures but they run off causing the two men to begin to fight with some nearby swords. Yost triggers a boobytrap while trying to escape solo and is impaled. Lorca and Lazar‚Äôs sword fight moves over the acid bath trapdoor and the hairless ape creature presses the button, causing both men to fall and dissolve in the acid. Sheila uses the security override keycard to lure the specimens out onto a carpet, then uses the carpet to sweep them into the open acid bath. Sheila and Kantor leave in his car without seeing the bloody tracks leading up the ladder out of the acid trap. As they drive off, the creatures are seen through the trunk‚Äôs keyhole.

The film was covered in William Shatner‚Äôs FullMoon Fright Night in what Shatner introduces as ‚Äúa clammy, goosepimple-covered episode‚Äù, a reference to the grotesque-ness of the film‚Äôs monsters . FullMoon Fright Night was a 13 episode TV series hosted by William Shatner that aired Aug-Oct in 2002. Each episode screened a different film produced and/or directed by Charles Band throughout his career and features 8-10 minutes in additional footage of Shatner and his mute, zombie bartender co-host sprinkled throughout. Its campy tone reflected the many humorous aspects and campiness of Band‚Äôs films while also relating bits of trivia on each film. For example, Shatner had this to say about Hideous! ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a fun fact for you: the creatures in Hideous! are actually an ingenious combination of puppets and computer generated animation.‚Äù The film‚Äôs credits list the Copyright ¬© 1997 Tanna Productions Inc.

Reception The film‚Äôs IMDb page currently has 35 Reviews from critics published on various film review websites and blogs in multiple countries. They are generally mixed to negative. TV Guide gave the film 1/4 stars in a review that cites the film‚Äôs Romanian shooting locations as being its ‚Äúmost interesting‚Äù aspect and criticizes the film‚Äôs script and monsters saying that while the dialogue may be semi-witty, exposition is repeated in an attempt to ‚Äúpad the film to feature length‚Äù, and that the creatures are ‚Äúbarely convincing and barely articulated‚Äù. Rotten Tomatoes currently only holds 1 published critic‚Äôs review of the film, calling it ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù, giving it a 1/4 or ‚ÄúRotten‚Äú.

At the 2006 census, its population was 34,632. Description The spoken language in the city is Kurdish, but the language which is used in schools and offices is Persian, since the official language in Iran is Persian. Almost everyone in the city is fluent in Persian. There are several rock reliefs from the Lullubian period in Sarpol-e Zahab. The town is also identified as the site of the ancient and medieval town of Hulwan. The population of Sarpol-e Zahab comprises Kurds who speak the Kalhori, Gorani and Sorani (Jaf) dialects of Kurdish.

Reliefs The area of Sar-e Pol-e Zahab has several more or less well preserved reliefs of the Lullubi kingdom, as well as a Parthian relief. Lullubian reliefs The most famous of these reliefs is the Anubanini rock relief. Another relief named Sar-e Pol-e Zohab I is about 200 meters away, in a style similar to the Anubanini relief, but this time with a beardless ruler. The attribution to a specific ruler remains uncertain. There are also other Lullubian relief in the same area of Sar-e Pol-e Zahab.

It was a side-by-side two seater called the Kendall Crabpot I, with a 60 ft. span and an aspect ratio of 18. A version with a novel asbestos fibre-polymer wing and a wooden fuselage with a butterfly tail was proposed by Miles, but the wing failed under low loads. Elliotts of Newbury built a conventional wooden wing to use with Miles' fuselage. The resulting glider flew, but not well and development was abandoned with just one example built. Development The wooden Crabpot was not built as designed but developed in two forms, differing in their wing construction. The most radical version was that part constructed by Kendall's employer, Miles Aircraft. This, known as the Miles M.76, was undertaken for the British Gliding Association, with financial backing for the project from the Miles company, the Kemsley Flying Trust, and the Ministry of Supply. The design included an experimental wing from by the plastics division of F. G. Miles, Ltd., built from a phenolic/asbestos fibre material stabilized with a paper honeycomb, the manufacturing technique being based on the vacuum moulding process pioneered by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The span wing was to be made in two semi-span sections each consisting of one moulding, considered to be the largest one-piece moulded phenolic/asbestos structures manufactured at that time. The new wing also had a different section from that of the Crabpot, a laminar flow 6- digit NACA airfoil rather than the original 5-digit one. However, the structure proved much weaker under test than intended and was abandoned.Ellison p.139 The possible failure of this novel wing to be delivered in time had been anticipated by the building of a wooden wing to the same specification by Elliotts of Newbury, to be fitted to the Miles-built wooden fuselage, shorter than the Crabpot and with a butterfly tail. This glider was known as the Kendall K.1 or by the Elliotts' designation EoN Type 9 K.1 and first flew in March 1954. It was not a success, failing to obtain its certificate of airworthiness because of insoluble spinning characteristics. Designer Hugh McLennan Kendall flew with the Fleet Air Arm during the war, and was involved in air-racing prior to and after the war. He was the Chief Test Pilot for Handley Page (Reading), formerly Miles Aircraft Ltd., and as such flight tested many types. He flew the maiden flight of the Mamba powered H.P/Miles Marathon 2. As well as designing the Crabpot, Kendall was the designer and test pilot for the Somers- Kendall SK-1, Britain's first ever light jet. The maiden flight was made by Hugh Kendall on 8 October 1955. After he ended his test flying career, he joined Shell-Mex and B.P Ltd as technical liaison with the aircraft industry and airlines. He died in 1999.

Like most of the Turkish Verbascum-species it is endemic to Anatolia. about 9300 species of vascular plant were known to grow in Turkey. By comparison, Europe as a whole contains only about 24% more species (about 11500), despite having thirteen times the area. The most important reasons for the high plant biodiversity are believed to be the relatively high proportion of endemics, together with the high variety of soils and climate of Turkey.  Endemism  serpentine mountain near Muƒüla, was described as new to science in 1995. A third of Turkish plant species are endemic to Turkey: one reason there are so many is because the surface of Anatolia is both mountainous and quite fragmented. In fact the Anatolian mountains resemble archipelagos like the famous Galapagos Islands. Since Darwin we know that geographic isolation between islands or separated mountains is an important means of speciation, leading to high spatial diversity. For Anatolia this assumption is confirmed by concentrations of endemism on highly isolated and relatively old massifs such as Uludaƒü and Ilgaz Daƒü, whereas very young volcanic cones such as Ercyes Daƒü and Hassan Daƒü are surprisingly poor in endemics.Gypsum hills south of Sivas: gypsum and serpentine areas are exceptionally rich in endemic species As local endemics take a long time to evolve, we also have to compare the history of the central and north European mountains with the Anatolian ones. During each of the glacial periods the former were covered by thick shields of permanent ice, which destroyed most pre-glacial endemism and hindered neo- endemics from forming. Only less glaciated, peripheral areas, the so-called ‚Äúmassifs de refuge‚Äù, offered suitable conditions for the survival of local endemics during glacial periods. In Anatolia the Pleistocene glaciations only covered the highest peaks, so there are many species with small ranges. In other words: Anatolia as a whole is a big ‚Äúmassif de refuge‚Äù, showing all degrees of past and recent speciation.  Ecologic diversity  For a visitor from Central Europe climatic diversity within Turkey is quite astonishing. All climatic zones present in Europe can be found in Turkey on a somewhat smaller scale. The Black Sea coast is humid all year round, with the highest rainfall between Rize and Hopa. South of the Pontic Range there is much less rain so Central Anatolia is dry; also it is cold in the winter. Approaching the southern and western coasts, the climate turns more and more Mediterranean, with mild but very rainy winters and dry, hot summers. This simple scheme is complicated a lot by the mountainous surface of Anatolia. On the high mountains harsh climatic conditions persist all the year round and, , there are glaciers in Turkey, for example on Mount Ararat. Also Anatolia‚Äôs diversity of soils is astonishingly high. Saline soils are quite common in the driest parts of central Anatolia: and also the Aras valley between Kaƒüƒ±zman and Armenia is full of impressive salt outlets, some pouring directly out of the mountains and thus resembling snow patches from a distance. South of Sivas and around G√ºr√ºn there are extensive gypsum hills with a very special flora. A further lot of endemics have been described from the extensive serpentine areas in South-West Anatolia, especially Sandras Daƒü (Cicekbaba D.) near K√∂yceƒüiz. The Anatolian diagonal is an ecological dividing line which runs slant-wise across central and eastern Turkey from the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea to the southeastern part of the Black Sea. Many species of plant that exist west of the diagonal are not present to the east, while others found to the east are not in the west. Of 550 species analysed, 135 were found to be \\"eastern\\" and 228 \\"western\\". Besides the Anatolian diagonal forming a barrier to floral biodiversity, about four hundred species of plant are endemic to the diagonal itself.  Main components of the Turkish flora  Heavily pastured thorn-cushion vegetation, consisting mainly of Astragalus angustifolius.‚Äî Melendiz Daƒüi (Niƒüde), c. 2000 m s.l. Species-numbers of the most important genera in Turkey With almost 400 species the genus Astragalus (milk-vetch, goat's-thorn; Fabaceae) has by far the most species of the Turkish flora; as historically humans have dramatically expanded its favored treeless, dry and heavily grazed habitats. But not as many as Central Asia: the former USSR has twice as many. The plasticity of this genus is astonishingly high. Depending on environmental conditions a big variety of life-forms evolved, ranging from tiny annuals to small woody and thorny bushes. Speciation seems to be in plain progress in Astragalus. Nearly all of its different sections consists of clusters of closely related species whose determination is one of the hardest tasks in a closer study of the Anatolian flora. One of the most successful growth forms of Turkish Astragali is the thorn cushion, which is very characteristic of the dry mountains of inner Anatolia. Such thorn cushions were not exclusively invented by many Astragali. Really striking examples of convergent evolution are the impressive thorn cushions of Onobrychis cornuta, also belonging to the Fabaceae. But there are a lot of thorn cushions also in Acantholimon (Plumbaginaceae). Even some Asteraceae (in Turkey e.g. Centaurea urvillei, C. iberica) and Caryophyllaceae (e.g. Minuartia juniperina) evolved in that direction. Second in importance comes Verbascum (Scrophulariaceae) and third is Centaurea (Asteraceae). For Verbascum Turkey evidently is the centre of distribution. Of approximately 360 species worldwide no less than 232 are to be found in Turkey, almost 80% of them being Anatolian endemics! Most Verbascum species are protected against water loss and hungry cattle by a dense cover of tree-shaped micro hairs. Centaurea species rarely have woolly hairs, but in defence against heavy grazing developed thorny phyllaries, or evolved to have no visible stem or a very short one.  Vegetation  Pinus nigra forms extensive stands in the central Taurus Mts.‚Äî between Akseki and Bademli, 1360 m s.l. The Pontic mountain range along the north Anatolian coast is a more or less continuous barrier against humid air from the Black Sea, causing high precipitation on the northern slopes of the Pontus all year. Climatic conditions on the northern coast therefore resemble those in central Europe and so does the vegetation. A limited Mediterranean influence is noticeable only on a very narrow coastal strip, but almost completely missing in the north-east. In the lower forest zone often Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) prevails, frequently intermingled with Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa). Further up Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis) and/or Nordmann Fir (Abies nordmanniana) form extensive forests. Humidity becomes extremely high in Lazistan, where the Pontic barrier culminates in the nearly 4000 m high Ka√ßkar Mountains. East of Trabzon therefore vegetation becomes somewhat sub-tropic, with a lot of evergreens in the forest and tea plantations everywhere on the slopes. South of the Pontic watershed the climate immediately gets drier. In the mountains first Abies nordmanniana, but then soon Pinus becomes dominant. In the western parts of Anatolia this is often Black Pine (Pinus nigra), in the east nearly exclusively Scotts Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Penetrating further into the central parts of inner Anatolia leads to still dryer, wintercold conditions. Today the lower parts of central Anatolia are virtually treeless. Fields on deep alluvial soils alternate with steppe on the dryer hills. But it is still an open question where and to what degree this central Anatolian steppe is due to aridity or to human deforestation. Aridity is most pronounced around Tuz G√∂l√º south of Ankara and in the Aras-valley near the Armenian border. Between Kaƒüizman and Tuzluca this valley is so dry, that here and there pure salt deposits glitter like white snowfields on the bare slopes. The Taurus Mountains form the southern edge of the central Anatolian Plateau and are already very influenced by the Mediterranean, with a lot of snow in winter, but dry and warm summers. Climax forests are formed by Black Pine, Cilician Fir (Abies cilicica) and Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus libani). Unfortunately there has been a lot of deforestation in the Taurus, most gravely affecting the stands of Cedrus. On the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts pronounced Mediterranean conditions prevail, with very hot and dry summers and very rainy winters. Antalya Province has considerably more total precipitation than, for example, the south of England (1071 mm versus 759 mm), but its seasonal distribution is completely different and average temperature is of course much higher (18.3 ¬∞C versus 9.7¬∞). Such conditions favour the growth of hard-leaved evergreen trees such as Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera) and Turkish Pine (Pinus brutia). But due to massive forest destruction hills and slopes in coastal West and South Anatolia are nowadays mostly covered with macchie. Where fertile alluvial soils prevail, e.g. in the Cilician Plain around Adana, there is intense agriculture.

Early versions of mod_deflate provided lesser amount of compression than mod_gzip.Comparison of mod_deflate and mod_gzip Starting with Apache 2.0.45, the compression level of mod_deflate is configurable using the DeflateCompressionLevel directive, so this difference disappeared. A mod_gz module was independently developed by Ian Holsman. This module implements a gzip compression filter for Apache 2.0, providing similar functionality to mod_gzip. One important difference between the two modules is that mod_gzip includes its own gzip implementation, whereas mod_gz relies on an external zlib library.

History  Little, Brown was established in Boston by Charles Little and James Brown in 1837, and was bought by Time Inc in 1968. Little, Brown became part of the Time Warner Book Group when Time merged with Warner Communications in 1989. Little, Brown USA bought what became Little, Brown Book Group UK in 1992.  Imprints  Macdonald and Futura Macdonald and Futura was founded in 1938 and Futura was founded in 1973. The Macdonald Futura publishing company was sold to Little, Brown USA in 1992 and the imprint changed to Little, Brown. The paperback imprint then became Warner, and since 2006, Sphere. Sphere Sphere was founded in 1967 by the International Thomson Organisation, sold to Penguin in 1986, then sold to Robert Maxwell in 1989. In 1992 it was acquired by Little, Brown USA at which time the commercial paperback list was changed to Warner. In 2006 the name reverted to Sphere. Under its Sphere imprint, Little, Brown publishes commercial fiction and non-fiction, including crime novels, celebrity autobiographies, romantic comedies and humour. In 2005 the Sphere imprint was nominated for a British Book Award. Sphere fiction writers include household names such as Patricia Cornwell, Mark Billingham, Val McDermid, Jenny Colgan and Dorothy Koomson; rising stars such as Kate Furnivall, Boyd Morrison and Christopher Ransom; and international bestsellers Mitch Albom, Nicholas Sparks, Carl Hiaasen and Nicholas Evans among others.

Little, Brown  Little, Brown is the literary hardback imprint that feeds into Abacus paperbacks. It publishes across a wide range of areas, including fiction, history, memoir, science and travel. Soon after the company‚Äôs establishment Little, Brown published Iain Banks's The Crow Road ‚Äì and all of Banks‚Äô fiction is now published by Abacus (with his SF in Orbit). In 2012, Little, Brown acquired and published Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling's first novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy and, in 2013, Rowling's foray into crime fiction, The Cuckoo's Calling published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Little, Brown/Abacus have published many great American writers, including Donna Tartt, Gore Vidal, E. L. Doctorow, David Sedaris, Candace Bushnell and Anita Shreve. Little, Brown non-fiction authors include historians Tom Holland, Juliet Barker, Eric Hobsbawm, Thomas Pakenham and writers as diverse as Tim Harford, Professor Steve Jones, Will Hutton and Evan Davis.  Abacus  Abacus was founded in 1973 as part of Sphere. In the early days it was strictly a non-fiction list with something of an ecological flavour, producing classics such as E.F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful and T.C. McLuhan's Touch the Earth. Primo Levi‚Äôs series of masterworks, including If This is a Man, The Periodic Table and Moments of Reprieve, was soon added and a tradition of bestselling high-quality memoir was established: Nelson Mandela‚Äôs Long Walk to Freedom; Gore Vidal‚Äôs Palimpsest and Point to Point Navigation; and historian William Woodruff‚Äôs double No. 1 bestsellers The Road to Nab End and Beyond Nab End. Abacus was one of the first publishers of behavioural economics with the groundbreaking Malcolm Gladwell book The Tipping Point, followed by the bestselling Tim Harford Undercover Economist series. In 2009 Abacus published Gillian Tett‚Äôs award-winning work on the financial crisis, Fool‚Äôs Gold. Abacus fiction publishing began with Jane Gardam. Gardam has twice won the Whitbread Novel Award, part of an excellent Whitbread record that includes Joan Brady‚Äôs Book of the Year for Theory of War, Beryl Bainbridge‚Äôs Novel Award for Every Man for Himself and Christopher Wilson‚Äôs shortlisting for The Ballad of Lee Cotton.

Abacus publishes some original paperback fiction and non-fiction including Jos√© Carlos Somoza (whose Athenian Murders won the CWA Gold Dagger), Guillermo Mart√≠nez, Charlie Connelly and Michele Giuttari.  Orbit  Orbit is an international publisher that specialises in science fiction and fantasy books. It was founded in 1974 as part of the Macdonald Futura publishing company. In 1992, its parent company was bought by Little, Brown & Co., at that stage part of the Time Warner Book Group. In 1997, Orbit acquired the Legend imprint from Random House. In summer 2006, it was announced that Orbit would expand internationally, with the establishment of Orbit imprints in the United States and Australia. Orbit Publishing Director Tim Holman relocated to New York to establish Orbit US as an imprint of Hachette Book Group USA. In June 2007, Orbit announced the appointment of Bernadette Foley as publisher for Orbit Australia, an imprint of Hachette Livre Australia. Some of the authors published by Orbit include the following: Brent Weeks, R.

Sullivan, Robert Jordan, Joel Shepherd and Orson Scott Card.  Virago  Nearly 40 years on from its beginnings around Carmen Callil‚Äôs kitchen table in 1973, Virago has become one of the most successful British publishing imprints and the outstanding international publisher of books by women. Virginia Woolf's well known cri de coeur from A Room of One's Own, 'if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly as we think...' was truly realised in the 1970s. The rise of the Women's Liberation Movement was causing seismic shifts in the march of the world's events; women's creativity and political consciousness was soon to change the face of publishing and literature. Virago owes its inspiration to these times: \` An exciting new imprint for both sexes in a changing world‚Äô. Virago was conceived by Carmen Callil. From 1973 to 1975 it was run by an independently owned editorial imprint by Carmen Callil, Ursula Owen and Harriet Spicer. In 1976 Virago became self-financing and independent with capital of just ¬£1,500 and a loan of ¬£10,000. In 1977, inspired by, among other things, Sheila Rowbotham's Hidden from History, Virago began the Virago Reprint Library, which fed an eager new audience‚Äôs desire for women‚Äôs history. Then in 1978 the first of the Virago Modern Classics, Frost in May by Antonia White, was published. It launched a list dedicated to the celebration of women writers and to the rediscovery and reprinting of their works, hugely guided by the influential A Literature of Their Own by Elaine Showalter. Its aim remains to demonstrate the existence of a female literary tradition and to broaden the sometimes narrow definition of a classic. Published with new introductions by some of today‚Äôs best writers, the list encompasses such diverse writers as George Eliot, Grace Paley, Elizabeth von Arnim, Pat Barker, Edith Wharton, Mae West, Angela Carter, Willa Cather and Molly Keane. It has become one of Virago‚Äôs most famous hallmarks. \\"The Virago Modern Classics have reshaped literary history and enriched the reading of us all. No library is complete without them\\" Margaret Drabble In 1982 Virago became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chatto, Virago, Bodley Head and Cape Group. In 1987 Callil, Lennie Goodings, Ursula Owen, Alexandra Pringle and Harriet Spicer put together a management buy-out from CVBC, then owned by Random House, USA. The buy-out was financed by Rothschild Ventures and Robert Gavron. Random House UK kept a 10 per cent stake in the company and continued to handle sales and distribution. In 1993 Rothschild Ventures sold its shares to the directors and Gavron, who thus became the largest single shareholder. In 1996 the directors sold the company to Little, Brown and Lennie Goodings remained as Virago‚Äôs Publisher. Virago has flourished under the Little, Brown umbrella to become, today, a brand name and in 2010, won The Bookseller‚Äôs Imprint of the Year Award. Lennie Goodings (publisher of Virago) won Editor of the Year. Virago‚Äôs contemporary fiction list includes award-winners and bestsellers including Margaret Atwood, Marilynne Robinson, Sarah Waters, Linda Grant, Sarah Dunant, Gillian Slovo, Shirley Hazzard; from the Man Booker to the Orange Prize for Fiction. Virago launched its non-fiction list with memoirs and biography ‚Äì Vera Brittain‚Äôs Testament of Youth and Maya Angelou‚Äôs I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ‚Äì and continues with the bestselling The Bolter by Frances Osborne; Lyndall Gordon‚Äôs biography of Emily Dickinson, Lives Like Loaded Guns; Shirley Williams‚Äô autobiography; and Ingrid Betancourt‚Äôs memoir. Continuing to publish up-to- date, thought-provoking analysis, Virago has published Natasha Walter, Joanna Bourke, Naomi Wolf, Lisa Appignanesi and √Ösne Seierstad‚Äôs The Bookseller of Kabul.  Atom  Atom is the young adult imprint of Little, Brown Book Group. It was founded in 2002 within the science fiction and fantasy imprint of Orbit but has since become an independent imprint focused on publishing mainstream and supernatural YA fiction.

The book was published on October 1, 2009 and is set in London's Highgate Cemetery where, after a year of research for the book, Niffenegger acted as a tour guide. Title The novel's title is inspired by William Blake's poem \\"The Tyger\\", which begins \\"Tyger! Tyger! burning bright / In the forests of the night, / What immortal hand or eye / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\". Given the novel's setting, some critics have also pointed out a potential verbal pun in the novel's title, since in received pronunciation \\"symmetry\\" and \\"cemetery\\" are almost homophonous.Book Review ‚Äì 'Her Fearful Symmetry', By Audrey Niffenegger ‚Äì Review ‚Äì NYTimes.com (Reviewed by Susan Cokal) There is also a physical symmetry between two of the main characters ‚Äì identical twins with mirrored internal organs. Plot summary  Elspeth dies of leukemia. Her apartment, located beside Highgate cemetery in London, is left for the daughters of Edwina, her estranged twin sister. Elspeth's nieces, identical twins Julia and Valentina, do anything together, though Julia is the more dominant twin. Valentina has asthma and has a heart valve that has not been properly formed, which occasionally makes her ill. The sisters move to London and take up residence in Elspeth's flat. Robert, Elspeth's former lover, lives in the apartment below them. Robert is employed as a tour guide in the cemetery as a way of learning more for his thesis work on the cemetery. Valentina begins falling in love with Robert and he quickly reciprocates, primarily because of her resemblance to Elspeth. Martin, a man whose wife, Marijke, has left him because of his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), lives in the apartment above. Julia befriends Martin and gives him Anafranil (a pill for OCD), pretending that it is a vitamin. Martin is aware that she is giving him the medication, but feigns ignorance. Unknown to either of the sisters for the first year they are in London, Elspeth is trapped inside the apartment as a ghost - invisible and completely mute. However, Valentina discovers her awareness of Elspeth's moods. One day, she sees Elspeth in the apartment. The twins find a stray kitten near the cemetery. After several failed attempts, they lure it into their apartment and begin taking care of the kitten. One day, while playing with the twins, the kitten abruptly drops dead. The twins realize that the kitten's soul had been caught on Elspeth's hand. Elspeth puts the kitten's soul back into its body and is able to bring it back to life. A recurring theme throughout the story is Valentina's discontent with being one half of a whole (her twinship with Julia). She is the weaker twin both physically (given her illness) and emotionally. Julia calls Valentina \\"Mouse\\" because of her fearful attitude towards everything. As the story progresses, Valentina becomes emotionally stronger and decides she must break away from Julia to be able to live her life. Valentina plans to fake her own death. She asks her aunt to temporarily remove her soul and instructs Robert to preserve her body. Horrified, Robert refuses to participate. He decides to read the diaries and letters that Elspeth left him when she died. He finds out that there was no rift between Edwina and Elspeth, but rather a secret they shared that made it impossible for them to be together again: for decades, the two woman have been assuming each other's identity. The recently deceased \\"Elspeth\\" (actually Edwina) is the mother of Julia and Valentina. Decades ago, Elspeth was engaged to Jack, an American working in London. Insecure about their relationship, she pretended to be Edwina and made advances toward Jack to test him. Jack knew that she was not Edwina, but played along anyways. On April Fool's Day, Jack and (the real) Edwina become intoxicated at a party and later have sex, which Jack was too inebriated to remember. Thereafter, Elspeth marries Jack, but it was actually Edwina who moved to America with him, and gave birth to Julia and Valentina. When the girls were four months old, Edwina brought them to London, and they switched places so that Elspeth could be together with Jack. Edwina had been living away from her children until her death. Later, Valentina, Robert, and Elspeth proceed with the plan. \\"Elspeth\\" removes and holds onto Valentina's soul. Robert then makes it appear as if an asthma attack killed Valentina. Julia discovers Valentina's body and is devastated. A funeral is held with Valentina's coffin being interred in the family mausoleum in Highgate Cemetery. Later that day, Robert retrieves the body and takes it to his flat. When Valentina's body is woken up, Robert discovers that the soul inside Valentina is \\"Elspeth.\\" She tells Robert that Valentina's soul has dispersed, and that she decided to take over the body. Valentina then becomes a ghost trapped inside the apartment. Julia continues living there, hoping to one day see her as Valentina had seen Elspeth. Eventually, the sisters are able to communicate with one another, and Valentina learns how to leave the apartment. While Julia remains sad for her sister's fate, Valentina is now free and happy. Eventually, Martin moves out of his apartment and his son Theo moves in. Soon after, Julia and Theo begin dating. One day, after a run in with Julia who is suspicious but uncertain, \\"Elspeth\\" (in Valentina's body) informs Robert that they need to leave England. She proposes moving to Sussex, where she has always wanted to live. Robert realizes that \\"Elspeth\\" is abusive and manipulative - always getting her way, which brings about harsh feelings among the family. They move to Sussex, where the relationship between Robert and \\"Elspeth\\" deteriorates with Robert ignoring her most of the time. \\"Elspeth\\" delivers a baby boy and one day, shortly after the child is born, she returns to their little cottage after a walk and discovers that Robert's thesis has been completed and is lying on the table. Robert has vanished, never to return. Critical reception AudioFile magazine called Niffenegger \\"a master storyteller\\" and praised her \\"skill in bringing plausibility to the unthinkable\\" as well as audiobook narrator Bianca Amato's narration.

The original 20-story structure on Battery Place, between West Street and Washington Street, was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, while the 31-story Whitehall Building Annex on West Street was designed by Clinton and Russell. The original building and annex are both at 17 Battery Place. Another 22-story addition at 2 Washington Street, an International Style building located north of the original building and east of the annex, was designed by Morris Lapidus. The original Whitehall Building and its annex has a Renaissance Revival style facade, and the two original structures' articulations consist of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column‚Äînamely a base, shaft, and capital. Since the building is located on landfill along the Hudson River, its foundation incorporates a non-standard design. The Whitehall Building is named after the nearby estate of New Amsterdam colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant. The original building was built as a speculative development in 1902‚Äì1904 for Robert A. and William H. Chesebrough, a real estate company. The annex was built in 1908‚Äì1910, and 2 Washington Street was built in 1972. In 2000, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Whitehall Building as an official city landmark. The upper floors of the original building and annex were converted to apartments, while the lower floors remain in use as an office building.  Site  Viewed from the Battery, to the left of the Brooklyn- Battery Tunnel ventilation building. The Downtown Athletic Club and 21 West Street are located behind the annex and 2 Washington Street (center left); One World Trade Center is under construction at right. The Whitehall Building is located near the southernmost point on Manhattan Island, closer to its western shore. The original building faces West Street to the west, Battery Place to the south, and Washington Street and the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel portal to the east. It is adjacent to the Downtown Athletic Club building at 20 West Street to the north, which occupies the entire width of the block between West and Washington Streets. The annex on West Street and the 2 Washington Street addition each occupy half the width of the block between Washington and West Streets. The building stands on filled land along the shore of the North River (an archaic name for the southernmost portion of the Hudson River). The surrounding neighborhood, the Financial District, was the first part of Manhattan to be developed as part of New Netherland and later New York City; its population growth led city officials to add land on Manhattan's shore by filling and land reclamation in the 18th and 19th centuries. As the North River shoreline was deeper and had a denser concentration of buildings than the East River shoreline on the east side of Manhattan Island, the land under the Whitehall Building was not filled until 1835, when debris from the Great Fire of New York was dumped there. These filling operations also led to the expansion of Battery Park, directly to the south. The site of the Whitehall Building was first occupied by small landowners who built houses in the area. The surrounding neighborhood became a financial and shipping hub during the late 19th century, and as the Financial District became more densely developed, the residential landowners moved uptown and their former lands were replaced with larger commercial buildings.  Design   Original structure and annex  The original structure (also called the Lesser Whitehall or just the Whitehall Building) is a 20-story building on Battery Place. It was designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh, and according to Moses King, had 400 offices. The Whitehall Building's annex, also known as the Whitehall Extension or Greater Whitehall, is a 31-story skyscraper on West Street, north of the original Whitehall Building's western section. Designed by Clinton and Russell, it was the largest office building in New York City at the time of its completion. Both structures contain Renaissance Revival facades with colorful granite, brick, limestone, and architectural terracotta cladding, which in turn was inspired from the sites' highly visible location at the southern tip of Manhattan Island.  Form  Original building (right) and annex (left) viewed from the southwest The original building measures along Battery Place to the south. Due to the irregular shape of the lot, its western boundary along West Street is long and the eastern boundary on Washington Street is long. The annex occupies a lot measuring along West Street, with a depth ranging from . A two-bay-wide, two-story section facing West Street, as well as an elevator structure toward the center of the block between West and Washington Streets, connect the annex and original building. The elevator structure is the same height as the annex and consists of a convex section with cast-iron cladding, as well as a straight section with brick facade. The original structure and annex form an \\"L\\" shape and appear as two slabs, as viewed from Battery Park.  Facade  The facade of the original structure is designed into three horizontal layers: a base, tower, and crown. The original structure is composed of 12 vertical bays facing Battery Place; the center six bays are slightly recessed, and at ground level, contain three double-width, double-height entrance arches with ornate lintels. The base, which is composed of the basement, first floor, and mezzanine, have a facade of rusticated blocks of limestone. The second through fifth floors contain a facade of tan brick and stone, and a cornice above the fifth floor. The fourth-floor windows on Battery Place are elaborately ornamented, with cast- iron railings in the six center windows on Battery Place, and pediments above the remaining windows. On the sixth through sixteenth floors, the center six bays on Battery Place are faced with red brick and mortar, while the outer bays and the side facades have a facade of yellow brick with pink strips. The terracotta-faced eighteenth floor acts as a transitional story. Above the 20th story is a large cornice with brick piers that emulate the base's articulation, and above the Battery Place facade, a triangular brick pediment with an ornate depiction of an oculus. The West Street facade of the original building is five bays wide and contains similar materials and symbolic elements as on the Battery Place facade. The first floor and mezzanine are faced with rusticated limestone, the second through fifth floors contain a facade of tan brick, and the upper floors are faced with yellow brick. The center bay on West Street contains four steps, leading to a window that replaced a former entrance. The metal cornices atop the building on West and Washington Streets have been removed. The northern facade is faced with plain brick. The original building's Washington Street facade is four bays wide, but otherwise is the same as the West Street facade in design. The annex has its principal facade on West Street, which is eleven bays wide. The annex has a base of limestone that rises to the sixth story, and as with the original building, the basement, first floor and mezzanine consist of rusticated blocks of limestone. The seventh through 23rd floors each contain two rectangular window openings per bay, and have a brick facade; there are cornices at the top and bottom of the 23rd floor. On West Street, the 24th through 29th floor windows are slightly recessed behind an arched arcade that wraps around the rest of the annex, and contain decorated terracotta detailing; the 29th floor windows are rounded and semicircular. The 30th floor contains elaborate terracotta detailing, with two windows per bay, and a 31st floor contains penthouses recessed behind a balustrade. At the top of the tower that rises above the annex, there is a south-facing rounded pediment and a water tower. The northern elevation of the annex contains a three-bay-wide largely plain yellow-brick facade. The piers at each corner are rusticated. The outer bays contain a single window on each floor. The 24th through 29th floor windows are arranged as in an arcade, the 30th-story windows are round headed, and the 31st-story windows are square-headed. The eastern facade of the annex has similar ornamentation as on West Street.  Features  leftThe original building measures to its rooftop while the annex measures to its rooftop. Underlying the site, a layer of hardpan was present between below the ground, while rock was below the ground. The foundation of the original building was dug by 48 pneumatic caissons sunk to below the curb. Of these, 32 were cylindrical while the other 16 were rectangular. The original building's caissons support 53 steel columns in the original building's superstructure. Air shafts and air locks for the workers were inside the caissons. The basement of the annex, which contains the building's boiler room and electrical equipment, was dug by timber and steel caissons. The annex basement is enclosed in a concrete cofferdam with walls, made of caissons joined from end to end. While the basement floor is below sea level and consists of a concrete layer, the walls of the cofferdam descend below the floor of the basement. Other portions of the foundation included I-beam grillages and distributing girders. The annex superstructure contains 71 main columns, 53 of which sit atop forty-five granite foundation piers. The other 18 main columns are inside the boiler room walls and are carried down directly to the hardpan. As with the original building, the annex's caissons contained air shafts and air locks. The annex incorporates 30 elevators, of structural steel, of brick, and of cement. The superstructure of the annex contains a steel frame with floors made of inverted concrete arches; tile partitions; copper windows; and steel stairs with marble treads.  2 Washington Street  Exterior of 2 Washington Street 2 Washington Street (also known as 17 Battery Place North or the Western Union International Plaza), was built in 1972 and measures with 22 floors. The structure was designed by Morris Lapidus in the International Style, and unlike the other two sections, does not have official landmark protection. The facade is a simple glass curtain wall. On the eastern side of 2 Washington Street is a privately owned public space.  History   Development of original structure  The Real Estate Record and Guide reported in 1901 that a land plot measuring on the north side of Battery Place, on West Street, and on Washington Street, had been sold. The buyer was Century Realty Company, another company owned by Chesebrough, which intended to resell the land to Battery Place Realty Company. The Battery Place Realty Company, which would develop what would become the Whitehall Building, was led by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist known for discovering Vaseline, along with his son William A. Chesebrough. At the time, building sites near Broadway, two blocks east of the Whitehall Building, were considered to be optimal for development, especially after the 1907 completion of the U.S. Custom House at Broadway and Battery Place. The Whitehall Building's location across from Battery Park ensured a direct view of the New York Harbor, since the park faced the harbor on its other end. The Chesebroughs were responsible for developing other Lower Manhattan structures as well. The original building was constructed from 1902 as a speculative office building designed by Henry Hardenbergh. Because the streets surrounding the site of the building were not heavily trafficked at the time, construction offices were placed directly on the street. The old cellars of the previous structures on the site were excavated, and three 8-hour shifts of 100 men each were employed to drive the caissons. The initial structure opened in May 1903, and was completed in 1904. The structure was named for Peter Stuyvesant's 17th-century home, \\"White Hall\\", which had been located nearby. Rents per square foot at the Whitehall Building were generally lower than those on Broadway, and so many tenants started to move into the building.  Development of annex  The Battery Place Realty Company had expanded its land holdings by 1904, so that they owned 150 feet of the block frontage on West and Washington Streets. The company purchased the addresses 4‚Äì7 West Street and 6‚Äì7 Washington Street, thus controlling a lot of over though the firm publicly stated that it had \\"no intention of erecting any addition to the building\\". By 1906 all land acquisition had been completed. The Battery Place Realty Company started soliciting construction bids for an annex to the Whitehall Building in 1908. Clinton and Russell had been hired to plan the structure, which was initially set to be 36 stories. The following year, the United States Realty and Improvement Company bought the Battery Place Realty Company's stock and took over the construction process. By then, United States Realty had on West and Washington Street, but intended to build the annex as a 31-story structure on West Street, a smaller 16-story section on Washington Street, and the 36-story tower in the center, rising . At the time, the annex was to be the largest single office building in the city. The combined lot area for the two buildings was , which was larger than the lot area of the City Investing Building, the next-largest office building in New York City. Seventeen structures were demolished to make way for the annex. Work on the foundations of the annex commenced on December 1909. Twelve derricks were placed on the site to install the beams and caissons. Work for the annex was driven by two 12-hour shifts of 450 men each, while the foundations were dug by three 8-hour shifts of 100 sandhogs each. The foundations of the annex were dug by the O'Rourke Engineering Construction Company, which extracted of earth through open excavation and through caissons. The superstructure was erected under the supervision of general contractor George A. Fuller Company. The steel frame was then erected from May 1910 at a rate of four stories per week, with trucks delivering the steel beams from offsite, and gangs of workers completing the concrete floors as the steel structure was being completed. The annex was completed by late 1910, excluding the section facing Washington Street, which was not constructed during that time. The annex was cited as being \\"one of the largest commercial structures in the world\\" and the largest individual office structure in Manhattan, with of space.  Office use  1910s postcard By 1911, rents at the original Whitehall Building and its annex averaged , cheaper than comparable structures. The building complex was described in the Real Estate Record and Guide as \\"one of the best investments of its kind in the city\\". The Whitehall Club, a lunch club for Lower Manhattan merchants and businesspersons, was housed on the top four floors of the Whitehall Building's annex. This lunch club became the premier maritime club in New York City during that era and hosted famous shipping figures. One office tenant in the mid-20th century was the Moran Towing Company, operator of a fleet of tugboats. In the days before radio dispatching, a man high in the building would watch with a telescope for incoming ships, and then use a six-foot megaphone to shout instructions to the Moran tugboats docked at the Battery. Other long term tenants included the Gulf Refining Company, Tide Water Oil Company, United States Weather Bureau, Internal Revenue Service, and the Penn Coal and Coke Company. The consulate of Germany in New York City and the Communist Daily Worker newspaper also had offices at 17 Battery Place, which were damaged in a 1940 bombing perpetrated by opponents of Nazi Germany. The German consulate moved out the year after the bombing. The United States Realty and Improvement Company owned the building until 1932. Afterward, the Whitehall Improvement Corporation owned the building until 1950 when it was sold to the New York Life Insurance Company. By then, the building was known as the \\"Whitehall-Sheraton Building\\". On the Washington Street side of the block, east of the annex and north of the original building, the twenty-two- story 2 Washington Street was erected in 1971. The newest addition was originally called One Western Union International Plaza because Western Union employees worked there. It was also called 17 Battery Place North. In 1974, a fire at 2 Washington Street forced the evacuation of 5,000 office workers across the entire Whitehall complex; The New York Times reported that the computers of one tenant, securities firm Hayden, Stone & Co., continued to handle transactions automatically during the evacuation. By the 1970s, the Moran Towing Company had moved to the World Trade Center, while the McAllister Brothers, a rival firm, had occupied the Whitehall Building's 15th floor. Another tenant at the Whitehall Building complex was Tidewater Oil. The membership of the Whitehall Club atop the annex declined significantly from 1,000 in the 1960s to 600 in 1990, and the club had closed by the end of the 1990s.  Hotel and residential conversion  In 1997, the developer Allen I. Gross bought the original building, annex, and 2 Washington Street for $70 million and proposed converting the original structure and annex's upper stories into a hotel and condominiums, retaining commercial uses on lower floors. The first through 13th floors were to be purchased by SL Green Realty and operated as office space; the 14th through 23rd floors would be a Ritz- Carlton hotel, and the annex above the 24th floor would contain residences. At the time, 30% of the of usable space was not occupied. The hotel proposal failed in 1998, and SL Green ultimately paid $59 million for the second through 13th floors in the original building and annex, as well as the entirety of 2 Washington Street. In 1999 the Moinian Group paid $42 million for the basement, ground floor, and the 14th through topmost floors of the older two buildings. The group intended to convert the upper floors to a rental-apartment building with its main address at One West Street. The ground floor was to be used as a business center, while the residential structure would contain a parking lot, health club, and rooftop deck. The Whitehall Building and Annex were designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission on February 8, 2000. SL Green sold the original building and its annex later that year to an affiliate of the Moinian Group. SL Green received $53 million from the sale, most of which it intended to use to pay for another building, 1370 Broadway. The residential conversion was nearly completed in 2001, when developer Richard Bassuk arranged for Deutsche Bank to give Moinian a $208.5 million loan to finish the project. However, because of the September 11 attacks at the nearby World Trade Center, Bassuk estimated that occupancy at 17 Battery Place went from nearly 100% before the attacks to 10% afterward. SL Green sold 2 Washington Place to Moinian in 2003 for $70 million. By that year, 17 Battery Place was almost completely rented. To attract tenants after the September 11 attacks, Moinian used \\"clever tactics\\" such as furnished model apartments as well as large retailers at ground level. In 2005, the southernmost portion of West Street was reconstructed, including the portal over the Battery Park Underpass directly to the west. As part of the reconstruction project, a public plaza was erected outside the Whitehall Building, east of West Street. Nyack College moved into 2 Washington Street in 2013, and the following year, the New York Film Academy moved to the first floor of 17 Battery Place. By 2019, the Moinian Group intended to convert 2 Washington Street into a residential structure with 345 units.  Critical reception  When originally built, the Whitehall Building was described as having \\"resembled a big chimney\\" and that it was the single most prominent structure for vessels docking on the East or North (Hudson) rivers. Art critic Russell Sturgis said \\"Mr. Hardenbergh has shown, in his Whitehall Building, that simplicity is not incompatible with dignity, and that this dignity may have a decided quality of beauty\\", but that this form was not emulated by other buildings' designs. One New York Times article later described the Whitehall Building as being \\"an elegant orange-colored building with ornate gargoyles\\" next to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel's ventilation building, an \\"overgrown tombstone\\". Architectural historians Sarah Landau and Carl W. Condit wrote that the original Whitehall Building and its annex complemented each other, even though the Whitehall Building's annex \\"is irregularly shaped and somewhat overwhelming in impact\\" compared to the older building. The annex was so much larger than the original Whitehall Building that the original structure was described as \\"suited as offices for little people only\\".

Early life and work Ruchama Marton was born in Jerusalem, to Bilha and Aaron Smuelevitch who arrived from Poland in 1929. In Jerusalem she attended the Lemel School, a non-religious school for girls. Her family then moved to Tel Aviv, where she attended high school. During her military service, she was a soldier in the Givati Brigade and served during the Sinai War in 1956. She saw members of her regiment killed in the Air Force bombing of the IDF, and witnessed the murder of Egyptian prisoners of war who had surrendered and were unarmed by soldiers from the battalion in which she servedProfiles of Four Women Health and Human Rights Activists, Laura Reiner and Richard Sollom, Journal of the American Medical Women's Association Volume 52 Number 4, Fall 1997 In the battlefields of Sinai the first seeds of her anti-militarist (but non-pacifist) attitude and her lifelong commitment to fighting for human rights began. At a time when criticism of the army was practically unheard of, she openly protested the execution of the Egyptian prisoners. After her military service, Marton studied medicine at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and completed medical school in 1963. During this time, she gave birth to her daughter, Orna, and her son, Yuval. While a student in medical school, Marton became active in struggles for women's rights. Together with Professor Dreyfus, she organized activities to change the medical school's policy that only 10% of students could be women. Marton struggled with this policy for many years and was eventually successful. She also organized a fight against an existing ban that forbade female students from wearing pants. This battle almost cost her her place at the medical school, which was at the time the only medical school in Israel, though the university eventually removed the ban. From 1974 to 1986 she worked as a senior psychiatrist at the Mental Health Center \\"Shalvata\\" in Hod Hasharon. While there, she tried along with Professor Davidson, director of the hospital, to promote community attitude and access, which was then not accepted in the field of psychiatry. Their idea was to create mental health clinics outside of psychiatric hospitals or centers where patients could go for care. In her work at the hospital she initiated professional survey of private psychiatric hospitals in the Sharon area on a team that included a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a social worker. The goals of the study were to determine whether hospitalization is justified, whether the medication patients received was appropriate, and whether patients could be released if there was improvement in their mental state. This survey was the first of its kind in Israel. From 1975 until 1990, she taught a post graduate program in psychiatry at the Institute of Psychotherapy at Tel Aviv University. At the School of Medicine she made extensive efforts, together with Professor Micha Neumann, director of the university clinic in the Shlvata hospital, to change the criteria for acceptance to medical school, so that a student's grades from humanities courses would bear equal weight to grades in math and the sciences. She believed that the change would improve the quality of the relationship between doctors and patients. In addition, for two years she directed a dynamic group of medical students in processing their experiences with patients in hospitals. After the success of these groups, group dynamics became an accepted part of training. Along with her public activities, Marton pursued academic work in human rights and was a research fellow at the Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College of Harvard University from 1997 to 1998, as well as a Research Fellow for Peace and Human Rights at the Research Center for the Middle East at Harvard in 1998 and 1999, and human rights fellow and visiting scholar at the University of Chicago from 1999 to 2000. Public activities Ruchama Marton has participated since 1962 in many organizations working in the field of human rights, promoting the right to health, the rights of women and the struggle for peace. From 1976 to 1990, she was a member of the Israeli-Palestinian Council for Peace, and was extensively involved promoting dialogue through seminars and meetings with representatives of the PLO. She was a volunteer in the Tel Aviv center for female victims of sexual assault and in another grassroots group called ELA, or Citizens for the Rights of the Hatiquva neighborhood. In 1980‚Äì1981 she co-founded \\"Liberated Territories\\" - a group which published a weekly article in the Haaretz newspaper showing a radical view of the problems of Israeli society. In 1982 to 1984 she was a co-founder of the \\"Committee Against the War in Lebanon\\", which started opposition to the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1983 to 1984 she was a co-founder of \\"Alternative\\", a bi-national, extra-parliamentary organization that strove to promote peace through a two-state solution. In 1984 to 1987 she was a co-founder and a member of \\"Forum, Teachers from Tel Aviv University\\", an organization for peace and human rights. In 1988 she founded the Association of Israeli-Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights, later known as Physicians for Human Rights-Israel,About PHR-Israel a human rights organization working against the occupation of the Palestinian territories and defending the right to health. She served as the organization Chairwoman for its first ten years. In 1989-1991 she was a co-founder of \\"Palestinians and Israelis Together for Peace,\\" where she organized seminars and discussion groups to help advance the peace process. In 1989 she co-founded \\"The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel\\", which still exists today, and was designed to create a lobby to stop torture in Israel. She was one of the founders of the committee against the closure of Bir Zeit University and in 1989 she co-founded \\"Verification\\", an organization of mental health workers for peace. In 1993 she co-founded \\"One in Nine: Women for Women with Breast Cancer\\"- a lobby and support group for women suffering from breast cancer. In 2005 she co-founded the \\"Committee for Political Prisoners.\\" In 2006 she co- founded the \\"ICRR,\\" the Committee for the Rights of Residency. She was also member of the \\"International Committee for Palestinian NGOs.\\" Ruchama Marton was among the founders of the Progressive List for Peace, a bi-national party to the Knesset in 1984, which elected two representatives to the Knesset. Physicians for Human Rights Physicians for Human Rights ‚Äì Israel Open Clinic in Jaffa, 2010 In 1988 Marton founded the Association of Israeli- Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights, which later changed its name to Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR-IL). She put together a group of Israeli and Palestinian doctors, working together in full equality and solidarity. The organization works towards a common goal of fighting against the occupation and promoting human rights and health. Physicians for Human Rights sees the occupation as a \\"sickness,\\" creating injustice and human rights violations. The organization works to maintain and defend human rights, with a focus on the right to health. Ruchama Marton bequeathed to the association a broader understanding of the concept of health - not just as medicine, but in the spirit of the World Health Organization - as \\"physical, psychological and social well-being\\" including access to water, sanitation, education, electricity, sewage, work, and free mobility. PHR was the first Israeli NGO run by a woman, as well as the first that introduced the concept of human rights to the Israeli public, and through its activity along the years contributed much the public discourse about human rights. PHR-IL has worked to protect human rights in general, as well as the right to equitable healthcare and to bodily integrity, dignity and mental health. In her public work, Marton has co-worked with Palestinian and international organizations dealing with mental health and human rights. She is on the board of the Mental Health Center in Gaza. PHR's partnership with organizations in Europe and the United States led to the \\"Network of International Organizations for Health and Human Rights\\" in 1992, of which Marton is a board member. She has been invited many times for meetings with the United Nations (in Geneva, Vienna, Strasbourg, New York City and more) to discuss and analyze the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.

Although Gravati uses a variety of shoe construction methods, including Bologna and Goodyear construction, the majority of their production uses Blake construction. The shoes are hand-crafted entirely within the factory by skilled artisans and technicians. Every pattern of every Gravati shoe is hand- cut. Unlike most modern shoe manufacturers, Gravati does not maintain stock‚Äîretailers must specify the patterns, lasts, leathers, soles, and construction methods that they want; and only then will the factory make the shoes. Their production methods are typical of many upper-echelon shoemakers in that the uppers are cut (or clicked) and lasted and the shoes finished by hand, but that all sewing is done by machine. Gravati's American retailers include Stanley Korshak, Davide Cenci and Wilkes Bashford.

It comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, unimproved meadows and flushes. Location The copse is situated to the north-west of Chandler's Ford between Flexford Road and Hook Road and adjoins the Eastleigh to Romsey railway line. Description The citation for the SSSI says: > Trodds Copse Site of Special Scientific Interest comprises ancient semi- > natural woodland, unimproved meadows and flushes overlying Bracklesham Beds, > Bagshot Sand, peat and alluvium. The habitats are drained by tributaries of > the Monks Brook, a branch of the River Itchen. The diverse geology and > varied drainage conditions give rise to a wide range of habitats. At least > ten woodland types can be identified, of which four are considered > nationally rare. The diversity of woodland types is matched by an extremely > rich ground flora. The antiquity of the woodlands is reflected in the very > high number of ancient woodland indicator species recorded within the site. > Over fifty such species occur, including a number of rare or local plants > such as tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) making it one of the botanically > richest woods in Hampshire. History Trodds Copse and surrounding land has been well documented since the late 16th century. The whole site was enclosed from common land prior to 1588 and woodland boundary banks can be clearly discerned. Some areas were managed as wood pasture but by the early 19th century this practice had ceased, the land being converted to pasture or coppice woodland. The site is threatened by the north-westerly expansion of Chandler's Ford. In 1990, a planning application to build 200 houses and a golf course at neighbouring Broadgate Farm, Ampfield was refused as it \\"would result in the destruction of part of the Trodds Copse Countryside Heritage Site\\".

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta (MLA) from 1967 to 1989. During his time in office he served in numerous party caucuses and as an Independent. Political career Buck ran for a seat to the Legislative Assembly in the 1967 Alberta general election. He won the electoral district of Clover Bar by a wide margin to hold it for the governing Social Credit Party of Alberta. While still a rookie MLA, Buck ran for the leadership of the Social Credit party in the 1968 leadership election following the retirement of longtime premier Ernest Manning. Buck survived the first round of balloting but distantly trailed Harry Strom and two other candidates to end in fourth place with 10.8% of the delegates. On the second ballot his votes dropped and he ended up with just 8.8% of the convention delegates while Harry Strom had a clear majority. Buck was not invited into Strom's cabinet after he became leader of the party and Premier of the province and thus remained in the back benches. Buck ran for a second term in office in the 1971 general election. He won a tight three-way race just edging out Progressive Conservative candidate J. Devereux in an election that ended the Socreds' 36-year run in government. He would reclaim a large majority with his biggest win in terms of popular vote to date when he was elected to his third term in the 1975 general election. Buck won his fourth term with a massive landslide and the largest plurality of his career in the 1979 general election. This was his last win under the Social Credit party banner. After a disastrous attempt to dissolve the Social Credit Party at a convention held in 1982, parliamentary leader Raymond Speaker and Buck resigned from the party to run as independents in the 1982 provincial election. Buck held his seat in a tight race with Stan Berg of the Progressive Conservatives and two other candidates. Buck and Speaker attempted to form the official opposition as an Independent caucus as had been done after the 1940 general election, over the Alberta New Democratic Party (NDP) which also had two members. The speaker denied them opposition status and the same caucus funding that had been provided to the NDP and limited the amount of questions that could be asked. The pair decided for form a new political party in 1984, the Representative Party of Alberta. It branded itself as a modern version of Social Credit, and opened its doors to former Socreds who had left the party. Buck ran for re-election in the 1986 general election under that banner winning a sizable majority in his riding. Buck retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the assembly in 1989. Buck died of stomach cancer in 2013 at Fort Saskatchewan. He was 82.

The film is also known as Great Mike Wins (American TV title). Plot summary Young Jimmy Dolan, who sounds like he's about to burst into tears any minute throughout the film, loves his friends Mike the horse and Corky the dog. While delivering newspapers on his route one day, Mike meets newcomer Colonel Whitley, a famous Kentucky horse breeder who has just leased a horse training farm in the area. Jimmy, a horse racing buff, eagerly introduces himself to the colonel and his horse trainer, James Spencer, and asks if he can watch the colonel's horses work out. The next morning, Spencer gives Jimmy and his friend Speck a tour of the stables. When Jimmy boasts that Mike could beat the colonel's thoroughbreds, the colonel gruffly insults Mike's ability, causing Jimmy to challenge him to a race. After Mike nearly beats his reigning champion, the colonel, humbled, apologizes and invites Jimmy to breakfast. At the dining table, Jimmy relates the story of how his uncle Joe bought Mike from a famous horse breeder after the man's daughter, Mike's owner, unexpectedly died. Jimmy is saving money from his paper route to pay his uncle for the horse. As Jimmy breakfasts with the colonel, a letter arrives at the Dolan house from his uncle, informing the boy that he plans to sell Mike to a racing stable for $700. When Jimmy, who has only saved $200, learns of his uncle's intentions, his sympathetic sister Erin suggests he make the horse unappealing to his prospective buyers. The next morning, when the representatives from the stable arrive to inspect Mike, Jimmy coats the horse with mud and instructs him to act lame. The stablemen see through the ruse, however, and while the boy is at school they return to claim the horse. At his new home, Mike refuses to eat or train, and when the stablemen inform his new owner, movie star Kitty Tremaine, that the horse is lonesome for Corky, she decides to visit the Dolan house and buy the dog. When Kitty learns how heartbroken Jimmy is over Mike's loss, she agrees to sell back the horse, and to finance the deal, Jimmy offers Spencer half ownership in Mike. After Spencer and Jimmy become partners, Spencer warns Jimmy to avoid Erin's beau, William \\"Sandy\\" McKay, a jockey who was disbarred for allegedly throwing a race. When Jimmy questions Sandy about the allegations, Sandy replies that he was innocent but never defended himself against his accusers. Satisfied with Sandy's explanation, Jimmy asks him to ride Mike in the horse's first race at Santa Anita. Meanwhile, a syndicate of gamblers pools its resources to bet on Speed Demon, who they deem to be a sure winner in the race. When Mike wins the race, he upsets the syndicate's plans and makes headlines as \\"The Great Mike.\\" Spencer and Jimmy then decide to enter Mike in a handicap race, and when the syndicate learns of their plans, it hires Doc Slagle and his brother Bill to put the horse out of commission. One night, the pair sneak into Mike's stable, armed with a hypodermic needle filled with poison. Corky springs to Mike's defense, and when Jimmy hears the dog's growls coming from the barn, he calls Spencer for help. By the time Spencer arrives, however, the Slagles have killed Corky and fled, leaving behind the unused hypodermic needle bearing their fingerprints. Grieving over Corky's loss, Mike again refuses to train or eat, forcing his withdrawal from the race. One day, after the Slagles have been arrested for their crime, Junior, Jimmy's friend, appears at the stable with news that his family is to be transferred out of state. Junior offers to sell Jimmy Corky's brother Mickey, and when Mickey and Mike begin to cavort, Jimmy realizes that Mike is ready to race again. Spencer and Jimmy enter Mike in a race against the colonel's champion horse, and when Mike wins the race, he earns the colonel's admiration and a generous purse, which Jimmy uses to finance a newsboys' clubhouse. Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer make a rare post Little Rascals appearance as Jimmy's dim-witted friend, Speck. And that's about what he is. Switzer's dialogue consists of little more than saying \\"Gee willikers\\" or words to that effect over and over and over again and grinning like he's still 8 years old.

Edition from 1902 Rabbi Meshulam Zusha of Hanipol or Meshulum Zusil of Anipoli (1718‚Äì1800), Reb Zusha, Reb Zushe, The Rebbe Reb Zusha (sometimes spelled Zusil, Zoussia, Zu≈°ya, Zushya, Zushia, Zisha of Anipoli) was an Orthodox rabbi and an early Hasidic luminary and well-known tzaddik. He was one of the great Hassidic Rebbes of the third generation and member of the academy circle of the Maggid of Mezeritch. Biography Rabbi Zusha was the brother of Rebbe Elimelech of Lizhensk; Rabbi Elimelech was the elder by about 1 year. Both of them were born in the city of Tykocin (Podlaskie), to Reb Eliezer Lipa(e),Encyclopedia of Hasidim,Tzvi Rabinowicz who was the son of the great Torah scholar Rabbi Elimelech (whom Rebbe Elimelech was named after). Rabbi Meshulam Zusha was named after his mother's father, also a great Torah scholar. Both Rabbi Zusha of Hanipol and Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk became prominent disciples of the holy Maggid of Mezeritch, part of his inner circle of students, known as the Chevraya Kadisha (\\"Holy Brotherhood\\"), together with other great tzaddikim such as Rabbi Nachum of Czernobyl, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Rabbi Aharon (HaGadol) of Karlin, Rabbi Shmuel (Shmelke) of Nikolsburg, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. Rabbi Zusha was known for his deep emotional approach towards prayer and his great piety. He was one of the two rabbis, together with Reb Leib HaKohen, with whom Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi consulted with before printing the Tanya in 1797. Both gave their approval. Rabbi Zusha did not write any books, but his teachings were collected in the Menorat Zahav, based on the memories of his students. His Yahrtzeit is on 2 Shevat. He was buried beside his master and teacher, the Maggid of Mezeritch, in Hannopil. He was succeeded by his son Rabbi Tzvi Menachem Mendel.  Stories about Rabbi Zusha of Hanipol  Before Rabbi Zusha and his brother Rabbi Elimelech were born, their parents were childless for 10 years. Both their parents descended from Torah scholars, but because they became orphans at a very early age, both remained unlearned, simple but God-fearing Jews. The father was a water-carrier. Although he could have become a merchant, he preferred to live by the toil of his own hands. At first he had some rich customers, but then he exchanged them with another water-carrier in order to be able to supply the local synagogues with water. This meant a financial loss for him and he became poor. But as a reward for his good deed God blessed Reb Eliezer Lippa and his wife, who always readily supported her husband, with two sons, later to become great Tzaddikim. At first the children were physically weak, and although Reb Eliezer Lippa and his wife hired the best Torah teachers to teach them, they weren't making much progress. That grieved the parents, so they increased their prayers to God, often fasted and gave their meals to poor people as Tzedakah. God answered their sincere prayers and when the boys expressed their desire to go to a Yeshiva to continue their studies, they readily agreed. After their parents sent their sons to a yeshiva in another city, they took two poor Torah-students from Tarnow in their house in order to take care of them and support their studies. Reb Eliezer continued to earn his living as a water-carrier. One Friday he found a fish by the river and brought it home and as his wife was preparing the fish to be eaten on Shabbat, she found a precious stone in its stomach. She and her husband, knowing about a similar story which occurred centuries earlier with a Jew in France named Yitzhak, later to become the father of Rashi, they were upset that this could be a test from Heaven and decided not to change their live- style, to sell the stone (after consulting the local Rabbi in order to be sure that they are permitted according to Halakha to keep the stone) and to distribute the money for Tzedakah, thus remaining poor. Soon good news came - their older son, Rabbi Elimelech had married the daughter of a wealthy man, who was ready to support his Torah study and both Rabbi Elimelech and Rabbi Zusha were making great progress and had become scholars. Strange enough afterwards Reb Eliezer Lippa found another treasure by the river, but once again he and his wife decided to give the gold coins he found as a Tzedakah. Some time later a wealthy relative of Reb Eliezer died and Reb Eliezer and his wife inherited his estate thus becoming wealthy themselves. By this time their sons had become both prominent Tzaddikim and great scholars. Reb Eliezer Lippa and his wife lived many long and happy years continuing to support poor Jews and Torah scholars until the end of their days.Rebbe Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn as quoted by Rabbi Sholom B. Wineberg in \\"Reb Elimelech and Reb Zushya\\", available as an mp3 on: Various stories are being told about the long journeys of the two brothers Rabbi Zusha and Rabbi Elimelech. Rabbi Noach of Kobryn once heard that Chassidus managed to spread only in those areas through which they both traveled. \\"Where Rabbi Zusha and Rabbi Elimelech haven't been, there are no Chassidim.\\"BUBER, MARTIN: \\"Die Erz√§hlungen der Chassidim\\", Manesse Z√ºrich 1949, P.380 A man once visited the holy Maggid of Mezeritch and said he had great difficulties applying the Talmudic saying that \\"A person is supposed to bless God for the bad just as he blesses Him for the good\\". The Maggid told him to find the Maggid's disciple Reb Zusha of Hanipoli and ask him. The man went and found Rabbi Zusha, who received him friendly and invited him to his home. When the guest came in, he saw how poor the family was, there was almost nothing to eat, they were beset with afflictions and illnesses. Nevertheless, Rabbi Zusha was always happy and cheerful. The guest was astonished at this picture. He said: \\"I went to the Holy Maggid to ask him how is it possible to bless God for the bad He send us the same way as we bless Him for the good, and The Maggid told me only you can help me in this matter.\\" Rabbi Zusha said: \\"This is indeed a very interesting question. But why did our holy Rebbe send you to me? How would I know? He should have sent you to someone who has experienced suffering.\\" ChaBaD.org: \\"Perspective\\" on Rabbi Zusha once said: \\"I learned seven things from the thief: 1) What he does, he keeps to himself. 2) He is willing to take risks to attain his goal. 3) He does not distinguish between \\"major\\" and \\"minor\\" things, but takes equally exacting care of each and every detail. 4) He invests great effort in what he does. 5) He is swift. 6) He is always optimistic. 7) If at first he fails, he is back time and again for another try.\\" ChaBaD.org: Daily Quote It is told that when Zusha was a young orphan, he used to study the Torah with Rashi's commentary, and when he came across a Rashi that he didn't understand, he used to cry a long time, until Rashi himself came to him and explained it to him. Once Rabbi Zusha was in a class taught by the Maggid of Mezeritch. The Maggid began the class with a commonplace verse from the Torah: \\"And God spoke to Moses...\\" Just these few words were enough to excite and astonish Rabbi Zusha. He exclaimed \\"God spoke... GOD spoke... God SPOKE!\\" over and over until he had to be removed from the classroom due to the disruption he was causing.Tales of the Hasidim, Martin Buber, \\"Early Masters\\" pp. 236-237, under R. Zusya. See also Botzina Kadisha (A. Meshulam Zissel Lipman), Torah 16, page 8. When Rabbi Zusha was on his deathbed, his students found him in uncontrollable tears. They tried to comfort him by telling him that he was almost as wise as Moses and as kind as Abraham, so he was sure to be judged positively in Heaven. He replied, \\"When I get to Heaven, I will not be asked Why weren't you like Moses, or Why weren't you like Abraham. They will ask, Why weren't you like Zusha?\\" Why didn't he fully live up to his own potential?

The urban legend has been circulating via the internet since the mid-1990s. Many print newspapers have been fooled into publishing the story as fact. Story The story goes that a freak accident occurred at a circus during an act involving a dwarf bouncing on a trampoline. The dwarf jumped sideways off the trampoline just at the moment a hippopotamus began to yawn. The dwarf landed in the hippo's yawning mouth and was abruptly, and accidentally, swallowed whole. The audience applauded until they realised this was not part of the show and the true horror set in. Euan Ferguson writing in The Observer in 2003 said the story is a marvelous metaphor for the reality that \\"Life is not safe. You can't plan for disaster. The hippo can get you at any time.\\" History According to Snopes, the hoax news story began circulating on the internet with a Usenet post in 1994. The story was allegedly taken from the National Lampoon magazine which in turn, again according to Snopes, attributed it to the Las Vegas Sun. However, according to Alex Boese, the story cannot be found in back issues of either the Sun or National Lampoon.Alex Boese, Hippo Eats Dwarf!, p. 1, Pan Macmillan, 2010 . The original story was set in an Austrian circus, the hippo was named Hilda, and the dwarf was named Franz Dasch. In 1999, a new version of the story appeared in the Pattaya Mail in Thailand. The setting had changed to northern Thailand and the hippo was called Od. The Pattaya Mail story was republished by several Australian papers including the Daily Telegraph, the Advertiser, and the Sunday Mail The story reached the UK in the Manchester Evening News. In comedy Karl Pilkington, of The Ricky Gervais Show, once told the story in a segment called \\"Educating Ricky\\" in 2002 in which Karl believed the story to be true. This led to both Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant laughing hysterically.

The cosmos is then recreated (palingenesis) only to be destroyed again at the end of the new cycle. This form of catastrophe is the opposite of (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫ŒªœÖœÉŒºœåœÇ, \\"inundation\\"), the destruction of the earth by water.Thomas G. Rosenmeyer, Senecan Drama and Stoic Cosmology, University of California Press, 1989, p. 149. The destruction of the universe was in the form of fire. The time frame of destruction was never defined or given by any of the Stoics. The fire destruction was to cleanse the universe. The cleansing of the universe was to help create a pure universe. The flames would destroy everything in the universe. Then, everything would be rebuilt in the exact same way in every detail before the fire. After so long, the process by fire would happen again and again. This cleansing of the universe is infinite.  Causes of Ekpyrosis  There are three reasons why this belief was taught by the Greeks. The reasons come from the theories of Zeno and Cleanthes. The first cause is that the god of the universe keeps increasing in size making himself have to absorb himself when he gets too big. The second is that the sun and stars burn so hot and bright that they dry out the universe. With everything so dry, it causes the universe to catch fire burning everything up. Zeno states that the fire that destroys the universe will not destroy the very thing that gives itself life, which is the seas. Zeno's thought was to fix the issue caused by the theory of elemental anathymiasis. So the fire would not destroy the sea. The third is that when the planets all return to their position from when the universe was first created, it would also start the process of Ekpyrosis.  Ekpyrosis Among Stoics  The concept of Ekpyrosis is attributed to Chrysippus by Plutarch.Plutarch, De Stoicorum repugnantiis 1053bM. Lapidge, \\"Stoic Cosmology,\\" in The Stoics, ed. J. Rist (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978): p. 183-184 Ekpyrosis itself however, was not a universally accepted theory by all Stoics. Other prominent stoics such as Panaetius, Zeno of Tarsus, Boethus of Sidon, and others either rejected Ekpyrosis or had differing opinions regarding its degree. Once such idea is that Ekpyrosis by some was generally viewed as a positive event that would result in a \\"purification\\" of the soul and a renewal of all that was destroyed. While another such as the Roman Poet Lucan, depicted Ekpyrosis as just an end with no new beginning, that Ekpyrosis brought about only destruction upon the world. The extent to which Stoics discussed and disagreed regarding Ekyrosis is largely attributed to works of Hippolytus of Rome, found in the Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta.  Abandonment of Ekpyrosis  Ekpyrosis itself was, for the most part a short lived cosmological theory. With both Zeno of Tarus, and Cleanthes theorizing on Ekpyrosis in the third century B.C., and then Chrysippus expanding upon this soon after in the second century B.C., Ekpyrosis would begin to be abandoned all together by early Roman Stoics as early as the first and second century B.C.. A strong acceptance of Aristotle's theories of the universe combined with a more practical lifestyle practiced by the Roman people, caused these later Stoics to focus their main effort on their own social well being on earth, and not concentrate on the cosmos. A prime example of this is the prominent Stoic and Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. In his personal writing Meditations, Marcus Aurelius chooses to discuss how one should act and live their life, rather than speculate on cosmological theories.

In 1892, Ostergaard returned to the United States. He was ordained a Lutheran pastor in 1893. He served the ministry of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church. He ministered to a number of congregations before retiring in 1916 at Tyler, Minnesota.Kristian Ostergaard 1855-1931 (Cyber Hymnal) Ostergaard devoted the remainder of his life to writing songs, poetry and fiction. His writings were all in the Danish language. He wrote a number of novels depicting the life among Danish-American immigrants. His novels provided accounts of the immigrants struggling to create communities on the prairies. Four of Ostegaard's novels are set in Nebraska. Several trace members of a family from their arrival in the early 1870s to their participation in the settling in their new home. Ostergaard's novels also reflected a debate in Danish society involving the influences of N. F. S. Grundtvig and George Brandes. Ostergarrd additionally alluded to the Danish intellectual Soren Kierkegaard.Kristian Ostergaard's A Merchant's House (John Mark Nielsen, University of Nebraska-Lincoln) Ostergaard also wrote many songs and hymns. He published two songbooks: B√∏rnesangbogen (1898) and Den dansk-amerikanske H√∏jskolesangbog (1901). An anthology was published in 1912 as Songs of the Prairie. Most notably, Ostergaard wrote the hymn Den Sag er aldrig i Verden tabt.

He became a member of the Servants of India Society founded by Gopal Krishna Gokhale in 1905. In 1922, he founded the Bhil Seva Mandal. Later, he became the general secretary of the Harijan Sevak Sangh founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 . The Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sangh was founded on 24 October 1948 on his initiative. When Indian constitution was in process, Kenvi visited remotest and most difficult parts of India and conducted probe into the situation of tribal and Harijan people. He added valuable inputs in the process of constitution. Mahatma Gandhi would call him 'Bapa'. Thakkarbapa visited forests in Assam, rural Bengal, drought affected areas of Orissa, Bhil belts in Gujarat and Harijan areas of Saurashtra, Mahar areas of Maharashtra, untouchables in Madras, hilly areas of Chhota Nagpur, desert of Tharparkar, foothills of Himalaya, coastal areas of Travancore with his mission of upliftment of tribal and harijans. He would always travel in third class of railway. Thakkarbapa spent 35 years of his life in service of tribal and harijans.  Early life  Thakkar Bappa was born on 29 November 1869 in a middle-class family of Bhavnagar in Saurashtra region of Gujarat State India. His father Vithal Das Thakkar named the child Amrit Lal. He received his first schooling for benevolence and service to humanity from his father. He got his L.C.E. (Licenciate in Civil Engineering) from Poona in 1890. He worked as an engineer creditably in Porbander and later went out of India to serve in laying the First Railway Track in Uganda (East Africa). He served also as chief engineer in Sangli State for some time and then was employed in Bombay municipality as an engineer. It was here he saw, for the first time, the miserable conditions of those scavengers who had to dispose of the refuse of the whole town of Bombay. He was shocked to see the filthy colonies where the Sweepers had to live and made a firm resolve to devote the rest of his life to alleviate the lot of these people. He later served in Uganda (Country) railways in East Africa. In 1914, he resigned and took up social work. He became a member of Servants of India Society and advocated the rights of untouchables and tribals.  Honors  The Government of India issued a stamp in his honour in 1969. A well known locality, Bappa Colony in Mumbai is named after him. The Madhya Pradesh state government has instituted an award named in his honour for dedicated services to poor, victimised and totally backward tribal community. Maharashtra government has set the scheme to improve aadivasi villages and colonies named Thakkar Bappa aadivasi vasti sudharana in the year 2007  Popular culture  In Tamil Nadu, Thakkar was popularly known as \\"Appa Thakkar\\", the Tamil version of \\"Thakkar Bapa\\". Due to the fact that he was very knowledgeable, often instantly answering questions thrown at him, the Madras Bashai term \\"appatakkar\\", meaning a know-all, developed. This term gained popularity through its usage in the 2010 Tamil film Boss Engira Bhaskaran.  References   Further reading  * Hari, Viyogi.

The field particularly incorporates ideas and perspectives from related domains like anthropology, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to study sociocultural influences on human behaviors. Such impacts on behavior are often measured using various neuroimaging methods, through which cross-cultural variability in neural activity can be examined. Cultural neuroscientists study cultural variation in mental, neural and genomic processes as a means of articulating the bidirectional relationship of these processes and their emergent properties using a variety of methods. Researchers in cultural neuroscienceChiao, J. Y. (Ed.) (2009). Cultural neuroscience: Cultural influences on brain function. Progress in Brain Research, Elsevier Press. are motivated by two fundamentally intriguing, yet still unanswered, questions on the origins of human nature and human diversity: how do cultural traits (e.g., values, beliefs, practices) shape neurobiology (e.g., genetic and neural processes) and behavior, and how do neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., genetic and neural processes) facilitate the emergence and transmission of cultural traits? The idea that complex behavior results from the dynamic interaction of genes and cultural environment is not new;Mareschal.

Oxford University Press, New York, New York. and neuroanthropology, cultural neuroscience aims to explain a given mental phenomenon in terms of a synergistic product of mental, neural and genetic events. In particular, cultural neuroscience shares common research goals with social neuroscientists examining how neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., mirror neurons), facilitate cultural transmission, (e.g., imitative learning) and neuroanthropologists examining how embedded culture, as captured by cross-species comparison and ethnography, is related to brain function. Cultural neuroscience also shares intellectual goals with critical neuroscience, a field of inquiry that scrutinizes the social, cultural, economic and political contexts and assumptions that underlie behavioral and brain science research as it is practiced today. Research in cultural neuroscience has practical relevance to transcultural psychiatry, business and technology as well as broader implications for global public policy issues such as population health disparities, bioethics, globalization, immigration, interethnic ideology and international relations.  Previous cross-cultural research  While the field of cultural neuroscience may still be growing, there are studies conducted by various researchers that have looked at cross-cultural similarities and differences in human attention, visual perception, and the understanding of others and the self. Previous behavioral research has focused on the cultural differences in perception, particularly between people from East Asian and Western regions. The results from these studies have suggested that East Asians focus their visual perception more on the backgrounds and contexts of their environment, while Westerners focus on individual stimuli/objects. To further explore these findings, more research was done to specifically look at the neurological similarities and differences in attention and visual perception of people in East Asian and Western cultures. Results from a 2008 study by Hedden et al. support the previous findings by showing how East Asians require more attention than Americans for individually processing objects. Brain regions more focused on attention, such as areas in the parietal and prefrontal lobes as well as the inferior parietal lobule and precentral gyrus, were found to be highly active in East Asian subjects compared to American subjects, during individual object processing. A visual perception study conducted by Gutchess et al. in 2006, also found neurological differences between Chinese and American subjects as they completed tasks of encoding images of individual objects, backgrounds, and objects with backgrounds. The fMRI results from the study presented that during visual processing of objects, there was greater neural activity in the middle temporal gyri, right superior temporal gyri, and superior parietal lobules of the American subjects than that of the Chinese subjects. Such results indicate a focus on object processing among Westerners compared to East Asians. Insignificant differences in neural activity between subjects were found during the visual processing of images with backgrounds. People from East Asian and Western cultures were also studied to learn more about cross-cultural differences in understanding both the self and other people. Findings from a 1991 study by Markus and Kitayama presented that people from Eastern cultures view the self in relation to others in their community, while people from Western cultures have a more independent perspective of the self. A 2007 fMRI study observed differences in activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain region highly active during self perception, when Western and Chinese subjects were thinking about themselves versus when they were thinking about their mothers. The results interestingly showed that there was still activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortices of Chinese subjects even when they thought about their mothers, while activity was only detected in American subjects when they thought about themselves. A different study conducted by psychologist Joan Chiao found that due to cultural differences, East Asians are more likely to suffer from depression than Americans. She found that East Asians are more likely to carry the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (STG) which leads to depression while Americans carry the long allele which doesn't lead to depression. Yet due to difference in cultural structure they found that collectivist societies are more likely to find happiness than individual societies. Another study done by psychologists Nalini Ambady and Jonathan Freeman showed a difference in brain activity between Japanese and Americans when shown different body posture. They found that the reward circuitry in the limbic system would light up when Japanese participants saw submissive body posture while the reward circuitry would activate when Americans saw dominant body posture.  Culture differences in visual stimuli  Cultural differences exist in the ventral visual cortex and many studies have shown this. In a study conducted in 2005 they found that East Asians were more likely to keep their eyes focused on background scenes than westerners who would instead focus more on the central object such as a giraffe in a savanna. In a similar 2006 study it showed that in congruence to the difference in society structure westerners showed more activation in object processing regions, including the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus, although no activation differences were observed in context-processing regions such as the hippocampus. However, there has been some research contradicting cultural bias in the oculomotor control such as one conducted in 2007 by Rayner, Li, Williams, Cave, and well who failed to find evidence that East Asians focus more on context although they did find evidence that they are more likely to focus less on central objects. In a different study they focused more on difference in attention towards faces. They proved that Americans focus more broadly on the entire face such as both the eyes and mouth while Asians focus more on a single part, such as the mouth. The authors point out that this happens due to gaze avoidance in east Asian culture as a way of politeness. In 2008, another study focusing on context showed that East Asians were more likely to include greater details and background when taking photographs of a model when they were free to set the zoom function of the camera as they saw fit. In 2003, a group of researchers used the Frame-Line Test and asked the participants to draw a line of either exactly the same length as the one showed or one that was proportional in size. Americans were more accurate in the absolute task, suggesting better memory for the exact or absolute size of the focal object, but East Asians were more accurate in the relative (proportional) task, suggesting better memory for contextual relationships. In a later study conducted by the same group they found a pattern within the cultures when processing emotions. East Asians were less likely to know the difference between fear and disgust than Americans when sampling faces. Many studies conducted proves that constant repetition in a certain skill has an effect on brain activity. For example, in a 2000 study they showed that taxi drivers in London showed larger gray matter in the posterior hippocampi than the average civilian. A different study in 2004 showed that those who know how to juggle have an increase in volume of the cortical tissue in the bilateral midtemporal area and left posterior intraparietal sulcus. The findings from many neuroimaging studies reflect the behavioral patterns observed in previous anthropological and cultural research. Such comparisons that were made between particular behavioral and neural activity across different cultures, have already provided the scientific community with more insight into the cultural influences on human behavior.

Biography He was born on December 4, 1821 at Lekeberg Municipality on the family farm. He moved to Stockholm and was involved in genealogical publishing. He is best known for his history of Swedish nobility in 4 volumes. It was Sweden's first scholarly genealogical work. From 1871 to 1882 he published another set of genealogy books, and the 1900s edition was edited by Gustaf Elgenstierna. In 1854 he started a new set in 27 volumes, containing information up to 1903. He died on March 12, 1907 in Stockholm, Sweden. Anrep's nobility genealogy Gillingstam presents documentation that Anrep had personally discarded a lot of earlier parts of family trees of nobility, for example as mythical. However, in his series 1858-1864, Nobility Genealogy, 4 volumes, it was a prerequisite from the Riddarhuset to use their material that Anrep must follow those (even mythical parts of) family tables strictly - i.e., he was not allowed to discard mythical parts of the pompous pedigrees in his publication. This has been used as criticism against Anrep personally - that he published even mistaken genealogies. Also, his publication has been used as evidence of the truthfulness of those mythical parts of genealogies, on basis of Anrep's authority - although he might personally be appalled to see his name used for such purpose, having himself left personal notes about unreliable portions.

Stephens (October 13, 1834 ‚Äì May 21, 1870) was a state senator from North Carolina. He was stabbed and garroted by the Ku Klux Klan on May 21, 1870.Biography from Rootsweb. This killing began the Kirk‚ÄìHolden war. Personal life and early career Born John Walter Stephens near Bruce's Crossroads (now Summerfield) in Guilford County, North Carolina, he was the oldest child of Absalom Stephens and his wife, Letitia. Stephens had four siblings, including three brothers and a sister. His family moved to Rockingham County when Stephens was still young, living first in Wentworth, the county seat, and then in Leaksville. Stephens' father, a tailor by trade, died in 1848, while the family was living in Leaksville. Stephens married his first wife, Nannie Walters, in 1857. Only two years later, she died, leaving Stephens a widower, and the single father of an infant daughter, Nannie. Living in a Wentworth hotel in 1860, he married Martha Frances Groom. From this marriage, his daughter Ella was born. Said to have been a member of the Methodist Church at Wentworth, Stephens also served for a time as an agent for the American Bible and Tract Society though he was barely literate. Soon after, he became a tobacco trader, moving to York, South Carolina. Civil War Early on in the American Civil War, Stephens was based in Greensboro, North Carolina. He served the Confederacy by commandeering horses for the Confederate army. Later, he moved back to Wentworth, and worked as what was known as an \\"impressment agent\\", mustering draftees for the Confederate army. Toward the end of the war, Stephens signed up for the armed forces, but it is unclear whether he actually saw action during this time. Post-war At the conclusion of the war, Stephens returned to Wentworth, and once more worked as a tobacco trader. It was during this time that the incident that would lead his political enemies to refer to him as \\"Chicken Stephens\\" occurred. Accounts of this incident vary greatly, even amongst historians. Much of the variance apparently depends upon the view the historian takes regarding Stephens' later political actions. In all versions of the story, Stephens shoots and kills chickens on his own property. The accounts diverge as to Stephens' motives in shooting the chickens. One account states that it was a simple misunderstanding and that Stephens had thought the wayward chickens were his own. In his history of North Carolina, Professor William Powell presents a picture of Stephens as a vindictive man, who killed the chickens almost purely out of spite or greed. The stories converge again when dealing with what happened after Stephens shot the chickens. All accounts have Wentworth merchant and postmaster Thomas Anderson Ratliffe, the owner of the chickens, complaining to the sheriff, and Stephens spent a night in jail. Upon release, he confronted Ratliffe his next-door neighbor, sporting a seven-shot revolver. During the altercation, the gun was discharged (whether intentionally or accidentally is again a matter where accounts vary), and two bystanders were wounded. Records do not indicate that Stephens ever spent further time in jail regarding this matter, but the dismissive nickname by which his enemies would refer to him the rest of his life and even to this day was established then and there at Wentworth. Political career Due to his unpopularity in Wentworth, Stephens moved to the adjacent Caswell County seat of Yanceyville in 1866, continuing to work as a tobacco trader, and also beginning to serve as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau. He became a member of the Republican Party, as well as the Union League. As part of these organizations, he helped to politically organize the majority black population. These activities made many enemies for him amongst the conservative white Democrats of the state and especially so in Caswell County. Due in large part to his popularity amongst the black population, Stephens was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1868, displacing the venerable sitting senator Bedford Brown, who was quite popular among the white community. This further inflamed the already significant hostility that the local white population of Caswell County felt for him. During this time, Stephens became nearly completely ostracized socially by and from the white community, even to the extent that he was supposedly expelled from the Yanceyville Methodist Church. Many unsubstantiated rumors were circulated amongst the white population regarding his personal life, including claims (likely true) that he was a spy for Governor William W. Holden, attempted to bribe local citizens, and had burned the crops and barns of fellow citizens loyal to the Confederacy. His political opponents, consisting mainly of white conservative Democrats, claimed Stephens had murdered his own mother, who died under the most \\"unusual circumstances.\\" However, none of these claims ever resulted in any form of legal action against Stephens, which seemed to mitigate against the veracity of such claims, at least among his supporters. Due to threats against his life raised during this period, Stephens was known to always be well armed. Additionally, it was said that he took out a quite substantial life insurance policy (worth a reported $10,000) on himself. Assassination by the Ku Klux Klan The grave of John Walter Stephens in Yanceyville, NC, USAStephens' political activities greatly angered the Ku Klux Klan in Caswell County. The Klan held a \\"trial\\" in absentia of Stephens, in which he was convicted and a death sentence verdict was rendered. Claims were made by Klan members that Stephens was given a \\"vigorous defense\\", though no evidence in this regard has ever been proffered. It was under the auspices of this \\"verdict\\" that the assassination of May 21, 1870 was carried out. According to news accounts from around that time, the assassination was carried out in a backroom of the Caswell County Courthouse in Yanceyville. Stephens was in attendance at a Democratic gathering, in an attempt to convince a prominent Democrat to run for Sheriff as a Republican. The man he was attempting to sway signalled to him from the floor of the hall and Stephens followed him downstairs. Knowing Stephens' reputation for being quite well armed, his Klan assassins had assembled between eight and twelve men who lay in wait in a darkened room on the Caswell County Courthouse's first floor. After a search by family and friends Stephens' lifeless body was discovered in the first-floor room the following day. There were multiple versions of the assassination published in the American media. The Charleston Daily News reported that his body was found with a rope around his neck, his throat cut in two places, and a knife body wound. While The Daily Phoenix reported that his body was discovered with 40 gunshot wounds. Legacy The legacy of the life lived by John Stephens is quite complicated. William Powell is not alone in his negative characterization of Stephens. Much local folk history characterizes Stephens as, at best, a misguided miscreant, and at worst a criminally craven opportunist. What is clear from all accounts is that Stephens did work extensively with the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League. It is such associations ‚Äî as well as his political organization of the black population ‚Äî that cause the wide divergence in popular opinion surrounding his legacy. Those who view him as little more than an opportunist often point out that he only joined the above organizations after the South was defeated, and the political winds shifted. During the War, however, he had worked in support of the Confederacy, leading modern historians like Phillips to take a more cynical view of his later support of the freedmen and the Union League. A significant number of former Confederates opted to join the Republican Party after the war, and some, such as James Longstreet and James L. Alcorn, became \\"scalawags\\" at least partly in the interest of national reconciliation. The dichotomy with which historians view Stephens aside, there is no question that the black population of the time revered him and that Stephens was murdered in the basement of a courthouse by the Klan for his political views and for assisting freed slaves. No likeness of Stephens is known to exist. An engraving said to be that of Stephens and published in a few local and state histories in the late twentieth century has been proven by family members in recent years to be that of someone else.

The case was consolidated with Plata v. Schwarzenegger and assigned to a three-judge court on July 26, 2007 to hear motions for relief pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act. An order to reduce the prison population was entered on January 12, 2010, which California claims is unconstitutional in its appeal before the Supreme Court.  History  The case was filed on April 23, 1990, and was tried before a United States magistrate judge, and in June 1994 the magistrate judge found that defendants‚Äô delivery of mental health care to class members violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Special Master  On September 13, 1995, the court issued a permanent injunction and ordered that a special master be appointed to monitor compliance with the court-ordered injunctive relief. The special master submitted 16 interim reports, with later reports \\"reflect[ing] a troubling reversal in the progress of the remedial efforts of the preceding decade\\".

In an order described by The New York Times as \\"scathing\\", the panel indicated that the state had failed to follow through on previous orders to improve conditions and that the cuts were needed to deal with overcrowding and poor health care that was causing an unnecessary death each week on average. The panel recommended achieving the cuts by reducing imprisonment of nonviolent offenders and technical parole violators. The state submitted a plan on September 18, 2009 but it the plan failed to meet requirements set by the release order. On October 21, 2009 the court rejected the plan, and gave the government until November 12 to submit a corrected plan or it would order the attorneys for the plaintiffs to submit a plan and order it implemented. The state submitted a revised plan on November 12, 2009, and the plan was accepted and entered as an order of the court on January 12, 2010.Order to reduce prison population , three-judge court, convened by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hearing Plata v.

Until a renaming contest in 1956, the truck was sold as the \\"Toyopet Light Truck SKB\\". Since 1985 the ToyoAce and Dyna truck lines have been merged, with the Dynas generally being intended for heavier duty work. In Japan, it was exclusive to Japanese Toyota dealerships called Toyopet Store. __TOC__ History First generation 1956 Toyopet ToyoAce The first- generation ToyoAce was a one-ton truck of a semi-cab over design. It has a four-cylinder sidevalve inline-four \\"type S\\" engine of and . It was originally sold as the \\"Toyopet Light Truck\\", a not very inspired name which was changed for \\"ToyoAce\\" after a public contest in 1956. The spartan interior featured hammock-style seats, as in a Citro√´n 2CV. The \\"K\\" in the model code was shared, as was the chassis, with the Toyopet SK/RK Truck, a line which was later to become the Toyota Stout. The first Toyoace initially sold slowly, due to a price much higher than the three-wheeled trucks with which it was competing. After a large drop in price, however, the ToyoAce went on to change the Japanese market for light trucks in favor of four-wheeled vehicles. There were also panel van, light van, double cab and other body styles developed. These received chassis numbers from SK17 to SK19.Ozeki (2007), p. 75 In 1958 power of the S engine was increased to .Ozeki (2007), p. 74 The former Central Motors produced the ToyoAce van from June 1956 to July 1960. Second generation Toyopet ToyoAce PK3# The semi-cab over layout was retained for the second-generation Toyopet ToyoAce, initially sold as the SK20. The new SK20 was also sold as a panel van (SK20V) and as a double-cab truck (SK20P). The sidevalve 1 liter engine's power remained , as for its predecessor. It was introduced in March 1959, but already by October that year it underwent a facelift and received a new engine, the 1.0-liter P type. This was the PK20 series. Australian versions were badged as a Toyota 25. Later yet, 1.25 and 1.5 ton versions were added, with more powerful 1.2 (2P) and 1.5-litre (R) engines. This picture is a PK3# with two single lights, the upgrade added in 1966 was the PK4# series which was fitted with the R engine. After the initial S-engined series, there were only PK models even though they were being powered both by the P and R series engines. This was to set it apart from the Stout which used the \\"RK\\"-series chassis numbers. In a May 1967 facelift, the car received quad headlights and a 3P-engined (1.35 L, \\"PK32\\") version was added. Unlike the front-engined SKB, the engine in the second-generation ToyoAce was moved, to underneath and behind the seats. This allowed seating for three rather than two. The cabin also tilted for engine access. The split windshield was replaced with a single unit, still flat. This ToyoAce had a long life, remaining on the market until 1971. Third generation Third- generation ToyoAce The third-generation ToyoAce received Y-series chassis codes to avoid confusion. It was introduced in August 1971 and had a much more modern design, and was available in several new body styles. There were 3P type and 12R gasoline engines (1.35 or 1.6 litres, from the 12R) as well as the 2.5-litre 2J diesel engine with . The diesel was introduced in July 1972. Payloads now ranged between . In August 1977 a special \\"just low\\" version appeared, with small twin rear wheels for a lower cargo surface. Starting with this generation, the ToyoAce was used as the basis of a commercial van to accommodate passengers for commuting, called the Toyota HiAce, which was sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyopet Store, thereby affording Toyota the ability to sell the ToyoAce as a smaller companion to the Toyota Coaster. Model codes include PY10, RY10/12/14, and JY16.  Fourth generation The fourth-generation ToyoAce was built between March 1979 and August 1985. This was the last ToyoAce to be of a separate design from the larger Dyna. While the overall size and cargo area was similar to those of the Y10-series, the wheelbase was shorter to allow for a narrower turning circle. The new ToyoAce also met new more stringent emissions and noise standards introduced for 1979. The 1.6-litre 12R was retained, although power was down somewhat to . The 2J diesel also remained, but was complemented by the all new L type, a 2.2-liter SOHC unit with . There was also a bigger 2-litre 5R petrol engine available, but diesels were now beginning to become more important in this sector. The amount of diesel versions increased from seven to 25, as opposed to twenty petrol models. Toyota ToyoAce (fourth generation) In 1982, a delivery van that allowed passengers to walk upright within the vehicle was introduced, called the Toyota QuickDelivery which is popular with delivery services and industries where working from inside the vehicle and mobility are an asset. Model codes include RY20, LY20, LY30, JY30 and Y40. A long-wheelbase version was also available. Fifth generation Fifth-generation ToyoAce Introduced in August 1985, the fifth-generation ToyoAce was based on the fifth-generation Dyna, which had been launched a year earlier. The ToyoAce models were generally for lighter duty and are offered with smaller engines, down to the 1,626 cc 1Y petrol unit. Models in the 1.5 ton range (called G15) had Y-series chassis codes (Y50/60), while the heavier duty 2‚Äì3.5 ton versions have the U-series codes of the Dyna (U80/90, marketed as the ToyoAce G25 and G35). The one-tonner was discontinued, with the HiAce truck taking its position in the market. There was now also the option of an LPG-powered two-litre engine, and the expanded diesel range now went up to a four-litre six. Sixth generation Sixth generation Toyota ToyoAce The sixth-generation (introduced in May 1995) was merged fully with the Dyna, still with Y-series chassis numbers for the lighter models and U-series for the heavier versions. The only difference between the Dyna and the ToyoAce from now on is the badging, and that they are sold through separate sales channels. The range expanded again, now also including a wide-bodied rebadging of the Hino Ranger FB. The lighter portion of the range remained on the market until 2001, two years after the heavier versions had been replaced. Seventh generation Double cab standard bed ToyoAce (TRY230) In May 1999 the heavier diesel versions (1.75-3.5 tons) were replaced by the new seventh-generation ToyoAce. A four- ton model was new to the ToyoAce lineup. In June 2001, the lighter models were also replaced by the seventh-generation model. Eighth generation Eighth generation Toyota ToyoAce In June 2011 the eighth-generation ToyoAce appeared, now featuring hybrid drive systems in several models. The ToyoAce got a minor change at the front and received a collision avoidance system and a lane- departure alert system..

Chief of the Gda≈Ñsk-Westerplatte train station, he was killed during the first minutes of the German attack on the Polish enclave of Westerplatte. He was the first casualty of the Battle of Westerplatte, and one of the first victims of the Invasion of Poland and of World War II. Biography Wojciech Najsarek was born April 22, 1900, in Jaƒámierz near Sanok, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. He graduated from a local primary school. In 1920 he volunteered for the Polish Army and took part in the Polish-Bolshevik War. Following demobilisation he joined the Polish State Railways and at the same time continued his education. In 1926 he married Maria n√©e Ostrowska. In 1933 he graduated from a gymnasium in Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem and was sent for a yearly course for railway managers in Pozna≈Ñ. After that he served as a stationmaster in Reda. On April 19, 1937, he became the stationmaster of Gda≈Ñsk-Westerplatte station, a Polish trade outpost within the Free City of Danzig, directly adjacent to a military depot at Westerplatte. At the same time he held a military rank of starszy sier≈ºant (equivalent to the rank of Staff Sergeant). On September 1, 1939, at 4:50 AM, only five minutes after the outbreak of hostilities, he was alarmed by strange noises and left his outpost to check what was happening, only to find a German military unit heading for the nearby Westerplatte military outpost. He received numerous heavy machine gun wounds and died instantly, as the first Polish victim of the Battle of Westerplatte and one of the first victims of World War II. In 1945 he was posthumously awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military decoration. In the 1970s the place of his death was marked with a memorial stone.

Comensoli was a serious and meditative child. Comensoli left her family in 1862 and joined the convent of the Sisters of Charity, founded by St. Bartolomea Capitanio in Lovere, Bergamo. She became seriously ill and was dismissed from the Institute. After Comensoli's recovery, she left her village due to the financial situation of her family and entered into domestic service, first with G. B. Rota, parish priest of Chiari, who a few years later was to become the Bishop of Lodi, and afterwards with the Countess F√©-Vitali. On the Feast of Corpus Christi of 1878, with the permission of her confessor, she made the vow of chastity. Without neglecting her duties as a domestic servant, Caterina decided to educate the children of San Gervasio, Bergamo, guiding them towards an honest life of Christian and social virtues. By means of assiduous prayer, mortification, an intense interior life, and the practice of the deeds of charity, Comensoli prepared herself for a religious life. Freed from family responsibilities after her parents‚Äô death, the young woman sought a way to live a religious life. Comensoli opened her heart to the Bishop of Bergamo, Speranza, who was, at that time, in Bienno as a guest of the F√©-Vitali's. He encouraged her. In 1880, while in Rome with the F√©-Vitali's, Comensoli succeeded in speaking with Pope Leo XIII about her plans to establish a religious institute devoted to the adoration of the Eucharist. The Pope suggested she include the education of young female factory workers as well. Supported by the new Bishop of Bergamo, Guindani, and by her \\"Father and Superior\\", F. Spinelli, on December 15, 1882, Comensoli, together with two of her friends, began the Congregation of the Sacramentine Sisters of Bergamo. On December 15, 1884 she took the name of Sister Geltrude of the Blessed Sacrament. Comensoli and her sisters, advised by the Bishop of Bergamo, Camillo Guindani, successor to Speranza, had to abandon their first location and took refuge in Lodi. The Bishop of Lodi, welcomed them and gave them a house in Lavagna di Comazzo, which temporarily became the Mother House of the Institute. When innumerable difficulties had been overcome, Rota, with a decree of September 8, 1891, gave canonical recognition to the Institute. On March 28, 1892, Comensoli returned to Bergamo. Death On February 18, 1903, at midday, Comensoli died. The news of her death quickly spread. Those who had known her, especially the poor and the humble, who were her favourite people, declared her a saint. On August 9, 1926, her remains were taken from the cemetery of Bergamo to the Mother House of the Institute which she had established. They resided in a chapel next to the Church of Adoration. Canonization On February 18, 1928, Comensoli's canonization process began. On April 26, 1961, the General Congregation of the then Congregation of Sacred Rites was held in the presence of Pope John XXIII, which declared her \\"Venerable\\". On October 1, 1989, Pope John Paul II declared Comensoli a beatified. On April 26, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI declared Comensoli a saint.Holy mass for the canonization of five new saints  References  External links * Geltrude Comensoli Category:1847 births Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:1903 deaths Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Canonizations by Pope Benedict XVI ","title":"Geltrude Comensoli"},{"id":"24647321","text":"Bannerman High School is a state secondary school in the Baillieston suburb of Glasgow, Scotland.

It has a capacity for 1400 pupils and has approximately 100 members of teaching staff. The current head teacher is Seonaidh Black. Associated primary schools The six associated primary schools are Caledonia Primary, Carmyle Primary, Mount Vernon Primary, Garrowhill Primary, Sandaig Primary and Swinton Primary. Together with these six partner primary schools and two pre-5 establishments, the school is part of the Bannerman Learning Community. Facilities The school was opened in 1973 and is composed of 3 linked buildings. The school has playing fields, all weather pitches, a workshop theatre, games hall and academic and practical classroom areas. Facilities for pupils with physical disabilities are in place. The school was fully refurbished and upgraded during the course of 2002, as part of a citywide PFI project. The G-Unit for young people on the Autistic Spectrum opened in the school in August 2000 (which had then been known as the Communication Disorder Unit, then Bannerman Autism Unit, and currently Bannerman Language and Communication Resource). History Prior to the school opening in the early 1970s, there was heated debate as to the naming of the school. The names put forward were. 1\\\\. Garrowhill Academy. The original suggestion was to call the new school, put forward by the councillor for the area because it was to be located near the residential area of Garrowhill. 2\\\\. Garrowhill High School. This was actually the name the Charles Anderson concrete sculpture purchase order was made out to. Ref Charles Anderson website. 3\\\\. Baillieston High School. The councillor for Baillieston, Jimmy McGuigan, strongly disagreed and he was supported by many residents. It was felt that the name should incorporate 'Baillieston' 4\\\\. Scott-Maxwell High School, This was very popular choice with older Bailliestonians. Bannerman HS was built in the Home Field of the Baillieston House Estate. The last proprietor of the Baillieston and Garrowhill Estates and Lands of Baillieston was John Maxwell Scott-Maxwell. However the Education sub-committee of Lanarkshire county council eventually decided to name it after the retiring county architect Charles Bannerman. The school became under the control of Glasgow City Council when Baillieston was incorporated into the city's boundaries in 1975.

Early career Originally from Tasmania, Grima played for the Tassie Mariners, South Launceston, the Tasmanian Devils and Central District, including in their 2007 SANFL premiership team. Grima was then rookie-listed by North Melbourne in the 2008 AFL Rookie Draft. AFL career Grima impressed in early training sessions and looked in line for a promotion before hyper-extending his knee in a marking exercise. The injury prematurely ended his season and raised doubts about his ability to retain a spot on the list. Despite this injury setback, North Melbourne promoted Grima to the senior list before the start of the 2009 season and the versatile defender was quick to show his potential, holding down a spot at full-back for North's reserves team, Werribee in the VFL in the early part of the season. His strong form led to Grima making his debut in round eight against Geelong. He only missed two games for the rest of the season and combined well in defence with Scott Thompson and Scott McMahon. Grima scored his first goal in AFL football on Saturday, 17 August 2013 against Essendon at Etihad Stadium. An injury to Leigh Adams resulted in Grima being moved forward for the final quarter of the match. Having not scored a goal after 71 AFL games, he crumbed the ball from a marking contest involving Robbie Tarrant, and snapped a left-foot goal midway through the last quarter. The defender embarked on a wild celebration, being mobbed by teammates who came from all areas of the ground to congratulate him. Had he failed to score, he would have equalled a club record, with former player Ted Larsen having a 72-game drought before scoring a goal. In July 2015, Grima had announced his retirement, effective immediately, due to a back injury. Grima had been unable to fully recover from the injury that had seen him undergo surgery on his back on two previous occasions. Specialists had advised him that he would need a third operation, this time to fuse a disc in his spine. In February 2016, Grima returned to the AFL after signing with the Essendon Football Club as a top-up player due to the club's supplements controversy. Coaching career In October 2018, Sturt Football Club announced its appointment of Grima as senior coach for 2019. He was previously the coach of Strathmore in the Premier Division of the Essendon District Football League.

Background He was bred in Maryland by Hal C.B. Clagett and raced under the Hidden Hill Farm's banner as his owner. He finished racing with a record of 38-16-14 in 105 starts with career earnings of $2,056,406. Little Bold John was best known for his wins in the grade one Donn Handicap and the grade two General George Handicap. In 1997, he became the first Maryland-bred horse to accumulate $1 million in career earnings, and he remains only one of six horses to have multimillion-dollar earnings from the state of Maryland. The others are Cigar, Awad, Concern, Broad Brush and the filly Safely Kept.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;.  Racing career  Little Bold John competed 105 times during nine seasons, winning 38 races, of which 25 were stakes. That ranks him fourth in stakes victories among thoroughbreds in North America behind Native Diver with 34 stakes wins, John Henry with 30 stakes wins, and Who Doctor Who with 26. In a 1997 interview with the Baltimore Sun, Robb said that Little Bold John, who earned $2,056,406, was the best horse he had ever trained. \\"Not only that,\\" Robb said. \\"I think he's the best horse we ever had in Maryland. I could run him short, long, on the turf, the dirt, in the mud, and he'd win anyway. That makes him special over any horse I've ever seen.\\" Little Bold John overcame injuries and retirement to return to the races. In 1992, though, Robb retired the gelding permanently. \\"In his last race, he hurt himself about the quarter pole and dropped back to third or fourth,\\" Robb said. \\"He pulled his suspensory ligament. Most horses, when they get hurt, pull up. But he came back to win the race, like he was three-legged. After that, I knew he'd end up killing himself if I kept running him.\\" Little Bold John's final race was on Halloween 1992 at Pimlico Race Course. He was 10, having raced every year since 1984 when he was two. His biggest win came at Gulfstream Park in the Donn Handicap a grade one stakes worth $175,000. Little Bold John paid a record $113.80 to win that race. He also won two $200,000 stakes in Maryland, including the grade two General George Handicap and the Maryland Million Classic, both at Laurel Park Racecourse. Breeder Clagett sold Little Bold John to Anne Arundel County businessman Jack Owens after his fourth start. Robb remained as trainer and bought Little Bold John from Owens in 1990. In 1996, he gave the horse back to Clagett. Bloodhorse Magazine, by Tom Keyser, Friday, January 24, 2003;  Retirement  Following his retirement, owner-trainer Jerry Robb sent Little Bold John to live at Hidden Hill Farm in Edgewater, Maryland. The horse spent the last few years of his life at Weston Farm in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. After suffering an attack of colic, he died at age 21 on January 21, 2003, in the same field where he had lived as a youngster.

It was located on the Wairarapa Line near the southern bank of the Tauherenikau River. The station opened to traffic in 1880 and closed nearly a century later in 1975. History  Facilities  At around the time the station opened it had a passenger shelter and a cottage. At some point a wooden-fronted platform was also constructed as the Masterton-based Inspector of the Permanent Way reported in 1953 that this had rotted and required replacement. An inspection of the passenger shelter in 1963 revealed that it was in such a poor state that it was not economical to repair it and its replacement with a smaller structure was recommended. In response it was noted that the station handled passengers only and patronage of the station was light. It was considered that a new building was not warranted and instructions were issued for no work to be carried out on the building until further notice. In 1965 minor repairs and a repaint were authorised. Fernside was never considered to be particularly important, but one of the more interesting facets of its history was that the Railways Department constructed a stone crushing plant there near the south bank of the Tauherenikau River in 1908. Source material was extracted from the riverbed and hauled to the plant in small trucks or skips. In 1912 a siding was laid to the plant and, though the plant ceased operation in the early 1920s, the siding was not lifted until about the late 1930s. With this siding gone it seems that there was little further use for the station for the consignment of freight and it was closed for this purpose in 1940. A backshunt that served as a service siding was retained at Fernside for use by the Way and Works bridge maintenance crew as a place where wagons of material and mobile workers huts could be stored. In practice, however, the crews stationed their huts at Featherston and travelled to the bridge on motor velocipedes. Closure of the siding was suggested in a 1953 report on sidings at unattended stations but the District Engineer required it to remain open in connection with work on the bridge. It was finally closed on 30 July 1962. The front edge of the station platform is still clearly visible beside the track. Services The first trains to stop at Fernside were the mixed services that ran from Wellington to Greytown when the Featherston ‚Äì Greytown section of the line opened in May 1880. These services had earlier terminated at Featherston and were simply extended to run to the new railhead. Later that year the line was opened to Masterton and in 1884 there were two return weekday mixed trains. No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains. As was typically the case for flag stations, trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers (a flag stop) and wagons if required to do so. The Wairarapa Line was completed to its northern terminus at Woodville in 1897 and this enabled the Railways Department to introduce the Napier Mail to the Wairarapa Line. This train had earlier run as the Napier Express via the Wellington and Manawatu Railway and the Manawatu Gorge. This arrangement lasted until 1909 when the Napier Mail once again became the Napier Express and reverted to its original route. Thereafter the primary passenger service through the Wairarapa was the Wairarapa Mail which was essentially the Wellington to Woodville portion of the old Napier Mail. From 1936 when the NZR RM class Wairarapa-type railcars were introduced passengers from Fernside had a much faster service to points both north and south. The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday ‚Äì Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage. It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948. Several years later the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars, and ushering in the era of the twin-set railcars. The private motorcar was already having an effect on smaller railway stations and Fernside was no exception with patronage steadily declining. The 1959 railcar timetable lists Fernside as a \\"stops if required\\" station for both northbound and southbound services. In 1963 patronage was considered to be \\"light\\" and by 1975 it was no longer sufficient to warrant keeping the station open leading to its closure to all traffic on 30 March.  Today  The only sign of the station today is the remains of the platform, the front edge of which can still be seen beside the track. The station site is only accessible from a private driveway off the end of Algies Road.

The shrine was the ichinomiya of the government of the South Seas Mandate, a League of Nations mandated territory administered by the Empire of Japan. It was established in 1940 and designated for the veneration of Amaterasu Omikami.Peattie, Mark R. (1988). Nan ªy≈ç: the rise and fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885‚Äì1945, p. 226. History The process which led to the establishment of the shrine began mid-1930s when the regional planning agency (Nan'y≈ç Takushoku) was charged with the Japanization of Micronesia.Guichard- Anguis, Sylvie et al. (2009). Japanese Tourism and Travel Culture, p. 181. The chief advocate for the shrine was Domoto Teiichi, who had been the Private Secretary to the Governor of the South Seas Mandate since 1936. The enshrinement ceremonies took three days, November 1‚Äì3, 1940 (Showa 15, 1st‚Äì3rd day of the 11th month). The shrine was situated at Koror because it was the Japanese colonial capital. From the outset, the Nan'y≈ç Shrine was officially designated one of the Kanpei-taisha (ÂÆòÂπ£Â§ßÁ§æ), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government-supported shrines.Peattie, pp. 225‚Äì229. The shrine was construed by the Japanese government as marking \\"a step forward in the sacred task of constructing a New East Asian Order.\\"Peattie, p. 229. When the Allied forces threatened Palau in late 1944, the kami and sacred symbols of the shrine were evacuated to Japan by submarine. The shrine remained untouched by American bombing; but Japan's defeat in World War II ended this colonial administration and a sense of reverence for the shrine structures which were dismantled for use in rebuilding Koror. Only the stone steps to the upper platform and the great stone lanterns still remain as evidence of the former shrine precincts.Peattie, p. 339 n61. In 1983, plans were developed for a reconstruction of the shrine at its former site, and a miniature replica of the original shrine was completed with the funding of private sponsors from Japan in 1993.ÂçóÊ¥ãÁ•ûÁ§æ, Asahi Shimbun, September 21, 2009 See also * List of Shinto shrines * Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines Notes References * Guichard-Anguis, Sylvie and Okpyo Moon.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Oscar Oscar developed from a low pressure area to the northwest of the Cocos Islands on 22 October. The storm moved generally southward for several days before dissipating on 1 November. Tropical Low Pearl A low pressure developed into Pearl on 11 November. The system tracked southeastward and ceased to exist on 14 November. It was classified as a tropical cyclone at the time until post-analysis indicated it remained a tropical low. Severe Tropical Cyclone Quenton Quenton developed on 26 November from a low pressure situated south of Java. Making landfall in Western Australia on 29 November, Quenton was the first tropical cyclone to strike Australia in the month of November since Ines in 1973. The cyclone dissipated on the following day. Tropical Cyclone Fritz On 9 December, Fritz developed from a low pressure area to the northwest of Willis Island. Fritz meandered erratically until dissipating on 13 December. Tropical Cyclone Esther A small, weak tropical low, later named Esther, developed over the Banda Sea on 19 December. Esther struck Babar Island and then dissipated on 21 December. Tropical Cyclone 06U Operationally, this cyclone was considered to have been the redeveloped remnants of Esther. The storm developed from a cloud cluster near the southern tip of Timor on 21 December. The system moved west-northward and dissipated on 24 December. Tropical Cyclone Sharon A low pressure area rapidly developed into Tropical Cyclone Sharon on 25 December. Sharon existed west of 90¬∞E, which is now the western boundary of the Australian region basin. The storm dissipated on 31 December. Tropical Cyclone Tim Tim formed from a low pressure area to the southeast of Christmas Island on 2 January 1984. After moving northwest, Tim turned southward on 6 January. The cyclone decayed to a tropical low by 10 January. Severe Tropical Cyclone Grace A weak area of low pressure developed east of Queensland on January 11. The tropical disturbance moved northeastward over the Coral Sea and gradually became better organized. On January 13 it turned to the south and intensified into a tropical cyclone the next day. In a favorable environment for intensification, Grace strengthened on January 15 and 16, developing a ragged eye as seen on the satellite images. On January 16 became a severe tropical cyclone and reached its lowest estimated pressure of 970 mb. Also on January 16, a weather station on Frederick Reef reported maximum winds of 130 km/h. On January 17, upper level shear increased over the circulation and Grace became exposed as the tropical cyclone turned to the east. Weakening continued during the next few days and Grace decayed into a remnant low on January 21 while located southeast of Noum√©a. Severe Tropical Cyclone Vivienne-Fanja The origins of Vivienne-Fanja are unclear as a result of sparseness of data, due to a disruption in satellite imagery coverage. It is estimated that a tropical low formed on January 23 west of Christmas Island in the Australian basin. The Bureau of Meteorology named the storm Vivienne, which gradually intensified while moving to the west. On January 27, the cyclone crossed 80¬∞ E into the southwest Indian Ocean, at which time it was renamed Fanja. Severe Tropical Cyclone Willy A weak area of low pressure developed south of Java along the monsoon trough on February 2. The system meandered for a few days while becoming better organized. Late on February 5, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the low pressure to tropical cyclone intensity. Willy moved southwestward starting on February 6 and continued to intensify. On February 7, Willy was upgraded to a severe tropical cyclone with an estimated central pressure of 975 mb. On February 8, Willy reached its peak with an estimated central pressure of 960 mb. Satellite images showed a well-organized tropical cyclone and an eye was intermittently visible. Strong wind shear caused Willy to quickly lose strength and it weakened below tropical cyclone intensity late on February 9. Early on February 11, Willy dissipated. Severe Tropical Cyclone Annette-Jaminy Cyclone Annette developed simultaneously with Cyclone Willy in the Australian basin and Cyclone Haja in the south-west Indian. On February 3, a tropical low formed northeast of the Cocos Islands. Steered by a ridge to the south, it moved generally southwestward and intensified into Tropical Cyclone Annette, named by the Bureau of Meteorology. After executing a loop, Annette crossed 80 E into the south-west Indian Ocean on February 16\\\\. Upon crossing into the basin, the storm was renamed Jaminy by the Mauritius Meteorological Service. Tropical Cyclone Harvey A low spawned within the monsoon trough developed into Tropical Cyclone Harvey on 3 February. The system moved generally east-southeastward and entered the South Pacific basin on 7 February. Severe Tropical Cyclone Bobby Bobby formed within the monsoon trough to the northwest of Broome, Western Australia, on 17 February. Bobby moved southwestward for much of its duration and dissipated by 23 February. Severe Tropical Cyclone Ingrid A tropical low developed into Cyclone Ingrid to the east of Innisfail, Queensland, on 20 February. Ingrid moved eastward and then east-southeastward by 23 February. The storm then curved southwestward and dissipated on 25 February. Ingrid brought strong winds and caused minor flooding in Cairns and Mackay. Severe Tropical Cyclone Chloe On 29 February 1984 Chloe crossed the coast near Roebourne, Western Australia where three houses were destroyed and twelve others unroofed. Fifty people required evacuation as floodwaters from the Harding River rose to the lower steps of the Police Station. Parts of the Wickham High Schools were severely damaged and two buildings and a boat were destroyed in the Cossack/Point Samson area. The Dampier Yacht Club was unroofed.BoM ‚Äì Tropical Cyclones affecting Karratha/Dampier Tropical Cyclone Ferdinand A weak tropical low intensified into Tropical Cyclone Ferdinand on 2 March. The cyclone moved eastward to east-southward and paralleled the northern coast of Northern Territory, until making landfall near Maningrida on 4 March. Ferdinand dissipated on the following day. Goulburn Island and the Miningrida area experienced minor damage. Severe Tropical Cyclone Jim Cyclone Jim developed from a low just southeast of the mainland on Papua New Guinea on 6 March. The storm slowly deepened while heading generally west-southwestward. Early on 8 March, Jim struck Cape Grenville, Queensland. Jim left minor damage to vegetation and downed some large trees. After crossing the Cape York Peninsula, the system emerged into the Gulf of Carpentaria and later made landfall on 9 March at Port Roper, Northern Territory, which is just south of Numbulwar. Jim dissipated on the following day. A boat was beach at Alyangula. Inland, wind gusts as high as downed trees in the vicinity of the Roper River. Severe Tropical Cyclone Daryl Daryl formed from a tropical low to the west-northwest of Christmas Island on 6 March. It trekked southwestward and entered the southwest Indian Ocean basin on 16 March, but was not renamed. On 18 March, Daryl entered the Australian region basin, but dissipated by 20 March. Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984. Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18 March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favored significant development. On 22 March, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). By this time, the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22 March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system. Once over land, Kathy rapidly degraded, losing gale-force winds within 24 hours; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24 March. One person died and damaged totaled to 12 million. Tropical Cyclone Lance Lance affected Queensland before dissipating on April 17. Other systems During 30 January a shallow tropical low developed over the south-eastern Coral Sea. Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further as it moved westwards into the South Pacific basin. The system was subsequently named Beti during 2 February, before it impacted the Loyalty Islands and lost its tropical characteristics during 6 February.

Tropical Storm 04S Due to its minimal intensity, 04S was designated only as a tropical storm strength cyclone by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The storm remained unnamed by the warning center in Darwin. Severe Tropical Cyclone Frank Tropical Cyclone Frank was a significant tropical cyclone which formed off the western coast of Australia. It peaked as a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale according to the JTWC. Perth assessed it as a category 3 on the Australian scale. After it turned to the south-east on 25 December, it made landfall as a Category 2 two days later near Port Hedland, Western Australia. Tropical Cyclone Monica Monica peaked as a category 2 storm, tracking roughly south- eastward, passing into the South Pacific basin on December 28. Tropical Cyclone Nigel The precursor low to Cyclone Nigel formed as an ill-defined low, within the intertropical convergence zone near the Cape York Peninsula during January 1985. Over the next several days the system gradually moved eastwards into the Coral Sea, before the BoM reported that a recognizable circulation had developed during January 14. Over the next two days the low moved eastwards and slowly developed further, before the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 13P early on January 16. Later that day the BoM named the system Nigel as it became equivalent to a modern-day category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and moved out of the Australian region into the South Pacific basin. Severe Tropical Cyclone Odette Odette was a powerful cyclone. Tropical Cyclone Gertie Gertie made landfall in Western Australia before dissipating. Tropical Low 18P This system remained weak. Severe Tropical Cyclone Hubert Hubert had major differences in peak intensity from BOM and JTWC, but did not touch land. Severe Tropical Cyclone Isobel Isobel failed to affect land. Severe Tropical Cyclone Jacob Jacob was a Category 4 system on the Australian scale. Tropical Depression 24S This depression failed to intensify. Tropical Cyclone Pierre Pierre brushed Queensland. Tropical Cyclone Rebecca Rebecca made landfall in Queensland on February 22, 1985, as a Category 1 storm. Tropical Cyclone Kirsty Although powerful, Kirsty failed to affect land. Severe Tropical Cyclone Lindsay Cyclone Lindsay formed on March 6, 1985. The storm moved south-southeast reaching Category 3 status before making landfall near Broome, Western Australia. Severe Tropical Cyclone Sandy Sandy formed on March 19 in the Gulf of Carpentaria and strengthened rapidly into a Category 4 cyclone, before it made landfall near Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands as a Category 2 cyclone on March 24. Over the next days, Sandy moved into the Indian Ocean and dissipated on April 3. Similar to Cyclone Kathy, the storm was not as intense as Kathy. Two trawlers were devastated by Sandy, where swells of were measured. Storm surges were measured at at Centre Island. Flooding was extensive along the southern gulf coast. A total of of rain recorded in the island during a four-day time span. Tropical Cyclone Tanya Tanya hit Australia as a tropical cyclone. Severe Tropical Cyclone Margot Cyclone Margot was a tropical cyclone that stayed out to sea during its entire duration. It was first identified on April 10, off the coast of Sunda Strait. Margot then traveled to the southwest during April 12, gradually intensifying to a tropical cyclone. In the noon hours of April 13, it began to move to the southeast, under the influence of an intense high pressure area to the south. The cyclone reached a peak intensity on April 14, as a category three cyclone using the Australian scale, with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). This intensity was based on satellite estimates, but the strongest report was from a ship eighteen hours earlier. After peak intensity Margot gradually weakened up until the 19, when it briefly underwent intensification, and turned west. This was short lived however, as dry, easterly low-level winds and wind shear began to influence the cyclone. Margot began to rapidly weaken and move in an easterly direction on April 20. On the 21 Margot had become a remnant low after completing a figure-eight path. On the 25 the remnant low was absorbed by a broad low pressure system located in the northeast Indian Ocean. Tropical Cyclone Gretel Cyclone Gretel was a tropical cyclone that formed in the Arafura Sea late on April 12, 1985, just east of Croker Island, off the Northern Territory coast. Moving in a west-southwest direction, it crossed the Cobourg Peninsula into the Van Diemen Gulf, where it intensified to Category 2 and reached its lowest pressure of 984 hPa. Moving south-west, the eye of the storm passed over Darwin, Australia, early on April 14, causing extensive tree damage and flooding to the area but no reported loss of life. It continued moving in a south-southwest direction, weakening to a low pressure system near the Victoria River mouth late that evening. The total estimated damages was $3.5 million.

Tropical Cyclone Pedro Tropical Cyclone Pedro existed from November 4 to November 13. Severe Tropical Cyclone Felicity On 13 December, the BoM started to monitor a monsoon low, that had developed within the Arafura Sea to the northeast of Darwin. Over the next day, the system moved southeastwards over the Northern Territory, before it re-curved slightly and entered the Gulf Of Carpentaria. Early on 15 December, the system was named Felicity by TCWC Brisbane, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. During that day the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 07P, with peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 110 km/h (70 mph). TCWC Brisbane subsequently reported peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 110 km/h (70 mph), before the system made landfall over the Cape York Peninsula where it weakened below cyclone intensity. The system subsequently moved into the Coral Sea during 16 December, where it started to rapidly deepen, but did not reattain the classical characteristics of a tropical cyclone. As a result, both TCWC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane treated the system as a tropical depression over the next four days despite winds of between being observed in the southwest quadrant. Felicity subsequently dissipated during 20 December as it was absorbed by a short-wave trough of low pressure to the north of New Zealand. Some minor damage to vegetation was recorded on the Cape York Peninsular.

It was produced by the Grundy Organisation for Nine Network's Children's Programming. Actor David Waters was the emcee. Object Four children compete against each other playing a game similar to the adult game show Concentration that also had elements of Sale of the Century and the later game Hot Streak. Game Play Rounds One and Two Two different children competed at a time in each round. Toss-Up Question (Ripper Rhyme) The children were asked a \\"ripper rhyme\\" by the emcee. A general knowledge question written in the form of a rhyming couplet that was missing the last rhyming word. The first child to buzz with the correct word won control of the puzzle. Rebus Puzzle Both children were shown a puzzle board of twenty numbered squares. Each square concealed a picture (either a drawing or photograph) AND part of a rebus puzzle. The emcee also gave a clue to the rebus' solution which was related to the \\"ripper rhyme\\". Starting with the child who won the \\"ripper rhyme\\", each child chose two numbers, one at a time, from the puzzle board. Each number revealed a different picture. In order to \\"match\\", the chosen pictures must be related in some way to each other. If the pictures \\"matched\\", the corresponding rebus pieces were revealed and the child was then given the opportunity to solve the puzzle. If the pictures did not \\"match\\" or if the child could not solve the puzzle, the opposing child received control of the puzzle. The first child to solve the puzzle won the round and advanced to Round Three. Special Squares =Sound Effect= One number, represented by a drawing of an ear, contains a sound that is associated with one of the pictures on the puzzle board. =Catch-a-Clue= One number, represented by a drawing of a butterfly net, contains a verbal clue that is read by the announcer and is associated with one of the items on the puzzle board. Round Three The winners of both round one and round two competed against each other. Toss-Up Question (Who/What/Where am I?) The children were shown a succession of increasingly larger clues to the identity of a person, place, thing, etc.; given by children recorded on videotape. The first child to buzz in with the correct answer won control of the puzzle. Super Word Puzzle Both children were shown another puzzle board of twenty numbered squares. This time the board was split into two different sets of ten numbered squares. Numbers one through ten on top contained pictures. Numbers eleven through twenty on the bottom contained scrambled words related to the pictures. Each square also concealed part of a \\"super word\\", a word where each letter was separated by a space. The pictures, scrambled words, and \\"super word\\" all related to the toss-up identity. Starting with the child who won the toss-up identity, each child chose one number revealing a picture from the top half of the puzzle board, and one number revealing a scrambled word from the bottom half. In order to \\"match\\", the chosen picture must be related in some way to the chosen scrambled word. If the pieces \\"matched\\", the corresponding \\"super word\\" letter or space was revealed and the child was then given the opportunity to solve the puzzle. If the pieces did not \\"match\\" or if the child could not solve the puzzle, the opposing child received control of the puzzle. The first child to solve the puzzle won the round, the game, and a $50(AUS) savings account. All runners up received consolation gifts, including toys and games. Round Four All four children took part in a final round to test the powers of observation. Match a Mime The children tried to communicate a specific situation using pantomime from one child to another. With three of the children having their backs turned to the action, the emcee mimes out a situation to the first child. When finished, a bell sounds and the first child must then repeat the mime to a second child. When the bell sounds again, the second child must repeat the mime to a third child, and then the third child must repeat the mime to the last child. At the end, the emcee then asks the last child to identify the situation that was observed and pantomimed; followed by the third child, the second child, and finally the first child. At the end of the round, the children select a toy or game to keep from a table full of toys at one end of the set. Trivia *Before the first two rounds, the children participating in the round entered the stage by way of playground slides on each side in the back of the set. The emcee also entered on one of the slides at the beginning of the show. *Before each commercial break, the home audience was asked a question for which the answer was revealed after the break. Some questions involved identifying an item by the sound it makes or answering a multiple choice question.

Newark was built as a commercial tug of the same name in 1913 by the Skinner Shipbuilding Company at Baltimore, Maryland. The U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company, on 18 August 1917 for World War I service as a minesweeper and tug. She was commissioned on 23 September 1917 as USS Newark (SP-266) with Ensign John W. Barr in command. Operating in the 3rd Naval District (headquartered at New York City) during World War I, Newark got under way on 26 September 1917 as a minesweeper in and around New York City, berthing at Marine Basin. She steamed on patrol to Whitestone, Long Island, New York on 4 January 1918. In February, she operated as a tug, breaking ice in Marine Basin, helping six submarine chasers out of the harbor, and towing ships from docks to coal barges. In May, she resumed minesweeping activities, operating in Ambrose Channel. After the war, on 22 January 1919, Newark steamed up to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, towing barges and ships such as to the Lackawanna Terminal coal docks in Hoboken, New Jersey. Newark was decommissioned on 15 May and was sold on 19 May.

Phosphorus is required by all plants but is limited in soil, creating a problem in agriculture In many areas phosphorus must be added to soil for the extensive plant growth that is desired for crop production. Phosphorus was first added as a fertilizer in the form of single super phosphate (SSP) in the mid-nineteenth century, following research at Rothamsted Experimental Station in England. SSP is non-nitrogen fertiliser containing Phosphate in the form of monocalcium phosphate and Gypsum which is best suited for Alkali soils to supplement Phosphate and reduce soil alkalinity. The world consumes around 140 million tons of high grade rock phosphate mineral today, 90% of which goes into the production of diammonium phosphate (DAP). Excess application of chemical fertilizers in fact reduces the agricultural production as chemicals destroy natural soil flora and fauna. When DAP or SSP is applied to the soil only about 30% of the phosphorus is used by the plants, while the rest is converted to forms which cannot be used by the crops [x1,X2], a phenomenon which is known as phosphate problem to soil scientists. Phosphate Rich Organic Manure is produced by co- composting high-grade (32% P2O5 +/- 2%) rock phosphate in very fine size (say 80% finer than 54 microns). Needless to say, the finer the rock phosphate the better is the agronomic efficiency of PROM. Research indicates that this substance may be a more efficient way of adding phosphorus to soil than applying chemical fertilizers.http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/may102001/1113.pdfhttp://precedings.nature.com/documents/2411/version/2 Other benefits of PROM are that it supplies phosphorus to the second crop planted in a treated area as efficiently as the first, and that it can be produced using acidic waste solids recovered from the discharge of biogas plants. Phosphorus in rock phosphate mineral is mostly in the form of tricalcium phosphate, which is water-insoluble. Phosphorus dissolution in the soil is most favorable at a pH between 5.5 and 7.Brady, NC, Nature and Properties of Soils, Collier Macmillan, London,1984. Ions of aluminum, iron, and manganese prevent phosphorus dissolution by keeping local pH below 5.5, and magnesium and calcium ions prevent the pH from dropping below 7, preventing the release of phosphorus from its stable molecule. Microorganisms produce organic acids, which cause the slow dissolution of phosphorus from rock phosphate dust added to the soil, allowing more phosphorus uptake by the plant roots. Organic manure can prevent ions of other elements from locking phosphorus into insoluble forms. The phosphorus in phosphate enhanced organic manure is water-insoluble, so it does not leach into ground water or enter runoff [x] Most phosphate rocks can be used for phosphate rich organic manure. It was previously thought that only those rocks which have citric acid soluble phosphate and those of sedimentary origin could be used. Rocks of volcanic origin can be used as long as they are ground to very fine size. Organic manure should be properly prepared for use in agriculture, reducing the C:N ratio to 30:1 or lower. Alkaline and acidic soils require different ratios of phosphorus. PROM is known as a green chemistry phosphatic fertilizer. Addition of natural minerals or synthetic oxides in water-insoluble forms that contain micronutrients such as copper, zinc, and cobalt may improve the efficiency of PROM. Using natural sources of nitrogen, such as Azolla, may be more environmentally sound.http://network.nature.com/groups/naturalfarmingscience/forum/topics  Phosphate Rich Organic Manure under FCO Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation, Government of India has now approved Phosphate Rich Organic Manure (PROM) and included the same under Fertilizer Control Order (FCO). The approved specifications may be seen from Gazette Notification from the website of PROM Society.

Signed to Asian Man Records, Classics of Love released their debut, the Walking in Shadows EP, in 2009, followed by a single in 2010 and an eponymously titled album in 2012. The band's music goes back to while Michaels was doing solo acoustic shows and was approached by Mike Park of Asian Man Records about recording the songs in a studio. Michaels decided to do the recordings with a full band and recruited Feshbach, Herrell, and Huguenor. The group named themselves Classics of Love (a name known from the opening track of Last Wave Rockers, recorded by Jesse Michaels' band Common Rider) and recorded the six song EP \\"Walking in Shadows\\". After playing initial shows in California, the band went on a European tour in the spring of 2009. While playing in Southampton, United Kingdom they had equipment stolen from them. The band announced that when they returned from Europe they planned on starting writing on a full-length album. Their first album was released on February 14, 2012. The album was self-titled and featured the same lineup as their EP. The band became less active due to lead singer Jesse Michaels attending school in Los Angeles, but assured fans they were not broken up. Michaels now refers to the band in the past tense, calling them \\"a band I was in\\". In July 2020, Jesse Michaels released a new EP, World of Burning Hate, under the Classics of Love name, with permission from the other members of the band. Featuring Sharif Dumani (Alice Bag, Exploding Flowers) on guitar and bass, and Peter John Fontes (Los Nauticals) on drums, the EP is more of a straight hardcore style than the punk-ska of their self- titled album.

Life and work  Graef was born in K√∂nigsberg. In 1842, he entered the University of K√∂nigsberg, where he was an enthusiastic member of the Student Corps and produced his first lithographs.K√∂sener Korps-Listen, 1910, 142, 74 His training as a painter began in D√ºsseldorf with Theodor Hildebrandt and Wilhelm von Schadow at the Royal Academy. He made several study trips to Antwerp, Paris, Munich and Italy.Hermann A. M√ºller: Biographisches K√ºnstler-Lexikon, Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig, 1882 Upon his return to K√∂nigsberg, he married a former acquaintance from his drawing class, the painter and lithographer Franziska Liebreich (1824‚Äì1893), who came from a prominent Jewish family.Petra Wilhelmy-Dollinger: Die Berliner Salons: Mit historisch-literarischen Spazierg√§ngen, Walter de Gruyter, 2000 One of their sons, Botho, became a noted art historian. Their daughter Sabine married the painter Reinhold Lepsius and became a well-known painter herself. In 1849, he received the contract to paint frescoes in the south dome hall of the Neues Museum; designed by Wilhelm von Kaulbach, depicting Widukind's reconciliation with Charlemagne. This necessitated a move to Berlin and was followed by a commission to paint four scenes from the Labors of Hercules for the Altes Museum. After 1862, he focused on idealized female portraits, which brought him great commercial success. He became a member of the Prussian Academy of the Arts in 1880. At the peak of his fame, in 1885, he was arrested and charged with the abuse of an underage model. This became a major scandal in Berlin society, as the young woman in question was from a notable family that had been very hospitable to Graef. He was eventually acquitted, but not without great damage to all the parties involved.Annette Dorgerloh: Das K√ºnstlerehepaar Lepsius - Zur Berliner Portr√§tmalerei um 1900.

Originally described in 1993, these designer peptides have attracted interest in the field of nanotechnology for their potential for application in areas such as biomedical nanotechnology, tissue cell culturing, molecular electronics, and more. Effectively self- assembling peptides act as building blocks for a wide range of material and device applications. The essence of this technology is to replicate what nature does: to use molecular recognition processes to form ordered assemblies of building blocks that are capable of conducting biochemical activities. Background Peptides are able to perform as excellent building blocks for a wide range of materials as they can be designed to combine with a range of other building blocks such as lipids, sugars, nucleic acids, metallic nanocrystals and so on; this gives the peptides an edge over carbon nanotubes, which are another popular nanomaterial, as the carbon structure is unreactive. They also exhibit properties such as biocompatibility and molecular recognition; the latter is particularly useful as it enables specific selectivity for building ordered nanostructures. Additionally peptides have superb resistance to extreme conditions of high/low temperatures, detergents and denaturants. The ability of peptides to perform self-assembly allows them to be used as fabrication tools, which is currently and will continue to grow as a fundamental part of nanomaterials production. The self-assembling of peptides is facilitated through the molecules‚Äô structural and chemical compatibility with each other, and the structures formed demonstrates physical and chemical stability. A great advantage of using self-assembling peptides to build nanostructures in a bottom-up approach is that specific features can be incorporated; the peptides can be modified and functionalized. This approach means that the final structures are built from the self-integration of small, simple building blocks. Essentially this approach is needed for nanoscale structure, as the top-down method of miniaturizing device using sophisticated lithography and etching techniques has reached a physical limit. Moreover, the top-down approach is applicable to mainly only silicon based technology, and is unable to be used for biological developments. The peptide structure is organized hierarchically into four levels. The primary structure of a peptide is the sequence of the amino acids on the peptide chain. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of. For designer self-assembling peptides both natural and non-natural amino acids are used. They link together in a controlled manner to form short peptides which links to form long polypeptide chains. Along these chains the alternating amine (NH) and carbonyl (CO) groups are highly polar and they readily form hydrogen bonds with each other. These hydrogen bonds binds peptide chains together to give rise to secondary structures. Stable secondary structures include the alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Unstable secondary structures are random loops, turns and coils that are formed. The secondary structure that is formed is dependent on the primary structure; different sequences of the amino acids exhibit different preferences. Secondary structures usually fold into with a variety of loops and turns into a tertiary structure. What differentiates the secondary structure from the tertiary structure is primarily that the latter includes non-covalent interactions. The quaternary structure is the combination of two or more different chains of polypeptide to form what is known as a protein sub-unit. The self-assembly process of the peptide chains is dynamic‚Äîreassembly occurs repeatedly in a self-healing manner. The type of interactions that occurs to reassemble peptide structures include van der Waals forces, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. These forces also facilitate the molecular recognition function that the peptides encompasses. These interactions works on a basis of preference dependent on energy properties and specificity. A range of different nanostructures can be formed. Nanotubes are defined as an elongated nano-object with a definite inner hole. Nanofibrils are solid on the inside, as opposed to hollow nanotubes. Processing/Synthesis Peptide synthesis can be easily conducted by the established method of solid-phase chemistry in grams or kilograms quantities. The d-isomer conformation can be used for peptide synthesis. Nanostructures can be made by dissolving dipeptides in 1,1,1,3,3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol at 100 mg/ml and then diluting it with water for a concentration of less than 2 mg/ml. Multiwall nanotubes with a diameter of 80‚Äì300 nm, made of dipeptides from the diphenylalanine motif of Alzheimer's Œ≤-amyloid peptide are made by this method. If a thiol is introduced into the diphenylalanine then nano-spheres can be formed instead; nanospheres of 10‚Äì100 nm diameter from a diphenylgalcine peptide can also be made this way. Characterization Atomic force microscopy can measure mechanical properties of nanotubes. Scanning-electron and atomic-forces microscopy is used to examine Lego peptide nanofiber structures. Dynamic light scattering studies show structures of surfactant peptides. Surfactant peptides has been studied using a quick-freeze /deep‚Äìetch sample preparation method which minimizes effects on the structure. The sample nanostructures are flash freeze at ‚àí196 ¬∞C and can be studied three-dimensionally. Transmission electron microscopy was used. Using computer technology, a molecular model of peptides and their interactions can be built and studied. Specific tests can be performed on certain peptides; for example a fluorescent emission test could be applied to amyloid fibrils by using the dye Thioflavin T that binds specifically to the peptide and emits blue fluorescence when excited. Structure Dipeptides The simplest peptide building blocks are dipeptides. Nanotubes formed from dipeptides are the widest amongst peptide nanotubes. An example of a dipeptide that has been studied is such a peptide is one from the diphenylalanine motif of the Alzheimer's Œ≤-amyloid peptide. Dipeptides have also been shown to self assemble into hydrogels, another form of nanostructures, when connected to the protecting group, Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride. Experiments focusing on the dipeptide Fmoc-diphenylalaine have been conducted that have explored the mechanism in which Fmoc-diphenylalanine self assembles into hydrogels via œÄ-œÄ interlocked Œ≤-sheets. Phenylalanine has an aromatic ring, a crucial part of the molecule due to its high electron-density, which favors self-assembly and during self- assembly these rings stack which enables the assembly to occur. Lego peptides / Ionic self-complementary peptides These peptides are approximately 5 nm in size and have 16 amino acids. The class of Lego peptides has the unique characteristics of having two distinct surfaces being either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, similar to the pegs and holes of Lego blocks. The hydrophobic side promotes self-assembly in water and the hydrophilic sides has a regular arrangement of charged amino acids residues, which in turn brings about a defined pattern of ionic bonds. The arrangement of the residues can be classified according to the order of the charges; Modulus I has a charge pattern of ‚Äú+-+-+-,‚Äù modulus II ‚Äú++--++--‚Äú and modulus III ‚Äú+++---+++‚Äù and so on. The peptides self-assemble into nano fibers approximately 10 nm long in the presence of alkaline cations or an addition of peptide solution. The fibers forms ionic interactions with each other to form checkerboard like matrices, which develops into a scaffold hydrogel with a high water content of larger than 99.5- 99.9% and pores of 10-200 nm diameter. These hydrogels allows neurite outgrowth and therefore is can be used as scaffold for tissue engineering. FIGURE 2 : MOLECULAR LEGO PEPTIDES: Two distinct surfaces can be easily identified. The 'pegs-and-holes'-like pattern is regular. Surfactant peptides Surfactant‚Äìlike peptides which undergo self-assembly in water to form nanotubes and nanovesicles have been designed using natural lipids as a guide. This class of peptides has a hydrophilic head (with one or two charged amino acids such as aspartic and glutamic acids, or lysine or histidine acids) with a hydrophobic tail (with 4 or more hydrophobic amino acids such as alanine, valine or leucine). The peptide monomers are about 2-3 nm long and consist of seven or eight amino acids; the length of the peptide can be adjusted by adding or removing acids.

Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science, 2009. 14(5): p. 340-348. In water surfactant peptides undergo self assembling to form well ordered nanotubes and nanovesicles of 30‚Äì50 nm through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the packing of the hydrophobic tails in between the residues in a manner similar to micelle formation.Transmission electron microscopy examination on quick-frozen samples of surfactant peptides structures showed helical open-ended nanotubes. The samples also showed a dynamic behaviours and some vesicles ‚Äúbuds‚Äù out of the peptide nanotubes. FIGURE 5: SURFACTANT PEPTIDE V6D IN A) NANOTUBE FORM AND B) VESICLE FORM.

Molecular paint or carpet peptides This class of peptides undergoes self assembling on a surface and form monolayers just few nanometers thick. This type of molecular ‚Äúpaint‚Äù or ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù peptides are able to form cell patterns, interact with or trap other molecules onto the surface. This class of peptides consists of three segments: the head is a ligand part which has functional groups attached for recognition by other molecules or cell surface receptors; the middle segment is a ‚Äúlinker‚Äùwhich allows the head to interact at a distance away from the surface. The linker also controls the flexibility and the rigidity of the peptide structure. On the other end of the linker was a surface anchor where a chemical group on the peptide forms a covalent bond with a particular surface. FIGURE 7 : MOLECULAR PAINT/CARPET PEPTIDES. A) A MOLECULAR MODEL OF RADSC-14 PEPTIDES. THEY FORM A 5NM THICK LAYER ON SURFACES AND ALSO TRAPS SPECIFIC MOLECULES ONTO THE SURFACE.B)MOLECULAR MODELS DEMONSTRATING THE LAYERS THAT CAN BE FORMED BY MOLECULAR CARPET PEPTIDES EG6SH (LEFT) AND RADSC-14 (RIGHT). MOLECULAR ‚ÄòSWITCH‚Äô PEPTIDES This class of peptides has the unique property of being able to change their molecular structure dramatically. This property is best illustrated using an example. The DAR16-IV peptide, has 16 amino acid and forms a 5 nm Œ≤-sheet structure at ambient temperatures; a swift change in structure occurs at high temperature or a change in pH and a 2.5 nm Œ±-helix forms. Cyclic peptides Extensive research has been performed on nanotubes formed by stacking cyclic peptides with an even number of alternating D and L amino acids. These nanotubes are the narrowest formed by peptides. The stacking occurs through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the end product is cylindrical structures with the amino acid side chains of the peptide defining the properties of the outer surface of the tube and the peptide backbone determining the properties of the inner surface of the tube. Polymers can also be covalently attached to the peptides in which case a polymer shell around nanotubes can be formed. By applying peptide design, the inner diameter, which is completely uniform, can be specified; the outer surface properties can also be deliberated by peptide design and therefore these cyclic nanotubes are able to form in range of different environments. Property evaluation ‚Äì Discussion of properties (mechanical, electronic, optical, magnetic...) of the material your chosen, indicate what the major differences would be if the same material was not on the nano-scale. Nanotubes formed from dipeptides are stable under extreme conditions. Dry nanotubes do not degrade until 200 ¬∞C; nanotbes display exceptional chemical stability at a range of pH and in the presence of organic solvents.this is a marked difference from natural biological systems which are often unstable and sensitive to temperature and the chemical conditions. Indentation atomic force microscopy experiments showed that dry nanotubes on mica gives an average stiffness of 160 N/m and a high Young's modulus of 19‚Äì27 GPa. Although they are less stiff then carbon and inorganic nanotubes, with these values these nanotubes are amongst some of the stiffest known biological materials. The mechanisms which facilitates the mechanical stiffness has been suggested to be the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and rigid aromati side chains on the peptides. Surface properties For nanotubes, apart from those made by cyclic peptides, the surface properties of the inner and outer surface has not yet been successfully independently modified. Hence it presents a limitation that the inner and outer tube surfaces are identical. Molecular assembly mostly occurs through weak non-covalent bonds which includes: hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. Self- assembling peptides versus carbon nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is another type of nanomaterial which has attracted a lot of interest for its potential as being building blocks for bottom-up applications. They have excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties and can be fabricated to a wide range of nanoscale diameters, making them attractive and appropriate for the developments of electronic and mechanical devices. They demonstrate metal-like properties and are able to act as remarkable conductors. However, there are several areas where peptides has advantages over CNTs. As mentioned in the background section, one advantage that peptides has over carbon as nanosize building blocks is that they have almost limitless chemical functionality compared with the very chemical interactions that carbons can perform due to their nonreactiveness. Furthermore, CNTs exhibits strong hydrophobicity which results in a tendency to clump in aqueous solutions and therefore has limited solubility; their electrical properties are also affected by humidity, and the presence of oxygen, N2O and NH3. It is also difficult for to produce CNTs with uniform properties and this pose serious drawbacks as for commercial purposes the reproducibility of precise structural properties is a key concern. Lastly, CNTs are expensive with prices in the range of hundreds of dollars per gram, rendering most applications of them commercially unviable. Present and future applications The appeal of designer peptides is that they are structurally simple and it is uncomplicated and affordable to produce them on a large scale. Cell culturing Peptide scaffolds formed from LEGO peptides has been used extensively for 3D cell culturing as they closely resemble the porosity and the structure of extra- cellular matrices. These scaffolds have also been used in cell proliferation and differentiation into desired cell types. Experimentations with rat neurons demonstrated LEGO peptides‚Äô usefulness in cell culturing. Rat neurons that were attached to the peptides projected functional axons that followed the contour as set out by the peptide scaffolds. Biomedical applications By examining the behaviours of the molecular ‚Äòswitch‚Äô peptides more information about interactions between proteins and more significantly the pathogenesis of some protein conformational diseases can be obtained. These diseases include scrapie, kuru, Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Surfactant peptides can be used as targeting delivery systems for genes, drugs and RNAi. Research has already shown that cationic dipeptides NH2-Phe-Phe-NH2 nanovesicles, which are about 100 nm in diameter, can be absorbed into cells through endocytosis and deliver oligonucleotides into the cell; this is one example of how peptide nanostructure can in used in gene and drug delivery.It is also envisaged that water-soluble molecules and biological molecules would be able to be delivered to cells in this way. Self-assemblying LEGO peptides can form biologically compatible scaffolds for tissue repair and engineering. this area is of great potential as a large number of diseases cannot be cured by small molecule drugs; a cell-based therapy approach is needed and peptides could potentially play a huge role in this. Cyclic peptide nanotubes formed from self-assembly are able to act as ion channels, which forms pores through the cell membrane and causes cellular osmotic collapse. Peptide can be designed to preferentially form on bacterial cell membranes and thus these tubes are able to perform as antibacterial and cytotoxin agents. Molecular electronics applications Molecular ‚Äòswitches‚Äô peptides can be made into nanoswitches when an electronic component is incorporated. Metal nanocrystals can be covalently linked to the peptides to make them electronically responsive; research is currently being conducted on how to develop electronically controlled molecules and molecular ‚Äòmachines‚Äô using these molecular ‚Äòswitches‚Äô. Peptide nanofibers can also be used as growth templates for a range of inorganic materials such as silver, gold, platinum, cobalt, nickel and various semiconducting materials. Electrons transferring aromatic moieties can also be attached to the side chains of peptides to form conducting nanostructures which can able to transfer electrons in a certain direction. Metal and semiconductor binding peptides has been used for the fabrication of nanowires. Peptides self-assemble into hollow nanotubes to act as casting molds; metal ions that migrates inside the tube undergoes reduction to metallic form. The peptide ‚Äò mold‚Äô can then be enzymatically destroyed to produce metal nanowires of about 20 nm diameter. This has been done making gold nanowires and this application is especially significant in light of the fact that nanowires of this scale cannot be made by lithography. Researchers has also successfully developed multi layer nanocables with a silver core nanowire, a peptide insulation layer and a gold outer coat, This is done by reducing AgNO3 inside nanotubes, and then bounding a layer of thiol containing peptides with gold particles attached. This layer acts as a nucleation site during the next step where process of electroless deposition layers a coating of gold on the nanotubes to form metal-insulator-metal trilayer coaxial nanocables. Peptide nanotubes are able to produce nanowires of uniform size and this is particularly useful in the nanoelectric applications as electrical and magnetic properties are sensitive to size. Nanotube's exceptional mechanical strength and stability makes them excellent materials for application in this area. Nanotubes has also been used in the developments of electrochemical biosensing platforms and has proved to have great potential. Dipeptide Nanotubes deposited on graphite electrodes improved electrode sensitivity; thiol-modified nanotubes deposited on gold with a coating of enzymes improved sensitivity and reproducibility for the detection of glucose and ethanol, as well as a shortened detection time, large current density and improved stability. Nanotubes have also been successfully coated with proteins, nanocrystals, and metalloporphyrin through hydrogen bonding and these coated tubes have great potentials in the areas of chemical sensors. Designed peptides with a known structure that would self-assemble into a regular growth template would enable the self-assembly of nanoscale electronic circuits and devices. However, one issue that has yet to be resolved is the ability to control the positioning of the nanostructures. This positioning relative to substrates, to each other and to other functional component is crucial and although progress has been made in this domain, more work has to be completed before this control can be established. Miscellaneous applications Molecular carpet/paint peptides can be used in a spectrum of diverse industries. They can be used as ‚Äònano-organizers‚Äô for non-biological materials, or could be used to study cell-cell communications and behavior. It has also been found that the catalytic abilities of lipase enzyme is greatly improved when encapsulated in peptide nanotube. After incubation in nanotubes for a week, the catalytic activities of the enzyme is improved by 33% compared with free-standing lipases at room temperature; comparison at 65 ¬∞C the improvement rises to 70%. It is suggested that the enhanced ability is due to a conformational change to an enzymatically active structure. Limitations Although well ordered nanostructures have already been successfully formed from self-assembling peptides, their potential will not be fully fulfilled until useful functionality is incorporated into the structures. Moreover, so far most of the peptide structures formed are in 1 or 2-D, whereas in nature most biological structures are in 3D.Shoseyov, O., I. Levy, and SpringerLink (Online service), NanoBioTechnology bioinspired devices and materials of the future. 2008, Humana Press: Totowa, N.J. p. xi, 485 p. Critique has been made in light of the fact that there is a lack in theoretical knowledge about the self-assembling behaviours of peptides. This knowledge could prove to be very useful in facilitating rational designs and precise control of the peptide assemblies. Lastly, although an extensive amount of work is being conducted on developing self-assembling peptide related applications, issues such as commercial viability and processability has not been paid the same amount of attention.

She represents nature while Luvah represents emotions. Originally with Luvah, she joins with Albion and begets the Zoa Urizen. In her fallen aspect, she is the wandering figure known as the Shadowy Female. After the Final Judgment, she is reunited with Luvah but placed under the dominion of the restored Urizen. Character Vala represents Nature and is an Emanation of the Zoa Luvah. Through him, she is connected to the East. Her name is derived from Voluspa, which is an earth spirit from the Edda.Damon 1988 p. 428 Luvah is connected to the heart aspect of the body and Vala is what the heart loves, which is nature and vegetative based creation. Sometimes she is connected to the image of the Old Woman within Blake's Orc cycle. As such, she is related to Rahab and Enitharmon.Bloom 1993 pp. 32, 60 In the beginning, Vala joined with Albion, the Eternal Man, and he impregnated her with Urizen, the first created form. In that act, Vala was split from Luvah and Albion became fallen. Immediately after, she hid because of her disconnection with Luvah. In response, Luvah attacked Albion by giving him boils and removed Albion's ability to sense. This leads to Luvah's fall. Once fallen, he steals Urizen's chariot, and the two ride the chariot across the sky. However, this leads to the two being divided, as Luvah recognizes that Vala is become more material, and Urizen pits them against each other. This leads to Luvah's imprisonment within a furnace and his being melted down by Vala, turned into a fire, to form the material universe.Damon 1988 pp. 428‚Äì429 During these events, Urizen causes both Los and Enitharmon to fall and be separated by offering them the ability to judge and condemn Vala and Luvah.Bloom 1993 p. 84 She is recreated within Enitharmon's heart and becomes the material being known as the Shadowy Female. When she meets with Tharmas in this form, he tells her that she and her sinning caused the fall of the others. She tries to convince Urizen to restore Luvah, and is left to melancholy. He uses her to destroy Jesus who took upon the mantel of Luvah. After realizing that it was Jesus, Vala and confronts him over the matter. Urizen, in turn, becomes the Dragon found in the Book of Revelation. During the Final Judgment, Urizen lets go over his feud with Vala and Luvah, which restores him to his former glory. After Albion is regenerated, Luvah and Vala are made servants of the restored Urizen.Damon 1988 p. 429 Albion and Vala are deeply connected in Blake's myth. Originally, Albion was also with Jerusalem, but he abandons her after she claims that both Vala and Albion are too obsessed with the idea of sin. Jerusalem's fall provokes Vala to claim that she is the triumphant beauty and embraces materialism along with statements that women are dominant. Los rejects these claims and defends mankind. Although she has entered into a fallen state, from her line Jesus would be born. In the fallen state, she promotes revenge, jealousy and justice during war. When she is redeemed after the Final Judgment, she is joined with Albion as his bride. This allows for a union between mankind and the divine.Damon 1988 pp. 429‚Äì431 Appearances Vala originates in Vala, or The Four Zoas, which was originally named after her. As a secondary figure in the work, she is responsible for Albion's fall. However, she is alluded to in the early America a Prophecy in her relationship with Orc. In Blake's Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, she is transformed into a binary with Jerusalem with her representing nature and Jerusalem representing freedom. Together, they are two wives of Albion, and they originally formed one whole known as Britannia. Jerusalem is Albion's Emanation, and she is made into the wife of Jesus with Vala being Albion's.Damon 1988 pp. 428‚Äì431 Notes References * Bloom, Harold. The Visionary Company.

The book argues that the oppression of women worldwide is \\"the paramount moral challenge\\" of the present era, much as the fight against slavery was in the past. The title comes from the pithy statement of Mao Zedong \\"\\" meaning \\"women hold up half the sky\\". Overview Half the Sky focuses on prostitution, rape, education, maternal mortality, genital mutilation, micro-credit, and solutions in developing countries.  Prostitution  Prostitution is prevalent in developing countries. Kristof and Wudunn visit brothels to better understand this industry. Many girls are abducted at an early age. They might be sold by their families because they cannot afford raising them, or sold to pay off a family debt. At the brothel they will be drugged so that they give into the industry and will work all day long. This often leads to STDs and HIV. Some programs will come into the brothel undercover to provide condoms, but the sexual workers are not allowed to use them unless the customer allows it. Young girls are widely looked for by customers. They will pay extra to sleep with a virgin. Some people believe that sleeping with a virgin will clean them of any STDs they may have and infect the worker. They found that many prostitutes become so entangled in the industry that even when they are able to leave the brothel they tend to come back because they internalize that the brothel is where they belong. Some women are financially indebted to their pimps making their stay longer. During their time they also experience physical and sexual violence.  Rape  The authors point out that most rapists are people the survivor knows, sometimes even family members. The survivor's story is usually hidden from the community and when it does arise, the survivor is usually not believed. The woman will also bring \\"shame\\" to the family and this sometimes leads to her killing in order to preserve the family honor. A rape can also lead to a woman having to marry her rapist.  Maternal mortality  Due to the lack of prenatal care and few hospitals in some third world countries, many women, and sometimes their babies as well, die. Genital mutilation can also make giving birth very difficult. Women are usually expected to give birth at home which makes them even more propense to mortality.  Education  WuDunn and Kristoff make the claim that if girls were allowed to garner an education they would be able to prosper. At this point in time however, it is preferred for boys to go to school than girls because it is believed that they will actually be able to make something out of themselves. Many families have to choose between which of their kids with gain an education because uniforms and school fees might be hard to keep up with if every child goes to school. Girls might also work early on, preventing them from school. Education for girls is also shamed by communities because they fear what an educated woman can do. Some men might not even want to marry an educated woman due to the fear that they will be deemed as inferior to her.  Solutions  Along with providing a scope on issues, Kristof and WuDunn provide a series of solutions to help end the disparity between men and women in developing countries. They talk about micro-credit, lending money to women so that they can start businesses which will make them independent. They also talk about modern soap operas that portray women as independents and when seen by patriarchal husbands and affected wives can change household dynamics. Another solution is sponsored by Always, Always provides feminine care products to school girls so that they do not miss school during their menstrual cycle, which often happens because they feel ashamed. The final and probably most empowering solution is an education. Allowing girls to attend school and go beyond elementary school can truly help women advance in developing countries.  Feminist criticism  Half the Sky has come under criticism for reinforcing stereotypes surrounding women of the Global South. Using Chandra Talpade Mohanty's conceptualisation of discursive colonialism, Sophia Chong (2014) argues that WuDunn and Kristoff are de- emphasising the agency of women in the Global South, and portraying societies in which they exist as absolutely dystopic.  Media   Critics  Carolyn See, a book critic from The Washington Post, said in her review: \\"'Half the Sky' is a call to arms, a call for help, a call for contributions, but also a call for volunteers. It asks us to open our eyes to this enormous humanitarian issue. It does so with exquisitely crafted prose and sensationally interesting material....I really do think this is one of the most important books I have ever reviewed.\\"  Documentary  In October 2012, the PBS television series Independent Lens presented a documentary based on the book as a two-night special. The film follows the book's authors and celebrity advocates America Ferrera, Diane Lane, Eva Mendes, Meg Ryan, Gabrielle Union, and Olivia Wilde to a couple of developing countries: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Kenya, India, Liberia, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Vietnam. In each country, the film introduces women and girls bravely fighting to rise above very difficult circumstances. Their stories expose the blight caused by sex trafficking, forced prostitution, maternal mortality, and gender-based violence as the authors propose that micro-finance and female education can help. The six actresses travel to different countries to observe the mistreatment of women, physically and psychologically. The actresses and Kristof visited organizations that gave opportunities to women that are often overlooked and maltreated. They also met the victims of sex trafficking, child labor, sexual violence and genital mutilation. Most of these women/young girls did not obtain an education and some had been abducted from their families. Throughout the documentary it is evident how men in women's lives always have the upper-hand, whether it is shown through support from the community towards them or the corrupt legal system in these countries. This documentary shows the serious issue of violence against women‚Äôs bodies. India has the biggest trafficking problem in the world. Because of the caste system, many women are taught to accept their fate instead of protecting their value of life. Many of the girls are sold to brothels because their parents could not afford supporting them or use them to pay debts. These girls‚Äô living conditions are dreadful. Doors are locked from the outside, and the room is small, dark and dirty. They were treated as objects, raped and sexually abused by men. Diseases were transmitted to their bodies; however, they had no say to their bodies. They get HIV and AIDS because condoms are not provided and they take several clients in a single day. They also face abortion. In the book, ‚ÄúHalf the Sky‚Äù, Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl Wudunn expanded more on the brothel. Sex business seems legal in the society. ‚ÄúThe police wouldn‚Äôt listen to her. The brothel owners not only threatened to kill her, they also threatened to kidnap her two young daughters and sell them to a brothel,‚Äù states in the book (8).Kristof, Wudunn. Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide. Vintage. p.6 In the film, when Nicholas Kristof and Urmi tried to rescue the victims, they were threatened and yelled by the brothel. The police were there but did not do anything to warn the brothel, instead, they asked Nicholas Kristof and Urmi to leave. Moreover, Nicholas Kristof mentioned that the international Labour Organization estimates that at any one time there are 12.3 million people engaged in forced labor of all kinds, not just sexual servitude. One of the serious issues that was found in Somaliland is female genital mutilation. The birth attendants, in the documentary, told Kristof that once they know the practice would risk women's health and bodies, so they stop exercising it. However, they find out the truth that one of them actually cut her own daughter. Girls do not have control over their bodies. They are taught that genital mutilation is the practice for females, and when they become mothers, they do the same to their daughters. Activism and supporting organization In those nations, there are organizations to support and aid those victims. For instance, in India, many children are treated as child labor and girls are obliged to take clients at a young age. Urmi, who works with the New Light Program, encourages them to obtain education and assists them to fight for their opportunities to speak for themselves.

They became tenants of Clanricarde at Carrowsteelagh townland (Woodville) in Ballymanagh parish. They were again evicted c. 1700 and settled at Kylegarriff, Killeenadeema.

Abroad in public I had survived numerous German security checks, shielded from unpleasant developments by Nazi Labour department registration and other efficient false documents. The round-ups of Poles created an additional threat for me as well as all Poles. Whole streets were sealed off by police and soldiers and most trapped men and women were carted off to concentration camps or sent as slave labour to the Reich.

Tens of thousands of these victims were killed in mass executions, including an estimated 37,000 people at the Pawiak prison complex run by the Gestapo and thousands of others killed in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. The Nazis also held public executions of hostages. Daily lists of Poles to be executed in the event of any attack upon Nazi troopers were published. In retribution for these acts of terrorism, the Polish Underground leadership prepared lists of Nazi leaders to be eliminated for the said crimes against civilian non-combatantsStrzembosz (1983).

Because of the particular brutality of the police, the Home Army killed 361 gendarmes in 1943, and in 1944 another 584. In Warsaw alone 10 Germans were killed daily, which caused repression and revenge from the German side. From August to December 1942, the Home Army carried out 87 attacks on the German administration and members of the occupation forces. In 1943 this number grew radically.

The headquarters of Petrobr√°s in S√£o Paulo The headquarters of SAP AG in S√£o Paulo S√£o Paulo is the one of the largest citites in the world economically, and is expected to be the 6th largest in 2025. According to data of Fecomercio/SP, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 was R$699.28 billion. The biggest financial center in Brazil and one of the biggest financial centers in the world, S√£o Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, S√£o Paulo's economy has become increasingly based on the tertiary sector, focusing on services and businesses for the country. The city is also unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations. Many analysts point to S√£o Paulo as an important global city, even though this assignment can be criticized considering its serious problems of social exclusion and spatial segregation.FERREIRA, Jo√£o Sette Whitaker; The myth of the global city, presented thesis of doutorado to the FAUUSP, 2003 Although being the most important financial centre of the country, S√£o Paulo also presents a high degree of informality in its economy. S√£o Paulo is the business center of the Mercosur economy. Acclaimed as a city of business tourism, attracting today's biggest and most important international events, be they in the economic, cultural, scientific or sporting area. It holds more than 200 events per day, offering more than 250 thousand square meters of space in pavilions and areas for congresses and fairs. This is without taking into account the supply of spaces within hotels, which adds another 70 thousand square meters, suitable for holding events. According to the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) that ranks the greatest event centers in the world, S√£o Paulo is the most important destination for international events in the Americas. S√£o Paulo is also among Top 20 destinations for events in the world and left behind destinations like Madrid, Sydney, Athens and Vancouver.International Congress & Convention Association (ICCA) - S√£o Paulo Adding space in nightclubs, cultural and business areas, clubs and other alternatives to these numbers, S√£o Paulo boasts approximately 430,000 square meters for the holding of any type of event. There is still the supply of approximately 30,000 apartments of various categories, a number which is to grow significantly in the next two years, predicted to reach 50,000 apartments in 2003, catering for those seeking the more luxurious options of the large chains, to simpler and more economical options. It is worth pointing out that from the tourist attractions the following stand out: gastronomy and culture. With more than 12,000 restaurants of more than 40 different world cuisines, besides the 70 museums, more than 200 cinemas, around 50 theaters, art galleries and cultural centers, S√£o Paulo has one of the liveliest night-lives in the world. If the city of S√£o Paulo were a country, its economy would be the 47th in the world, bigger than Egypt and Kuwait, for example, about the same size as Hungary, New Zealand or Israel. The economy of the city of S√£o Paulo would also be bigger than 22 U.S. states, such as Hawaii and New Hampshire. In 2005, the city of S√£o Paulo collected R$90 billion in taxes, and the city budget was R$15 billion; these figures show that S√£o Paulo contributes to redistribution of wealth. The city has 1,500 bank branches. There are 70 shopping malls. Of all the international companies with business in Brazil, 63% have their head offices in S√£o Paulo. According to Mystery Shopping International, the Oscar Freire Street is the eighth most luxurious in the world. A connected city, always in the vanguard of the greatest cultural movements that changed Brazilian behavior and habits. In higher education, the University of S√£o Paulo (USP) is in the top 100 public universities in the world and, recently, in the annual raking of the British newspaper The Times, as the first university in South America. There is also a wide range of short courses, lectures, seminars, literary discussions and several universities and cultural centers teaching from handicraft to technology.Vanguard and Knowledge Center - S√£o Paulo City The S√£o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F; Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bonds exchange. The BM&F; Bovespa is the largest stock exchange in Latin America and third largest in the world. In the Stock Exchange, R$6 billion (US$3.5 billion) change hands every day.BM&F; Bovespa: About us If the Greater S√£o Paulo were a country would be the thirty-third richest nation in the world (in nominal GDP), ahead of the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong for example and twenty-eighth richest nation ahead of Belgium and Venezuela (in GDP PPP).PricewaterhouseCoopers, Global city GDP rankings 2008-2025 S√£o Paulo is the best city to do business in Latin America. The large growth of S√£o Paulo GDP is due to the great economic potential of the city and the appreciation of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar. The per capita income for the city was R$57,759.39 (2017). According to PricewaterhouseCoopers annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%. Manufacturing Industrial development, beginning in the late 19th century but intensifying after World War II, has transformed metropolitan S√£o Paulo into the foremost industrial centre in Latin America. The city has outgrown its status as the \\"Chicago of South America,\\" because it actually plays a greater role in Brazilian commerce and industry than any one city in the United States. The value of its industrial production is by far the largest of any Brazilian city. Its leading industries produce textiles, mechanical and electrical appliances, furniture, foodstuffs, and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Heavy metallurgical plants located in nearby Taubat√©, oil refineries and chemical plants in Cubat√£o, and plants manufacturing motor vehicles, transportation equipment, and farm machinery in Santo Andr√©, S√£o Bernardo do Campo, S√£o Caetano do Sul, and Diadema make large contributions to production. Computer industries and the manufacturing of electrical appliances are on the rise, as are automobile components. The several thousand manufacturing establishments in S√£o Paulo provide employment for more than one-tenth of the population. Finance and other services Commerce, both wholesale and retail, is well developed and spread over the city by zones according to specialty, for example, the wholesale garment district in Bom Retiro and Br√°s. Banks are concentrated in the central Tri√¢ngulo, as well as along Paulista Avenue, but maintain branches in almost every district. All but the smallest Brazilian banks also represent interests from North America and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. S√£o Paulo Stock Exchange has taken on global significance, and diversified financial services rival those of other world centres. No less important in terms of employment are street vending, peddling, and neighbourhood stores. Yet huge shopping malls have sprung up near residential neighbourhoods, and new service industries spawned by the computer age provide increased employment opportunities for the great number of graduates produced by S√£o Paulo's many universities and technical institutes. International Trade Treemap showing the market share of exports by product for the City of S√£o Paulo in 2014 generated by DataViva As of 2014, S√£o Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year S√£o Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports.

Harrison (March 23, 1880 ‚Äî 22 October 1966) ,Obituary, Variety (2 November 1966) known popularly as Pete Harrison, founded the motion picture trade journal, Harrison's Reports, which was published weekly from 1919 until 1962. Until the late 1950s, he was the publisher and chief reviewer. Early years Born as Petros Spallios in Turkey of Greek ethnicity. Working as a stoker, he jumped ship in New York in 1903. In Long Beach, California, he worked as a projectionist, and managed a nickelodeon.Sanderson Vanderbilt. \\"Iron Moulder to Cinema Critic\\", New York Herald Tribune (10 October 1937) In 1918, he became a film reviewer for Motion Picture News with a column titled Harrison's Exhibitor Reviews. Harrison's Reports In 1919, he founded Harrison's Reports which was published weekly from 5 July 1919 until 11 August 1962. Until the 1950s, he may have been its sole writer and reviewer (except for one review in 1943; see below). From beginning to end, Harrison's Reports did not accept film advertising, leaving Harrison free to discuss subjects other trade periodicals would not report. Often he would advise, \\"It is a clean picture\\", meaning no subject matter relating to sex. From his editorials, it is clear he believed \\"dirty\\" movies were bad for the movie business. He took a strong stand against the practice that later became known as \\"product placement\\" that is, brand names appearing in movies. From the late 1940s through the early 1950s, his editorials also took on a strong anti- communist stance. In the 1950s, cable TV made its first appearance, and Harrison approved efforts by theater owners to make it illegal. In the late 1950s Harrison sold control to Al Picoult, who became managing editor. Picoult also became publisher and sold the paper in June 1959 to individuals associated with exhibitor, Allied States, which the paper had been close to and supported for many years. Harrison still retained an interest. In July 1959, David Martin took over from Harrison as the new editor, with Harrison retiring. In 1962, Harrison was still publishing film reviews in a publication called Harrison‚Äôs Hollywood Reviews but ceased due to health issues. Sued for libel Harrison's editorials often discussed Will H. Hays and the Hays Office, rarely favorably. In the 31 October 1931 issue, Harrison reported that Hays Office lawyer Gabriel Hess, among others, had been indicted for criminal conspiracy in Ontario, Canada. The wording of Harrison's editorial was erroneous, and in the issue of 14 November 1931, Harrison printed a retraction/correction, including the text of the indictment as it related to Hess. The same editorial also stated that Hess had filed a libel suit against Harrison. Libel laws of that period required virtually no proof of damage to the plaintiff. In the 28 September 1935 issue, Harrison reported that Hess had been awarded $5,200 plus costs. Harrison settled the judgment for $5,000, money he did not have, but he did have enough friends who donated or loaned him the money he needed to continue in business. Brief career as screenwriter and producer In 1943, Harrison co-wrote and produced Deerslayer. The screenplay, adapted from the novel by James Fenimore Cooper, was co-written and produced by E.B. Derr. It is the only known production credit for Harrison, and the only writing credit of Derr, who produced several dozen movies from 1930 to 1943 (and none afterward). The 13 November 1943 issue of Harrison's Reports reviewed the film, which was the first review in the journal that was acknowledged not to have been written by Harrison. It was written by Harrison's friend, Abram F. Myers, a leader at exhibitor Allied States.

Russia (dark brown) was the source of 35% of total EU natural gas consumption in 2017. The Russian Federation supplies a significant volume of fossil fuels and is the largest exporter of oil, natural gas and hard coal to the European Union.\\"Russia has maintained though throughout the whole period 2007-2017 its position as the leading supplier to the EU of the main primary energy commodities ‚Äì hard coal, crude oil and natural gas\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20191019113648/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Energy_production_and_imports In 2017, energy products accounted around 60% of the EU's total imports from Russia. According to _Eurostat_ , 30% of the EU's petroleum oil imports and 39% of total gas imports came from Russia in 2017. For Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Finland, more than 75% of their imports of petroleum oils originated in Russia. The Russian state-owned company Gazprom exports natural gas to Europe. It also controls many subsidiaries, including various infrastructure assets. According to a study published by the Research Centre for East European Studies, the liberalization of the EU gas market has driven Gazprom's expansion in Europe by increasing its share in the European downstream market. It has established sale subsidiaries in many of its export markets, and has also invested in access to industrial and power generation sectors in Western and Central Europe. In addition, Gazprom has established joint ventures to build natural gas pipelines and storage depots in a number of European countries. Transneft, a Russian state-owned company responsible for the national oil pipelines, is another Russian company that supplies energy to Europe. In September 2012, the European Commission opened formal proceedings to investigate whether Gazprom was hindering competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets, in breach of EU competition law. In particular, the Commission looked into Gazprom's usage of 'no resale' clauses in supply contracts, alleged prevention of diversification of gas supplies, and imposition of unfair pricing by linking oil and gas prices in long-term contracts.European Commission, Antitrust: Commission Opens Proceedings Against Gazprom, IP/12/937 The Russian Federation responded by issuing blocking legislation, which introduced a default rule prohibiting Russian strategic firms, including Gazprom, to comply with any foreign measures or requests.Marek Martyniszyn, Legislation Blocking Antitrust Investigations and the September 2012 Russian Executive Order, 37(1) World Competition 103 (2014) Compliance is subject to prior permission granted by the Russian government. History In the early 1980s there were American efforts, led by the Reagan administration, to convince European countries, through which a proposed Soviet gas pipeline was to be built, to deny firms responsible for construction the ability to purchase supplies and parts for the pipeline and associated facilities. Ronald Reagan feared that a Kremlin- controlled European natural gas pipeline infrastructure would increase the USSR's influence not only in Eastern Europe, but also in Western Europe. For this reason, during his first term in office, he attempted ‚Äì unsuccessfully ‚Äì to stop the first natural gas pipeline from being built between the USSR and Germany. The pipeline was built despite these protests and the rise of large Russian gas firms such as Gazprom as well as increased Russian fossil fuel production has facilitated a large expansion in the quantity of gas supplied to the European market since the 1990s. Natural gas deliveries Major existing and planned natural gas pipelines supplying Russian gas to Europe In 2017, 39% of the European Union's natural gas total imports originated in Russia. As of 2009, Russian natural gas was delivered to Europe through 12 pipelines, of which three were direct pipelines (to Finland, Estonia and Latvia), four through Belarus (to Lithuania and Poland) and five through Ukraine (to Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland). In 2011, an additional pipeline, Nord Stream (directly to Germany through the Baltic Sea), opened. The largest importers of Russian gas in the European Union are Germany and Italy, accounting together for almost half of the EU's gas imports from Russia. Other larger Russian gas importers (over 5 billion cubic meter per year) in the European Union are France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and Slovakia. The largest non-EU importers of Russian natural gas are Ukraine, Turkey and Belarus. In 2013 the shares of Russian natural gas in the domestic gas consumption in EU countries were: * 100% * 100% * 100% * 100% * 100% * 97% * 83% * 72% * 66% * 63% * 62% * 57% * 46% * 34% * 18% * 5% * 1.1%  Disputes and diversification efforts  Angela Merkel criticized the United States's sanctions against Russia that target EU‚ÄìRussia energy projects.\\"Germany's Angela Merkel slams planned US sanctions on Russia\\". Deutsche Welle. 16 June 2017. On the eve of the 2006 Riga summit, Senator Richard Lugar, head of the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, declared that \\"the most likely source of armed conflict in the European theatre and the surrounding regions will be energy scarcity and manipulation.\\" Since then, the variety of national policies and stances of larger exporters versus larger dependents of Russian gas, together with the segmentation of the European gas market, has become a prominent issue in European politics toward Russia, with significant geopolitical implications for economic and political ties between the EU and Russia. These ties have occasionally led to calls for greater European energy diversity, although such efforts are complicated by the fact that many European customers have long term legal contracts for gas deliveries despite the disputes, most of which stretch beyond 2025‚Äì2030. The EU's failure to successfully advance a common energy policy can be further exemplified by the building of the Nord Stream pipeline, which embodies the divisions between the center and the periphery of the EU‚Äîbetween Old and New Europe. Natural gas presented as an instrument of Russian state power A number of disputes over the natural gas prices in which Russia was using pipeline shutdowns in what was described as \\"tool for intimidation and blackmail\\" caused the European Union to significantly increase efforts to diversify its energy sources. Some have even argued that Russia has developed \\"the capacity to use unilateral economic sanctions in the form of gas pricing and gas disruptions against many European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states\\". During an anti-trust investigation initiated in 2011 against Gazprom, a number of internal company documents were seized that documented a number of \\"abusive practices\\" in an attempt to \\"segment the internal [EU] market along national borders\\" and impose \\"unfair pricing\\". The planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany was opposed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, U.S. President Donald Trump and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. In 2017, Germany, France, Austria and European Commission criticized the United States over new sanctions against Russia that target Nord Stream 2.\\"Germany threatens retaliation if U.S. sanctions harm its firms\\". Reuters. 16 June 2017.\\"The U.S. Sanctions Russia, Europe Says 'Ouch!'\\". Bloomberg. 16 June 2017. The United States has been encouraging European countries to diversify Russian-dominated energy supplies, with Qatar as possible alternative supplier. To compare with alternative sources, Germany produced 10.5% of its electricity from fossil natural gas in 2019 and 8.6% (44 TWh) from renewable biomass, largely biogas.Der deutsche Strommix: Stromerzeugung in Deutschland https://strom-report.de/strom/ Retrieved 7 September 2020 As only 13% of Germany's gas use was for power production,Anteil der Verbrauchergruppen am Erdgasabsatz in Deutschland in den Jahren 2009 und 2019 https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37985/umfrage/verbrauch-von- erdgas-in-deutschland-nach-abnehmergruppen-2009/ Retrieved 7 September 2020 this replaced just above 1 percent of its overall gas consumption. Replacing natural gas with gas produced with Renewable energy in Power-to-gas processes or by direct use of power has more potential for further expansion. Power-to- gas is as yet limited to small-scale demonstration projects, as the carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of natural gas can be emitted cheaply or for free, and Russia does not take back carbon dioxide from the combustion of Russian gas for underground storage in its depleted gas reservoirs. In January 2020 Russia halted oil deliveries to Belarus over another price dispute.  Nuclear fuel supplies  Ukraine has been traditionally sourcing fuel for its nuclear power plants from Russia, although with the outbreak of Russian military intervention in Donbass it saw an urgent need to at least diversify supplies of fuel and started talks with a number of Western suppliers, most notably Westinghouse branch in Sweden. In response, Russia started an intimidation campaign which included supplying deliberately incorrect technical specifications of the existing fuel supplies, alluding to \\"second Chernobyl\\" and staging protests in Kyiv. In spite of these efforts, Ukraine secured a number of framework contracts with numerous suppliers, eventually supplying 50% of the fuel from Russia and 50% from Sweden.

Degrees and Programs The division offers two primary degree programs: a BA and a PhD in Media Arts + Practice. The PhD program, better known as iMAP, began accepting students in 2007. It is a practice-based PhD program in which students develop skills in both the theory and practice of media arts while doing doctoral level research that may be realized in an exclusively digital form. The degree was conceived by Anne Friedberg and Jen Stein with help from the program's founding director Steve F. Anderson. Other advisory faculty members include Holly Willis, Scott Fisher, Kathy Smith, Mary Sweeney, Tara McPherson, Mark Bolas, Aniko Imre, Henry Jenkins, Andreas Kratky and Norman Hollyn. The BA in Media Arts + Practice, which began accepting students in 2013, is \\"an interdisciplinary storytelling program combining the study of contemporary digital media with hands-on production and research.\\" Students learn to create media across several different platforms, such as video or interactive programming, while also studying the history and theory of media. The curriculum emphasizes the use of emerging technologies (such as virtual reality) to develop new narrative models. There is also an emphasis on media activism and social change. The division also offers three undergraduate minors (Digital Studies, Future Cinema and Media and Social Change), an undergraduate honors designation (Honors in Multimedia Scholarship), and a graduate certificate program (Digital Media and Culture). Research MA+P faculty and students actively participate in several arts-based research projects. Arts-based research is a practice by which artists and creative practitioners use their practical skillset as a method of developing original research questions and thereby contributing to the process of knowledge production. Arts-based research is unique in that it is not predetermined by desired end results; it borrows and combines many different research methodologies; and it often involves collaboration with professionals from other art and non-art fields. Research labs at the USC School of Cinematic Arts include the Creative Media and Behavioral Health Center, the Game Innovation Lab, the Mobile and Environmental Media Lab, the Mixed Reality Lab, the Scalar Lab, the Transient Media Lab and the World Building Media Lab.

The two primary colours used are blue and gold, with blue representing the sea and the Brisbane River which flows through the city, and gold representing the sun and the city's warm climate. Symbols on the flag The white, wavy lines in three of the six quarters of the flag may represent the river, which brought much commerce and prosperity to the city in the early days of British settlement. An alternative explanation is that the wavy lines represent white clouds, parting to allow the blue sky to be seen behind them. The three caducei in these sections, rather than their popular but erroneous association with medicine, again represent commerce, referencing the role of Hermes in Greek mythology in his capacity as the protector of commerce and trade. The remaining three quarters depict two pretzel knots and a star, with the stars representing the achievements in astronomy of Sir Thomas Brisbane, for whom the city is named, and the knots representing the 38th Foot (Staffordshire Regiment), which Brisbane served in prior to being named governor of the colony of New South Wales. The abundance of maritime symbols on the flag reflects Brisbane's early role as a river port. Usage The flag is flown daily outside of Brisbane City Hall, and is also prominently displayed both inside the main city hall, as well as in other council offices throughout the city. A giant image of the flag was also projected onto the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane as a part of Queensland's 150th anniversary celebrations.

Perhaps M√ºller's best-known work, the story portrays four young people living in a totalitarian police state in Communist Romania, ending with their emigration to Germany. The narrator is an unidentified young woman belonging to the ethnic German minority. M√ºller said the novel was written \\"in memory of my Romanian friends who were killed under the Ceau≈üescu regime\\". Like many of M√ºller's books, The Land of Green Plums illustrates the position of dissidents from the German minority in Romania, who suffered a double oppression under the regime of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. The rural German- speaking community tries to preserve its culture by enforcing traditional rules; once the main characters escape this environment through university study in the city, they suffer, as political dissidents, the oppression exercised by the totalitarian regime. Those who flee the country for Germany become cultural outcasts: they are not considered German there but rather Eastern Europeans. Critics read the novel as testifying to abuse and the ensuing trauma. Normal human relationships are rendered impossible by the lack of freedom of expression; the threat of violence, imprisonment, and execution; and the possibility that any personal friend may be a traitor. Written in a paratactic style, full of flashbacks and time shifts, the language of the book reflects trauma and political oppression. After its publication in German and its translation into Dutch, the novel received moderate attention. It gained an international audience when the English translation by Michael Hofmann was published in 1996. In 1998 this translation won the International Dublin Literary Award, the largest prize given for a single work of fiction published in English. Following the announcement that M√ºller was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, The Land of Green Plums entered the bestseller list on Amazon.com. Plot The first character introduced to the reader is a girl named Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts to escape from the totalitarian world of school and society. She rides the buses at night and has brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase. Having supposedly committed suicide and thus betrayed her country and her party, Lola is publicly denounced in a school ceremony. Soon after, the narrator shares Lola's diary with three male friends, Edgar, Georg, and Kurt; Lola's life becomes an escape for them as they attend college and engage in mildly subversive activities‚Äî\\"harbouring unsuitable German books, humming scraps of banned songs, writing to one another in crude code, taking photographs of the blacked-out buses which carry prisoners between the prison and the construction sites.\\" The four are from German-speaking communities; all receive mail from their mothers complaining about their various illnesses and how their children's subversiveness is causing them trouble; all have fathers who had been members of the Nazi SS in Romania during World War II. They hide the diary and other documents, including photographs and books, in the well of a deserted summerhouse in town. Very quickly it becomes clear that an officer of the Securitate, Captain Pjele, is interested in the four; he begins to subject them to regular interrogations. Their possessions are searched, their mail opened, and they are threatened by the captain and his dog. After graduation the four go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, although their letters are read by the Securitate. They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance; and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as it becomes clear that she is acting partly on Pjele's orders. The lives of all five become more miserable, and each conforms to the regime's demands even as they lose their jobs for apparently political reasons. They discuss fleeing the country, and Georg is the first to do so. Weeks after he arrives in Germany, he is found dead from a fall from the window of a Frankfurt hotel. The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, but continue to receive death threats after emigrating. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working; he is later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: \\"When we don't speak, said Edgar, we become unbearable, and when we do, we make fools of ourselves\\". Characters The narrator, Edgar, Georg, and Kurt hail from similar backgrounds. All are German Romanian and students at the same university. They all suffer persecution, and oppose the regime. The characters‚Äîespecially Edgar, Georg, and Kurt‚Äîare quite deliberately not developed in great detail, as noted by critics. \\"Characterization is not the point here. M√ºller is primarily a poet\\", and this poetic interest likewise is said to explain the lack of chapter organization and of transitional phrases. Only two of the six main characters who suffer oppression survive at the end of the book: Lola dies by hanging, Georg commits suicide after fleeing to Germany, Kurt is found hanged, and Tereza, the narrator's friend who betrays her to the Securitate, dies of cancer. Genre Herta M√ºller, 2007 Autobiography The novel is partly autobiographical. Like her narrator, M√ºller comes from the German-speaking minority in Romania, the Banat Swabians, with a father who had been former SS man during World War II. Trained as a teacher, she lost her position after refusing to cooperate with the Securitate. She emigrated to Germany in 1987. In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in The Land of Green Plums: \\"That [recognition of characters] was already the case in my previous book [The Land of the Green Plums]. Because my best girlfriend died young, and because she had betrayed me, and because I had to despise her and could not stop loving her.\\" In an earlier interview with the Danish newspaper Politiken, M√ºlller went into greater detail about her friend, portrayed as Tereza in this novel: Allegory The novel approaches allegory in many of its details, such as the green plums of the title. Mothers warn their children not to eat green, unripe plums, claiming that they are poisonous. Yet the novel regularly depicts police officers gorging themselves on the fruit: \\"The officers' lack of constraint in engulfing the fruit parallels the remorseless persecution of the human race\\" under Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. The green plums also suggest childhood, or regression into childhood: \\"The narrator watches the Romanian police guards in the streets of the city as they greedily pocket green plums ... 'They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality.\\" Language and style Critics have recognized M√ºller's writing as political, \\"as a form of manifest resistance against totalitarian claims to power,\\" and have studied her \\"complex and ambiguous imagery.\\" According to Larry Wolff, reviewing the book for The New York Times, the poetic quality of the language is essentially connected to its author's objective: \\"the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania.\\" Critics have generally shown appreciation for the novel's language, as did Nicholas Lezard, writing in The Guardian: > The prose, while simple at the level of the sentence (and we can safely > assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is > shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what > exactly is going on ‚Äì a deliberate flight from causation, quite > understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has > been driven mad by fear. Though the novel's language, and M√ºller's language in general, is praised for its precision--Peter Englund, secretary of the Swedish Academy, noted her \\"extreme precision with words\\"‚Äîmany things are left unsaid. As a reviewer for The Australian noted, the narrator is never named, the words \\"totalitarian\\" and \\"liberty\\" never appear in the book, and even Ceausescu, usually referred to as the \\"dictator,\\" is named only twice, first when one of the characters (a Jewish WWII survivor) notes how the greeting \\"ciao\\" is also the first syllable of the dictator's name, and again when a comparison is made between Ceausescu, Hitler, and Stalin. Themes Trauma Psychological trauma caused by fear permeates the novel: \\"Fear, isolation, and abandonment characterize the lives of the first-person narrator and her three friends....M√ºller describes how fear acquires a life of its own; it becomes independent of the subject's will.\\" One critic argues that \\"Herztier was written in response to the trauma of life under the Ceau≈üescu dictatorship, when the citizens of Romania lived in constant fear of the secret police or Securitate.\\" As M√ºller said in an interview, this fear in the novel is autobiographical as well. According to Beverley Driver Eddy, The Land of Green Plums presents trauma as well as its testimony; the narrator gives her own testimony, and relates it to the testimony of her friends' suffering. The first of these is Lola, the friend who supposedly kills herself; her testimony is preserved in her diary, in which she wrote of her animalistic sexual exploits with nameless men and her struggle to cope with the guilt of having joined the Communist Party in an effort to better herself. For the narrator, preserving Lola's notebook (and sharing it with her three friends) becomes of paramount importance, especially since the memory of Lola was erased days after her death by the Party establishment. Additional complexity comes from Lola's testimony being interwoven in the narrator's own‚Äî\\"a testimony within a testimony.\\" In an interview published in 1998, M√ºller said that \\"she is concerned with showing that the childhood experiences have been internalised by the narrator, and that the traumas of the frightened, non-conformist child are replicated to the larger traumas of the adult dissident.\\" In the image of the weeds cut down by the narrator's father, an image presented early in the novel, the parallel between the father and the dictator is evidenced: \\"both 'make cemeteries' without fear of retribution.\\" One symptom of the trauma this causes in its victims is disconnection, the strain of friendship resulting from lack of trust, disrupting normal human relationships for the remainder of the victim's life. M√ºller's novel portrays this disconnection and the ongoing trauma for survivors, even after the fall of the dictatorship. Other critics have focused on different effects of trauma in the novel and in M√ºller's work in general. Lyn Marven argues that the M√ºller's poetics and style, characterized by paratactic as well as syntactic and narrative gaps, illustrates one of the effects of trauma: > \\"Trauma disrupts the structures of memory....Trauma cannot be integrated > into narrative memory and exists only as a gap or blank spot; it therefore > cannot be articulated, and returns in the form of surprisingly literal > flashbacks, hallucinations, or dreams.\\" Marven notes another effect: a \\"distorted body image\\" that often gives rise to a \\"radical metonymy,\\" a fragmentation, surfacing most notably in a scene where Pjele, during an interrogation, lists the narrator's clothes and possessions, to which the narrator responds by listing her own body parts: \\"1 pr. eyes, 1 pr. ears, 1 nose, 1 pr. lips, 1 neck.\\" Marven notes that M√ºller's collages, which the critic says are \\"central to M√ºller's ≈ìuvre,\\" show the same fragmentation, and says that her \\"increasingly readable\\" prose, coupled with recent collages moving toward narrative, might suggest that there is \\"a possibility of overcoming trauma.\\"(Grazziella Predoui also noted that M√ºller's prose is developing from parataxis toward more complicated syntax.) Banat- Swabians The situation of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is a recurring theme in M√ºller's writing. Historically, Germans were recruited by the Austria-Hungary to repopulate southern areas following the expulsion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. They were given special privileges, allowed to keep their language and Roman Catholicism, even in areas in which the Orthodox Church was paramount. Their communities spoke German into the 20th century. They were among ethnic Germans, or Volksdeutsche, whom Adolph Hitler proposed to unite in a greater Germany. Millions of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe after the war; thousands were forced into labor camps. Even years later, they were often discriminated against in Romania under the communist government. By the late 20th century, their status is one of the central themes of The Land of Green Plums; this idea is explored in detail in Valentina Glajar's 1997 article \\"Banat-Swabian, Romanian, and German: Conflicting Identities in Herta M√ºller's Herztier.\\" The Banat-Swabian community, of which the narrator is a member, was described by M√ºller as extremely ethnocentric. Following persecution after the war, while remaining survivors had no desire to emigrate to Germany, they exerted an almost totalitarian control, especially on their children to keep them within their community. M√ºller had already addressed this topic in her first work, Niederungen, translated as Nadirs in English, in which the German community holds on to its language and habits in an attempt to deny the Romanian dictatorship that rules them. One critic characterized this communal attempt in Niederungen as a \\"mechanistically followed tradition\\". According to Glajar, this is the world of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her daughter emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father was a member of the SS (as were M√ºller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timi»ôoara, where the main characters attend college‚Äîbetween German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt. Critical reception Academic interest The book attracted academic interest, and scholars discussed it in at least three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; Reviewed in trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow up under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. M√ºller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe. Attention in the press In the German press, the novel's publication generated modest but positive attention. Rolf Michaelis reviewed the novel at length in Die Zeit in October 1994, analyzing the function of fear and praising the book as a \\"poetic epic\\", comparing transitions and structure to those found in Homer. \\"Herta M√ºller\\", he wrote, \\"does not simply use the German language; she makes it her own, in an incomparable way. She invents her own language.\\" A favorable review of the Dutch translation appeared in the national daily newspaper Trouw in 1996. The English translation was likewise favorably reviewed: a review in The San Diego Union- Tribune said \\"this heartbreaking tale is bitter and dark, yet beautiful\\". Larry Wolff, in his review for The New York Times, described the book as \\"a novel of graphically observed detail in which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania\\". Radio Free Europe reported that the novel is a favorite of Mohammad- Ali Abtahi, the Iranian pro-democracy activist, who read it (in the Persian translation by Gholamhossein Mirza-Saleh) shortly after being released from prison in 2009. Awards International Dublin Literary Award *The novel and its English translation won the 1998 International Dublin Literary Award; M√ºller received ¬£75,000, and translator Michael Hofmann ¬£25,000. In its comments, the jury remarked on the main themes of the novel‚Äîpolitics, language, and allegory, saying: The International Dublin Literary Award drew attention to the novel, and by the end of the year, it had been published in paperback in the US by Hydra Books/Northwestern University Press. 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature In 2009, Herta M√ºller won the Nobel Prize in Literature. During the presentation ceremony, Anders Olsson, member of the Swedish Academy, referred to The Land of Green Plums as \\"a masterful account of the flight of a group of youths from the terror regime\\". Immediately following the announcement, sales of this and M√ºller's other novels (five had been translated into English by thenThe German Handelsblatt reported on the media coverage in the United States and cited the article by Rich and Kulich in The New York Times, but says four, not five novels were translated into English. ) skyrocketed: \\"On Thursday morning, when the award was announced, The Land of Green Plums, by all accounts M√ºller's best book, was No. 56,359 on Amazon.com; by the close of business that day, it was No. 7\\". Publication history The Land of Green Plums is the second novel published by M√ºller since leaving Romania, after Der Fuchs war damals schon der J√§ger (1992). It appeared in German in 1994, followed by the English translation in 1996. The hardback was published in the United States by Metropolitan Books in November 1996. A Dutch translation was published in 1996. Although French-language Swiss media had shown interest in the author, the novel had not been translated into French by 1998as evidenced by an interview with Le Temps in 1998, which was reprinted in Courrier International. After the IMPAC award, paperback editions of Hoffman's translation were published in the United Kingdom by Granta later that year and again in September 1999 (with new cover art.) It was published in the United States by Northwestern University Press in November 1998. In November 2010, after M√ºller had won the Nobel Prize for Literature, a paperback was released in the United Kingdom and the United States by Picador.

Some of her early works were published under the name Ir√®ne Wieniawska. She married Sir Aubrey Dean Paul, 5th Baronet (1869‚Äì1961), becoming Lady Dean Paul. Her name appears in a number of forms: * R√©gine Wieniawski * Ir√®ne Wieniawska * Irene Regina Wieniawski or Wieniawska * Lady Dean Paul * Lady Irene Dean Paul * Lady Irene Poldowski Paul * (Madame) Poldowski, Poldowsky or Poldowska. Biography R√©gine Wieniawski was born on 16 May 1879 in Ixelles, Brussels, where her father, the Polish virtuoso violinist and composer Henryk Wieniawski, had earlier settled on his appointment as a professor of the Brussels Conservatory. Her mother was an Englishwoman, Isabelle Bessie Wieniawski (n√©e Hampton), the niece of Irish pianist and composer George Alexander Osborne (who studied under Johann Peter Pixis, Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis and Friedrich Kalkbrenner and was a close friend of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Hector Berlioz) and a member of a London family that had had associations with Rossini, Meyerbeer, Jenny Lind, Michael William Balfe and Anton Rubinstein. She was named R√©gine after her paternal grandmother Regina Wolff. It is sometimes stated that R√©gine was born a few weeks after the death of her father. However, this seems to be an error caused by some earlier sources stating she was born in May 1880 rather than May 1879; her father died on 31 March 1880, in Moscow, while on a concert tour, when Irene was ten months old. Her musical studies are also disputed. She initially studied piano with a Miss Ellis. She told her official biographers that she entered the Brussels Conservatoire at age 12, studying piano with Pierre Storck and composition with Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert. Later she continued her studies in London with Michael Hambourg and Percy Pitt. After her marriage she returned to Paris to study with Andr√© Gedalge, and after her first child died she studied under Vincent d'Indy at the Schola Cantorum de Paris. However, some of the above is contradicted by the fact that her name does not appear in any records of the Brussels Conservatory. In 1887, aged eight, she was introduced to and befriended by Nellie Melba, then making her debut at La Monnaie. In 1893, aged 14, she publicly performed some of her own compositions. She was a neighbour of Octave Maus and her songs Cort√®ge and Cyth√®re were dedicated to Maus and his wife Madeleine. In 1896, R√©gine Wieniawski and her mother moved to London. There she published some early works under the name Ir√®ne Wieniawska. In 1901, she married a descendant of the 1st Duke of Marlborough, Sir Aubrey Edward Henry Dean Paul, 5th Bt (19 October 1869 ‚Äì 16 January 1961) to whom she had been introduced by Nellie Melba. She thus became Lady Dean Paul, and adopted British nationality, but continued to publish works as \\"Ir√®ne Wieniawska\\" They had three children: * Aubrey Donald Fitzwarren Severin Dean Paul (1902‚Äì04) * Sir Brian Kenneth \\"Napper\\" Dean Paul, 6th Bt. (1904‚Äì72; an amateur muralist and opium taker, whose portrait was painted by Lucian Freud) * Brenda Irene Isabelle Dean Paul (1907‚Äì59; she became a well-known actress and \\"society drug addict\\" who was frequently arrested on charges of possession. She spent time in Holloway Prison. She died of a drug overdose in her flat. The early death of Lady Dean Paul's first-born son devastated her and ultimately led to the break-up of her marriage. It inspired three works, the songs Soir and Berceuse d'Armorique, and the violin-piano piece Berceuse pour l'enfant mourant. She then adopted the pseudonym Poldowski.It is stated in some sources that R√©gine Wieniawski had an earlier marriage to a \\"Theodore Presser Poldowski\\", from whom she derived her professional name; but this is not supported in more reliable sources. Gervase Elwes introduced her Paul Verlaine songs to the English concert stage in 1912 at the Queen's Hall. These songs then had a great vogue in Paris and this performance made a deep impression. He had been impressed with her music ever since he had first encountered it almost 20 years earlier, in 1893 in Brussels. He felt they showed \\"great originality and for her age, great finish\\". Elwes encountered her again in 1903, in Brussels, and she dedicated two of her songs to him. A concert of her songs she was to have given in the United States with Gervase Elwes in 1921 had to be cancelled when he was killed in a rail accident in Boston. She moved to Brussels in the spring of 1912 after Queen Elizabeth of Belgium had expressed a desire to hear her. She accompanied √âmile Chaumont in the premiere of her Violin Sonata in D minor, which was dedicated to Octave Maus, and was then performed in Paris by her close friend, the French pianist Lazare L√©vy, whom she had met in Miss Ellis's class. L√©vy premiered her piano solo piece Caledonian Market, in 1923. In January 1912 her friend Henry Wood conducted the premieres of her Suite miniature and Nocturnes at the Sunday Concerts. In 1913 she returned to Brussels for the last time to accompany Jane Bathori-Engel in four of her Verlaine settings. She and her family converted to Roman Catholicism in 1916. In 1919, at the Queen's Hall, Henry Wood accompanied Poldowski at the premiere of her piano and orchestra piece, \\"Pat Malone's Wake\\". She fell seriously ill in the autumn of 1913. In August 1919 Poldowski moved to the United States, where her \\"symphonic opera\\" Silence was published despite serious financial issues. She legally separated from her husband in 1921. She returned to London in 1922; her regular visitors included playwright Alfred Sutro, mezzo-soprano Marguerite d'Alvarez, conductor Eug√®ne Goossens, fils, harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, violinist Paul Kochanski and composer George Gershwin. Her 1923 series of midday recitals at the Hyde Park Hotel, known as The International Concerts of La Libre Esth√©tique, attracted Arthur Rubinstein, Jacques Thibaud and the London String Quartet. She also opened a fashionable haute couture boutique where she produced several creations for the British Royal Family. On a 1925 tour of Spain, she was given a gift of a diamond bracelet by the King and Queen of Spain. Death She later became seriously ill with pneumonia, her right lung was removed, and she died of a heart attack on 28 January 1932, in London, aged 52. Music Poldowski was a gifted composer of songs, and her style shows strong influences of Claude Debussy. She set 22 French texts of Paul Verlaine, as well as English texts by William Blake, W. B. Yeats, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and others. Discography Texts by Paul Verlaine * Trois m√©lodies sur des po√©sies de Paul Verlaine ** 1. Dimanches d'avril ** 2. Bruxelles ** 3.

During World War II he was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Early life On 30 April 1895, Otto Paul Wilhelm H√∂hne was born in Woinowitz near Ratibor, Upper Silesia (Oberschlesien), in present-day Poland.Franks et al 1993, p. 131. World War I aviation career H√∂hne initially flew with Kampfeinsitzerkommando (Combat Single-Seater Command) Nord, before moving on for a brief posting to Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 1 in early August 1916. On 27 August, he became one of the original pilots in the newly formed original fighter squadrons. He was assigned to Jagdstaffel 2 serving under Oswald Boelcke when he downed a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b from 11 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps on 16 September 1916, scoring the first victory for the Albatros D.1 and sending both men in the FE.2 crew into captivity. Six days later, H√∂hne shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12 over Combles. A month later, on 25 October, at ten minutes to noon, it was the turn of a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2d. On 3 November, H√∂hne shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2c over H√©buterne. Six days later, on 9 November 1916, he shot down Canadian ace Alan Duncan Bell-Irving's Nieuport 17 fighter to become an ace. He would score one more time, eight days later. H√∂hne was himself wounded in action on 10 January 1917. After spending most of 1917 in hospital, he later returned as commander of Jasta 2 in early 1918. He served in that capacity for one month, flying the Fokker Dr.1 triplane, before stepping aside as seeing himself still not sufficiently recovered to lead the squadron.Hohne, Joachim, Glory Refused: The Memoirs of a Teenage Rocket Pilot of the Third Reich Between the World Wars H√∂hne served in several Freikorps units in Silesia in the early 1920s, returning to flying service first with the DLV, then with the reformed Luftwaffe as a Major in 1935, with Kampfgruppe 254. As a squadron commander with Kampfgruppe 54, he briefly flew with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War, and took part in the Luftwaffe's show of force during the annexation of Czechoslovakia. Hohne, Joachim: Glory Refused: Memoirs of a Teenage Rocket Pilot of the Third Reich. World War II H√∂hne returned to service during World War II, serving in the Luftwaffe and rising to Major General. As lieutenant colonel in KG 54, he led one of the two bomber columns during the Rotterdam Blitz, but managed to abort the attack of his column at the last minute, because he had realized that the Dutch defenders had capitulated.Jacobsen, H.

He also commanded a wing of KG 54 during the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Poland, and the battles over France. He was again badly injured as a passenger in the crash of a Heinkel 111 on 15 August 1941 and subsequently served as Generalmajor and commanding officer of the flight combat school in F√ºrstenfeldbruck (Bavaria). His son, Joachim H√∂hne, served in the Luftwaffe as well, first as a Flak gunner and then as an ME163 Komet pilot with JG 400.Hohne, Joachim, Glory Refused: The Memoirs of a Teenage Rocket Pilot of the Third Reich References Citations Bibliography * Franks, Norman; Bailey, Frank W.; Guest, Russell.

It was produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, and its showrunners were Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. The first season introduces a Federal Bureau of Investigation \\"Fringe Division\\" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses unorthodox \\"fringe\\" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. FBI agent Olivia Dunham is portrayed by actress Anna Torv, while actors Joshua Jackson and John Noble play father-son duo Peter and Walter Bishop. Other regular cast members include Lance Reddick, Jasika Nicole, Blair Brown, Mark Valley, and Kirk Acevedo. The season was supposed to contain 21 episodes, although only 20 of them aired as part of the first season. The unaired episode, \\"Unearthed,\\" was aired a few days before episode 12 of season 2 entitled \\"Johari Window\\" as a special episode.

As part of her investigation, she finds she needs the knowledge and experience of Walter Bishop, currently institutionalized in a mental hospital. Olivia blackmails Walter's estranged son, Peter, to be Walter's legal guardian, allowing his release from the institution. Olivia finds that Walter's knowledge in the area of fringe science to be critical for her job, and convinces Peter to remain as Walter's guardian; Peter, initially resentful due to events in his childhood, starts to participate directly in the cases, his abilities as a jack-of-all-trades being a benefit to both Walter's scientific needs and Olivia's investigations. Walter himself struggles with life outside the institution, plagued by a secret from his past and often resorting to recreational drugs. Olivia comes to discover that Massive Dynamic, a company that Walter used to be a part of, is connected with several of the Fringe cases. The Fringe team starts to learn of a bio-terrorist group known as ZFT (in German, Zerst√∂rung durch Fortschritte der Technologie, translated as \\"Destruction by Advancement of Technology\\"), which seem to be after several of Walter's old experiments. In one case, a group of men led by Mitchell Loeb have recreated Walter's technology used to pass through solid matter to steal several components of a device constructed by Walter from banks. With the assembled device, Loeb's team is able to teleport David Robert Jones, a former Massive Dynamics employee and leader of the ZFT, out of a high security prison. Jones attempts to sway Olivia to his side as a \\"soldier\\" in an upcoming \\"war,\\" making her aware that she, as a child, was part of a test run by Walter and his partner William Bell of the nootropic drug, Cortexiphan, that gave her psychokinetic powers. Olivia refuses, disbelieving his claim but realizing that evidence to support it appears true. Meanwhile, the Observer meets with Walter and takes him to Walter's old beach house, where he finds a device he once made that can close a portal to a parallel universe. Tracking Jones, Olivia finds that all of the Fringe events have formed a spiral, centering on Reiden Lake in New York, and she, Peter, and Walter are able to prevent Jones from crossing over to a parallel universe using the device that Walter found, killing Jones in the process. Later Walter is seen at a cemetery where he mourns over a grave labeled \\"Peter Bishop.\\" Olivia tries to get answers from Nina Sharp on Jones' motive, but she only directs her to a meeting with Bell. Olivia, while en route to the meeting, finds herself in the parallel universe, in the World Trade Center office of William Bell.  Episodes  Development Co- creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci began the brainstorming process for Fringe in the spring of 2008. They avoided emulating Abrams' other show, Lost, because they believed its mysteries made it difficult to attract new viewers. Instead, the co-creators studied crime procedurals, such as the American series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and the franchise Law & Order, in an attempt to merge that genre with a more mythology-based show without creating only standalone episodes. Orci explained, \\"We studied procedurals specifically to try and merge the two. Very against our instincts to do that, but when nine of the top TV shows are called Law & Order and CSI, you have to study them a little bit and figure out what it is that they're doing.\\" Abrams has also listed the science fiction television series The Twilight Zone, Altered States, and The X-Files as well as the 1979 film Alien as inspirations for Fringe. Jeff Pinkner, an executive producer on two of Abrams' other television series Lost and Alias, was hired to serve as showrunner and executive producer for Fringe. He described Fringe as being concerned with \\"primal fear\\", as \\"our bodies and our minds are, at the end of the day, unknowable. The ways our bodies betray us can be terrifying.\\" Critics as well as those involved in the show's production have acknowledged that Fringe had a rocky beginning. Abrams later noted, \\"It's going to sound weird, but a show starts talking to you and telling you what it wants to be. It took us a while to hear it.\\" The series struggled early on, as the first ten episodes had continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. Actor Lance Reddick noted \\"It was a constant struggle. It just didn't feel like a signature [J.J. Abrams] show ‚Äî not yet.\\" Pinkner has also acknowledged that early episodes were often too neatly wrapped and solved. \\"We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of‚Äîthe tease would be fantastic. And then we would too quickly answer it and [reduce] the tension,\\" he said. \\"And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise\\" questions that don't get answered right away. The writers began to focus more attention on the series' mythology when Akiva Goldsman temporarily joined Fringe to write and direct a mid-season episode, \\"Bad Dreams.\\" Believing \\"this is the stuff fans want to know\\", he and Bryan Burk were able to convince the other series writers to begin revealing the concept of parallel universes, despite the writers' initial intention to merely tease the idea of two worlds over two seasons. They also attempted to make Olivia's personal life more relatable by ending her storyline with John Scott and giving her a sister and niece. Abrams noted that Olivia was evolving from a \\"guarded, protective woman\\" who did not have strong relationships with others to someone more vulnerable; the presence of Olivia's sister, he noted, helped give the character \\"at least opportunities to be warmer to someone.\\" By the middle of the season, critics and regular viewers noted Fringe had started to improve. Kevin Reilly observed around this time, \\"I was looking for evidence that it was becoming their favorite show. And it was during the back half of the season that people started to say, 'This is now appointment television for me.\\" Reception Ratings Fringe finished its first season with an average of 8.8 million viewers per episode, making it the most watched new series for the 18‚Äì49 demographic. In Canada on CTV, Fringes first season had an episode average of 1.3 million viewers and finished in 19th place. Reviews Metacritic, a film review aggregate website, gave the first season 67/100 based upon 25 critical reviews, indicating a \\"generally favorable\\" reception. While the series was perceived to have a shaky start, the season finale aired to general fan acclaim. Home video releases The first season of Fringe was released on DVD and Blu-ray in region 1 on September 8, 2009, in region 2 on September 28, 2009 and in region 4 on September 30, 2009.

He served as principal of Visva-Bharati's Music school, Sangit Bhavana for its opening years.Dinendranath Tagore Visva-Bharati University website. He was the first person who introduced the songs of Tagore as the name of Rabindra Sangeet. Dinendranath was son of Dwijendranath Tagore's eldest son Dwipendranath, and was born into the culturally rich environment of the Jorasanko Thakur Bari of the Tagore family. He was particularly well- trained in Hindustani classical music, and many early Rabindra Sangeet renderings in his baritone voice can be found in archives and recordings. For recording the melodies, he primarily used the sargam notation newly formalised by Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, but he was equally well versed in the Western staff notation. Many Ashramites and contemporaries recall that whenever a particularly haunting note was thought by Rabindranath, he always looked around for Dinu to have it noted. Perhaps for this reason, he was affectionately and respectfully called \\"Amar gaaner bhandari\\" [the keeper of my songs] by Rabindranath himself. Dinendranath could play a number of Eastern and Western musical instruments also, notable being the esraj and piano. He was also involved with a number of dance dramas of Tagore, including a tour performing Taser Desh (Land of cards) to Bombay in 1933. He also composed the music for the film Natir Puja in 1932.

Tom Frost (June 30, 1936 ‚Äì August 24, 2018) was an American rock climber known for big wall climbing first ascents in Yosemite Valley. He was also a photographer and climbing equipment manufacturer. Frost was born in Hollywood, California and died in Oakdale, California.  Rock climbing and mountaineering  Frost graduated with a degree in engineering from Stanford University in 1958 and was a member of the Stanford Alpine Club. Frost began making first ascents in Yosemite in 1958. In 1960, he made the second ascent of The Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, a route pioneered by Warren Harding in 1958. He climbed with Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt and Joe Fitschen. In 1961, Frost and Yvon Chouinard visited the Grand Tetons, and made the first ascent of the northeast face of Disappointment Peak, its difficulty rated IV, 5.9, A3, according to the Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). The southwest face of El Capitan from Yosemite Valley. Salath√© Wall takes a line up the central part of the face. On September 12, 1961, Frost, along with Robbins, began the first ascent of the Salath√© Wall on El Capitan, named for pioneer Yosemite climber John Salath√©. The pair spent two days establishing the first 600 feet of the route, and then retreated to the valley floor, where they met up with Chuck Pratt, with whom they spent several more days pushing the route to 1,000 feet above the valley floor. Once again, the climbers descended and resupplied. On September 19, they resumed the climb, and after days of intense vertical aid climbing they reached the Roof, a 15-foot overhang. Using pitons, Frost led this key section of the climb, and on September 24, the trio reached the summit. It had taken them a total of 11 days and 36 pitches of vertical climbing to finish the route, which is rated YDS VI, 5.10, A3. In 1963, he visited the Himalaya with Edmund Hillary, making the first ascent of Kangtega, and helping with the construction of a school and a hospital for the Sherpas. Frost, Robbins, Pratt and Chouinard at the completion of the first ascent of the North America Wall on El Capitan in 1964. Photo by Tom Frost. From October 22‚Äì31, 1964, with Robbins, Pratt and Chouinard, Frost made the first ascent of the North America Wall on El Capitan, YDS VI, 5.8, A5. Robbins described this climb in the 1965 American Alpine Journal: \\"The nine-day first ascent of the North America Wall in 1964 not only was the first one-push first ascent of an El Capitan climb, but a major breakthrough in other ways. We learned that our minds and bodies never stopped adjusting to the situation. We were able to live and work and sleep in comparative comfort in a vertical environment.\\" (republished 1995) Of this climb, Chris Jones wrote, \\"For the first time in the history of the sport, Americans lead the world.\\" In 1968, Frost visited the Cirque of the Unclimbables in the Northwest Territories of Canada. From August 10 to August 13, along with Jim McCarthy and Sandy Bill, he made the first ascent of the vertical southeast face of the 2,200-foot granite pillar named the Lotus Flower Tower, YDS V, 5.8, A2.Roper, pp. 98‚Äì103 This has been called \\"one of the most aesthetically beautiful rock faces in the world\\". In 1970, he participated in the 1970 Annapurna South Face expedition, reaching 25,000 feet. In 1979, he reached the summit of Ama Dablam on a filming expedition. Tom Frost in Eldorado Canyon, Colorado, in the late 1980s In 1986, he returned to Kangtega and climbed a new route with Jeff Lowe. From 1997 to 2001, he returned to Yosemite big wall climbing with his son Ryan, repeating the Nose, the North America Wall and finally, the Salath√© Wall on the 40th anniversary of his first ascent.

Photography  Frost photographed many of his first ascents. Glen Denny, also a mountaineering photographer and author of the book Yosemite in the Sixties, wrote of Frost's photographic achievements: \\"Most of the climbing photos you see now are prearranged setups for the camera on much-traveled routes. The impressive thing about Frost is that his classic images were seen, and photographed, during major first ascents. In those awesome situations he led, cleaned, hauled, day after day and ‚Äî somehow ‚Äî used his camera with the acuity of a Cartier-Bresson strolling about a piazza. Extremes of heat and cold, storm and high altitude, fear and exhaustion ... it didn't matter. He didn't seem to feel the pressure.\\" Several of Frost's photos were published in Royal Robbins' book, Advanced Rockcraft, in 1973. Frost is also an ice climber, and contributed dozens of photographs to Yvon Chouinard's book Climbing Ice. Nine of his photographs appeared in the book Fifty Classic Climbs of North America. Many of his photos appeared in Pat Ament's Royal Robbins: Spirit of the Age. In 1979, he co-founded Chimera Photographic Lighting with Gary Regester. The company, based in Boulder, Colorado, manufactures lighting products for photography and filming.  Climbing philosophy and activism  Frost was a longtime advocate of environmental ethics in climbing, using natural protection whenever possible, guided by respect for tradition and a desire to \\"leave no trace\\". He articulated his climbing philosophy in an address to an international congress called \\"The Future of Mountain Sports\\", held in Innsbruck, Austria in September, 2002. He opposed what he believed to be excessive use of bolts by sport climbers, especially the altering of traditional climbing routes previously completed without such aids. He criticized such practices as the result of a desire by some climbers for \\"instant gratification with little or no accountability\\". He opposed five attitudes as the culprits of modern climbing: \\"selfishness ‚Äî entitlement ‚Äî lack of self management ‚Äî mis-education ‚Äî and disrespect.\\" Frost played a critical role in the fight to save Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, starting in 1997. He filed a lawsuit against the National Park Service to save the historic rockclimber's campsite, and convinced the American Alpine Club to support the suit. The effort was successful and Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2002, Royal Robbins offered the following description of Frost: \\"Tom is the kindest and gentlest and most generous person I have ever met, with never an ill word to say of anyone. He is also a man of courage and leadership, as witness his recent vanguard role in the effort to save Camp 4 in Yosemite. And he continues to possess the true spirit of climbing. Just a couple of years ago, at age 60, with his son, he climbed three big El Capitan routes, one of them the North American Wall.\\" Climbing equipment While working on the first ascent of Kat Pinnacle with Chouinard in 1959, the pair designed and fabricated the Realized Ultimate Reality Piton or RURP, a tiny device that allowed them to finish the most difficult aid climb then completed in North America. This led to a lengthy partnership between Frost and Chouinard in climbing equipment companies such as the Great Pacific Iron Works and Chouinard, Ltd. Frost described his profession as \\"piton engineer\\". In the late 1960s, Frost and Chouinard turned their attention to ice climbing and its specialized equipment. They developed an alpine hammer with a drooping pick. Although Austrian climbers had improvised rigid crampons decades before by welding a bar across the hinge of conventional crampons, such devices were not commercially available until 1967. That year, Chouinard and Frost began marketing adjustable rigid crampons made of chrome-molybdenum steel. Frost and Chouinard invented the climbing protection device called the Hexentric. They applied for a United States patent in 1974 and it was granted on April 6, 1976. These are still manufactured by Black Diamond Equipment, a successor to earlier companies owned by Frost and Chouinard. Since 1997, Frost owned a business manufacturing rock climbing equipment called FROSTWORKS.

Biography World War I After passing out as a \\"Gentlemen Cadet\\" from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Hudson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Buffs (East Kent Regiment) on 15 September 1915. He was immediately seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, being granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1830 on 6 October, after flying a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military Flying School at Farnborough, and was appointed a flying officer on 10 November. Assigned to No. 15 Squadron, Hudson was wounded in action on 21 February 1916, and was subsequently awarded the Military Cross on 30 March. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant Frank Neville Hudson, The Buffs (East Kent Regiment) and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and skill on several occasions, notably when, although severely wounded in the head, he successfully completed his aerial reconnaissance. After recrossing the line and landing at an aerodrome, he at once lost consciousness. This young officer is only 18 years of age, but has many times driven off enemy machines and twice forced them to the ground.\\" After recovering from his injuries, Hudson eventually returned to active duty in No. 54 Squadron, flying the Sopwith Pup. He gained his first victory by sending an enemy reconnaissance aircraft down in flames over Courcelette on 27 January 1917, and drove down another on 13 February. On 4 March he was appointed a flight commander with the acting-rank of captain. On 5 April, Hudson, with Captain R. G. H. Pixley, Lieutenant Maurice Scott and 2nd Lieutenant Reginald Charley, shared in the destruction of an observation balloon at Gouy. Hudson went on to drive down two more enemy aircraft in that month. He had been promoted to temporary lieutenant on 1 February, but had to wait until 1 July until it was made permanent. He gained his sixth and final victory by destroying an Albatros C on 11 July. Two days later, on 13 July, Hudson was shot down between Bruges and Ostend by aircraft from Jasta 20. Initially reported as missing, it was not until September his father, Frank Hudson, of Park Langley, Beckenham, received notification that his son was unwounded and a prisoner of war at Karlsruhe. Hudson remained a POW until after the armistice in November 1918, and in December 1919 received a mention in despatches \\"for valuable services whilst in captivity\\". Post war On 1 August 1919 Hudson was granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, relinquishing his Army commission in the Buffs the same day. On 1 January 1921 he was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant. He was transferred from the RAF Cadet College (Flying Wing) at Cranwell to No. 6 Squadron, based in Iraq, on 24 February 1922. On 31 May 1922 he crashed his Bristol F2b on landing, and died from his injuries on 6 June. He is buried in Ma'asker Al Raschid RAF Cemetery just outside Baghdad.

The season was produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, and its showrunners were Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. Actors Anna Torv, John Noble, and Joshua Jackson reprised their roles as FBI agent Olivia Dunham and father-son duo Walter and Peter Bishop, respectively. Previous series regulars Lance Reddick, Jasika Nicole, Blair Brown, and Kirk Acevedo also returned, though with Acevedo in a limited capacity. The season followed the continuation of a war between two universes, the prime and the parallel. It was set in the former, until the last several episodes when Peter Bishop (Jackson) journeyed back to the parallel universe after being lured there by his real father, \\"Walternate\\" (Noble). While co- creator J.J. Abrams described the first season as \\"identifying that there is an enemy\\", he referred to season two as \\"getting to know the enemy\\" as it \\"build[s] to a very specific type of confrontation\\" between the two universes. The writers focused on their characters' development, in particular making them more comfortable with each other while solving cases for Fringe Division. By inventing the \\"mythalone\\" style of episode, the producers sought to create the perfect episode that mixed standalone episode qualities for casual viewers with the further development of the series' mythology for regular viewers. In a departure from the previous season, the second season aired in a new competitive timeslot at 9:00 pm on Thursdays. It contained 22 episodes, plus an unaired episode that was produced during the first season; \\"Unearthed\\" aired as a special as episode 11 of season two, days prior to \\"Johari Window\\", the first new episode of 2010. Also part of the season was the series' only musical episode, \\"Brown Betty\\", which was produced at the request of the network. The season finale, \\"Over There\\", fully introduced the parallel universe and laid the groundwork for the third season. Fringe ended its second season with a per episode average of 6.252 million total viewers and a 2.3 ratings share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The season was generally well-received by critics, though most agreed that the second half was a considerable improvement over the first. The series was chosen for a number of 2010 \\"best of television\\" lists, including The New York Times, the Seattle Post- Intelligencer, and Entertainment Weekly. Despite its critical acclaim, Fringe failed to earn any major category nominations at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, but did receive nominations at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, Golden Reel Awards, and Satellite Awards; at the Saturn Awards, Torv and guest actor Leonard Nimoy won in their respective categories. The second season was released on DVD and Blu-ray in region 1 on September 14, 2010, in region 2 on September 27, and in region 4 on November 10.  Season summary  Olivia, having been taken to William Bell's office in the parallel universe, is returned to the prime universe but with short term amnesia, unable to recall her experience there. Massive Dynamic's Nina Sharp directs her to Sam Weiss, a bowling alley manager, who gives her cryptic but helpful advice to overcome her amnesia. Meanwhile, the Fringe division has discovered several shapeshifters - a human/machine hybrid that bleed mercury - have crossed over, but unbeknownst to them, one takes the form of Olivia's partner, Charlie. When Sam's advice allows Olivia to recall what Bell told her, she unwittingly gives this information to the shapeshifter, who calls its agents to use the information to recover the body of Thomas Jerome Newton, an agent for some entity operating from the parallel universe. Nina provides Olivia with cautionary advice, alerting her to a \\"great war\\" that Bell postulated would occur between the two universes. During this time, Peter has come to forgive Walter for his past, and Walter has grown accustomed to normal life outside of the institution, but is still troubled by a secret. Newton, using old technology from Walter and Bell's research, is able to pull an entire building from the parallel universe to the prime, and the team races against time to prevent harm when, due to the laws of mass conservation, a building from the prime is pulled to the parallel one. This event forces Walter to try to coax Olivia to recall her Cortexiphan abilities as to identify things affected by the parallel universe. Initially unable to do so, her fear of failure enables her ability, allowing them to save the people within the target building, but also revealing to her that Peter is from the parallel universe. Walter explains to Olivia that in 1985, he and Bell had devised a way to observe the parallel universe, where he found his doppelg√§nger, \\"Walternate\\", was also close to losing his son. Though Walter's Peter had died, Walternate continued to search for a cure, but missed the telltale sign when the Observer September arrived at his lab. Walter resynthesized the cure and aimed to cross over using untested equipment at Reiden Lake, though stalled by Nina and his lab assistant Clara. Nina tackled him on his way over, losing her arm in the process, while Walter, on the other side, found the cure vial broken. Intent on curing the alternate Peter, he posed as his father and crossed back with Peter, intending to administer the cure at the lab and then return Peter. However, on the return, the ice on Reiden Lake broke, threatening to drown both, but they were saved by September, who cautioned Walter \\"the boy must live\\". While Walter successfully administered the cure, his wife Elizabeth saw Peter, and Walter realized he could never return Peter to the parallel universe. After Walter reveals this truth, he considers letting Peter know but struggles with how to do so, hoping to seek repentance from God for his actions. Meanwhile, Newton has continued to use Walter's technology to bring into temporary existence elements from the parallel universe. This enables Newton and his agents to bring over a figure known as \\"Mr. Secretary\\", despite Fringe's attempts to stop them. Peter, from this action, deduces that he is from the parallel universe, and furious at Walter for hiding this information, leaves on his own. While hiding in the Pacific Northwest, Peter meets Mr. Secretary - Walternate, his true father, who offers to take him back to the parallel universe, which Peter accepts. Olivia and Walter are alerted by September that Walternate plans to use Peter to initiate the operation of a strange device that threatens to destroy the prime universe, and the two launch a rescue attempt. In the parallel universe, they find that it suffers from singularities caused by Walter's crossing in 1985, forcing Walternate's Fringe team to use an amber-like substance to surround and quarantine such areas, regardless of innocent lives trapped within. They meet with William Bell, and Walter and Bell resolve their past differences. Olivia faces off against her doppelg√§nger, \\"Fauxlivia\\", who works for Walternate in the Fringe Division under the U.S. Secretary of Defense; she is able to recover Peter, who has seen the device and recognized that it reacted only to his biology, and wants nothing of it, willing to return with the others. As Olivia, Walter, and Peter attempt to return, they are engaged by Fauxlivia and others in the Fringe Division. Bell sacrifices himself to provide energy into a device to allow the three to cross over, but none of them are aware that Fauxlivia has secretly switched places with Olivia under Walternate's orders, while Olivia is captured and held in a secured facility by Walternate.  Episodes  Development Crew The season was produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Though still set in Boston, the show's production for the second season moved from New York City to Vancouver out of financial necessity, as it lost access to New York's TV production tax incentive program. Fringe consequently got a mostly new writing staff and production team, though co-creators J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman, and producer Bryan Burk remained involved with the series. Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman returned as executive producers and showrunners. Jeff Vlaming and previous episode director Akiva Goldsman joined the crew as consulting producers. While Abrams had six episode writing credits for the first season he remained much more hands-off for the second, instead focusing on other commitments like the film Star Trek. He explained, \\"Sometimes we'll talk every day. Then there will be a period of a couple weeks where we don't speak. But we're emailing a lot. There's a lot of stuff that happens that way.\\" Eden FX and Zoic Studios stayed as vendors for the series' visual effects, effectively giving Fringe a sense of continuity. Jay Worth, the overall visual effects supervisor, commented that having these two companies \\"helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next, particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit.\\" Despite his decreased involvement, Abrams was sent all of the visual effects for the series during production, and responded back with notes and tweaks. Writing and filming Responding to criticism that some first season episodes were too neatly wrapped and solved, Jeff Pinkner commented towards the end of that season, \\"We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of‚Äîthe tease would be fantastic. And then we would too quickly answer it and [reduce] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise\\" questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to \\"have the energy of the show get bigger as [an episode] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories.\\" Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman developed the second season's storyline together. Goldsman explained that they \\"mapped\\" out the season \\"in a way that we remained fundamentally faithful to\\". Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were going to start and end up but \\"got there at different paces than what [they] originally planned\\". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to \\"[build] to a very specific type of confrontation\\" between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, \\"Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why\\". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a \\"journey of self-actualization\\" and \\"maturation for our characters.\\" They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and \\"grounded as a human being\\". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to \\"acknowledge it to our characters\\". All the while Walter was \\"suffering... and desperately trying to keep it all quiet\\", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By \\"giv[ing] these things time\\" to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on \\"event, event, event\\", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery. The second season's mythology was intended to be revealed in small parcels. Throughout the season, Pinkner and Wyman tried to create an episode that best bridged \\"standalone\\" traits‚Äîneeded for casual viewers‚Äîwith the further advancement of the show's mythology for those who watched regularly. At the start of the season Pinkner believed they had found a \\"good rhythm\\" between the two, as the mythology \\"really [started to] affect the characters, to the point where even the standalone [episodes] advance mythology\\". After the season ended, Wyman commented at San Diego Comic-Con International, \\"We learned that the fan fans love mythology but there are needs from the networks. We started experimenting with a thing we called 'mythalones', not standalone or myth.\\" Wyman cited the season's 18th episode, \\"White Tulip\\" as a prime example, noting \\"You can see that you're following Walter's journey, it's the right mix.\\" The Fringe producers strove to avoid becoming bogged down in mythology, an issue that they perceived happened in Alias, another J.J. Abrams television series. In a joint statement released midway through the season, Abrams, Pinkner, and Wyman noted that their \\"only internal rule is that we make every effort to not raise mythological questions merely to string viewers along, but rather to provide answers that generate consequences.\\" At Fox's request, the writers developed a musical episode, \\"Brown Betty\\" to fit into the network's \\"Fox rocks\\" campaign in the same vein as its series Glee. While the episode already had most of the necessary elements in place before Fox's request, the producers were able to add the musical theme as a \\"narrative device\\" to \\"explore Walter's feelings\\" in the aftermath of Peter's discovery and flight. To prepare for the season finale, the producers began developing characteristics of the parallel universe relatively early on. Relating to the two universes' idiosyncrasies, Pinkner and Wyman were both interested in world building and \\"the concept of choices\\", such as the differing events that led to the Other Side possessing a still-standing World Trade Center but destroyed White House. Other historical idiosyncrasies included the oxidation of the Statue of Liberty and the use of zeppelins as transportation. They believed that all of their additions were \\"the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real\\". As the series began filming in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus served as a substitute for Harvard University. Because of its heritage buildings and antique storefronts, many of the scenes set in the alternate universe were shot in New Westminster, an area outside Vancouver. Consulting producer and previous Fringe director Akiva Goldsman returned to direct several episodes, as did producer Brad Anderson, executive producer Joe Chappelle, and producer Paul Edwards. One time guest directors for the season included Bryan Spicer, Jon Cassar, Dennis Smith, Paul Holahan, Jeannot Szwarc, Frederick E. O. Toye, Deran Sarafian, Adam Davidson, Charles Beeson, David Straiton, Thomas Yatsko, Jeffrey Hunt, and Seith Mann. Cast Guest actor Leonard Nimoy appeared in four episodes in the second season.  Main cast  * Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham (23 episodes) * Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop (22 episodes) * Lance Reddick as Phillip Broyles (22 episodes) * Kirk Acevedo as Charlie Francis (6 episodes) * Blair Brown as Nina Sharp (10 episodes) * Jasika Nicole as Astrid Farnsworth (22 episodes) * John Noble as Dr. Walter Bishop (23 episodes) As with the previous season, the second season featured three main characters all working together to solve various Fringe cases. Anna Torv played determined FBI agent Olivia Dunham, who is able to travel between universes as a result of childhood experiments performed on her with the nootropic drug, Cortexiphan. The man responsible for these experiments, Dr. Walter Bishop, was played by John Noble. Walter's son Peter Bishop, whom he stole from the parallel universe, was portrayed by Joshua Jackson. Other members of the main cast included Jasika Nicole as Junior FBI Agent and Walter's lab assistant Astrid Farnsworth, Lance Reddick as Agent Phillip Broyles, Blair Brown as Massive Dynamic executive Nina Sharp, and Kirk Acevedo as Agent Charlie Francis. Acevedo's character was killed off in the season's fourth episode, though at the time Pinkner and Wyman hinted of the actor's possible return later in the season. Acevedo returned to guest star in the season finale as the parallel universe version of Charlie Francis. Acevedo was also featured in \\"Unearthed\\", a special episode that was filmed during the first season, but aired as the eleventh episode of the second season.  Recurring cast  The second season marked a large number of recurring guest appearances. Michael Cerveris played September/The Observer, a mysterious man that observes important events and appeared in every episode of the season, often merely in brief glimpses. Further Observers were revealed, including August (Peter Woodward) and December (Eugene Lipinski). Ryan McDonald portrayed Massive Dynamic scientist Brandon Fayette, while its founder, Dr. William Bell was played by Leonard Nimoy, despite the actor's recent retirement. Thomas Jerome Newton, one of the season's main villains, was played by Sebastian Roch√©. Kevin Corrigan portrayed Samuel Weiss, a mysterious man who helps Olivia recover from her injuries. Ari Graynor appeared as Olivia's sister Rachel Dunham, while Lily Pilblad played Rachel's daughter and Olivia's niece Ella Blake. Orla Brady played Walter's wife Elizabeth Bishop. A new FBI agent, Amy Jessup, was portrayed by Meghan Markle. Roger Cross appeared as a shapeshifter. Former Cortexiphan subjects James Heath and Nick Lane were played by Omar Metwally and David Call, respectively. Karen Holness appeared as Broyles' ex-wife Diane, and Clark Middleton played rare book seller Edward Markham. Philip Winchester appeared as Fauxlivia's boyfriend Frank Stanton, while Seth Gabel played Agent Lincoln Lee from the parallel universe, both in the finale. J. R. Bourne played Agent Edwards, and Gerard Plunkett appeared as Senator James Van Horn. Further notable guest stars included Andrew Airlie, Stefan Arngrim, Demore Barnes, Jenni Blong, Pascale Hutton, Ravil Isyanov, Ravi Kapoor, Alice Kremelberg, Diane Kruger, Quinn Lord, Tzi Ma, Stephen McHattie, Jennifer Missoni, Cameron Monaghan, Michael O'Neill, Geoff Pierson, Martha Plimpton, Paul Rae, John Savage, Peter Weller, and Craig Robert Young. Reception Ratings and broadcast Fringe first season ended with an average of 9.96 million viewers, and among the season's new series, it was the first rated show for adults 18‚Äì49. On May 4, 2009, a week before the season one finale, Fox renewed Fringe for a second season, giving it a full season pick-up of 22 episodes. The network's president of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, explained \\"Fringe proved to be a notable addition to our schedule all season and it really has fans buzzing as it builds to a fantastic season finale.\\" Later in May, Fox announced Fringe would be moving from Tuesdays to Thursdays for the second season, to be aired in the competitive 9:00 pm timeslot. Kevin Reilly explained the move, \\"The door is more open on this night than it has been in a long time. Fringe is a real alternative to both [Grey's and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation].\\" However, after a perceived \\"healthy\\" first season, the second season premiere was watched by an estimated 7.817 million viewers. Ratings for the season continued to decline, culminating in 5.68 million viewers watching the finale. Fringes second season ended with an average of 6.252 million viewers per episode and a 2.3 ratings share for adults 18‚Äì49, causing the series to finish in 79th place out of all the season's network television shows. However, Fringe and its lead-in, Bones, did help the network increase 52% among adults aged 18‚Äì49 and 65 percent among total viewers from the same night the previous year. Despite its middling ratings, Fringe received a full- season renewal on March 6, 2010. Reviews The second season of Fringe received generally very favorable reviews. At the beginning of the season, the series was featured on the September 18 cover of Entertainment Weekly, which promised to give readers a \\"deep dive into the gory, witty world of Fox's Fringe. Metacritic, a film review aggregate website, gave the second season 75/100 based upon ten reviews, indicating a \\"generally favorable\\" reception. After viewing the first eight episodes, Entertainment Weekly columnist Ken Tucker gave the series an A-, calling it \\"one of the fastest, smartest, wittiest shows on television now... Fringe successfully mixes the crime genre with sci-fi, and cold conspiracies with heartfelt emotion.\\" Peter Swanson from Slant Magazine gave Fringe two and a half stars after watching the first six episodes. He believed the second season had \\"floundered a little, stuck in that creative hinterland between the desire to grab new viewers and the need to build on the mythology of the show's universe.\\" While Swanson understood the need to attract a larger audience, he thought the standalone episodes to be \\"less than stellar\\", as \\"they've yet to get scary, or even vaguely unsettling\\". Swanson did however find the war between two universes to be \\"particularly compelling\\", and expressed hope that \\"Fringe [would] find its footing.\\" In a review of the entire second season, IGN believed that despite the premiere's \\"great start\\", the first half contained \\"some rather lackluster episodes\\" that \\"made a lot of fans worried and got the rumors of cancellation circulating\\"; the second half however \\"showed that Fringe is still one of the best sci-fi series on TV\\". The A.V. Club agreed, and called the first half \\"entertaining\\" but \\"never essential\\" while noting a great improvement mid-way through the season, as \\"the show finally grounded its freak-of-the-week weirdness in deep sadness\\". The A.V. Club continued, \\"...The season-two episode \\"Peter\\" finally dramatized the moment that changed [Peter's] life, giving the series' overarching storyline a devastating emotional core, based in a father's love instead of in theoretical concepts. It only got better from there, as the series expanded its world by further making those concepts concrete. Fringe is that rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness.\\" The Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that by the end of the season \\"Fringe had truly found its footing, doing daring, experimental episodes like the musical \\"Brown Betty\\"... and heartbreaking stand alone episodes, like \\"White Tulip\\", (which might be my favorite hour of television this year that wasn't Lost-related).\\" In particular, critics highlighted the season premiere \\"A New Day in the Old Town\\" as well as regular episodes \\"Peter\\" and \\"White Tulip\\", and the season finale \\"Over There\\". The main three cast members' performances were praised, and various critics noted the series continued the sense of humor seen in the first season. Fringes second season was chosen for a number of 2010 \\"best of television\\" lists, including The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Digital Spy, the New York Post, The Daily Beast, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, AOL's TV Squad, as well as IGN, which named Fringe the best sci-fi series of 2010, beating fellow nominees Lost, Caprica, and Stargate Universe. Awards and nominations At the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, actor Joshua Jackson and actress Anna Torv submitted their work in the second season for consideration in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series categories, respectively. Actors John Noble, Lance Reddick, Kirk Acevedo, and actress Blair Brown submitted their work for consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series categories, respectively. The second season of Fringe was submitted for consideration in the Outstanding Drama Series category but failed to garner a nomination. The failure of the series to garner any major category nominations at the Emmys was perceived as a notable snub by many media outlets. The second season received nominations for Sound Editing at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards and at the Golden Reel Awards. The season's sole musical episode, \\"Brown Betty\\", received a nomination for Short Form Musical In Television at the Golden Reel Awards. Noble, Torv, and guest actor Leonard Nimoy were nominated at the 2010 Saturn Awards, with Torv and Nimoy winning in their respective categories. Noble also received a nomination at the 2010 Satellite Awards, but lost to Dexters John Lithgow.  Home video releases  The second season of Fringe was released on DVD and Blu-ray in region 1 on September 14, 2010, in region 2 on September 27, 2010 and in region 4 on November 10, 2010.

After he was expelled in a mutiny by Yang Zhicheng, the imperial government continued to commission him as a military governor, and he served at two other circuits subsequently.  Background  Li Zaiyi was born in 788. He was a descendant of Li Chengqian, who was at one point the crown prince of Emperor Taizong of Tang, and therefore a distant relative to Tang's imperial family. It was said that his ancestors were known for generations for their battlefield prowess and served at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing, Lulong Circuit's capital). Li Zaiyi lost his father early, and he spent his days touring with those from his home area not under anyone's orders. Li was said to be strong and capable in wrestling. When then-military governor of Lulong, Liu Ji, saw him, Liu was impressed, and invited him to serve on Liu's guard corps. For his subsequent accomplishments, Li received repeated promotions.Old Book of Tang, vol. 180. In 826, then-military governor Zhu Kerong and his son Zhu Yanling () were killed in a mutiny. Another faction of soldiers initially supported Zhu Kerong's second son Zhu Yansi to succeed him. Zhu Yansi, however, was said to be cruel, and several months later, Li led another mutiny and killed Zhu Yansi, and further slaughtered the Zhu family. He then submitted a report of Zhu Yansi's crimes to the imperial government. Soon thereafter, Emperor Jingzong commissioned Li as the new military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. Li was also created the Prince of Wuwei and bestowed a new name Zaiyi.  As the military governor of Lulong  In 827, the imperial government prepared for a campaign against Li Tongjie, who seized control of Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) after the death of his father, Li Quanl√ºe (), who had been military governor, without imperial sanction. Li Zaiyi offered to participate in the imperial campaign, and subsequently, when Emperor Wenzong did declare a general campaign against Li Tongjie, Li Zaiyi was one of the generals mobilized. Li Tongjie, trying to get the other circuits' military governors to speak on his behalf, sent many of his relatives to try to bribe those military governors with money, treasures, and women, but when he sent his nephew with bribes to Lulong, Li Zaiyi arrested his nephew and sent the nephew and the bribe to the capital Chang'an. Thereafter, Li Zaiyi participated in attacking Henghai's capital prefecture Cang Prefecture (). After Li Tongjie surrendered in 829, Li Zaiyi received the honorific chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. In 830, Xi forces attacked Lulong. Li Zaiyi defeated the Xi forces and captured the chieftain Rujie (); he subsequently sent Rujie to Chang'an. In 831, when Li Zaiyi was feasting with an imperial emissary, his officer Yang Zhicheng started a mutiny, and Li Zaiyi and his son Li Zhengyuan () were forced to flee to Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei) (in neighboring Yiwu Circuit (). Emperor Wenzong initially considered launching an army to reinstate Li Zaiyi, but the chancellor Niu Sengru pointed out that the imperial government had no strength at the time for such a campaign. Emperor Wenzong thus allowed Yang to take over (although, at that time, only naming Yang acting military governor). Meanwhile, when Li Zaiyi arrived in Chang'an from Yi Prefecture, Emperor Wenzong, because Li Zaiyi had been respectful and had participated in the campaign against Henghai, continued to let him carry the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi, and further conveyed the title of Taibao (Â§™‰øù, one of the Three Excellencies) on him.  Subsequent career  In summer 831, Emperor Wenzong made Li Zaiyi the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), as well as the mayor of its capital Xingyuan Municipality (). In 833, he was made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), as well as the mayor of its capital Taiyuan Municipality. It was said that at that time, whenever Tang's ally Huigu sent emissaries to offer tributes, the emissaries often pillaged the Tang territory they went through. The local governments did not dare to complain, and only reacted by mobilizing security forces. When Li Zaiyi arrived at Hedong, there happened to be a Huigu mission led by the emissary Li Chang () going through Hedong. Li Zaiyi met with Li Chang and stated: Li Zaiyi then sent away his guards and put only two guards at his headquarters. Li Chang, impressed, did not carry out any hostile actions. In 834, Yang Zhicheng was himself expelled by his officer Shi Yuanzhong. He fled toward Chang'an, and as he went through Hedong, Li Zaiyi had him battered and wanted to kill him, only stopping after earnest advice from the staffers. Li, however, still killed Yang's wife and followers. Emperor Wenzong did not punish Li, on account of his accomplishments. Li then submitted a petition, accusing Yang of having dug up the tombs of Li's mother and brother to steal the treasures buried with them, and he requested that Yang be executed so that he could take out Yang's heart to sacrifice it to his mother; Emperor Wenzong refused, although subsequently, when Shi sent imperial robes that Yang made to Emperor Wenzong (i.e., as evidence that Yang had imperial pretensions), Emperor Wenzong exiled Yang, and later had him killed in exile.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. In 835, Li was given the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). When Li's subordinates suggested to Emperor Wenzong that a monument should be erected to commemorate Li's achievements, Emperor Wenzong agreed, and he commissioned the former chancellor Li Cheng to author the text of the monument. However, at that time, Li Zaiyi did not yet have a courtesy name, which was customary to be used on a monument. Emperor Wenzong thus bestowed the courtesy name of Fanggu on him.New Book of Tang, vol. 212. Around the new year 836, during a plot by Emperor Wenzong, the chancellor Li Xun, and the general Zheng Zhu, to slaughter the powerful eunuchs who controlled much of imperial governance (an incident later known as the Ganlu Incident), as part of the plot, Emperor Wenzong recalled Li Zaiyi to Chang'an, while naming the official Wang Fan (), who was an associate of Li Xun's, as the new military governor of Hedong. (This was to enable Wang to have an excuse to mobilize troops at the capital to carry out the plot.) After the plot failed (ending in the deaths of Li Xun, Zheng, and several other chancellors, as well as the other plotters and the virtual house arrest of Emperor Wenzong by the eunuchs), Li Zaiyi was allowed to remain at Hedong. It was said that late in his life, Li Zaiyi was arrogant and cruel. He died in 837 and was given posthumous honors.

He was the only ace in his squadron. Biography Background and early life Huston was born in Belfast, Ireland, one of nine children of William Wentworth Huston and Elizabeth Victoria (n√©e Simpson). His parents had lived for some time in Cape Town, South Africa, but had returned to Northern Ireland in 1889. Huston served in the 11th Hussars, before emigrating to Canada, where he married Sarah Bailie in Vancouver in November 1912. His attestation papers describe him as a motor engineer, tall, and a member of the Church of England. First World War service Huston enlisted into the Canadian Expeditionary Force in September 1914 and was assigned to the Canadian Army Service Corps. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 13 September 1915. He was seconded for service in the British Army's Royal Flying Corps on 8 December 1916, and was appointed a flying officer the same day. On 17 December Huston was posted to No. 18 Squadron RFC to fly the FE.2b. He gained his first victory on 15 February 1917, when he and observer Second Lieutenant P. S. Taylor destroyed a Type C reconnaissance aircraft over Gr√©villers. On 5 April he and his observer Second Lieutenant Giles Blennerhasset were credited with two Albatros D.IIs driven down out of control over Inchy. Huston was then paired with observer Lieutenant E. A. Foord for his remaining three victories, destroying an Albatros D.III on 24 April, then a Halberstadt D north-west of Cambrai on 13 May. Huston shared his sixth and final victory with Flight Sub-Lieutenant Harold Spencer Kerby, both pilots being credited with destroying an Albatros D.V north-west of Havrincourt on 27 May. On 18 June 1917 Huston was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Lieutenant Victor Henry Huston, Canadian Army Service Corps and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has rendered valuable service when on photographic reconnaissance. He has always shown the greatest skill and courage in leading attacks on hostile machines, and thus enabling valuable photographs to be secured behind the lines.\\" Huston left No. 18 Squadron on 8 July 1917. He was promoted to captain in the Canadian Army Service Corps on 5 August 1917, but remained seconded to the RFC. He received a special appointment as a flight commander on 20 March 1918. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force. In August 1918, Huston, now a temporary major in the RAF, sailed for Chile. The Chilean Army had founded a School of Military Aeronautics in 1913 to train pilots, but the war in Europe meant that they had difficulties in obtaining modern aircraft, and had to use obsolete pre-war machines. However, in 1918 the British, as part of their compensation for the requestioning in 1914 of the two s that were being built for Chile in England, supplied them with a number of aircraft, and Huston was sent to serve as Chief Instructor to the Servicio de Aviaci√≥n Militar de Chile (\\"Chilean Military Aviation Service\\"). While there Huston was also instrumental in Lieutenant Dagoberto Godoy's first flight over the Andes in a Bristol M.1c on 12 December 1918, and he also made the first flight of a seaplane in Chile, piloting a naval Sopwith Baby at Talcahuano on 3 July 1919. Huston also contributed to the creation of an independent Chilean Air Force, stating in a letter to the military authorities that: \\"The air service in Chile must be a single branch dependent only on the Ministry of War and Navy.\\" Huston was subsequently awarded the Chilean Order of Merit. Huston's secondment to the Royal Air Force ended on 30 September 1919, and he relinquished his RAF commission as a flight lieutenant to return to the Canadian Army as a captain. Post war life Huston returned to England and lived in London, but was killed during the Second World War in an air raid on Coventry on 10 April 1941.

Early life Born in St. Paul, Minnesota on July 22, 1930. Grundhoefer graduated from Cretin High School, (now Cretin-Derham Hall High School). Career Grundhoefer's first public performances were playing organ at St. Paschal Catholic Church where he met Bernie Fitch, his future wife. Fitch and Grundhoefer were married at St. Croix River in 1950. Subsequently, he worked for American Dereck machines. Approximately one year later, Grundhoefer was working as a salesman for Hobart Sales and Services, playing music on the side. Due to job transfers, the family moved from St. Paul to Atlanta to Raleigh, NC, while Grundhoefer opened offices for Hobart in these cities. They finally settled permanently in Birmingham, Alabama in 1965. By this time, they had 9 children and Bernie was expecting another. They had 2 more children together after the move. Grundhoefer opened Grundy's Jazz Music Hall in 1979 in Birmingham, a bar where jazz musicians played live music daily.

McCall Jr. (April 4, 1904 ‚Äì April 3, 1986) was an American writer best known for her screenwriting. She was a charter member and the first woman president of the Writers Guild of America (then known as the Screen Writers Guild), serving from 1942‚Äì44 and 1951‚Äì52. Biography Mary C. McCall Jr. was born on April 4, 1904 to a wealthy Irish American family in New York. She wanted to be a writer from the time she was in first grade. After graduating from Vassar College and Trinity College, Dublin, she began writing advertising copy and fiction. In 1932, McCall published her first novel, The Goldfish Bowl, a satirical comedy loosely based on Anne Morrow and Charles Lindbergh.Smyth, p. 123-124. The film rights were purchased by Warner Bros., but McCall did not get to write the screenplay for the film version, It's Tough to Be Famous (1932) starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Instead, Warner Bros. hired McCall on a ten-week contract to write Street of Women (1932). They also tasked her to help with the screenplay of the film Scarlet Dawn (1932), based on her tragic novel of the Russian Revolution, titled Revolt. In 1934, McCall landed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. and became involved with the Screen Writers Guild. McCall became an associate member of the Guild in 1934 and served her first of six terms on the executive board in 1935.Smyth, p. 119-120. As a member of the negotiating committee, she worked to help secure the Guild's first contract with the studios, and as a member of the executive board, she helped secure an across-the-board wage increase from $40 to $125 per week for writers.Smyth, p. 135. In 1942, the first year the contract was signed, McCall was elected the first woman president of the Guild. During her career, McCall wrote for Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. Among her screen credits are the 1935 film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Craig's Wife (1936, directed by Dorothy Arzner), The Fighting Sullivans (1944), and Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1950). She also adapted Wilson Collison's novel Dark Dame into Maisie (1939), launching the successful Maisie series. McCall wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten films in the series. In the 1950s and 1960s, she branched out into television, being credited with four episodes of The Millionaire and one each of Sea Hunt, I Dream of Jeannie, and Gilligan's Island, among others. A number of her stories were published in such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, Collier's, and The Saturday Evening Post from the 1930s to the 1950s. McCall was one of many who clashed with the conservative Motion Picture Alliance. On July 27, 1954, she had to defend herself in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee against reports that she was a communist sympathizer. She was completely exonerated by the separate California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities of the General Research Committee in its report to the California Senate. Mary C. McCall Jr. died of \\"complications of cancer\\" at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital, one day shy of her 82nd birthday. She was the first recipient of the Writers Guild's Valentine Davies Award in 1962. In 1985, she also received the Guild's Edmund J. North Award.

He is best known for his reckless role in the Agadir Crisis in 1911, when France militarily expanded its control of Morocco. He demanded compensation in an aggressive, saber-rattling fashion, sending a warship to the scene and whipping up nationalist sentiment inside Germany. A compromise was reached with France whereby France took control of Morocco and gave Germany a slice of the French Congo. However, the British were angry at this aggressiveness, and talked of war. The episode, small itself, permanently soured relations between Berlin and London. Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2012) pp 204-13.  Biography  The son of a banker from Wurttemberg, Robert Kiderlen, and Baroness Marie von Waechter, he was born in Stuttgart. His father was elevated to the personal nobility in 1852. In 1868, Alfred's mother Marie Kiderlen and her children Alfred, Sarah and Johanna were elevated to the hereditary nobility with the name von Kiderlen-Waechter, combining the names and coats of arms of the Kiderlen and Waechter families. His name is occasionally spelled Kiderlen- W√§chter, however, the correct spelling is Kiderlen-Waechter. Kiderlen-Waechter fought as a volunteer in the Franco-German War (1870-1) and then studied at different universities, retaining throughout his subsequent career a good deal of the jovial manner of a German student (burschikos). Following studies of law, he joined the foreign office in 1879. Some years later, he accompanied the emperor to Russia, Sweden and Denmark. He was minister in the free town of Hamburg in 1894, and was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, Paris and Constantinople. He served as envoy to Copenhagen 1895-1896. Later still he was transferred to Bucharest where he spent ten years. In Romania he gathered a deep knowledge of Eastern European politics, which led to a temporary appointment as chief at the foreign office, acting also as ambassador at Constantinople during the illness of the actual ambassador. He negotiated the construction of the Baghdad Railway. In 1908, he was appointed by von Bulow as Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and returned to Berlin. He played a central role during the Bosnia Crisis. After badly misunderstanding France, Britain and recklessly stirring up German nationalists, aggressiveness, he negotiated an agreement with France during the Second Morocco Crisis over Agadir in 1911. After Chancellor Bulow's resignation in November 1909, Kiderlen became Secretary of State; and worked closely with Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg on the protracted negotiations with the Triple Entete. He conducted negotiations in 1911 during the Agadir Crisis and was severely criticised both at home and abroad for his provocative attitude in the Panther incident which triggered it. His attempts to reach an understanding with other great powers largely failed. He endeavored to make a friend of Russia. Kiderlen-Waechter died in Stuttgart in 1912. His personal papers are held in the Manuscripts and Archives division of the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University.

He led the nation's team to and during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.  Biography  As a player, Kim Jong-hun has spent his career at April 25 Sports Club. He was capped four times for North Korea during the qualifications for the 1974 and 1986 FIFA World Cups. After ending his player career, Kim became a manager. He managed April 25 Sports Team until 2007, when he became the manager of North Korea national team. In 2009, he led the team as it qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, their first since 1966. After a disappointing showing at the World Cup, Kim faced harsh criticism upon his return to North Korea. Radio Free Asia reported that he was publicly shamed and condemned for hours in front of 400 people, including the North Korean sports minister. At the same event, the team members were commanded to individually criticize their coach, who was accused of betraying General Kim Jong-un, the country's heir apparent. The report also mentioned that he had been stripped of his membership in the Workers' Party of Korea and forced to work hard labor on a construction site as punishment. It is however unknown whether Kim was really faced with such a violating punishment, as far as DPRK has its information mostly closed from the other world. Little is known about Kim Jong-hun's current (by October 2018) occupation, probably due to the same reason.

He was the son of recaptive of Yoruba ancestry captured from what is now Lagos Nigeria, and resettled in Sierra Leone by the British West Africa Squadron, and eventual returnees to present day Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.  Historical context  In 1807, Britain outlawed the African slave trade, took over Sierra Leone and called it Freetown. It was there that all Africans freed from attempted enslavement on the high seas were settled and educated. Between 1807 when the slave trade was outlawed and 1863 when the last slaving ship was captured, about 50,000 Africans were released and set free in Freetown. Many returned home, but many also remained in Freetown. Notable among these were Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, Crispin Curtis Adeniyi-Jones, Samuel Johnson (History of Yorubas author), Christopher Sapara Williams, James Pinson Labulo Davies, and Thomas Babington Macaulay (founder of CMS grammar school). Education was universal; their common language was English, they were Christians and they were free. These new Africans became known as the Sierra Leone Creoles, later the Krios. They became the leaders and developers of the western area of Africa, and above all they looked at the white man as equals and expected to be so treated in turn, By 1827 they had a college of higher education, and by 1845 they had a grammar school for boys and girls. By 1864 their first bishop was consecrated in England.  Family  The name Vivour is a contraction from the word Survivor which is related to the circumstances that led to his father's arrival at Sierra Leone. William Allen Vivour was born in Sierra Leone and had four siblings (two brothers and two sisters) which include Sally Vivour (grandmother to Robert Wellesley Cole) and Jacob Vivour. By 1855, William Allen Vivour migrated from Sierra Leone to set up his base in Nigeria and Fernando Po. \\"About the middle of last century my father‚Äôs eldest uncle, William Allen Vivour, returned to Nigeria (Lagos) and set up his business in Fernando Po, With his success, he educated his two brothers in Europe, including the doctor, and sustained his sisters in Freetown comfortably.\\" Jacob Vivour went on to study law at Christ Church, Oxford University, obtaining his law degree in 1887, then went to Edinburgh where he studied medicine, and duly qualified as a doctor in 1895, returning home to practice in Eastern Nigeria.  Palm oil trade  On arrival at Fernando Po, W. A. Vivour entered the trade of palm oil and yams with the indigenous Bubi tribes. This involved the collection of the palm oil fruits by the Bubi which was then sold to merchants like Vivour. With time he had saved enough money to buy a schooner from John Holt with the aim to expand his palm oil business. On 16 March 1871, he purchased a schooner boat from Holt to use in the yam and palm oil trade. The following year Holt's assistant W. J. Jones wrote that the black merchant was thriving: W. A. Vivour's interest in palm oil grew so significant that it brought him into direct conflict with Jaja of Opobo in the time leading up to the Jaja-Ibeno War. At the time, Vivour was trading directly with Liverpool and had established trading factories on the Kwa Ibo; to achieve this, he had agreements with the Ibeno hierarchy. Ibeno sovereignty was independent of Jaja's Opobo. Jaja himself knew this and said, \\"although I had no claim to the territory near the mouth of the Qua Eboe River, Mr Vivour would still have no right to trade there, for any oil which he could get would either be bought in or drawn from my markets\\". At last dialogue between the Opobo and the Ibeno failed. But Jaja did not take it kindly to see the same Liverpool traders whom he sent away from Opobo because of their free trade policy, establishing trading factories on the Kwa Ibo. About twenty eight of them including George Watts, Henry Watts, Holt and Vivour had agreements with the Ibeno hierarchy. Nevertheless, Jaja's threat for war was ignored by the Ibeno. European traders told Ibeno Chiefs not to exercise any fear that ‚Äòwhatever rights Jaja has at Opobo were conferred by Her Majesty‚Äôs Consul and no rights whatever were given to him over the Qua Iboe people‚Äô. Vivour prospered in the lucrative palm oil trade until the palm oil boom came to an end due to the general decline in oil prices by 1861. Prices had declined from ¬£37 per ton, from 1861 to 1865, to ¬£20 per ton, from 1886 to 1890. Prices fell by half and expansion levelled off in the late 1870s and in the 1880s. In major centers like Opobo, exports declined and by the 1880s settlers began to secure land from the indigenous Bubi and invest in cocoa farming on the island.  Cocoa trade  The cocoa tree itself was introduced to Sao Tome in 1822 and from there it reached Fernando Po in 1854; it was from Fernando Po that the crop spread to the Gold Coast and Nigeria. The British granted the first concessions around Clarence to 'original settlers' in the late 1820s.\\" The Spaniards thought it politic to recognize existing property rights as long as there were signs that plots had been cultivated in some way. Of the land grants listed in 1891, 32 appear to have belonged to Creoles, judging by the names. Vivour was the Fernandino with most land, 202 hectares in all The combined effort of the Creole and the Spaniards so quickened the pace of agricultural development in Fernando Po that by 1909 the island was the tenth- largest producer of cocoa in the world. By the 1890s the presence of the Creoles in Fernando Po was so pervasive that a Catholic missionary complained that: The significant fortune Vivour made in the palm oil business he invested heavily in cocoa farming. On February 1, 1872, he loaned Reverend Roe his schooner to visit Clarence peak. By 1887, when he accompanied Catholic missionaries on their first trip to the western side of the island, Vivour had acquired several cocoa plantations. At the end of the 1880s few agriculturalist were trading directly with the Manchester trading houses, among them Vivour. By the mid-1880s he was the largest land owner on the island. and employed a massive labor force of men from diverse ethnic origins recruited from the Biafra and beyond. They were from Loango; the lower Guinea coast; Accra; and Grebo Kruboys (migrant laborers) from Cape Palmas and the Windward Coast. Vivour also recruited ethnic Bassa and ethnic Bubi. He also employed artisans from Accra who served as coopers, carpenters and smiths. His success in coca cultivation was so noteworthy that the following was remarked during the proceedings of the Royal geographic society in England.  Personal life  W. A. Vivour married Amelia Barleycorn one of the prominent Fernandino Krio families, they had several children one of which was Garnet Vivour, father to both RAF pilot Bankole Vivour and Justice R.W.A Rhodes-Vivour. In relation to the complexities of making a living and settling on land that was in contention by both the British and Spanish, The British agreed to recognize only about one-tenth of the population of Clarence as British subjects on the eve of effective Spanish occupation in 1888, including a few Britons. The rest of the resident Creole population became Spanish by default.\\" William Allen Vivour, a wealthy Creole planter born in Sierra Leone, greeted the Austrian explorer Oscar Baumann in Korth West Bay (San Carlos, Luba) in 1886 as the local representative of the Spanish crown. As regards the spend thrift nature of his contemporaries, Baumann painted a very intimate picture of Vivour as one that was efficient and hated waste. Funds were borrowed for non-productive purposes, but suggestions that Africans were more likely to waste capital than Europeans are suspect. Sundiata portrays profligacy as the major Creole weakness. He echoes Mary Kingsley's verdict that the Creoles spent 'most of their money in the giddy whirl of Santa Isabel, But this does not fit with Baumann's intimate and detailed portrait of Vivour as an archetypal miser, saving every penny. In the 1910s, Spanish authors stressed the eminence of the Creoles, not their decline. Saavedra wrote in 1910 of the not inconsiderable number, of well off Creoles in Fernando Po, who tended to dress better and with more style than the Europeans. He continued, 'A few families ... have considerable fortunes which allow them to visit the capital cities of Europe, especially London', and he singled out the Jones, Kinson, Vivour, Barleycorn, Balboa, Collins, Knox and Prince families for special mention. His evidence is backed up by Bravo Carbonel, writing seven years later, who noted admiringly the luxurious life styles of the leading Creoles, notably their consumption of the best champagne, cognac, whisky.  Death  In the 1890s after Vivour's death, a visiting African-American noted that the opulence of his tomb bore testimony to his business success: References Category:Saro people Category:Sierra Leonean people of Yoruba descent Category:Fernandino people Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Equatoguinean businesspeople Category:Yoruba businesspeople Category:Yoruba farmers Category:19th-century businesspeople Category:1890s deaths ","title":"William Vivour"},{"id":"24649339","text":"Arnold is an unincorporated community in Jerome Township, Union County, Ohio, United States.

History In 1893, a railroad station was built and a community platted on land owned by Mrs. George Arnold along the Toledo and Ohio Central Railroad. The station was originally called New California, but the name was changed when they applied for a post office. The Arnold Post office was established on June 21, 1894, with James Arnold as the original Postmaster. Arnold closed his grocery store, and the post office was abandoned in 1896. Fred Smith was then commissioned as Postmaster, but closed his business also before he could perform any of the duties of the office. Mrs. Carrie Fleck was the next Postmaster, when she and her husband established a store in the community later in 1896. She continued her duties until the branch was discontinued on February 28, 1910. As of 1913, Mr. & Mrs. Fleck's store had continued to grow, and there was also another grocery store, an axe handle factory, two warehouses, the railroad station, 24 houses, and a population of about 100.

It was this longing for the preservation of culture and life that mandated the Kayabi left their native lands and seek shelter and protection. During colonial times indigenous peoples had their villages disseminated, raided and even destroyed if located on resource rich lands. Many men were killed and women forced into slavery during these acts of ethnocide. Countless fell ill to diseases the Europeans brought with them, for example smallpox, measles, chicken pox, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and other forms of the flu virus. Name They are known by a number of names; Caiabi, Parua, Maquiri, Kawaiwete and many more romanizations of the word Kaiabi. History The Kaiabi people along with other indigenous peoples occupied large areas within Brazil. In relatively self-reliant villages all along the coast of Brazil and mouth of the amazon, these people thrived as fisherman, hunters and farmers. The ever-increasing presence of Europeans systematically caused a cultural hemorrhage of the Kaiabi People. In 1961 after centuries of forced contact and inhumane treatment at the hands of European settlers and companies, an area was finally allocated for the indigenous peoples of Brazil who faced the same grievances as the Kaiabi. An indigenous reserve comprising about 6.9 million acres of land that today houses about 5,500 inhabitants, including 1,000 Kaiabi, from 17 different clans; Parque Ind√≠gena do Xingu. The Kaiabi People first began moving into Xingu Indigenous Park during the early 1950s. The Kaiabi People faced encroachment of their lands and culture by commercial companies, therefore they fled to the Xingu Indigenous Park. There were three distinct migrations; the first in the 1950s from the upper Teles Pires River area in the state of Mato Grosso, another in 1966 from the Peixes River area (a tributary of the Arinos River), lastly during the 1970s and the early 1990s other Kaiabi families migrated from the State of Par√° located down the Teles Pires River. As mentioned before the Kaiabi began moving to the Park not only to protect their culture but also to evade persecution from rubber tappers, loggers, farmers, miners and other Euro-Brazilians who forced them from their lands, raped their women, or murdered them. Presently, about 200 Kayabi still live in their traditional homelands outside of the Xingu Reserve, these stay only because of the ancestors who are buried on there. The Kaiabi fervently believe that spirits exist even after their bones have turned to dust. They believe that these spirits can be communicated with and sought after for blessings, protection etc. Therefore, as a form of respect some Kaiabi refuse to leave these lands but most importantly the bones of their ancestors. Language The official language of the Kaiabi people is their native tongue. Referred to as the Kayab√≠ Language. This language shares certain commonalities with the Tupi-Guarani language . Economy Cassava root; a main staple of the Kaiabi Land for many cultures is a source of life, wealth and divination. For the Kaiabi people land is the embodiment of all three, to this day the Kaiabi maintains a strong connection to their lands. Though considered a \\"tradition\\" peoples their methods of agriculture are quite vast. Their horticulture is extremely diversified, containing dozens of varieties of domesticated plants and a fairly elaborate agricultural system. As a result of their agriculturally based society there are four main seasons throughout the year. They are the cutting down of shrubs and trees (May), clearing of the debris (June), burning of the cleared area (August) and finally planting in September and October. These practices are similar to what we know as slash-and-burn. Harvesting of crops is dependent on the method of cultivation employed. The Kaiabi people have two basic types of cultivation fields or farms: namely, poly-variety manioc(cassava) fields and poly-cultural fields after the slash- and-burn technique. Planted almost exclusively in the first are the different varieties of manioc used for the production of flour, bread and porridges. Planted in the poly-cultural swiddens are various species demanding better soil types (areas of black earth): maize, cotton, peanut, potato, yam, banana, beans, sugarcane, pumpkin and watermelon and many other staples the Kaiabi depend on. The dietary practices of the Kaiabi mirror that of their agriculture. Their dishes are organic, natural and diversifies greatly. Even today seafood and wild game are still important staples in their diet. A typical meal would consist of flour from the cassava root, which could be made into bread and ate along with a fish dish. Also juices from the pulp of fruits, corn, peanuts and many other products are consumed. Religion Unlike western ideology that time is linear, many indigenous people believe that time is cyclical. Which in turn connects the people who came before to those still living. However, because the presence of supernatural beings is not felt by every individual, a person who acts as an intermediary between humans and the supernatural world is needed. Within the Kayabi society there are numerous shamans, who fulfills the intercessory role. According to Tori McElroy an online journalist the role of a shaman includes \\"Going Around In Circles\\" in his article he states that a shaman understands the concept of The Circle of Life. In other words, we are born, we live and we die; some sooner than others but the process is still the same. Just as the seasons spring, summer, fall and winter represent different times of the harvest, so do they mirror our journey in life. A shaman is tasked with the great responsibility of understanding each stage and giving advise, helping, healing and teaching as needed for the common good of the community. This often means placing the needs of the society first, before your needs or the needs of your family. It can be said that Shamans are protectors of the traditions that the Kaiabi hold dear. there is no question that Shamans are special and important members of society however they don't exactly participate in the normal everyday life activities of the community. It is believed that shamans gained the gift of divination through an encounter with a grave sickness, and with this event a link between the supernatural and human worlds is created. Culture Cosmology According to the Kaiabi the universe is divided up into overlapping segments. It is home to various powerful beings. Some of these beings take on the form of animals called \\"animal chiefs\\", the \\"anyang and mama'e\\" which according to the Kaiabi have the power to take the souls of humans. In the western point of view this deities are similar to Death. Also there are cultural heroes who are believed to have taught the Kaiabi their way of life. And finally, within the universe there are Gods and shamans of the sky. This cosmological tale is how the Kaiabi believe they came in existence, it is how they see themselves and understand their place within this world. Every animal, and when they say animal that includes Humans possess an \\"ai'an\\" which means the soul. The Kaiabi believe that humans are not given souls at their births, but receives it when they are given their names. The naming process is a very important event in the life of a Kaiabi, their names reflect the community in which they live, one is given a name based on the day that his is born. and whether or not he is the first, second, third etc. child for his parents. Naming Scheme Names and the naming process are significant within the Kaiabi culture. Each Kaiabi individual acquires several names at their birth, and throughout their lifetime. These names represent a range of personal events or accomplishments such as a rise in status or life-altering personal experiences. Names can be taken from ancestors or occurrences within the community (such as market day, the one day of the week, or second day of the week) and many more. The child is responsible for making his or her name known to the rest of the society. Art/Craft The material culture of the Kaiabi people is extremely diverse and intricate. Their most notable self manufactured item is the sieve. There are different types of sieves such as the \\"ap√†s\\" and the basket which is woven and designed by the men of the village. The women engage in hammock and sling making. Which are woven by cotton grown and harvested in their own fields. Presently, the main items of produce are collars made from tucum palm, either smooth or designed with animal inspired figures, also manufactured by women.

Unfortunately, most of the show's initial plotlines revolved around Tyler and his star-crossed Romeo & Juliet romance with Julie Clegg, a union complicated by his capture in war torn N'Shoba, Julie's amnesia, and opposition just from about everyone in town. After the two finally made it to the altar in July 1983, Tyler ran for his brother-in-law's Congressional seat, and although he lost the election, he was appointed to a special crime commission that sought to destroy an international crime cartel operating out of the Caribbean. In March 1985, the Pan-Caribbean investigation in full swing, Tyler mysteriously vanished. 1985‚Äì1987 Two months later, he was rescued from an Italian monastery where he'd been held captive by Pan-Caribbean criminals. Still tall, hunky, square- jawed, and dull, the new, improved Tyler did possess one attribute...better acting skills. He and wife Julie quickly made the grievous error of buying their black market baby Allison from Trey's unscrupulous attorney Austin Sinclair. Unbeknownest to Tyler, the adoption had been arranged by Sandy Vincent, chief flunky to crooked Senator Josh Harrington, head of the Pan- Caribbean cartel. Tyler soon found himself having to choose between his new daughter and the criminal investigation to which he'd devoted much of his life. Eventually, he busted Harrington, exposed the cartel, and left to take an Interpol job in Geneva, Switzerland.

Founding  The Center for Black Equity (CBE) is an organization birthed from a history of pride in the LGBT community. Before its time there were celebration of LGBT pride in DC hosted by the Club House a LGBT club that was occupied main by the Black LGBT community. The Club House started hosting what was called \\"Children's Hour\\", a themed party celebrated on Memorial Day. The \\"Children's Hour\\" brought members of the LGBT community together in celebration and awareness for each other. The Club House hosted this event for fifteen years before being forced to stop in 1990. Unfortunately, the Club House had to cease business due to financial problems and key members of the staff being affected by AIDS. After the Club House closed down there was a void left. Children's Hour had been a unifying celebration for the LGBT community and all of sudden it was gone. This absence inspired a group of Black queer men and women, Welmore Cook, Theodore Kirkland and Ernest Hopkins, to join together and carry out the legacy of \\"Children's Hour\\" and from there became Black Pride. This continuation of Black Pride events went on for eight years, expanding to multiple cites, states, and continents. In 1999 Welmore Cook, Theodore Kirkland and Ernest Hopkins, the founders of Black Pride, decided to create a more inclusive organization that would serve as a network that would connect all Black Prides together to have unifying message that would increase their chances of visibility, outreach to prevent and educate the Black LGBT community on HIV/AIDS, and funding opportunities. They would title this organization as the International Federation of Black Pride (IFBP). This network of encompassed Black Prides from all over the world ; Albany, NY; Buffalo, NY; Rochester, NY; Boston; New York City; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; Washington, DC; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Charlotte; Columbia, SC; Atlanta; Jacksonville; Central Florida (Tampa); Jackson, MS; Memphis; Nashville; New Orleans; St. Louis; Indianapolis; Chicago; Detroit; Twin Cities (Minneapolis); Little Rock; Dallas; Austin; Portland; Los Angeles; San Diego; Toronto, Canada; London, UK and Johannesburg, South Africa. The following Black Prides are in the IFBP membership pipeline: Columbus, OH; Oakland, CA; Gainesville, FL; Orlando; Virginia Beach and Greensboro, NC. Also, Latino Prides in New York; Boston; Portland, OR; Chicago and Washington, DC. The IFBP organization decided that their brand wasn't aligning with their mission and services that had and is still growing today. On July 28, 2012, the board of IFBP decided to change there brand from International Federation of Black Pride to Center for Black Equity (CBE). As IFBP The International Federation of Black Prides was organized during D.C. Black Pride of May 1999 by a coalition of Black Pride organizers representing Chicago, North Carolina, New York City, Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC. The coalition saw a need to organize the twenty plus Black Prides in the United States and abroad for the purpose of developing sponsorship strategies, providing technical assistance, networking, mentoring, and supporting one another. IFBP acquired its IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit status in November 2004.  Importance  The Center for Black Equity serves as a beneficial tool for Black LGBT persons who deal with the duality of being black and LGBT. CBE is the only organization in the world strictly focused on the Black LGBT experience. The disproportionate effect of HIV/AIDS on the black LGBT community compared to their white counterparts serves as a driving force within CBE. The Black LGBT community also face work discrimination, issues in housing opportunity, and lack of medical access more than White LGBT persons. The CBE intentionally networks with CBOs (Community Based Organizations) to reach to the Black LGBT community to do health screenings, and they assist in connecting them to care and making sure they stay in care. This support system is an integral part in the Black LGBT community that is disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, Black gay and bisexual men account for the highest number of HIV/AIDS cases in the United States.

Early life Ludwig was born in Uhlbach (near Stuttgart) in the state of W√ºrttemberg. His father was a clergyman and served as his childhood teacher. At the age of 10, he was sent to attend the Latin school at Markgr√∂ningen. Ludwig showed promise in medicine at an early age, and at 14, he went to Neuenburg to continue his classical studies while beginning to study medicine under a surgeon.There are several places called Neuenburg, and it is uncertain which one this was. ADB suggests either Neuenburg am Rhein or Neuenb√ºrg. Ludwig received a certificate of proficiency in 1807, whereupon he went on to study surgery, medicine, and obstetrics at the University of T√ºbingen. His performance was so exemplary that he was awarded a gold medal by King Frederick I in 1809‚Äîbefore graduating‚Äîfor the advancement of surgery. In July 1811, Ludwig received his doctorate. Unfortunately, before he could commence his study tour, Napoleon attempted to conquer Russia, and previously exempt students were called to service. Ludwig served initially as the doctor for 3rd Infantry at the Schorndorf garrison, and subsequently as director for the W√ºrttemberg field hospital at Smolensk in 1812. He contracted typhus and was captured by the Russians; after recovering from typhus, he served as a Russian noblewoman's personal physician. Once he was freed from Russian capture in 1814, Ludwig returned home and directed a typhus hospital in Hohenheim, where he completed his military service in 1815. Career Shortly after leaving the military, Ludwig was honored with title of full professor of surgery and obstetrics at T√ºbingen in 1815. Before fulfilling it, however, he commenced his initially planned study tour that had been put off in light of the war. Upon returning to T√ºbingen in 1816, Ludwig, having experienced the equipment available at other facilities in Germany, immediately supplemented T√ºbingen clinic's own supplies and reference literature with his own salary. When supplies were similarly lacking in the following year, Ludwig petitioned the king for a higher salary. In response, Ludwig was appointed as one of King Wilhelm I's personal physicians (King Frederick had died the previous year). Ludwig remained in T√ºbingen until a successor could take his place in 1817. When Ludwig went to Stuttgart to serve the king, he was quickly recognized as a great diagnostician, and he was soon promoted to be the royal family's chief physician. He remained in Stuttgart for most of the remainder of his life; between 1835 and 1846, he served as director of the medical college, president of the W√ºrttemberg Medical Association, and chairman of the first Stuttgart scientific congress's medical section. Ludwig published his now-famous paper on Ludwig's angina with no title in 1836. A colleague dubbed the condition \\"Angina Ludovici\\" (Ludwig's angina) a year later. Later life Ludwig retired in 1855 at the age of 65. He never married. Beginning only in his seventies, the physician suffered several health problems, including a bladder stone removed during 1865 in two separate sessions a few months apart. Somewhat ironically, he died December 1865 a week after the onset of an unspecified neck inflammation, which was probably not the condition that bears his name.

History The Provincial Waterworks Authority was established on 28 February 1979, as a state enterprise under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. Prior to the creation of the PWA, water supply services in the provincial areas had been assigned to two government agencies‚Äîthe Department of Public Works (DOPW) was in charge of the water supply services in municipal areas outside the Bangkok metropolitan area, while the Department of Health (DOH) took care of rural areas. When the performance of these two agencies was found wanting, the government shifted water supply affairs, along with officials and employees, transferred from DOPW's provincial waterworks division and DOH's rural waterworks division, to the newly created Provincial Waterworks Authority. The governor of the PWA is Mr Seree Supratid. Operations As of end-May 2014, the PWA had 7,730 employees, 987 of them working at Bangkok headquarters, and the remaining 6,743 staffers working at 10 PWA regional offices and 233 waterworks across the country.

Its mission is to produce, distribute, and sell treated water in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan, and engage in related businesses synergistic with waterworks. The MWA began operations on 16 August 1967 under the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority Act B.E. 2510 (1967) to serve potable water to Bangkok, Nonthaburi Province, and Samut Prakan Province. , MWA's governor is Mr Prinya Yamasamit. The chairman of the MWA Board is Mr Vullop Phringphong. History In the reign of King Rama V, when Bangkok had a population of roughly 333,000, the king, returning from his first visit to Europe in 1897, ordered the establishment of a Sanitary Department to provide water to the Bangkok populace. Many still used water from rivers or canals, frequently the source of epidemics. The new department made a survey and dug up a distributary canal of the Chao Phraya River at Sam Lae Sub-district in Pathum Thani Province to the north of Bangkok. Water was drawn though this canal into Bangkok to supply cleaner water. In 1907, the king made a second visit to Europe. He found that most European countries produced clean, adequate water for their people. Returning to Thailand, he ordered the hiring of French experts to conduct a survey and make suggestions on water procurement for Bangkok. On 13 July 1909, the king decreed that the government would provide a modern water supply system for the people of Thailand. He ordered the Sanitary Department to dig and construct canals and install water pumps in order to deliver water to water treatment plants in the Sam Sen Sub-district. Pipes were installed underground to distribute water throughout the Bangkok area, at a cost of over four million baht and five years of construction. The king called the result \\"Bangkok Waterworks\\". The first water treatment plant was set up in 1914. Demand for water in Bangkok increased rapidly, from 10,000 to 13,000 metres3 per day, most of which was consumed at numerous public water spigots. People in the suburbs of Bangkok, with no water supply, carried pots to take water from them, especially in the summer, when the waterworks increased production to full capacity of 28,800 m3 per day, sufficient for the population at the time. The government's emphasis on improving water supplies in Bangkok led to the merging of the Nonthaburi municipality water supply, Samut Prakan's water supply, and Thonburi's water supply with those of Bangkok Waterworks. A new organization called the \\"Metropolitan Waterworks Authority\\", a public enterprise under the Interior Ministry, began operations on 16 August 1967. Operations The MWA draws raw water from two sources: the Chao Phraya River at Ban Krachaeng Sub-district, Mueang Pathum Thani District, Pathum Thani Province and from the Mae Klong Dam in Tha Muang District, Kanchanaburi Province. The water is treated with lime, chlorine, alum, and polyelectrolyte at four water treatment plants‚ÄîBang Khen, Sam Sen, Thonburi, and Maha Sawat. MWA's treated water is distributed to its 2,375,490 customers in five regional service areas via 37,700 km of water pipes. The 2018 average tariff for residential customers was 9.99 baht per cubic metre. Total consumption in FY2018 was 1,401.4 million m3. At end-September 2018, the MWA employed 5,365 persons. Water tariffs Charges for MWA water for residential users range from 8.50-14.45 baht per m3 depending on usage. These rates have evidently been unchanged since December 1999. MWA does not add waste water charges to water supply bills, despite clear evidence from international experience that this is best practice. Critics claim this exacerbates Thailand's water pollution problems for want of adequate funding. Financials MWA's fiscal year (FY) runs from 1 October to 30 September. In FY2018 (1 October 2017 ‚Äì 30 September 2018) MWA reported total assets of 75,100 million baht, revenues of 19,203 million baht, and a net profit of 7,519 million baht. Issues * Source water salinity: Thailand's frequent droughts cause the water level of the Chao Phraya River, one of MWA's two raw water sources, to plunge. At high tide in the Gulf of Thailand salt water intrudes up the river, causing an increase in salinity. , salinity levels have been within acceptable limits, but MWA has advised vulnerable customers to monitor or restrict their intake of salt.

Besides the wagon, other grave goods, like jewelry, bronze amphorae, iron weapons, and tack and harness gear were found. The wagon consists of a square-shaped, open- worked base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32 cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands in the center of the wagon. The bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports. Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to the wagon up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of the cult wagon . In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on the wagon. The depicted scene is interpreted as a sacrifice. The wagon presumably served as a cult object for the consumption of a libation. The Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon was restored in 2009 and is on display in the newly redesigned Archaeology Museum of Styrian Universalmuseum Joanneum at Schloss Eggenberg in Graz. A copy is on display in the museum in Judenburg.

Moore by Mark Setterfield, (ed.), Edward Elgar Publishing, 2006, p.1.  Theory  Moore emphasizes the mechanics of credit creation, particularly lines of credit extended by banks to large corporations on the money supply. He argues that the ability of commercial banks to extend credit is limited only by demand for money by creditworthy borrowers, as central banks are compelled to act to ensure there is always a sufficient supply of money for demand to be met (at their target interest rate). Moore contrasted his own \\"horizontalist\\" view of the money supply, shared by some post-Keynesian economists, with a more mainstream \\"structuralist\\" view of the economy, in which the quantity of money is supply- constrained.

Today, there are about 20 Black Gay Pride events all over the United States. The largest of these events have historically been D.C. Black Pride and Atlanta Black Pride. While black pride events started as early as 1988, D.C. Black Pride, which began in 1991, has been cited as one of the earliest celebrations. The D.C. Black Pride celebration started out of a tradition called the Children's Hour 15 years prior.  Center for Black Equity  A Black LGBT Pride Flag Formerly known as the International Federation of Black Prides until 2012, the Center for Black Equity (CBE), is an international organization dedicated to equality and social justice for black LGBT people. On October 13, 2013, CBE president Earl Fowles, along with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, announced a name change from IFBP to the Center for Black Equity. Though the organization began as a way to support the network of Black Gay Pride celebrations worldwide, CBE now also focuses on social justice issues as well. The International Federation of Black Prides started during DC Black Pride of May 1999 by a coalition of Black Pride organizers representing Chicago, North Carolina, New York City, Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC. The coalition saw a need to organize the twenty plus Black Prides in the United States and abroad for the purpose of developing sponsorship strategies, providing technical assistance, networking, mentoring, and supporting one another. IFBP acquired its IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit status in November 2004.  Most popular events  Attendee at the 2017 D.C. Black Pride event. The two largest black gay pride celebrations in the world are based in Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D.C.  Atlanta Black Pride  Created in 1996, Atlanta Black Pride weekend (ABPW) is the only official event for the black LGBT community in Atlanta. The event was partially inspired by a group of black gay friends who decided to have annual Labor Day picnics together at Piedmont Park.https://www.gaycities.com/outthere/45011/atlanta-black-pride-could-be- the-hottest-labor-day-party-ever/ It has grown to be the largest black gay pride event in the world with a plethora of events catering to the black LGBT community.https://thegavoice.com/pride/black-pride-atlanta-does-it-again/  D.C. Black Pride  D.C. Black Pride is the earliest and the second largest black LGBT pride event. The event first took place on Saturday, May 25, 1991 at Banneker Field. Like all black LGBT celebrations, it started because the community did not see themselves fairly represented during D.C's annual Capital Pride. Event sponsors include CBE and Capital Pride.

S. Nagabharana, starring H. G. Dattatreya and Master Vijay Raghavendra in the lead roles. At the 41st National Film Awards, the film was awarded the Best Feature Film in Kannada. It also won four awards at the 1993-94 Karnataka State Film Awards; Best Children Film, Best Music Director (C. Aswath), Best Child Actor - Male (Master Vijay Raghavendra) and Best Female Playback Singer (Manjula Gururaj). Plot Every child is full of potential talent. Tapped at the right time, harnessed for the right purpose and monitored in the proper path, it is possible to awaken the achiever inside the child, leading to great heights of excellence. In this process, just love and care are not enough. The objective should be clear and the path must be cleared. This is what the film tries to project. Mutha (Vijay Raghavendra) is a vibrant young boy. He belongs to the lower strata of society. He lives with his grandmother (Shanthamma), who is barely able to manage with small earnings, by selling firewood. Running fast was an integral part of Mutha. But neither he nor the people around him were aware of this innate talent. The playful Mutha becomes a lonely soul after the grandmother dies and becomes a bonded labourer in the house of village head. He is not only missing the love and care of grandmother, but also the freedom to go out and play with his friends. He manages to coax the village head into permitting him to take the cattle to the forest for grazing. Now he is back with his friends in the forest. His joy knows no bounds. One day, while they are playing, one of the cows goes astray. Frightened of the consequences, he runs away from the village and ultimately finds himself in a big city, Bengaluru. Everything is a strange experience for him there. He gets into a group of young boys engaged in shoe-lifting as a livelihood under the loving care and able guidance of Daada (H. G. Dattatreya). He is a lonely old man, who finds his own happiness in the company of these young lads. One day, when Mutha is running away with stolen shoes from a stadium, he is chased and caught by Saavant (Avinash), a professional coach training athletes in running. Instead of a thief, Saavant sees the potential of a great runner in Mutha. Saavant takes Mutha under his care and starts training him for running race. Slowly and steadily, Mutha comes up as an acknowledged runner and with hard training and perseverance, goes on to win the Gold Medal in the state level competition. He wants to bring all those Daada's boys also into Saavant's camp, so that they can also experience the thrill of a purposeful life as he has experienced. He persuades Daada and Saavant also convinces Daada. The boys join Mutha. Saavant trains them all and creates a fine team for the relay races. The team wins the relay race in All India Competition.

April 30 occupation of Iolani Palace grounds At around 9:00 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 2008, roughly seventy members of a group that described itself as the Hawaiian Kingdom Government blocked entrance to the grounds of Iolani Palace in a move to assert the group's purported status as the Hawaiian Kingdom's government. According to the group's leader, Mahealani Kahau, the group put up yellow \\"No Trespassing\\" signs at the entrances to the palace grounds to \\"give awareness and notice to everyone that passes that the Hawaiian Kingdom Government has resumed its lawful status as the seat of government.\\" Following negotiations between the group and the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the state agency with jurisdiction over the palace, the gates were reopened at around 2:00 p.m. No one was arrested. The group returned to the palace grounds the following day, but did not block the palace entrances and instead peacefully occupied a portion of the palace's lawn. Statehood Day occupation On August 15, 2008, independence proponents occupied Iolani Palace for four hours. The trespassing incident happened on Statehood Day 2008. On August 15, 2008, at 4:30 in the afternoon, 27 members of the so-called Kingdom of Hawaii Nation, a national-independence fringe faction, entered the grounds of Iolani Palace. The group was led by James Akahi, who claims descent from Kamehameha I and called himself \\"Majesty Akahi Nui, King of Hawaii\\". Fifteen to twenty members of the group wore red shirts with \\"SECURITY\\" printed in yellow on the backs while other members wore black.Honolulu Star Bulletin The purported mission of the group was to establish the palace as a new seat of government, undermine the State government, and declare the independence of Hawaii from the United States. Six to ten employees of the Friends of Iolani Palace, the nonprofit that administers the palace on behalf of the state, and the nonprofit's director, Kippen de Alba Chu, locked down the buildings and locked themselves inside the administrative building, located next to the palace. Facilities manager Noelani Ah Yuen attempted to stop the intruders from locking the east gate and was injured by the trespassers; she also withdrew into the administrative building. The group flew their flag and entered  ªIolani Barracks and Palace. During the trespassing incident, a city police officer refused to stop the trespassers because the palace grounds are state property and hence under the jurisdiction of the state police, the HDPS. Police chief Boisse Correa rejected claims his officers committed wrongdoing. Seven members of the group were arraigned on burglary charges. Charges against six were dismissed, and James Akahi was acquitted of felony burglary charges, but convicted of simple trespass and fined. Two group members were tried for assaulting an employee of the palace and acquitted.

As a founding member of the United Nations, India strongly supports the purposes and principles of the UN and has made significant contributions in implementing the goals of the Charter, and the evolution of the UN's specialised programmes and agencies. India has been a member of the UN Security Council for eight terms (a total of ongoing 16 years), with the most recent being the 2021‚Äì22 term. India is a member of G4, group of nations who back each other in seeking a permanent seat on the Security Council and advocate in favour of the reformation of the UNSC. India is also part of the G-77. India is a charter member of the United Nations and participates in all of its specialised agencies and organizations. India has contributed troops to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Korea, Egypt and the Congo in its earlier years and in Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon and Rwanda in recent years, and more recently in the South Sudan conflict. History UN Headquarters in New York 1st Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru at the UN General Assembly in 1948. India was one of the original members of the League of Nations. In principle, only sovereign states can become UN members. However, although today all UN members are fully sovereign states, four of the original members (Belarus, India, the Philippines, and Ukraine) were not independent at the time of their admission. India signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 and was represented by Girija Shankar Bajpai who was the Indian Agent-General at the time. Afterwards the Indian delegation led by Sir Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar signed the United Nations Charter on behalf of India during the historic United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco, United States on 26 June 1945. Sir A. Ramaswamy Mudaliar later went on to serve as the first president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Technically, India was a founding member in October 1945, despite it being a British colony. India, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia were all British colonies but were given independent seats in the United Nations General Assembly. India gained full independence in 1947. Independent India viewed its membership at the United Nations as an important guarantee for maintaining international peace and security. India stood at the forefront during the UN's tumultuous years of struggle against colonialism and apartheid. India's status as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 cemented its position within the UN system as a leading advocate of the concerns and aspirations of developing countries and the creation of a more equitable international economic and political order. India was among the most outspoken critics of apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa, being the first country to have raised the issue in the UN (in 1946). Activities UN General Assembly India was one of the founding members of the United Nations, joining in October 1945, two years before acquiring independence from Imperial Britain. By 1946, India had started raising concerns regarding colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination. From early 1947‚Äì48, India took an active part in Drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dr (Mrs). Hansa Mehta, a Gandhian political activist and social worker who led the Indian delegation, had made important contributions in drafting of the Declaration, especially highlighting the need for reflecting gender equality by changing the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 'all men are created equal' (Eleanor Roosevelt's preferred phrase) to 'all human beings'. In 1953, the chief delegate of India at the time, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was elected the first woman President of the UN General Assembly. India supported the struggle towards global disarmament and the ending of the arms race, and towards the creation of a more equitable international economic order. India had a mediatory role in resolving the stalemate over prisoners of war in Korea contributing to the signing of the armistice ending the Korean War in 1953. India chaired the five-member Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission while the Indian Custodian Force supervised the process of interviews and repatriation that followed. India then went on to chair the three international commissions for supervision and control for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos established by the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina. India also had an active role to play in the Suez Crisis in 1956 with the role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime minister and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement being significant. Indian historian Inder Malhotra wrote that \\"Now Nehru‚Äîwho had tried to be even-handed between the two sides‚Äîdenounced Anthony Eden (the then British Prime Minister) and co-sponsors of the aggression vigorous. He had a powerful, if relatively silent, ally in the US president Dwight D. Eisenhower who went to the extent of using America's clout in the IMF to make Eden and Mollet (the then French Prime Minister) behave\\". Charter provisions on Non- Self-Governing Territories were given a new thrust when the UN adopted the landmark 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples which was co-sponsored by India. The following year, the Special Committee on the Implementation of the Declaration on Decolonization was established to study, investigate and recommend action to bring an end to colonialism, it was chaired by India for the first time. India played a leading role in the formation of a Sub-Committee against Apartheid set up by the General Assembly. When the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination was adopted in 1965, India was among the earliest signatories, however it does not recognise competence under article 14 and it does not consider itself bound by article 22. India also played a prominent role in articulating the economic concerns of developing countries in such UN- sponsored conferences as the triennial UN Conference on Trade and Development and the 1992 Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. It has been an active member of the Group of 77, and later the core group of the G-15 nations. Other issues, such as environmentally sustainable development and the promotion and protection of human rights, have also been an important focus of India's foreign policy in international forums. UN Security Council Countries which host an Indian diplomatic mission.  Activities during 1947-1962  Despite its anti-status quo stand on many global issues, India's attitude toward the basic structure of the UN was fundamentally conservative. It accepted the organization and distribution of power in the UN, as both a guarantee of Indian sovereignty and as a check on the numerical superiority of the U.S. and its western coalition. India supported the charter provisions for a Security Council veto for the great powers, opposed the U.S. initiative to circumvent the veto through the Uniting for Peace Resolution, dismissed Hammarskj√∂ld's notion of a \\"UN presence\\" as interventionist and opposed all efforts to conduct UN directed plebiscites as tests of opinion. India's procedural conservatism was based both on its commitment to national sovereignty and its desire to protect Indian interests. Its experience with the UN had not always been positive. In the early years after independence, a whole range of issues, which had their origins in the partition of the Indian subcontinent between India and Pakistan, came before the UN. These issues included the disputed princely states of Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir, which were ultimately incorporated into the Indian Union through the use of military force. The most persistent of these disputes was the Kashmir conflict. Nehru's faith in the UN and adherence to its principles proved costly on some occasions due to the power play inherent in the organization. This was seen by his decision to refer Pakistan's intervention ('invasion') in disputed Kashmir to the UN Security Council in January 1948. The United Kingdom, which was hoping to avoid being seen as unfriendly to a Muslim state after the creation of Israel, used pressure tactics on its allies France, Canada and the US to support the Pakistani viewpoint that Kashmir's accession to India was disputable and had to be put to the test of a plebiscite. Nehru's hope that the UN would unconditionally instruct Pakistan to vacate the one-third portion of Kashmir that the Pakistani tribesmen and army had occupied fell flat in the face of geopolitical manoeuvrings and cross-issue linkage. To this day, Indian strategic commentators and critics of Nehru bemoan his cardinal mistake of taking the Kashmir dispute to a UN that was packed with pro-Pakistani partisan powers. According to columnist Brahma Chellaney, 'Nehru did not appreciate that the UN was an institution of power politics, not an impartial police force'. As if a double reminder were needed that India was small fry in a UN dominated by crafty Great Powers divided into two ideological camps, New Delhi was disappointed to find that Security Council members the US, United Kingdom and France tried to prevent it from forcibly absorbing the Portuguese colony of Goa in 1961. But for the Soviet veto in favour of India, Goa could have become enmeshed in another Kashmir-like stalemate for decades, buffeted by the changing winds of Great Power alignments and preferences that were paralysing and hijacking the UN. Overall the period from 1947-1962 was marked by India's active interest in all UN activities under the leadership of V. K. Krishna Menon who was the Indian Ambassador to the United Nations from 1952-1962. Indian leadership and peacekeeping roles in the UN brought it considerable recognition and global standing. The Phase from 1962-1976 India's defeat in the Sino-Indian War came as a grave shock in comparison to its global aspirations and recognition. Large scale hostilities and military reverses dealt a shattering blow to its self-confidence and pride. India was obliged to turn towards the west for military and political support. Following the conflict with China, India became involved in two wars with Pakistan and entered a period of political instability, economic stagnation, food shortages and near-famine conditions. India's role diminished in the UN which came both as a result of its image and a deliberate decision by the post-Nehru political leadership to adopt a low profile at the UN and speak only on vital Indian interests. This change in policy was implemented during the 1965 debate on Kashmir in the Security Council when Indian Foreign Minister Swaran Singh dramatically stormed out of the session in response to the intemperate language of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's Foreign Minister. In his book \\"India's Changing Role in the United Nations\\" Stanley Kochanek shows how 'bilateralism became the guiding principle of Indian foreign policy', relegating the UN to just an 'arena for maintaining such contacts'. Further the Soviet Union's backing became far more important than a slow and indecisive UN Security Council when India obtained its greatest strategic victory by beating China in the 1967 War and breaking up Pakistan into two and carving out independent Bangladesh in 1971. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear device, the aftermath of which resulted in a nuclear embargo by US and Canada. Soon after the UN's non-proliferation agenda became another irritant that forced New Delhi to view some units of the organization with distaste as fronts for imposing discriminatory regimes instead of promoting universal disarmament. From the very beginning it has refused to lend its support to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty with India's then External Affairs Minister and later President, Pranab Mukherjee in a visit to Tokyo in 2007 commenting that: \\"If India did not sign the NPT, it is not because of its lack of commitment for non-proliferation, but because we consider NPT as a flawed treaty and it did not recognise the need for universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment.\\" In short, the 1960s as a whole saw major changes in the global system but a general decline in UN activities.  Activities since 1976  From January 2011 to January 2013, India was a non permanent member of the UN Security Council. According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of India's foreign policy, as a non-permanent member from January 2011 to January 2013, India played a crucial role on important international issues with a view to promote international peace and security as well as India's own national security. Seeking of Permanent Seat in UNSC thumb|right|450px|Countries that explicitly and openly support India for UNSC permanent seat. India has been elected eight times to the UN Security Council. India has been seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a member of the G4, an organization composed of Brazil, Germany, Japan, and India, all who are currently seeking permanent representation. The Russian Federation, United States, United Kingdom and France support India and the other G4 countries gaining permanent seats. According to the G4 proposal, the UN Security Council should be expanded beyond the current fifteen members to include twenty-five members. If this actually happens, it would be the first time permanent Security Council status is extended to a South Asian nation and supporters of the G4 plan suggest that this will lead to greater representation of developing nations rather than the current major powers. India makes a number of claims to justify its demand. India has the world's second largest population and is the world's largest liberal democracy. It is also the world's fifth largest economy and third largest in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2020. India is the largest contributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions with 7,860 personnel deployed with ten UN Peacekeeping Missions as of 2014 after Bangladesh and Pakistan, all three nations being in South Asia. India has contributed more than 180,000 troops, the largest number from any country, participated in more than 43 missions and 156 Indian peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice while serving in UN missions. India has also provided and continues to provide eminent Force Commanders for UN Missions. Although the U.S. and other permanent Council members were not very supportive of expanding the Security Council, in his visit to India, US President Barack Obama has offered his support for India to become a permanent member of the Council. However, the reaction from other Council members are not very clear, particularly from China. Thus it is uncertain whether the demands by G4 nations will be implemented anytime soon. As of 2018 and according to The Economic Times, Pakistan has affirmed that it remains \\"firmly opposed\\" the creation of new seats in the council. In September 2017 House Resolution 535 was introduced in the 115th United States Congress to support India's permanent seat in UN security council, but the legislation did not proceed to a hearing in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Others International Court of Justice From 1945 to present, a total of 3 members from India have been appointed as Judges of the International Court of Justice, the primary judicial branch of the United Nations. Moreover, Nagendra Singh was appointed as the President from 1985 to 1988. In addition, 3 member have also served as Judges sitting ad hoc. Now India's Supreme Court Justice 'Justice: Dalveer Bhandari' has been appointed as the judge in International Court of Justice for a second term. Justice Dalveer Bhandari has studied at JNVU Jodhpur and served as judge in both high court and The Supreme Court in India. UN Audit In November 2016, Vinod Rai was appointed as Chairman of UN Panel of External Auditors and Shashi Kant Sharma as Member of the United Nations Board of Auditor General. Joint Inspection Unit Joint Inspection Unit is the only independent external oversight body of the United Nations system mandated to conduct evaluations, inspections and investigations system-wide. Achamkulangare Gopinathan currently serves as Chairman, since January 2013. He was re-appointed to this post. Model United Nations The logo of the BESC Assembly of Nations, organised by the Bhawanipur Education Society College, in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Many schools in India have now started taking up Model United Nations to educate their students about global issues. Peacekeeping So far India has taken part in 43 Peacekeeping missions with a total contribution exceeding troops and a significant number of police personnel having been deployed. In 2014 India is the third largest troop contributor (TCC) with 7,860 personnel deployed with ten UN Peacekeeping Missions of which 995 are police personnel, including the first female formed Police Unit under the UN. The Indian Army has undertaken numerous UN peacekeeping missions. As of 30 June 2014, 157 Indians have been killed during such operations. The Indian army has also provided paramedical units to facilitate the withdrawal of the sick and wounded. In service to the United Nations, Satish Nambiar was appointed as 1st Force Commander and Head of Mission of UNPROFOR and Jai Shanker Menon as Head of Mission and Force Commander of United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. According to UN estimates, India is currently the fourth-largest police-contributing country with 1,009 officers, and the third-largest contributor of female police officers. As of February 2017, 163 Indians have been killed while serving in UN peacekeeping operations. As of 16 April 2019, the United Nations had arrears of USD 38 million to India for its troop contributions. Initiatives International Yoga Day On 11 December 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted without a vote a resolution commemorating 21 June as the International Yoga Day, recognising the holistic benefits of this timeless practice and its inherent compatibility with the principles and values of the United Nations. Plea for International Equality Day In 2016, with focus on combating inequalities to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, B. R. Ambedkar's birth anniversary was observed at the United Nations for the first time. India has made a plea to declare April 14 as International Equality Day. Financial contribution For FY 2015-16, India's contribution to the United Nations was , which was 55 per cent more compared with the previous fiscal. India is one of the main contributors to the UN regular budget. Indian contribution to United Nations Democracy Fund was USD 250 million for 2009. Representation India has a permanent mission to the UN, which is led by the Permanent Representative (UN Ambassador), currently T. S. Tirumurti , who was appointed in April 2020.

First World War Keeble entered the Royal Naval Air Service as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant, and on 2 August 1915 was confirmed in his rank of flight sub-lieutenant for temporary service. He was assigned to a squadron in No. 1 Wing, based at Saint-Pol-sur-Mer, Dunkirk, and gained his first victory while flying a Nieuport. On 25 January 1916 he forced down a German seaplane off Nieuwpoort. His second victory did not come until 23 October when, flying a Sopwith Pup, he destroyed another seaplane off Nieuwpoort. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, which was gazetted on 11 May 1917. His citation read: ;Distinguished Service Cross > Flt.-Lieut. Noel Keeble, R.N.A.S. :For conspicuous gallantry on the 23rd > October, 1916, when he attacked four German seaplanes and brought one of > them down in a vertical nose-dive into the sea.

On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Keeble became part of No. 202 Squadron RAF, flying the DH.4 two- seater day bomber. With Captain Eric Betts as his observer/gunner he went on to gain four more aerial victories; firstly destroying a Pfalz D.III north of Essen on 5 June, then driving down out of control a Fokker D.VII over Bruges on 10 August. Finally, on 16 September, he destroyed a Pfalz D.III over Lissewege and a Fokker D.VII over Dudzele. Keeble was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 20 September 1918.

Inter-war career Post-war, Keeble was granted a short service commission as a flight lieutenant in the RAF, but this was later cancelled and he was granted a permanent commission from 1 August 1919. He served at No. 6 Flying Training School until being transferred to the School of Technical Training on 1 April 1922, but was soon transferred again, being posted to the RAF College Cadet Flying Wing at Cranwell on 8 August. On 23 February 1923 he was sent to Iraq to serve in No. 30 Squadron, before returning to England to serve at the Electrical and Wireless School at RAF Flowerdown from 20 August 1925. On 7 April 1927 he was posted to the RAF Depot at RAF Uxbridge. He later returned to Iraq to serve in No. 1 Armoured Car Company from 7 October 1930, and then at the Aircraft Depot at RAF Hinaidi from 2 May 1932.

Biography Origins Gustav Klaudat was born in eastern Prussia. He was serving in a Uhlan regiment during World War I when he transferred to aviation. Although it was customary for German pilots to serve in reconnaissance or artillery direction units as seasoning before becoming fighter pilots, nothing is known of Klaudat's service before he joined a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 15, in 1918.Franks et al 1993, p. 144. Service as a fighter pilot Klaudat flew a Fokker D.VII painted in the squadron colors of blue tail and red nose. To that he added an overpainted personal marking of a Uhlan lance sporting a black and white banner. On 20 July 1918, just after his arrival at Jasta 15, Klaudat lent his aircraft to his squadron leader, Rudolph Berthold, who crashed it. Klaudat had to be supplied with another mount; he received one with a highly prized BMW engine.VanWyngarden 2006, pp. 78, 85. At 1220 hours on 15 August 1918, he shot down a Caudron R.11 over Conecticourt. Two days later, at 1710 hours, it was the turn of a Spad XIII that fell over Beaurains; it has variously been attributed as being from the 94th Aero Squadron USAS, or as being Jean Bozon- Verduraz.Gutmann 2002, p. 32. On 21 August 1918, Klaudat shot down a Breguet 14 south of Chaunay at 1650 hours. A week later, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. On 13 September, Klaudat shot down two Spad XIIIs on two different sorties for victories four and five. On 16 September 1918, he fought in the dog fight that brought down Maurice Boyau; Klaudat was credited with shooting down Boyau's wingmanFranks et al 2003, p. 69. at midday over St- Hilaire. That was his last victory, although a 1 October combat claim of another Spad XIII would be undecided. On 23 October 1918, Gustav Klaudat was wounded severely enough in the left humerus, probably by Eddie Rickenbacker, to be removed from action for the remainder of the war.VanWyngarden 2005, pp. 109, 112.Gutmann 2008, p. 105.

It is served by two daily Amtrak trains on the Empire Builder, which travels west to Seattle and east to Chicago. The station has one platform and is located northeast of downtown Leavenworth, which is noted for its Bavarian village theme. Leavenworth was served by the Great Northern Railway from 1893 until the cancellation of passenger service in the 1950s. The railroad and its successor, Amtrak, continued to run excursion trains and other special services until 1991. The local government began lobbying for a permanent train station in the early 2000s and earned funding from the federal government and private donations. The permanent station, named Icicle Station, opened in September 2009 after three months of construction. Description Icicle Station is located northeast of downtown Leavenworth on North Road. It consists of a single platform on the south side of a double-tracked section of the Scenic Subdivision, owned and operated by BNSF Railway. The platform is long and has two small covered shelters, a bicycle rack, and a portable toilet. The station has 20 short-term parking stalls and a small cabin with a passenger waiting room. History Amtrak platform at dusk Leavenworth was founded in 1892, shortly after the Great Northern Railway arrived in the area to begin construction of its route across Stevens Pass towards Seattle, which was completed on January 6, 1893. The town grew around the railroad, as Great Northern operated mines and lumber mills in the area, until the railroad relocated its train operations in 1926. Great Northern ceased its regular passenger train service to Leavenworth in the mid-1950s, but continued to run special trains from Seattle to serve spectators for the city's annual ski jumping competition. A city program in the 1960s promoted the renovation of buildings to fit a Bavarian Alpine theme that successfully began to draw tourists to Leavenworth. Annual excursion trains for the Autumn Leaf Festival and holiday festivals began in 1964, which were initially operated by Great Northern and funded by a nonprofit group until private travel agencies took over. The excursion trains continued for a year under Burlington Northern, the successor to Great Northern, and Amtrak after it took over national passenger rail operations in 1971. The excursion trains were canceled in 1991 because of inadequate facilities and partially replaced by a free shuttle bus from Wenatchee station. The regional economic development council and the Port of Chelan County began studying the feasibility of year-round train service to Leavenworth in the early 1990s. The two agencies lured an undisclosed company from Utah to run an all-year weekend dinner train service after negotiations with Burlington Northern and Amtrak in 1993, including the construction of a platform in Leavenworth and a depot to fit the city's Bavarian theme. Negotiations with Burlington Northern were stalled over scheduling issues and existing freight congestion, but civic boosters in Leavenworth returned with alternate proposals the following year. In April 1995, Amtrak announced its interest in adding a Leavenworth stop to the transcontinental Empire Builder if a platform were to be built with local funding. The port proposed joint funding of the platform with Leavenworth on the condition that Amtrak would commit to adding service once construction was completed. Amtrak and the port entered into further negotiations with an undisclosed tour operator who would organize potential excursion trains during the holiday season and other festival periods, rather than using the Empire Builder. The tour operator, Alki Tours, began running holiday excursion trains in December 1996. Amtrak, the port, and the local chamber of commerce contributed to funding a new temporary platform on North Road for the excursion train. Alki Tours also chartered a special round-trip train between Seattle and Spokane for the Lilac Festival in 1997, with a stop in Leavenworth. Following a second market feasibility study in 2002, the Leavenworth city government began campaigning for a permanent all-year stop on the Empire Builder to be located on North Road. The proposal earned the support of U.S. Senator Patty Murray and state senator Linda Evans Parlette, and the city government entered into negotiations with Amtrak and BNSF Railway. The city was awarded a $75,000 grant from the federal government to initiate design work on the station project, which would be funded by a mix of government grants and private donations. In February 2007, Amtrak and BNSF gave conditional approval for an Empire Builder stop in Leavenworth that would begin after completion of the permanent station, named \\"Icicle Station\\". In the agreement with BNSF, the city government was required to acknowledge that the Empire Builder could move to the Stampede Pass corridor and bypass Leavenworth entirely. The $750,000 project received $250,000 from the state government and $300,000 from the federal government's development funds, in addition to $200,000 raised by the city government. The station was designed by HNTB and split into two project phases, to be built on a former BNSF staging area. The first phase would construct a platform, two shelters, and a parking lot. The second phase would include a larger, Bavarian-style shelter, additional parking stalls, and a longer platform. In May 2008, the first phase's estimated cost was revised to $850,000, with the shortfall planned to covered by private donations in a funding campaign launched by the city mayor. The planned opening date of November 2008 was also delayed to September 2009. By the end of the year, the city government had raised an additional $175,000 to cover the construction of the first phase. Construction of Icicle Station began in late June 2009 shortly after the bid was awarded to a Wenatchee firm. The first half of the platform was completed in July and the second half was poured in early August. Icicle Station was opened on September 25, 2009, with a crowd of 200 people attending a dedication ceremony upon the arrival of the first eastbound train from Seattle. The new station served 4,461 passengers in its first four months of service, exceeding ridership estimates set by Amtrak. In January 2013, a small cabin was installed in the station's parking lot to act as a warming shelter for passengers. The second phase of the station project remains partially funded, with $900,000 allocated by the federal government in 2010. Services Icicle Station is served by two daily Amtrak trains on the Empire Builder, a transcontinental route connecting to Seattle, Spokane, and Chicago. The next stops on the Empire Builder are Everett to the west and Wentachee to the east. During Saturdays in December, Alki Tours offers daytime excursion trains between Seattle and Leavenworth using chartered Amtrak trains. The station has no direct bus service, with Northwestern Trailways and Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach using a separate facility in Leavenworth on U.S. Route 2. A private company, Leavenworth Shuttle & Taxi, operates fixed-rate taxi service between Icicle Station and other areas of Leavenworth. Link Transit, the local transit operator serving Leavenworth, does not operate buses that reach the station.

Early life Howard Clayton Knotts (25 August 1895--23 November 1942) was the son of district attorney Edward Knotts, and was reared in Carlinville, Illinois. He graduated from college in 1915.Over The Front: The Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914-1918, p. 50. World War I The younger Knotts joined the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps on 31 July 1917. Knotts was sent to Toronto for training. His first assignment was stateside, in the 182nd Aero Squadron; he joined them in Fort Worth on 5 November 1917. On 4 February 1918, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. On 14 August, he was forwarded to the 17th Aero Squadron in France. Once there, he used a Sopwith Camel to destroy six Fokker D.VIIs in the month from 25 August to 24 September 1918. He was then shot down by ground fire on 14 October 1918, suffering a wound in his right foot in the process. He landed behind German lines and shot it out with five infantrymen, who finally captured him. Once placed on a train to the Prisoner of War camp, Knotts managed to set fire to the train, ruining seven Fokker D.VIIs. He narrowly escaped being shot for sabotage. Four days later, he temporarily escaped from the Mons prisoner of war camp. Sneaking off from a work detail, he hid in a French chateau being used as a German billet. He was then shipped to a camp at Soignies to sit out the war. Postwar Knotts left the military in 1919. He graduated from Yale in 1921. On 25 June 1921, he married Charlotte Ann Sterling, the daughter of John Allen Sterling and niece of Thomas Sterling. Knotts became a principal in his own law firm of Knotts and Dobbs. He was co-author of the Illinois Aeronautics Act of 1931. In 1934, he became chairman of the Illinois State Bar Association's section on aeronautical law. He was also chairman of the American Legion's national aeronautics commission. On 27 April 1937, he became editor of the Journal of Air Law published by Northwestern University.The Daily Northwestern (Evanston, Illinois), 27 April 1937, p. 3, per The Aerodrome website Howard Clayton Knotts died of a heart attack on 23 November 1942. Honors and awards Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Howard Clayton Knotts, Second Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Arieux, France, September 17, 1918. During a patrol flight 5 American planes were attacked by 20 enemy Fokkers. During the combat, when Lieutenant Knotts saw one of his comrades attacked by 7 enemy planes and in imminent danger of being shot down, he, although himself engaged with the enemy, went to the assistance of his comrade and attacked 2 of his immediate pursuers. In the fight which ensued he shot 1 of the enemy down in flames and forced the other out of control. His prompt act enabled his comrade to escape destruction, although his comrade's plane was so disabled that he made the allied lines with difficulty, crashing as he landed. General Orders No. 19, W.D., 1921 Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) On August 25, 1918 he shot down from two thousand feet, over the Bapaume-Cambrai Road, on Fokker biplane. \\"On September 13, 1918 he shot down from four thousand feet, near Inchy-en-Artois, northeast of Bapaume, on Fokker biplane. \\"On September 17, 1918, with Lieutenant William T. Clements, he shot down from four thousand feet, near Arleux, a Fokker biplane. \\"On September 22, 1918 he shot down from six thousand feet, near Marquion (east by south of Arras), a Fokker biplane. \\"On September 24, 1918 he shot down from six thousand feet, just north of Bourlon Wood, two Fokker biplanes; while flying alone on the afternoon of the same date, trying to confirm and locate an enemy aeroplane shot down by Lieutenant Campbell in the forenoon, he saw a detachment of enemy troops on the Bapaume-Cambrai Road and at once attacked them; as he dived upon them he noticed at the side of the road past which the troops were marching a large ammunition dump, into which he fired incendiary tracer bullets which started several fires and in a few moments the dump blew up. The explosion was seen by many pilots who were in the air at that time, and by observers on the ground some fifteen miles away. \\"On October 8, 1918, having completed a low bombing attack on enemy troops in Awoingt on which his flight had been sent out, Lieutenant Knotts saw a closed German staff car passing along the road through the villages of Naves. Of his own accord and although subjected to heavy machine-gun fire from nests along the road, he followed and attacked the car from just above the tree tops as it rushed through the village until it left the road and turned over. He then noticed two enemy officers roll out of the car, one of whom lay where he fell, and returning shot the other officer who started to run away. \\"Lieutenant Knotts' flying showed the greatest disregard of danger, and over and over again he did not hesitate to fly very low in spite of the fire from the ground, thereby bringing back valuable reconnaissance material and seriously harassing the enemy's movements during their retreat. Whilst so flying on October 4, 1918 his engine was put out of action by ground fire, east of Saulzoir, and he was made a prisoner. Whilst a prisoner in Germany he was subjected to great exposure and his physical condition has been such that he has been in hospital ever since his return.

Biography Early life Kurt K√ºppers was born in 1894, birthplace unknown. An early interest in aviation led him to gain pilot's license No. 492, granted on 22 August 1913.Franks et al 1993, p. 152. Service in military aviation K√ºppers was serving in the Luftstreitkr√§fte when World War I began. However, his first known assignment was as a pilot of two-seater reconnaissance aircraft in the vicinity of Dunkirk in 1916. After that, he served on the Eastern Front with Flieger-Abteilung (Flier Detachment) 45, a recon unit. Although it goes unmentioned in records, he must have undergone fighter pilot's training, because his next posting was to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 6 (Jasta 6), in March 1917. Between 16 March and 12 July 1917, he scored four aerial victories. However, in August 1917, K√ºppers transferred to Kampfstaffel (Tactical Bomber Squadron) 14 as a bomber pilot; there he flew a Gotha bomber to convey his friend Fritz Lorenz on several raids on England. K√ºppers returned to Jasta 6 in October. He scored his fifth credited aerial victory on 23 November 1917. On 16 December 1917, he was tasked to form and command a new fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 48 (Jasta 48). On 6 March 1918, he scored his sixth and final victory. He remained in command of Jasta 48 until he was relieved from combat on 23 August 1918.

Heritage value  Entrance of Pedder Building (2009) The Pedder Building is listed as a \\"Grade II Historic Building\\" by the Hong Kong Antiquities and Monuments Office (grading awarded in 1981), and there are proposals to upgrade its status to Grade I. The building occupies a narrow site of with an arcade at the front entrance on Pedder Street. It consists of nine storeys plus one mezzanine floor and a basement, and stands above street level. The architectural design of the building is typical 1920s office style, with stone cladding on its base and Neo-classical elements such as arches, mouldings, a triangular-shaped pediment, columns and sculpted medallions. The architecture of the building follows a vertical layout, distinguished by a ground-floor on two levels, a mezzanine and four office floors, adorned with an in relief portico, directly above the main entrance, and finally one floor encircled by a balcony surmounted by two neutral levels. It is the oldest commercial edifice in town, and has survived a world war and the better part of a century.Vines, Stephen(2002). 'Colonial Hong Kong: A Guide', p 47\\\\. Form Asia, Hong Kong. There is an intermediate moulding above the three main entrance arches which used to be lined with a row of gargoyle masks flanked on the two ends by two giant bronze figures. However, in 1990, the gargoyles came loose and fell off, and the ornaments were subsequently removed. Symbolising the colonial history of Hong Kong, the building showcases Hong Kong as an international city, where western and eastern culture merge. Nevertheless, owners Henry Fok Estates have shied from their custodial role of the heritage site, with managing director Ian Fok Chun-wan saying it is becoming harder for owners to conserve heritage buildings because of tight regulations and a lack of incentives or benefits. Occupants Shanghai Tang shop front on the ground floor Abercrombie & Fitch shop interior Occupying the ground floor and basement area of the building, Shanghai Tang was one of the prominent tenants in the building. The shop was founded by a local businessman, David Tang, and it is well known for selling pre-war retro-styled Chinese fashion. Oriental Chinese restaurant China Tee Club, founded in 1986 by former Miss Hong Kong Loletta Chu and her two sisters, is located on the first floor of the building. It used to be members- only but now it serves non-members for dinner. On the first floor and above there are more than a dozen small stores selling garments, jewellery, fashion and similar. One floor houses a number of clinics. In July 2011, it was announced that fashion clothing giant Abercrombie & Fitch would take over three main floors and the basement for a new store, ousting Shanghai Tang and the China Tee Club, which closed on 30 September 2011. In October the same year, after 17 years, the flagship Shanghai Tang store closed down, with rising rents cited as the main reason. The landlord was asking for a monthly rental of HK$7 million. US clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch reportedly took over the lease for an even higher monthly rent. However in November 2016 the fashion retailer announced its decision to close down their flagship Hong Kong store, citing strategic review.

It is an iron bridge dating from the late 19th century. It is the only surviving iron semi-deck lenticular truss bridge in the state, and the only extant of three known to have been built.} In 1977 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shortly afterwards it was closed to vehicular traffic, and at some time later to pedestrians as well. The county had considered demolishing it, but held off after heavy lobbying from local preservation groups. In 2006 it was reconstructed and restored with federal and state grants, and reopened without any load restrictions. Structure The bridge is located just above where the Sacandaga flows into the Hudson River opposite the village of Lake Luzerne, and just south of the central portions of Hadley. It is within the Adirondack Park's Blue Line. The river flows rapidly through a deep gorge here, with its sides sloping steeply from the road grade. An abandoned rail bridge (now reactivated as of 2016) is just upstream, and an interpretive panel is located near the bridge. The bridge is supported by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other. The span at the south end is an end-post three-panel pony truss with both cast and wrought iron elements. Its upper chord is a riveted steel girder supported by lattice-braced members riveted to the flanges of the plate girder. The lower chord consists of two double wrought iron tension bars. The central panel is cross-braced with wrought-iron tie rods. All joints, not just in this span but the main one as well, are secured by threaded iron pins two inches (5 cm) wide capped with hexagonal nuts. The longer span, () uses the same materials but is more intricate. It has nine panels, each wide, creating chords which arch both above and below the deck to the point that they are apart at their most distant from each other, in mid-span. The upper chord is made of flanged plate girders riveted together with top and bottom iron cap plates bolted on; the lower of double wrought iron bars. Both are joined at the span's end with end pins. A lattice- braced system similar to that on the short span supports the lenticular truss, with similar members serving as horizontal braces below the deck. Iron tie rods wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust. The deck is composed of rough-cut transverse two-by- fours supported by seven iron stringers on eight transverse iron I-beams. It is surfaced with asphalt thick. History The lenticular truss bridge design was developed by engineer William O. Douglas of Binghamton, who patented it in 1878. He then assigned the patent to the Berlin Iron Bridge Company in Connecticut, where he had gone to work as an agent, and patented an improved design in 1885. Berlin manufactured hundreds of these bridges throughout the late 19th century, most of which were installed in New York and New England. In early 1885 the Hadley Town Board authorized the town's highway commissioner to ask bridge companies for bids for the new bridge over the Sacandaga, replacing one which had been built in 1813 (the abutments are from this bridge). By June several bids had been received, and Berlin's was chosen. The bridge was finished in September at a cost of $6,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). Only three lenticular truss bridges were known to have been built in the \\"semi-deck\\" configuration, where the deck was midway between the two chords, and supported by the web posts rather than suspended from the lower chord as is more commonly done with truss bridges. It has been described in lay terms as \\"a self-anchored suspension bridge.\\" The reasons for the use of this design at Hadley are not recorded, but it is likely due to a problem with truss bridges which the design and setting could address. The longer the truss bridge, the deeper the truss itself is required to be, often with lateral bracing to prevent buckling. A medium-length span such as Hadley's is particularly problematic because while it may require bracing as well, the clearance below may not be adequate enough for it to be included. In Hadley's case the bridge is high enough that the parabolic trusses may well have been the least expensive solution. Many of the lenticular trusses were found to be insufficiently stiff despite the lateral bracing, and the design's popularity waned in the early 20th century. Most were later replaced. Hadley's remained, since in 1907 ownership was taken over by the state when the legislature created the county highway system. In 1926, the construction of the Lake Luzerne bridge on what is today NY 9N created a newer option for long-distance travel through the region, and ownership reverted to the town. In 1972 the Hadley Bridge, stressed by increased traffic caused by the closure of the Route 9N bridge to Lake Luzerne, was closed for a while so that its structure could be strengthened. The cross braces were supplemented with a series of steel cable braces tightened with turnbuckles. The deck support system was changed from timber to iron, and the roadway itself was narrowed by with a wooden curb so that it would only have enough room for one vehicle at a time, with a speed limit of , thereby further reducing loads. It was restricted to loads of 3 tons (2.7 metric tons) or less afterwards, but it continued to deteriorate. In 1983 it was closed to vehicles, effectively bisecting the Town of Hadley. In 1994 it was surveyed for the Historic American Engineering Record. The town transferred ownership to the county in 1999, and the next year the deck had to be removed as well, closing it even to pedestrians. The county was planning to dismantle the remaining structural components, but delayed that at the request of some local historic preservation groups. In 2000 the county's Board of Supervisors committed up to $350,000 in matching funds to restore the bridge. Those funds were more than matched with a $1.38 million combined federal and state transportation enhancement grant the next year. A Mechanicville company was awarded the contract in 2005 and finished the bridge the next year. It is now open again, without load restriction, as a single-lane bridge.

Minchina Ota is considered as one of the finest movies in the history of Kannada cinema. It's also a milestone movie in the career of Nag brothers.  Plot  Katte (Shankar Nag) and Prabhakar Rao / Tatha (Loknath) are petty thieves who can't seem to get a break in life. Their criminal past does not leave them wherever they go. To make it big, they resort to their past and start jumping unsuspecting passers by on National Highways and relieving them of their automobiles. Disassembling the auto parts, they sell them for money and often duping people on their way. Soon their jig is up when one of their stolen vehicles breaks down and a mechanic Tony D'Souza (Anant Nag) is brought for help. Seeing that money is a free flowing concept in this criminal life, Tony joins hands with this crime duo. Soon the trio is hitting various spots and making away with vehicles. During this process, they even manage to rope in another petty thief Manju (Priya Tendulkar), who is thieving to meet her sick mother's medical bills, into their criminal enterprise. Soon, Tony and Manju get married. The cops are hot on their trail for a good part of the film before finally clamping the trio down much to the delight of the pipe-smoking Inspector Nayak (Ramesh Bhat). As jailbirds, Katte and Thatha seem to have found their peace but not Tony. His desperate self is trying to get away from the chains that bind him. A prison break is planned and executed to almost perfection by the three. In the process, Tatha dies after accidentally falling off the high prison walls. Katte and Tony are killed in an encounter while trying to flee from the cops. The film ends with Manju, who at this stage is pregnant by Tony, vowing to raise the child in a good and healthy environment.

The painting depicts an old man lying on a chaise-longue. He is showing a stuffed bird, a king bird of paradise, to a group of children and a woman. The older girl on the left of the picture is holding a resplendent quetzal, and other specimens are scattered about. The attitude of the children ranges from the enthralled interest of the youngest two to the comparative indifference, almost boredom, of the oldest girl. The work was inspired by a visit that Millais and his son John Guille Millais paid to the ornithologist John Gould shortly before his death in 1881. On the way home, Millais said to his son \\"That's a fine subject; a very fine subject. I shall paint it when I have time.\\" It was several years after Gould's death before he had time, and the picture as painted is not a representation of Gould or of the scene during Millais' visit ‚Äì the central figure was modelled by the engraver Thomas Oldham Barlow, a friend of the artist, two of the others are professional models, and the two smallest children are Millais' grandchildren (one of whom is William Milbourne James).

The theoretical basis of this position is that money comes into existence through the requirements of the real economy and that the banking system reserves expand or contract as needed to accommodate loan demand at prevailing interest rates. Central banks implement policy primarily through controlling short-term interest rates. The money supply then adapts to the changes in demand for reserves and credit caused by the interest rate change. The supply curve shifts to the right when financial intermediaries issue new substitutes for money, reacting to profit opportunities during the cycle. History Theories of endogenous money date to the 19th century, with the work of Knut Wicksell, and later Joseph Schumpeter.A handbook of alternative monetary economics, by Philip Arestis, Malcolm C. Sawyer, p. 53. With the existence of credit money, Wicksell argued, two interest rates prevail: the \\"natural\\" rate and the \\"money\\" rate. The natural rate is the return on capital‚Äîor the real profit rate. It can be roughly considered to be equivalent to the marginal product of new capital. The money rate, in turn, is the loan rate, an entirely financial construction. Credit, then, is perceived quite appropriately as \\"money\\". Banks provide credit by creating deposits upon which borrowers can draw. Since deposits constitute part of real money balances, therefore the bank can, in essence, \\"create\\" money. For Wicksell, the endogenous creation of money, and how it leads to changes in the real market is fundamentally a breakdown of the classical dichotomy between the monetary and real sectors. Money is not a \\"veil\\" - agents do react to it and this is not due to some irrational money illusion. However, for Wicksell, in the long run, the quantity theory still holds: money is still neutral in the long run.The Cumulative Process of Knut Wicksell, newschool.edu Theory The theory is based on three main claims: Loans create deposits: for the banking system as a whole, drawing down a bank loan by a non-bank borrower creates new deposits (and the repayment of a bank loan destroys deposits). So while the quantity of bank loans may not equal deposits in an economy, a deposit is the logical concomitant of a loan ‚Äì banks do not need to increase deposits prior to extending a loan. While banks can be capital-constrained, in most countries a solvent bank is never reserve-constrained or funding-constrained: it can always obtain reserves or funding either from the interbank market or from the central bank. Banks rationally pursue any profitable lending opportunities that they can identify up to the level consistent with their level of capital, treating reserve requirements and funding issues as matters to be addressed later‚Äîor rather, at an aggregate level. Therefore, the quantity of broad money in an economy is determined endogenously: in other words, the quantity of deposits held by the non-bank sector 'flexes' up or down according to the aggregate preferences of non-banks. Significantly, the theory states that if the non-bank sector's deposits are augmented by a policy-driven exogenous shock (such as quantitative easing), the sector can be expected to find ways to 'shed' most or all of the excess deposit balances by making payments to banks (comprising repayments of bank loans, or purchases of securities). Branches Endogenous money is a heterodox economic theory with several strands, mostly associated with the post-Keynesian school. Multiple theory branches developed separately and are to some extent compatible (emphasizing different aspects of money), while remaining united in opposition to the New Keynesian theory of money creation. * Monetary circuit theory was developed in France and Italy, and emphasizes credit money creation by banks. A detailed explanation of monetary circuit theory was provided by Augusto Graziani in the book The Monetary Theory of Production. * Horizontalism was developed in America by economist Basil Moore, who was also its main proponent in the 1970s and 1980s. It emphasizes credit money creation by banks. He developed an endogenous money very gradually, and not until 1979, in Eichner's Guide, did he have come around to 'monetary factors' or endogenous money. * Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger in their book \\"Eigentum, Zins und Geld\\" developed a theory called \\"Property Theory of Money\\", which also explains money by endogenous processes.

It was described botanically in 1883. It is called meoru () in Korean and yama-budo () in Japanese. History The species name is dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Coignet who reportedly brought seeds back from their trip to Japan in 1875. This vine was also reported in 1884 snowy regions of Japan by Henri Degron sent to East Asia to seek wild vines resistant to Phylloxera. Degron sent specimens to a Professor Planchon of Montpellier who named them Vitis coignetiae but did not retain them due to their low resistance to phylloxera. Degron planted a vineyard in Crespi√®res, √éle-de-France where one of the vines reached a length of 32.8 meters and a height of 2.8 meter. In the cooler Norman climate the vine produces a bitter wine, rich in color and extract. Description The vine is very vigorous, with purple shoots. The deciduous leaves are large (15 to 30 cm in diameter), simple, orbicular, toothed, with deep petiole. First green, they turn red-orange in autumn. Wild vines can be male, female or hermaphrodite. Clusters are large with small berries and large purple seeds. It is found in the mountainous regions of Japan and up to 1300 m altitude in Korea.

The Italian economic boom () is the term used by historians, economists and the mass mediaLife, November 24, 1967 (p.48) to designate the prolonged period of strong economic growth in Italy after the Second World War to the late 1960s, and in particular the years from 1958 to 1963. This phase of Italian history represented not only a cornerstone in the economic and social development of the country‚Äîwhich was transformed from a poor, mainly rural, nation into a global industrial power‚Äîbut also a period of momentous change in Italian society and culture. As summed up by one historian, by the end of the 1970s, \\"social security coverage had been made comprehensive and relatively generous. The material standard of living had vastly improved for the great majority of the population.\\"Italy, a difficult democracy: a survey of Italian politics by Frederic Spotts and Theodor Wieser History One of a number of posters created to promote the Marshall Plan in Europe. After the end of World War II, Italy was in ruins and occupied by foreign armies, a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced European economies. However, the new geopolitical logic of the Cold War made possible that the former enemy Italy, a hinge-country between Western Europe and the Mediterranean, and now a new, fragile democracy threatened by the proximity of the Iron Curtain and the presence of a strong Communist party, was considered by the USA as an important ally for the Free World, and therefore a recipient of the generous aid provided by the Marshall Plan, receiving $1.5 billion from 1948 to 1952. The end of the Plan, that could have stopped the recovery, coincided with the crucial point of the Korea War (1950‚Äì1953), whose demand for metal and other manufactured products was a further stimulus to the growth of every kind of industry in Italy. In addition, the creation in 1957 of the European Common Market, of which Italy was among the founder members, provided more investments and eased exports. A Lettera 22 typewriter by Olivetti. The above-mentioned highly favorable historical backgrounds, combined with the presence of a large and cheap stock of labour force, laid the foundations of a spectacular economic growth. The boom lasted almost uninterrupted until the \\"Hot Autumn's\\" massive strikes and social unrest of 1969‚Äì1970, that combined with the later 1973 oil crisis, gradually cooled the economy, which has never returned to its heady post-war growth rates. The Italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of GDP of 5.8% per year between 1951 and 1963, and 5.0% per year between 1964 and 1973. Italian rates of growth were second only, but very close, to the German rates, in Europe, and among the OEEC countries only Japan had been doing better. In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy personally praised Italy's extraordinary economic growth at an official dinner with Italian President Antonio Segni in Rome, stating that \\"the growth of [...] nation's economy, industry, and living standards in the postwar years has truly been phenomenal. A nation once literally in ruins, beset by heavy unemployment and inflation, has expanded its output and assets, stabilized its costs and currency, and created new jobs and new industries at a rate unmatched in the Western world\\". Society and culture The Fiat 500, launched in 1957, is considered a symbol of Italy's economic miracle. The impact of the economic miracle on Italian society was huge. Fast economic expansion induced massive inflows of migrants from rural Southern Italy to the industrial cities of the North. Emigration was especially directed to the factories of the so-called \\"industrial triangle\\", the region placed between the major manufacturing centres of Milan and Turin and the seaport of Genoa. Between 1955 and 1971, around 9 million people are estimated to have been involved in inter-regional migrations in Italy, uprooting entire communities and creating large metropolitan areas. The needs of a modernizing economy and society created a great demand for new transport and energy infrastructures. Thousands of miles of railways and highways were completed in record times to connect the main urban areas, while dams and power plants were built all over Italy, often without regard for geological and environmental conditions. A concomitant boom of the real estate market, increasingly under pressure by strong demographic growth and internal migrations, led to the explosion of urban areas. Vast neighborhoods of low- income apartments and social housing were built in the outskirts of many cities, leading over the years to severe problems of congestion, urban decay and street violence. The natural environment was constantly under strain by unregulated industrial expansion, leading to widespread air and water pollution and ecological disasters like the Vajont Dam disaster and the Seveso chemical accident, until a green consciousness developed starting from the 1980s. At the same time, the doubling of Italian GDP between 1950 and 1962 had a massive impact on society and culture. Italian society, largely rural and excluded from the benefits of modern economy during the first half of the century, was suddenly flooded with a huge variety of cheap consumer goods, such as automobiles, televisions and washing machines. From 1951 to 1971, average per capita income in real terms trebled, a trend accompanied by significant improvements in consumption patterns and living conditions. In 1955, for instance, only 3% of households owned refrigerators and 1% washing machines, while by 1975 the respective figures were 94% and 76%. In addition, 66% of all homes had come to possess cars.Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries edited by Victor George and Roger Lawson In 1954 the national public broadcasting RAI began a regular television service.  Criticism  The pervasive influence of the mass media and consumerism on society in Italy has often been fiercely criticized by intellectuals like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Luciano Bianciardi, who denounced it as a sneaky form of homogenization and cultural decay. Popular movies like The Easy Life (1962) and I Mostri (1963) by Dino Risi, Il Boom (1963) by Vittorio De Sica and We All Loved Each Other So Much (1974) by Ettore Scola all stigmatized selfishness and immorality that they believed characterized the miracle's roaring years.

It is located at Karimbam village on Taliparamba to Irikkur road in Kannur district of Kerala province in India. History This farm was originally started in 1905 by Sir Charles Alfred Barber at the behest of the Madras Government, based on the recommendation of the Famine Commission of 1880 of Government of India. Although the objective was to do research on pepper, the activities of the farm were further extended to agroclimatic experiments, hybridization and production and distribution of seeds and seedlings. Covering an area of 56 hectares, the farm has a rich biodiversity with a variety of indigenous and exotic fruit trees (such as Mangosteen, Rambutan, and Durian), spices and medicinal plants. The lush greenery with its array of crops such as Coconut, Areca nut, Cashew, Mango, Sapota, Jack, Coffee, Cocoa, Nutmeg, Clove and Pepper and the adjoining paddy field attracts many nature lovers and environmentalists to the farm. Recognizing the importance of the flora and fauna of the station, Kannur District Panchayat has established a ‚ÄòBiodiversity Centre‚Äô and an ‚ÄòIndigenous Technology Knowledge Centre‚Äô at the farm in 2005. Thousands of students, researchers, teachers and the general public from all over the state and the neighboring states make use of the facilities of the farm to improve and update their knowledge through study visits every year. The farm produces over 62 varieties of mango. With a collection of varieties from all over India, the farm has produced four hybrid varieties of mango namely, H 45, H 56, H 87 and H 151. The farm participates at fruit and vegetable exhibitions conducted in Kannur and the neighboring districts of Kasargod and Kozhikkode. Benganappally, Alampur Banishan, Neelam, Alphonso, Kalapady, Himayudheen, Jahangir, Chinnarasa, Panjarakalasa, Priyori and Malgoa are among the popular varieties of Mango grown and multiplied in this farm.

Farm office  Mango Orchard  More than 60 distinct types of Mango cultivars collected from different parts of India were planted in the orchard during the fifties. Varietal characteristics are described here as observed at the farm. Almost all varieties have a wide range of adaptability under South India conditions and the performance of flowering and fruiting vary significantly based on climatic and soil factors. Also there could be considerable confusion in the nomenclature of a few varieties due to many synonyms for a single cultivar. In such cases, name of the variety along with common synonyms have been furnished. Most of the varieties grown at the farm were collected years ago from growers and nursery men and the names signify size, shape, colour, name of a place or king and even local dialects. Hybridisation works were undertaken at the farm in the sixties and 225 hybrids were produced. Of the various hybrids assessed only a few had been found promising. Even among the hybrids of same parentage enormous variation in fruit size, shape, quality and bearing behavior were observed. A number of hybrid seedlings of each parental combination were planted in the orchard to select the desirable ones. Consequently, 4 varieties, namely H 45, H 56, H 87, H 151 were released.

Columbia Records released it as a single in the US and the UK in 1969 as the B-side to \\"I Threw It All Away\\". The song was recorded in four takes on October 17, 1967. CBS Records International also issued the song paired with \\"John Wesley Harding\\" in some markets. Lyrical interpretation Dylan wrote \\"Drifter's Escape\\" on a train in New York while traveling to the first session for the John Wesley Harding album. The lyrics provide a Kafka-esque narrative in which an outsider is oppressed by society, but not defeated. The protagonist is put on trial without knowing what the charges against him are. The judge is sympathetic, but powerless. The jury finds the protagonist guilty, but he is saved through divine intervention when the courthouse is struck by lightning. The protagonist is able to escape as his persecutors fall to their knees in prayer. Dylan leaves the orientation of the protagonist and the deus ex machina ambiguous. The protagonist could be a prophet freed by God, or he could be a false prophet freed by the devil. Several commentators have pointed to parallels between the song's story and Dylan's own experiences around the time he wrote the song. The drifter does not understand the charges against him, just as Dylan did not understand the criticism he received for moving from folk music to rock music. The jury \\"cried for more\\", just as Dylan's fans who followed his path to rock music became more oppressive. And the lightning bolt that allows the drifter to escape could be a metaphor for the \\"motorcycle accident\\" Dylan suffered in 1966. Another theme that comes through in the song is Dylan's hatred for mob violence. Biographer Clinton Heylin has noted that in writing \\"Drifter's Escape\\", Dylan found a new, economical style that allowed him to tell a five- act story in just three verses. He then went on to write more songs in a similar manner, which formed the bulk of the John Wesley Harding album. Live performances Dylan did not perform \\"Drifter's Escape\\" live for almost 25 years after it was written and released. He first performed it live in Oregon on April 30, 1992, a day after the Rodney King verdict. He sang it again four days later in San Francisco, at which point the lines \\"The trial was bad enough/ But this was ten times worse\\" had particular resonance with those who considered that verdict unjust. Since then, Dylan has performed the song occasionally on the Never Ending Tour. In 1992, he used two different live arrangements: one similar to the arrangement on John Wesley Harding and one influenced by Jimi Hendrix's version. He also performed it as the show opener in several 1995 concerts. It returned to his live set again in 2001, this time in an energetic performance driven by Dylan's \\"paranoia-inflected vocals\\". Other recordings \\"Drifter's Escape\\" has been recorded by several other artists, including Joan Baez and Jimi Hendrix. Baez covered the song in 1968 on her album Any Day Now. Hendrix' version was recorded in 1970 and appeared on Loose Ends in 1974, Stone Free in 1981 and South Saturn Delta in 1997. Author David Stubbs noted that Hendrix didn't transform this song the way he did \\"All Along the Watchtower,\\" but that Hendrix' guitar provides \\"a chorus of 'amens' and 'hallelujahs' throughout the song.\\" George Thorogood recorded the song for his 2006 album The Hard Stuff. Patti Smith performed the tune for Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty (2012). Drifters Escape was also released 2010 on \\"The Original Mono Recordings\\" and 2019 on \\"Travellin' Thru The Bootleg Series Vol. 15 1967-1969\\".

Biography Walker was born on 1 August 1791 at Markton, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh. In 1815, Walker went to London to study as a stipple engraver under Thomas Woolnoth. He established his reputation by engraving a large plate of Sir Henry Raeburn's equestrian portrait of John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun. In 1829, on his marriage to Elizabeth Reynolds, the famous miniaturist, he settled at 64 Margaret Street, where he resided until his death. Walker's work consists of about one hundred portraits of eminent contemporaries, after various oil painters, chiefly in mezzotint, all published by himself. Additionally, Walker created some interesting subject-pieces. His most famous work is the engraving of Robert Burns based on Alexander Nasmyth's famous portrait. This engraving was used many times in printed versions of Burns' poems. He died at his house in Margaret Street, London, on 7 September 1867. His grave is in Brompton Cemetery.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he emerged as a renowned polemicist, especially directed against the influential left liberal critic Josip Vidmar, with whom he nevertheless maintained a cordial relationship.Josip Vidmar, Obrazi (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba), 329-339.

His poetics was strongly influenced by late fin-de-si√®cle symbolism, especially Rilke and Maurice Maeterlinck. Vodnik was influential as a poet especially during the 1920s, while since the 1930s, his influence started to decline, due to the popularity of social realism and the emergence of a new aesthetic sensibility among young Catholic authors that embraced new objectivity on one hand, and a more mystical tradition on the other.

It was formed in Prome, Burma, on 19 March 1942, took part in the retreat through Burma, and was disbanded on arrival in India in May 1942. History Lt-Gen William 'Uncle Bill' Slim. Burcorps was created on 13 March 1942 to take control of the scattered British, Indian and local troops retreating through Burma in the face of a sustained Japanese offensive. The main fighting components of this force were two infantry divisions, 17th Indian Division and 1st Burma Division, but 7th Armoured Brigade Group had recently arrived at Rangoon as reinforcements from the Middle East.Playfair, Vol III, p. 125. Major-General William Slim was brought back from Iraq where he was commanding 10th Indian Infantry Division and promoted to Acting Lieutenant-General to take command of the new corps. He had to improvise a corps staff, including Captain Brian Montgomery, younger brother of General Bernard Montgomery, who filled a number of junior staff roles simultaneously in the early days.Lewin, pp. 82‚Äì5.Duncan Anderson, 'Slim', in Keegan (ed.), pp. 298‚Äì322.Slim at Generals of WWII.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 147‚Äì8. By the time Slim arrived at Magwe on 19 March, Rangoon had already fallen after the Battle of Pegu and Burcorps was retreating to Prome, though 17th Indian Division carried out a number of raids as it withdrew, and the motorised 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment made a surprise attack on Letpadan, temporarily driving the Japanese out. 1st Burma Division in the Sittang Valley retired through the lines of 200th Chinese Division near Taungoo, and then moved west by train to join Burcorps around Prome in the Irrawaddy Valley and cover the Yenangyaung oilfields. On 26 March Burcorps was ordered to stage a demonstration on the Prome front to coincide with a Chinese attack along the Sittang. A striking force was assembled but on 29 March was outflanked and forced to fight its way back through Shwedaung to Prome (the Battle of Shwedaung). Burcorps' HQ was moved back from Prome to Allanmyo.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 148‚Äì9, Map 8.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp.157‚Äì9Farndale, pp. 94‚Äì6, Map 20.Lewin, pp. 85‚Äì8. The Japanese conquest of Burma, April‚ÄìMay 1942. Prome came under attack at midnight on 1 & 2 April (the Battle of Prome), and Burcorps was forced to retreat through a series of delaying positions while the Thayetmyo oilfields were destroyed and essential stores evacuated. By 8 April the corps was at the Yin Chaung, defending a front some south of the Yenangyaung oilfields. 1st Burma Division was organised as the Corps' Striking Force to hold the western part of this front, while 17th Indian Division at Taungdwingyi was aligned north-south on its eastern flank and 2nd Burma Brigade was further west across the Irrawaddy. Slim moved Burcorps' HQ to Taungdwingyi in an attempt to maintain links with the Chinese. An observation line was established some to the south of Burcorps' main position, and, patrol clashes on 10 April indicated that the Japanese were moving against the centre of the position. Serious attacks began on 12 April and it became clear that the Japanese were attempting to work around 13th Indian Brigade. Slim ordered a force across the Irrawaddy to Magwe ('Magforce'). By 14 April elements of the corps were surrounded and having to fight their way back to the Yin Chaung, Magwe airfield was being prepared for destruction, and Burcorps was planning to fall back to the next defensible line on the Pin Chaung.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 159‚Äì67.Farndale, pp. 97‚Äì8.Lewin, pp. 88‚Äì92. The destruction of the Yenangyaung oil installations, 16 April 1942. On 15 April Slim gave orders for the destruction of the Yenangyaung oilfields; demolition was completed by the afternoon of 16 April, after which the storage tanks were set on fire. 1st Burma Division had attempted to hold on to the Yin Chaung for one more day, and as a result Japanese columns had infiltrated between its scattered units. The Japanese attack came on 16 April and 1st Burma Division resumed its fighting retreat, with Magforce acting as a covering force, but the Japanese cut the line of retreat at Yenangyaun, driving the garrison (1st Gloucesters) southwards. Next day the engineers were used to reinforce 1st Gloucesters and Magforce was given the motor transport to act as an advanced guard for the retreating 1st Burma Division and attempt a roadblock by-pass. On 18 and 19 April Magforce fought its way across the Yenangyaun plain, followed by 1st Burma Division while 7th Armoured Brigade and 38th Chinese Division made diversionary attacks (the Battle of Yenangyaung). 1st Burma Division struggled across the Pin Chaung with the wounded carried on tanks, but most of the transport and artillery had to be destroyed. Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 167‚Äì73.Farndale, pp. 98‚Äì100.Lewin, pp. 92‚Äì6. On 21 April the decision was made to evacuate Burma. All the troops would cross the Irrawaddy, then Burcorps would cover the route to India, while 7th Armoured Brigade helped the Chinese. The Irrawaddy crossing was completed by the evening of 30 April, the Ava Bridge was destroyed and Mandalay was abandoned. The fighting portions of Burcorps continued towards the Chindwin River, preceded by an undisciplined mob of refugees and rear-echelon troops. Corps HQ was at Budalin, near Monywa. Once again the retreat was threatened by infiltration, when a Japanese battalion seized Monywa on 1 May. However, the Japanese were unable to exploit this, and Burcorps (including 7th Armoured Brigade) was able to regroup at Ye-U.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 178‚Äì84, 200‚Äì3, Map 9.Farndale, pp. 100‚Äì3.Lewin, pp. 98‚Äì101. The retreat now turned into a race between Burcorps and the Japanese for Shwegyin before the Monsoon rains broke in mid- May. Japanese air superiority prevented casualties being airlifted out, so 2300 wounded and sick had to be moved along the Ye-U‚ÄìShwegyin track, as well as thousands of refugees who were being fed by the army and moved by army transport where possible. From Shwegyin all the troops, motor vehicles and guns had to be ferried across the Chindwin up to Kalewa, while the refugees made their way by a riverside path. The Chindwin was protected from Japanese river craft by a boom manned by the Royal Marines. The ferrying operation was covered by a rearguard formed of 17th Indian Division and 7th Hussars, who manned a series of lay-back positions and flank guards. By 10 May the only troops remaining east of the river were HQ 7th Armoured Brigade, 48th Indian Brigade, and part of 1st Battalion 9th Royal Jats. By now the Japanese were pressing forward, the boom had been destroyed by air attack and Shwegyin was being bombed. On the morning of 10 May the ferrying point came under fire. Counter-attacks failed to dislodge the enemy, and the rearguard had to take to the riverside path after destroying all tanks, vehicles and stores. The gunners fired off as much ammunition as they could before disabling their guns.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 205‚Äì9, Sketch 8.Farndale, pp. 103‚Äì5.Lewin, pp. 101‚Äì3. Luckily, the Japanese failed to press the rearguard, and the fighting was over. The troops from Kalewa went to Sittaung by river steamer, arriving on 14 May, and then destroyed the boats before marching to Tamu, where troops of Eastern Army were holding the Indian frontier. 2nd Burma Brigade, which had marched independently along a poor bullock-track to the west, covering in 14 days, made contact with the Chin Hills Battalion near Kalemyo on 12 May and was evacuated to Tamu by motor transport supplied by IV Corps. 17th Indian Division marched up the Kabaw Valley through the rains and reached Tamu on 17 May. The final rearguard, 63rd Indian Bde, marched in on 19 May. The following day IV Corps assumed operational control of all the units from Burma and Burcorps was disbanded.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 204, 210.Farndale, p. 105.Lewin, pp. 103‚Äì6.

Pasqual is also a surname found in Spain (especially in Catalan area including Andorrans, Valencians, Balearics) and in Italy (especially in Veneto, including Lombardy and Piedmont). Pasqual, like Pasquale (Italian), Pascal (French), Pascoal (Portuguese) and Pascual (Spanish), derives from the Late Latin paschalis or pashalis, which means \\"relating to Easter\\" from Latin pascha (\\"Easter\\"), Greek Œ†Œ¨œÉœáŒ±, Aramaic pas·∏•ƒÅ, in turn from the Hebrew pesach, which means \\"to be born on, or to be associated with, Passover day\\". Since the Hebrew holiday Passover coincides closely with the later Christian holiday of Easter, the Latin word came to be used for both occasions. The names Pasquale, Paschal, Pascal, Pascale, Pascha, Pascoe and Pasco are all variations of Pasqual. The feminine form, rather rare, is Pasquala, Pasqualina, Pascale, Pascalle or Pascalina. As a surname in Italy Pasqual has many variations found all over the country: Pasquali, De Pasqual, Pascale, Pascali, Pascalis, De Pascal, De Pasquali, De Pasquale, Di Pasquale, Di Pascali, De Pasqualis, Pasqualin, Pasqualon. As a given name and surname in Spanish-speaking countries Pasqual is often spelled Pascual.

Writing under the pen name of K≈çtei, his given name was Kiyoshi (Ê∑ë). He was the second son of Sone Nao (ÊõæÊ†π Áõ¥), and his patrilineality root was the Kai-Genji clan (Áî≤ÊñêÊ∫êÊ∞è).  Biography  Nakane was born in Edo (Ê±üÊà∏), and was adopted and brought up by the Nakane-House (‰∏≠Ê†π) from childhood. His adoptive parents treated him as a real son and he served them faithfully. Nakane liked Japanese martial arts and read many books, however he had no formal teacher. Military service Nakane served Edo Bakufu as a kachi- metsuke (ÂæíÂ£´ÁõÆ), an infantry officer, and became an infantry commandant in the last days of the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, Nakane followed Tokugawa Yoshinobu to Suruga (ÈßøÊ≤≥, now Shizuoka prefecture), and worked there at the Numazu Military Academy (Ê≤ºÊ¥•ÂÖµÂ≠¶Ê†°). In 1873, Nakane was called to the Staff Bureau of Military (Èô∏ËªçÂèÇË¨ÄÂ±Ä), and served as a major. In the winter of 1876, he contracted a disease, and became incapable of performing any further physical hard labour. Due to this he resigned his post, and lived in Tokyo for the next five or six years. He was eventually appointed as a sonin-hensankan (Â•è‰ªªÁ∑®Á∫ÇÂÆò), or \\"compilation government service\\" in the Ministry of Education, but resigned several years later. At this point Nakane's life in the public services had ended, and he thereafter followed his literary pursuits. Literature In about 1885, Nakane was offered a position by the publisher Kink≈çd≈ç (ÈáëÊ∏ØÂ†Ç) to work as the chief editor and he accepted. Whilst in this position Nakane published many novels written by a younger generation of authors, for example works from Futabatei Shimei (‰∫åËëâ ‰∫≠ÂõõËø∑) and K≈çda Rohan (Âπ∏Áî∞ Èú≤‰º¥). Death After the deaths of his wife and son, Nakane believed that fate was trying to destroy the pedigree of his families, and felt that he should not act against that fate. Nakane never remarried, gave up his house, and roamed from place to place. In his last days, he lived in Okotsu (ËààÊ¥•), Shizuoka. Nakane died in 1913 at 75 years of age, and his ashes were scattered as requested in his will. Notable works Nakane is noted for writing an excellent essay and short biographies. Nakane is not well known today, even in his native Japan, as he wrote using the old Japanese style of prose, or Classical Chinese. While Nakane did not write as a profession, his historical investigations were nonetheless skilfully authored. Possessing wide interests and a deep culture, Nakane's writings covered the history of Japan and China, including their literature. Mori Senz≈ç (Ê£Æ Èäë‰∏â), an expert on old Japanese literature, remarked that the works of Nakane have the character of a noble samurai.

This work is their first novel of four. Setting The Unincorporated Man is a social/political/economic novel that takes place in a utopian/dystopian future, after civilization has fallen into complete economic collapse and been revived. This reborn civilization is one in which every individual is incorporated at birth, and spends many years trying to attain control over his or her own life by getting a majority of his or her own shares‚Äîa task made all the more difficult given that modern medicine has created extraordinarily long life spans. Plot A successful industrialist named Justin Cord, frozen in secret in the early twenty-first century, is discovered and resurrected in the 24th century. He is given health and a vigorous younger body, as well as the promise of wealth and fame. There's only one problem: He remains the only unincorporated man in the world. Justin cannot accept only part ownership of himself, even if that places him in conflict with a civilization that extends outside the solar system, to the Oort Cloud and beyond. Criticism Some reviewershttp://www.librarything.com/work/6360938/reviews argue that the book spends too much time extolling the idea of personal incorporation and not enough time criticising it. The book is also criticised for a lack of depth, with the plot and characters' motivations all put in service of explaining the book's primary concept instead of developing in any natural fashion. Other reviewers have arguedhttp://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/04/unincorporated- man.html that the supposed protagonist, Justin Cord, makes illogical and emotion-based arguments against incorporation while the supposed antagonists and defenders of the incorporation system make sensible and logical economic arguments that the system allows humans to reach their full potential through monetizing human capital, increasing the scope for more voluntary transactions, and gains from trade.

He is credited with identifying the site of Bombay as a strategic port. A fictional character in the novel Midnight's Children by author Salman Rushdie bears the same name and is described as a direct descendant. (See List of Midnight's Children characters). Life He was the son of Thomas Methwold and his wife, Susan both of Swaffham, Norfolk. Sir William Methold, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer was his uncle. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an English merchant, and served him for four years in London and then five in Middelburg, Netherlands. During this time he gained knowledge of Latin, and became fluent in Dutch and French. In September 1615 Methwold was accepted for service in the East India Company as a linguist and sailed in its 1616 fleet to Surat, in Gujarat, India. He travelled much in India, and visited the diamond mines of Golconda in 1622, being the first Englishman to accomplish the journey. His narrative of his Indian travels, entitled Relations of the Kingdome of Golchonda and other neighbouring Nations within the Gulfe of Bengal &c.;, was printed in 1626, when Methold had returned to England, in the fifth volume of Samuel Purchas's Pilgrims. He prospered as a merchant in the employ of the company from a base in Masulipatam on the Coromandel coast. He practiced some private trading, which was forbidden by company rules and in 1622 was recalled to England to answer charges which he freely admitted . He left the company and spent a number of years practicing as an independent trader but reconciled with it in 1628 when he was given the freedom of the East India Company, entitling him to become a shareholder. While in England he was married in April 1624 to Mary Wright (d. 1652), daughter of William Wright of Sevenoaks, Kent. With her he had two sons who both became merchants. His skill as a negotiator and linguist, he could by now also converse in Persian, the language of the Mughal court and high officials, were noted and he was appointed president of Surat in November 1633. In 1635 he negotiated the Goa Convention, a pact with the Portuguese which ceased hostilities in India and gave English ships access to Portuguese resources. Around this time he began to lobby for the acquisition of Bombay from the Portuguese as a supremely suitable trading centre on the west coast of India. The company eventually acquired it in 1668 from Charles II, to whom Bombay had been ceded in his marriage to the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza as part of her dowry. Methwold was elected deputy governor of the East India Company in 1643 and was re-elected annually thereafter until his death. Methwold negotiated the amalgamation of the East India Company's with the rival Assada Company in 1649. Around 1640 he acquired Hale House and adjoining land in Kensington, London, as his home in England. His wife died in October 1652 and in February 1653 he married a widow, Sarah Rolfe (d. 1678?), daughter of Sir Richard Dean. Methwold himself died on 5 March 1653, at his mansion, Hale House, afterwards known as Cromwell House, Kensington, aged 63 years. He was buried, under the name Meathall, in St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, on 10 March 1653. Cromwell House was pulled down in 1850 to form a site for the Great Exhibition. During his lifetime Methwold had also bought land in Yorkshire, Wiltshire, and Somerset, and buildings near Charing Cross.

He was Duke of Kujawy since 1233, ruler over LƒÖd from 1239-1261, ruler over Wyszogr√≥d since 1242, Duke of Sieradz from 1247-1261, Duke of ≈Åƒôczyca since 1247, and Duke of Dobrzy≈Ñ since 1248. He was the second son of Konrad I of Masovia and his wife Agafia of Rus. He was probably named after his grandfather, Casimir II the Just.  Life  Casimir I received Kujawy (however without Dobrzy≈Ñ and Sieradz-≈Åƒôczyca) from his father in 1233. In 1239, he would enlarge his domains with the castellany of LƒÖd, which he received as the dowry of his second wife. In subsequent years, Casimir I actively supported his father's turbulent politics, which brought him in 1242 to conquer the district of Wyszogr√≥d from the rulers of Gda≈Ñsk. Konrad I died on 31 August 1247. According to his will, most of Masovia passed to his oldest son, Boles≈Çaw I, and the youngest of his sons, Siemowit I, received Sieradz-≈Åƒôczyca. Dissatisfied with his part of the paternal inheritance, Casimir I attacked his brothers' lands while they were in P≈Çock at the funeral of their father, and was able to conquer Siemowit I's inheritance. The next geopolitical change in Masovia came in early 1248, when Boles≈Çaw I died unexpectedly and without issue. In his will, he left all his domains to his brother Siemowit I. With this opportunity, Casimir I was able to take advantage of the confusion after his older brother's death and capture Dobrzy≈Ñ. Casimir I of Kuyavia's Seal. During the 1250s Casimir I was busy with his effort to Christianize the Yotvingian tribes and establish peaceful relations with them. His plans were not supported by the Teutonic Order, however, which had the Pope on its side. After this failure, Casimir I appealed to the Knights Templar, who settled in ≈Åuk√≥w, in order to secure the northern border of his territory. It was not until 1263 that his relations with the Teutonic Order where normalized. Meanwhile, Casimir I faced additional internal problems. In 1258, Boles≈Çaw the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland, allied with Wartislaw III, Duke of Pomerania, and attacked Kujawy, demanding the return of the castellany of LƒÖd. It was his opinion that the land was unlawfully transferred by Henry II the Pious to his son-in-law. The expedition was only partially successful, and so the following year Boles≈Çaw the Pious organized a more powerful coalition with Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste, Siemowit I, and Daniel of Halych against Casimir I. This expedition was a complete victory, and on 29 November 1259, Casimir I was forced to surrender and promised to cede LƒÖd to Boles≈Çaw the Pious. Ultimately, however, Casimir I refused to return LƒÖd, and this caused the coalition to attack again in 1261. Leszek II the Black, Casimir I's eldest son, took advantage of his father's difficult position and demanded his own district, using as an excuse the intrigues of his stepmother, who wanted to obtain more land for her own children. In the end, Casimir I was forced to not only surrender the castellany of LƒÖd, but to also give Sieradz to his son as a separate district. Casimir died on 14 December 1267 and was buried in the Cathedral of W≈Çoc≈Çawek.  Marriages and Issue  Around 1230/31 Casimir I married firstly with Hedwig (1218/20 ‚Äì 8 January aft. 1234), probably the daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic.D.

In 1239 Casimir I married secondly with Constance (c. 1221/27 ‚Äì c. 21 February 1257), a daughter of Henry II the Pious. As her dowry, she received the castellany of LƒÖd, which was the cause of the Casimir I's long conflict with the Duchy of Greater Poland. They had two sons: #Leszek II the Black (c. 1240/42 ‚Äì 30 September 1288). #Ziemomys≈Ç (c. 1241/45 ‚Äì 29 October/24 December 1287). In 1257, Casimir I married thirdly with Euphrosyne (c. 1228/30 ‚Äì 4 November 1292), daughter of Casimir I of Opole. As her dowry, she received the district of Ruda, but the quick action of Przemys≈Ç I, Duke of Greater Poland, prevented this land from passing to the Masovian branch. They had four children: #W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (3 March 1260/19 January 1261 ‚Äì 2 March 1333), King of Poland (1320‚Äì1333). #Casimir II (c. 1261/62 ‚Äì 10 June 1294), killed in battle against the Lithuanians. #Siemowit (c. 1262/67 ‚Äì 1312). #Euphemia (c. 1265 ‚Äì 18 March 1308), married Yuri I of Galicia.

Manuscript It is preserved in only one manuscript, Mons 331/206 (olim 4568), and in the Prose Perceval printed in 1530. Moreover, a German translation by Philipp Colin and Claus Wisse appeared in the N√ºwe Parzefal of the 14th-century. In Mons 331/206, the text is grouped together with the so-called Bliocadran prologue, Chr√©tien's Perceval and three Continuations of Chr√©tien's poem. In its received form, the text presents serious difficulties to modern scholars, containing many corrupt forms and readings such as may have been miscopied or wrongly interpreted by a scribe whose own source text may have been far from perfect. Synopsis Although the Elucidation was conceived as a prologue to Chr√©tien de Troyes' unfinished romance Perceval, le Conte du Graal, it is in many ways a significant departure from it, even to the extent of offering contradictory material. Albert Wilder Thompson, who edited the poem in 1931, suggests that the poem can be broken up into five sections. The first part (lines 1‚Äì28) is an introduction in which the reader is told that a degree of reticence about the secrets of the Grail must be kept, a note of warning which is here ascribed to one Master Blihis. It also hints at the role of \\"seven guards\\" later in the poem. The second part (lines 29‚Äì98) recounts that the Maidens of the Well used to serve food and drink to every visitor until King Amangon raped them and took off with their golden cups. As a consequence of the crime, the land turned into a barren wasteland and the Castle of the Fisher King could not be found for a considerable time after. The third part (99‚Äì224) forwards to the world of King Arthur and his knights, who intend to seek redress for the crime and so restore the land. The knights are unable to find the wells and the maidens, but find other maidens whom they vigorously defend in battle. The first triumph against the enemy is when Gauvain defeats the knight Blihos Bliheris. Sent to Arthur's court, Blihos reveals that the maidens descend from the Maidens of the Wells. Arthur and his knights then seek out the Fisher King and his castle. In the fourth section (225‚Äì338 and 383‚Äì484), Gauvain and Perceval have located the castle and witness the procession of the Grail. Gauvain's success is briefly anticipated, but Perceval's Grail adventure soon takes centre stage. As in Chr√©tien's poem, Perceval begins his career at Arthur's court as an unseasoned youth who through his deeds and behaviour, ultimately proves himself a laudable knight. However, the poem differs from Chr√©tien in that the young hero does not fail to ask the crucial question \\"what is the purpose of the Grail?\\" Perceval goes on to ask about the identity of a dead body and the broken sword that lay on it, but neglects to ask the reason for the bleeding of the lance. It then appears that the procession is performed three times a day, each time before a banquet at which the food is served autonomously by the Grail, without the need of servers. Though the account is notably different, the author asserts that the service of the Grail was revealed to Chr√©tien by the \\"good master\\", possibly the \\"Master Blihis\\" referred to in the introduction. In the fifth part, which occurs within the fourth section (lines 339‚Äì382), the speaker adds that the castle was discovered only seven times in the course of history and that seven \\"guards\\" will provide the individual narratives. Of these, the seventh is about the Lance of Longinus, but the allusions to the other tales cannot be so readily identified: (1) \\"Adventure of the Shield\\"; (2) \\"Story of the Great Sorrows\\", how Lancelot lost strength; (3) a story involving a goshawk which attacked Amangon's son and terrified Castrar, (4) \\"Story of the Swan\\" (about one Carahet who came to Glamorgan, possibly Guerrehet, the French form of Gareth, Gawain's brother), (5) about the \\"wrath and loss of Husdent\\"; and (6) about \\"the great struggle\\".

Immigration to Australia and personal life  He was brought out to Australia in 1926 by Wilkie, as actor and stage director. He married Minnie Suckling, an actress with the same troupe (having previously married Gertrude Mary T Littlewood between April and June 1910 in St John Baptist, Hulme, Manchester, Lancashire, England).http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3955346 He played Henry VIII, Mercutio and Lafeu at the Theatre Royal, Hobart and Henry VIII at the Otago Theatre, Dunedin, New Zealand. Career in Australia  It was during this time he met a young actor Catherine Duncan with whom he was to have a professional association several years later. He was appointed director of the Melbourne Repertory Theatre Society, succeeding Gregan McMahon in 1928., amongst other plays directed The Touch of Silk (by Australian playwright Betty Roland) in November of that year. Angel Symon, who had also toured with Wilkie and assembled an important collection of stage ephemera now held at the University of Adelaide, was his secretary. The Repertory Theatre disbanded around 1930 after encountering financial difficulties. Clearly a man of huge enthusiasms, newspaper cuttings of this time show him appearing in public almost every week, whether conducting poetry recitals,http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4210357 lectures on German theatre,http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4025465 on poetry,http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12239116 judging at eisteddfods and elocution competitions, even opening an art exhibition in 1930. He contributed an article The Future of the Theatre for July 1931 Stream leftist literary journal that included an article by Nettie Palmer.http://www.reasoninrevolt.net.au/bib/PR0001143.htm He was responsible for the stage debut of Coral Browne in the George Bernard Shaw play You Never Can Tell at the Garrick Theatre in 1930.Stars of Australian Sage and Screen Hal Porter, Rigby Ltd. Adelaide 1965 Around 1930 he organised a series of \\"great plays\\" for 3LO, a new member station of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which led to his appointment in 1931 as Director of Drama for that station.Argus 29 November 1930 He assembled a strong group of radio actors to perform several great plays every week. A similar group was assembled by his counterpart in Sydney, Laurence Halbert, and the two stations exchanged programs by landline and transcription disc. In 1938 he was moved to Sydney to become National Director of Productions for the ABC by (later Sir) Charles Moses, who was developing the Commission into a more centralised network. It is difficult now to appreciate what a powerful position this was, but in the decades before television radio drama was the chief form of entertainment for most Australians and the major radio networks provided the chief source of employment for many hundreds of actors (and a springboard to a movie career for many such as Peter Finch) and the drama heads of radio stations and production houses such as Grace Gibson and Hector Crawford could make or break an actor and the success or otherwise of a production could make or break a program. *As guest adjudicator for a Melbourne elocution competition in 1934, he was impressed with Ida Elizabeth Osbourne and found parts for her in radio productions. So when he was authorised by ABC head Charles Moses to create a national children's radio program, he called on her to develop it. This became the highly influential Children's Session and Argonauts Club.The Golden Age of the Argonauts\\" by Rob Johnson pub. Hodder & Stoughton 1997 *He commissioned Edmund Barclay to write the series As Ye Sow which ran for most of 1937. *In 1939 he cast the (then) unknown Nigel Lovell in a radio adaptation of The Wild Ass's Skin by Balzac, then as Romeo in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. *Later that same year he placed Peter Finch on contract. *He produced one of the most famous Australian radio plays, The Fire on the Snow by Douglas Stewart, first performed by the ABC on 6 June 1941 with Ida Elizabeth Osbourne as Narrator. *In 1943 he commissioned Gwen Meredith to write a radio serial to be a feature of the Country Hour, with the remit of providing agricultural information along with entertainment, expressly to consult with the NSW Agricultural Department and the ABC Rural Department. That program The Lawsons ran from 1944 to 1949 then morphed into the historic Blue Hills which ran until 1976.http://publications.epress.monash.edu/doi/pdf/10.2104/sc050007 *He appointed Catherine Duncan to write for radio after judging her entry The Sword Sung in a Sydney New Theatre competition. But rivals and opponents such as Leslie Rees and Lawrence H Cecil were developing influence within the organization. His insistence on \\"high standards\\" could easily be interpreted as reactionary, and his acid tongue made enemies of people who disagreed with him. In 1950 he was excised from his position and (quite unwillingly) transferred to Hobart to produce plays there. Recognition *He appeared in the Who's Who in Australia for publications 1936 and 1947. *A portrait of Clewlow painted by Jack Carington Smith was an exhibited entry for the 1955 Archibald Prize.

History Chase Corp had a major effect on the New Zealand economy, starting out in the 1970s with small property developments, becoming an extremely large player in the New Zealand commercial property market in the 1980s. In the early 1980s, Chase Corp operated as a corporate raider, taking over companies whose shares they thought were under-priced, and then either 'asset stripping' or restructuring the company. Launching itself as a publicly listed company in April 1983, Chase Corp's share price rose to a high of $10.40 by June 1987, with an estimated value of NZ$3.6 billion. Chase Corp was one of the largest companies on the New Zealand share market. At the end of 1986 Chase Corporation was one of the largest three listed companies in New Zealand (along with Brierley Investments and Fletcher Challenge). Chase Corp also invested in Australia, England and the United States of America. After the New Zealand sharemarket crash on 20 October 1987, the Chase Corp share price continued to drop and it effectively never recovered from that point, as the New Zealand property market collapsed. On 4 July 1989, the NZ Government appointed statutory managers to run the NZ property interests of Chase Corp. The company was formally wound up in July 1996. Leadership The Chairman of Chase Corp (as it was commonly known) was Colin Reynolds, with other Directors Peter Francis, Adrian Burr, John Clarke and Seph Glew. In April 1985, Colin Reynolds and Seph Glew featured on the cover of the magazine 'Metro' as the 'darlings of Queen Street' References Category:Defunct companies of New Zealand Category:Financial services companies of New Zealand ","title":"Chase Corporation"},{"id":"24651237","text":"Mason Thompson Scott (20 December 1865 ‚Äì 1 June 1916)Mason Scott player profile Scrum.com was an English international rugby union half back who played club rugby for Cambridge University and Northern. Scott played international rugby for England and was an original member of invitational team, the Barbarians. Personal history Scott was born in 1865 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth son of Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet of Beauclerc and Ann Brough. Scott was educated at Craigmount School in Edinburgh, and matriculated to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1884. He was awarded his BA in 1888, and on leaving University, became a publisher. He married Flora Alice Williams on 30 November 1899, and they had a daughter, Flora Brookbank Scott.Person Page ‚Äì 31822 thepeerage.com His younger brother, William, followed his brother being educated at Craigmount and Jesus College, and was also an international rugby player for England. Scott died on 1 June 1916 at Brunstock in Carlisle, and left in his will the sum of ¬£130,000.Griffiths (1982), pg 53. Rugby career Scott first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University. Scott played in three Varsity Matches winning all his sporting 'Blues' in rugby football. Scott's first Blue was in the 1885 Varsity Match, and his clean heel in the first half allowed teammate William Leake to break and set up Brutton for the first try.Marshall (1951), pg 65. The game ended with Cambridge victorious, two tries to nil. The next season saw Scott and Leake selected again at half back for Cambridge, this time winning by three tries to nil. Scott was central to several moved in his final Varsity match in 1887, combining well with Leake. Scott missed at a drop goal during the game, but set up a clean pass to allow Duncan to successfully drop kick a goal.Marshall (1951), pg 70. Later in the match Scott again found Duncan with a good pass to send him through for a try under the posts. Wynne of Cambridge finished the game with a try to give Cambridge their third successive win. While still at University, Scott was awarded his first international cap for England. Called into the squad to face Ireland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship, Scott was partnered with England's captain Alan Rotherham. The Irish forwards outclassed their English counterparts, and the possession the Irish backs gained gave them dominance throughout the game. Scott and Rotherham set up a careful defence to prevent the Irish three-quarters from several scoring chances,Griffiths (1982), pg 47. but the game eventually went to the Irish, winning by two goals to nil. After leaving Cambridge, Scott joined Northern Rugby Club, based in Newcastle upon Tyne. While representing Northern, Scott won his final two international caps and became the first player to be capped directly from the club. Scott was selected for the final two games of the 1890 Championship, after England had lost the opener against Wales. Paired at half back with fellow Barbarian Francis Hugh Fox, Mason experienced his first international win with England taking the game 6‚Äì0. His final match for his country was the last game of the Championship at home to Ireland. Scott played with yet another half back pairing, this time Frederick Spence, but despite the lack of consistency the English back play was solid enough to see a three try win over the Irish.

BASIC ASSUMPTIONS MOGUL project research takes as its premise that the mind is modular in character, i.e. composed of functionally specialised systems. Two of these are specifically linguistic in nature and are unique to human beings. They interact with other expert systems such as vision both during the growth of language in the mind and during the processing of language (in comprehension, production, thinking, and even dreaming). Explanations are framed within a processing perspective. This, however, does not mean representations and their properties are left aside. Typically, research into linguistic theory and description typically avoids dealing with mental processes operating in real time; instead, the focus is on abstract structures without recourse to processing explanations. Psycholinguists, by contrast, focus on real time activity rather than on issues surrounding abstract linguistic structure. However, despite its declared processing perspective, the framework used in this research allows issues surrounding real time mental activity to be integrated with accounts of the representations that make up an individual‚Äôs current linguistic knowledge. The background assumption is that the functionally specialised cognitive systems that comprise the mind as a whole and which have evolved over time include two systems (or one depending on the linguistic-theoretical perspective adopted) which are responsible for human linguistic ability. Language cognition, however, engages all of the mind's systems and many at the same time. In other words, of all the systems that are engaged in language performance use only the two of them handle linguistic structure but it is the two that mark language as a specifically human ability. These two systems handle, respectively, phonological (speech or sign language) structure and syntactic structure, in other words, 1) the phonological system and 2) the syntactic system. Other cognitive systems closely associated with language processing and development are 3) the conceptual system, which handles all abstract meanings but is inevitably richly connected with the syntactic system and 4) the auditory system which handles all sound representations based on acoustic input from external environment and is inevitably richly connected with the phonological system whereby specific auditory input gets associated with phonological structures, and finally 5) the visual system which handles all visual representations based on visual input from the external environment some of which will happen to be patterns created by writing and (language) signing. The two linguistic systems former a linear chain so that phonological structures can be directly associated and hence coactivate each other via the interface between them. The phonological system receives input from the two perceptual (visual and auditory) systems and the syntactic system received input from the conceptual system. A single word like jump, for example, is actually a composite structure arising from an association between several different types of representation. The spoken version will be a chain of: #an auditory representation (AS) of the sound \\"tree\\" #an phonological representation ((PS') of its speech structure (expressed using the conventions determined by the preferred linguistic theory) #a syntactic representation (SS) of its identity as a noun, verb, preposition, etc. (expressed using the conventions determined by the preferred linguistic theory) #a conceptual representation (CS) of its meaning The word chain can be displayed using the following abbreviations always using 'S' for ' \\"structure\\" (a synonym for representation): AS/PS/SS/CS Processing works in both directions depending where the initial input comes from and then after that going in both directions in principle until the overall best-fit is found. In other words, processing is parallel, incremental and bidirectional. https://online.bankofscotland.co.uk/personal/logon/login.jsp Linguists may note that what is conventionally thought of as the scope of phonetics is expressed here as the domain of auditory structure. Similarly, what is conventionally thought of as the scope of semantics and 'pragmatics falls within the scope of conceptual structure. None of these linguistic areas are treated here as the domain of one or other of the two linguistic systems: the term linguistic is reserved for the two above-mentioned systems that process and store linguistic structure. Development over time An important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural by-products of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the parser. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on) are used to explain a) how cognitive representations are formed within and across each cognitive systems as a result of online processing and b) how existing representations develop or lose their competitive edge when competing online with other candidates for participation in some online task. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of the MCF and is applicable not only to language but to all kinds of cognitive development (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).O'Grady, W. (2005). Syntactic Carpentry: An Emergentist Approach to Syntax. Mahwah, NJ.. All cognitive development and therefore language development as well is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated. Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word \\"ship\\" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying \\"sheep\\" and \\"shape\\" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener; see Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002.Dijkstra, A.F.J. & W.J.B. van Heuven (2002). The Architecture of the Bilingual Word Recognition System: From Identification to Decision. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 5/3. 175-197.). The \\"ship\\" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic \\"use it or lose it\\" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole. As we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned. Although the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each cognitive system is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant cognitive systems are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. Comprehension and production The cognitive systems involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures. As mentioned earlier, meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in writing or signing. As an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage ‚Äì in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus syntactic structure) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in \\"a boy hit the ball\\", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain. As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles. Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure). Perception and affect (PopS and AfS) One feature of this approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of perception and affect in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of \\"a boy hit the ball\\" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept \\"boy\\". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co- activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. High levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of perceptual output structures (POpS). POpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses ‚Äì or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in this language research are visual structures (VS) and auditory structures (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word \\"dog\\" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully. Perceptual output structures are richly interconnected. This enables a coordinated response to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory.Baars, B. (1988). A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness. New York: Cambridge University Press. At the same time, since POpS mediate between a) the external environment and b) the internal operations of the mind that are completely inaccessible to awareness, the conscious awareness role of POpS is compatible with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness.Jackendoff, R. (1987). Consciousness and the Computational Mind. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, the condition for awareness to occur. It also helps to explain the condition known as synaesthesia: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. In language use, another example of how a very highly active connection can affect perception is provided by the experimentally-induced McGurk effect (McGurk & MacDonal, 1976McGurk H., MacDonald J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices. Nature, 264, 5588: 746‚Äì8. doi:10.1038/264746a0. .) Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips). The main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word \\"dog\\" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its conceptual structure(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do not have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and cannot) achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature. The affective system works with affective structures (AfS) that are constructed using primitives form which the basic emotions such as \\"fear\\" and \\"disgust\\" are composed and which are discussed extensively in affective neuroscience, in the work of Ant√≥nio Dam√°aio Damasio, A. (1999). The Feeling of What Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making of Consciousness. Heinemann: London. and others. The affective system is particularly important in its role as an assigner of positive and negative ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôvalue‚Äô‚Äô, the affective primitives. A representation in another system, if it is associated with a very high value AfS undergoes a boost in its activation levels and this can have wide ranging consequences for the behaviour that ensues. It is easy to understand this in terms of survival behaviour where a visual image that is connected with a highly negative value will trigger rapid withdrawal behaviour and emotions of fear and/or disgust whereas with association with a highly positive value will cause a person to be attracted to it. In language research, taboo words have been a popular object of investigation (for example Jay T. (2009). The Utility and Ubiquity of Taboo Words. Perspectives on Psychological Science.4,2:153-161. doi:10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01115.x.). It would appear that the linguistic systems, critical for the ensure success of early language acquisition, do not require and indeed are maybe immune from direct influence from the affective system. Nonetheless, they have interface with systems that ‚Äò‚Äôare‚Äô‚Äô directly connected. Language switching (or ‚Äò‚Äôcode-switching‚Äô‚Äô ) behaviour provide examples of this when in a change of situation, one language or one shorter or longer stretch of the current language in use gives way to another and switching behaviour is triggered by changes in affective association with other, non-linguistic representations that are currently active. Two bilinguals speaking Mandarin, for instance, when approached by a monolingual English-speaking colleague may well switch to English because all the perceptual and conceptual representations associated with the connected conceptual structures ENGLISH + LANGUAGE, formerly undervalued, have now undergone a rapid change in their current value and have inherited their consequent activation boost to which the linguistic systems must automatically respond by providing different chains of PS and SS (Truscott & Sharwood Smith, 2016Truscott, J. & Sharwood Smith, M. (2016). Representation, Processing and Code-switching.‚Äô‚Äô Bilingualism: Language & Cognition‚Äô‚Äô, 20, 5, 903-916..Sharwood Smith, 2017a Sharwood Smith, M. (2017a) Language and affective processing implemented within a crossdisciplinary conceptual framework. ‚Äò‚Äô Pozna≈Ñ Studies in Contemporary Linguistics‚Äô‚Äô 53, 1: 43-62.) Knowledge of language Language is a vague term in its widest sense involving a host of different cognitive systems. Hence ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôknowledge of language‚Äô‚Äô or knowledge of a/several languages‚Äô‚Äô are by no means unambiguous concepts. Direct access to the linguistic systems that collectively represent the grammar(s) we possess is impossible so knowledge of grammar in this sense is subconscious and cannot be raised to consciousness. If, by knowledge, we are referring to anything concerning language (including grammar), that we can consciously think and talk about and analyse, we are referring to metalinguistic knowledge, which is also a legitimate object of research within cognitive science. How the is explained within the current framework? As with all forms of metacognition, it is constructed out of conceptual structures with their multiple connections with perceptual other types of structure. output structures. For conscious reflection on language, associated perceptual structures have to be activated up to the high levels required for conscious experience to occur. To take a simple example, the word \\"horse\\" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning. consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as word, syllable, noun, definition and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the linguistic systems are not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. They are simply activated at lower levels to support the ongoing thought processes (Sharwood Smith, 2020Sharwood Smith, M. (first published online 2020). The cognitive status of metalinguistic knowledge in speakers of one or more languages. Bilingualism: Language & Cognition. doi.org/10.1017/S1366728920000371.). Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general because we have accumulated a rich repertoire of conceptually based knowledge. At the same time we may yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however. An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. However, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance. Notes Sources * Baars, B.

Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo (ca. 1280/84 ‚Äì 22 August 1345/13 May 1350), was a Polish prince member of the House of Piast, Duke of Inowroc≈Çaw during 1287-1314 (under the regency of his mother until 1294 and his brother during 1294-1296), since 1306 vassal of the Kingdom of Poland, Governor of the Duchy of Pomerelia (Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania) during 1306-1309 (on behalf of his uncle W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high), since 1314 ruler over Gniewkowo (between 1332-1343 deposed by the Teutonic Order). He was the third and youngest son of Ziemomys≈Ç of Inowroc≈Çaw and Salomea, daughter of Sambor II, Duke of Pomerelia. Life After the death of their father in 1287, Kazimierz III and his older brothers Leszek and Przemys≈Ç inherited his domains; however, because they are minors, remained under the regency of their mother and paternal half-uncle W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high until 1294, when Leszek, as the oldest brother, attained his majority and assumed the government and the guardianship of his brothers. Kazimierz III attained his majority ca. 1302, but initially ruled jointly with his brothers; two years previously (in 1300) he was forced to paid homage to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. In 1306 he paid homage to his uncle W≈Çadys≈Çaw I, in return for which he was appointed Governor of Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania, with his base in Tczew. In 1309, he was forced to abandon his post as a result of the invasion of the Teutonic Order, despite a personal conversation with the Komtur Heinrich von Pl√∂tzke, even asked him on his knees to return the cities taken by the Teutonic Knights to his rightful owner, W≈Çadys≈Çaw I, but without success. Shortly after, Kazimierz III and his brother Przemys≈Ç where involved in a financial dispute with Bishop Gerward. In December 1310 both princes looted the district of RaciƒÖ≈º, who belonged to the Bishopric, and in retaliation, on 2 January 1311 the Bishop excommunicated both. In response, the princes imprisoned both the Bishop and his brother Stanis≈Çaw, Provost of W≈Çoc≈Çawek. Both parties made an agreement only on 22 November: the Bishop and his brother were released, and the excommunication against the princes was lifted.Kazimierz III gniewkowski in. poczet.com [retrieved 19 February 2015]. In 1314 was made the formal division of the paternal inheritance between Kazimierz III and his brothers; as the youngest son, he received the small district of Gniewkowo. Between 18‚Äì23 June 1318, he took part in the meeting at Sulej√≥w. As an ally of the Polish King his name also appears on a document dated from 1325, on the occasion of the conclusion of an alliance between W≈Çadys≈Çaw I and Western Pomerania. In April 1332, during the next stage of the Polish-Teutonic War, the Teutonic Knights besieged Gniewkowo. Kazimierz III, unable to defend his Duchy and not wanting to be captured, decided to escape after burning the main fortress. During the war, all Kujawy was lost, and Casimir III found himself in exile, probably in the court of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I. His fate after the loss of his domains is uncertain, because he only appears during the Second Polish-Teutonic Trial (4 February-15 September 1339), where he testified, and during the Treaty of Kalisz (8 July 1343), where thanks to the provisions arranged there he was able to return to his Duchy. Kazimierz III died between 22 August 1345 and 13 May 1350. Is unknown where he was buried. Marriage and Issue Between 1312/18, Kazimierz III married, although the name and origins of his wife are unknown. She certainly died between 19 April 1332/13 July 1343, because at the time of his return to Gniewkowo he was already a widower. The chronicler Jan of Czarnk√≥w mentioned that Kazimierz III had several sons and daughters, but only two survive to adulthood: *Elizabeth (ca. 1315/23 ‚Äì after 22 August 1345),Prince of Inowraclaw and Gniewkowo who married Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, and was the mother of Elizabeth of Bosnia, Queen consort of Poland and Hungary *W≈Çadys≈Çaw the White (ca. 1327/33 ‚Äî died on 29 February 1388).

Opposed to Calvinism, he was an isolated and embattled bishop of the reign of Elizabeth, though able to keep his see. Life Born in London, according to John Strype, he was a scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he proceeded BA in 1529. In 1530 he was elected fellow of Pembroke Hall; was ordained subdeacon 24 February 1532, and priest 21 September 1534; and commenced MA(Cantab) in 1532 and BD in 1540. He supported Sir John Cheke in the controversy on Greek pronunciation. He received over time the livings of Halford, Warwickshire (1547), Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire (1558), and Bishop's Hampton, Herefordshire (1559), of Plainsford, Gloucestershire, and . He was a court in Edward VI's reign, and on 3 February 1552 he was appointed archdeacon of Hereford, and afterwards one of the keepers of the spiritualities of the see of Hereford during a vacancy. As archdeacon he attended the convocation of Canterbury at the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary (October 1553); according to Heylyn few of the Edwardian clergy were present. By the command of the queen the convocation proceeded to vote a proposition declaratory of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. Against this six divines offered to dispute, the five known being: Walter Phillips, dean of Rochester; James Haddon, dean of Exeter; John Philpot, archdeacon of Winchester; John Aylmer, archdeacon of Stow; and Cheyney. Haddon and Aylmer were reluctant to comply with the conditions proposed for the discussion, but Cheyney who held Lutheran views on the subject began, and, the others afterwards coming to his assistance, it continued for four days. His disputation is printed in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments. He resigned his archdeaconry in 1557, and became canon of Gloucester 14 November 1558; he had retired for a time to his living of Halford in the diocese of Worcester, under Richard Pate, one of those exempt from executions for heresy under Queen Mary. Cheyney paid a priest to perform the services. On the accession of Elizabeth I Cheyney went on a preaching tour, and during his absence on this work the ecclesiastical visitors employed to carry out the queen's injunctions of 1559 visited Halford, where they found the rector absent, and the priest in charge a probable Catholic. They amerced the absent incumbent and seized his corn. Cheyney was well known to William Cecil, and was very soon (6 April 1560) invited to preach before the queen. He then told her that her visitors ought rather to be called takers, as they had impoverished his living. Soon afterwards, in a letter to Cecil, he complained of neglect. On 21 June 1560 Cheyney was appointed canon of Westminster, and the provostship of Eton College being vacant by deprivation, Archbishop Matthew Parker recommended Cheyney for the post, unsuccessfully. Next year (1562) he obtained by Cecil's influence the bishopric of Gloucester, to which he was consecrated April 19, and by letters patent bearing date April 29 was allowed to hold the see of Bristol in commendam. On 3 May the archbishop issued a commission to Cheyney, as commendatory of the see of Bristol, to visit the diocese, appointing him his vicar-general in spirituals. But Parker withdrew his commission for Bristol diocese from Cheyney, and appointed John Cotterell in his place 23 May 1563. The bishop wrote to Cecil, complaining of the encouragement thus given to puritanism which was rampant in his diocese, and expressing his wish to resign. Cecil was willing to translate Cheyney to Chichester in 1568, but the archbishop objected. In 1569 the degree of D.D. was conferred on Cheyney at Cambridge. Cheyney continued to act as bishop of Gloucester, becoming very popular by his liberality; but ran into debt.' About October 1576 process issued out of the exchequer to seize his lands and goods for 500l. due to the queen for arrears of tenths. The bishop, however, begged for time, and the request seems to have been granted. Cheyney died on 29 April 1579 at the age of sixty-five, and was buried in his cathedral of Gloucester. Views Cheyney, a Lutheran ed, was opposed the Thirty-nine Articles of 1563. From a letter (22 December 1566) of Edmund Gheast to Cecil it seems that Cheyney was offended by the insertion of the word 'only' in Article XXVIII on the Eucharist, and that he found it impossible to subscribe to this statement of doctrine. This article was drawn up by Gheast, who defended it against Cheyney, but without success. Three of his sermons (preached 22 August, 29 August, 1 September 1568) against Calvinist doctrine gave such offence at Bristol that he was answered in the cathedral by James Calfhill, and also by John Northbrooke, a preacher of Bristol. On another visit to Bristol, where his views were unacceptable, the bishop again preached on the freedom of the will and on the corporal presence in the Eucharist. In 1571 it became obligatory on all the bishops and clergy to subscribe the Articles. Cheyney refused to attend the convocation or to sign. It was unanimously resolved that he was contumacious and ought to be excommunicated. Accordingly, the sentence of excommunication was pronounced by the archbishop (20 April), and was entrusted to Guy Etton, the archdeacon of Gloucester, accompanied by the queen's pursuivant, to be published in Gloucester Cathedral. Two or three days after a chaplain of the bishop appeared for him as proxy and requested absolution. This was granted, but only to the next meeting of convocation, when it would be necessary for the bishop to attend and give explanations. He apparently submitted, and was absolved on 12 May 1571. But he seems to have remained under a sort of ban. The isolated Cheyney was a target for Edmund Campion, who had received sympathetic treatment from him. In his letter to Cheyney, by whom he had been ordained a deacon in the Anglican Church, he commends him for dealing gently with Catholics in his diocese, and exhorts him to convert. The letter produced no effect. Cheyney had been an antagonist to Rome, and was not inclined to accept her claims.

The model name stand for PersonVagn (\\"passenger car\\"), 6 cylinders, 5 seats; the third digit indicates the version. __TOC__  PV650-652  Volvo had started planning for a larger successor for its first car, the √ñV4 in 1926, even before the little four-cylinder car was introduced. The Swedish car market was dominated by American manufacturers and Volvo needed a large six- cylinder car to be competitive. Volvo PV651 was introduced in April 1929. The new car had a stronger chassis to cope with the more powerful engine. The bodywork was manufactured in the traditional way, with a wooden frame covered with steel plates. The 3010 cc DB engine was very robust and its crankshaft was supported by seven main bearings. The gearbox was a non-syncromesh 3-speed box. In the spring of 1930 the car was succeeded by the PV652, with modified interior and dashboard. The engine had a new carburettor but the main improvement was the introduction of hydraulic brakes. In 1931 the car got a 4-speed non-syncromesh gearbox. In January 1932 the PV652 was updated with the larger capacity 3366 cc EB engine and a new 3-speed gearbox with synchronized 2nd and 3rd gear. Volvo also built commercial chassis versions of the car. Most of them got light truck-, ambulance or hearse bodies, but a small number of the PV650 Series chassises were clothed in more flamboyant two-door open or closed bodies.  Versions  * PV650: 1929-34, 206 cars built, commercial chassis * PV651: 1929-30, mechanical brakes * PV652: 1930-33, hydraulic brakes Total production of PV651/652: 2,176 cars  PV653-655  In the autumn of 1933 the six-cylinder Volvo cars were updated with a new, stronger chassis with an X-shaped cross member support, smaller 17-inch rims and an all-steel body, without the wooden frame. The centre roof section was still covered with a leatherette insertion. The body had new fenders and the windshield and radiator grille were slightly tilted to improve the aerodynamics. The mechanical parts were left unchanged. Volvo offered two versions: the PV653 base model and the PV654 de luxe model. The PV654 luxury equipment included an uprated interior, twin fender mounted spare tires, twin chrome plated horns and twin rear lights.

The body was basically the same as in 1929. Still, Volvo updated the cars once more. The new PV658/PV659 got the larger capacity 3670 cc EC engine and a V-shaped radiator grille. The passenger cars were superseded by the Volvo PV51 in 1936, while the commercial chassis version soldiered on for one more year.

It was first broadcast on ITV. The film was produced to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Whitechapel murders, and was originally screened on British television in two 90-minute episodes, broadcast on consecutive evenings, in October 1988, to coincide with the dates of some of the original events, advertising itself in advance as a solution to the century-old mystery of the murderer's identity using newly discovered original evidence. Plot London, autumn 1888. Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the East End of London. As the mutilated corpses of other \\"shilling whores\\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of The Star - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \\"Jack the Ripper\\" after a letter bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren fears that a revolution is in the air in London's East End. There is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant George Godley. These suspects include the American actor Richard Mansfield (appearing in the play Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; socialist agitator George Lusk; Queen Victoria's clairvoyant Robert Lees; the Queen's grandson Prince Albert Victor; and Dr Theodore Dyke Acland, the son- in-law of Sir William Gull, Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked. Cast * Michael Caine - Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline, an aging alcoholic whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking * Lewis Collins - Sergeant George Godley * Armand Assante - Richard Mansfield, American Stage actor in the theatrical play Jekyll and Hyde * Ray McAnally - Sir William Gull, Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria * Ken Bones - Robert James Lees, Queen Victoria's psychic medium * Susan George - Catherine Eddowes, fourth victim of Jack the Ripper * Jane Seymour - Emma Prentiss * Harry Andrews - Coroner Wynne Baxter * Lysette Anthony - Mary Jane Kelly, fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper * Gerald Sim - Dr. George Bagster Phillips * Hugh Fraser - Commissioner of Police Sir Charles Warren * Edward Judd - Chief Superintendent of Police Thomas Arnold * George Sweeney - Coach driver John Netley * Michael Gothard - George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, and a violent Marxist and power-hungry politician * T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In Jack the Ripper, Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually George Chapman. George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a churchwarden and a Freemason. Hugh Fraser wore clothing that his character, Sir Charles Warren, had actually worn. This was both Harry Andrews and Edward Judd's last production. Armand Assante's stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming Jack the Ripper, Jane Seymour said, \\"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn‚Äôt tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you‚Äôd show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you‚Äôre on to the next. So that was interesting.\\" Michael Caine worked with Jack the Ripper director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two- part Jekyll & Hyde (1990), based on the book by Robert Louis Stevenson. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' Jack the Ripper series. Using historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, Jack the Ripper was written by Derek Marlowe and David Wickes and directed by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited Masonic/Royal Family conspiracy theory as the 1978 film Murder By Decree; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film From Hell. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by Thomas E. A. Stowell who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of The Criminologist.Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \\"Jack the Ripper ‚Äì A Solution?\\". The Criminologist vol.5 pp.40‚Äì51 The theory was later turned into the bestselling Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution (1976) by Stephen Knight. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional Sherlock Holmes who uncovered the conspiracy in Murder By Decree and instead concentrates on the real-life Whitechapel detective Frederick Abberline, as assisted by Sergeant George Godley.Jack the Ripper reviewed on Eofftv.com The series is constructed as a Whodunit in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that Prince Albert Victor, Richard Mansfield, George Lusk, Henry Llewellyn or Theodore Dyke Acland could be Jack the Ripper. Before Jack the Ripper was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the Scotland Yard files on the Ripper case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from Ripperologist Melvin Harris and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim. Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, \\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the Home Office and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\\" The series' \\"revelation\\" that Sir William Gull was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 BBC TV series Jack the Ripper (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film Murder by Decree, assigned the fictitious name \\"Sir Thomas Spivey,\\" was based on Sir William Gull. Marlowe and Wickes retained The Final Solutions contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a red herring; there is no mention of Walter Sickert, Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail or Freemasons; and the explanation given for the murders is dementia, acquired by Gull from a stroke. The original script adhered more closely to The Final Solution but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, Jane Seymour stated \\"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\\" The series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of multiple personality disorder (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi- faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman John Netley complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play after Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner Sir Charles Warren to avoid a scandal, as Gull was Queen Victoria's physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed. Jack the Ripper ends with the following disclaimer: The series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with Barry Foster of Van der Valk cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network CBS became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off. Michael Caine played Frederick Abberline Jack the Ripper was consequently re-tooled as an Anglo-American co- production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by Thames Television and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the United States, so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor Michael Caine \\\\- ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy, when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women. The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. Jack the Ripper reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million. In the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by Brian Capron.Series background on Eofftv.com He was replaced by Lewis Collins who was best known as Bodie in the ITV action series The Professionals. American actor Armand Assante and British actress Jane Seymour, both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. Ken Bones, George Sweeney, Edward Judd and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series. Jack the Ripper began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at Pinewood Studios. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.Action TV Online The series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \\"Canonical Five\\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic. Several DVD editions of Jack the Ripper include, as extra features, audio commentary by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring Barry Foster and Brian Capron. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases. Historical accuracy The film contains several historical inaccuracies: Inspector Frederick Abberline's name is mis-pronounced for the entirety of the series. There is also no evidence that he was an alcoholic. George Lusk is depicted as an anarchist but was in fact a mild-mannered, public spirited man: the patrols he organised were more like modern neighbourhood watch patrols or police organised searches. Prince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as the Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume that title until May 1890, two years after the murders. Emma Prentiss claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication didn\`t exist until 1891. A photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary. According to their badges, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division. George Godley exclaims that the murderer has cut off the ears of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary. The actor Richard Mansfield is portrayed as being american. Although he had his greatest success in America, Mansfield was an Englishman born in Berlin to a Russian mother and an English father. Bloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation. When the body of MaryJane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corpse through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right. Susan George, playing prostitute Catharine Eddowes, is clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress. This garment would have been far beyond the means of women like Eddowes. Frederick Abberline is depicted as having been transferred to Whitechapel as a form of punishment for his alcoholism. In fact, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having previously worked as the local Inspector for Whitechapel for fourteen years from 1873-1887.

It was produced and sold in France by Simca. It was virtually identical to the Fiat 500 Topolino on which it was based, but was first presented, at the company's new Nanterre plant, three months ahead of the Fiat equivalent on 10 March 1936. Production was delayed, however, by a wave of strikes, that accompanied the June 1936 electoral victory of L√©on Blum's Popular Front government. The manufacturer boasted at the time of its launch of being ahead of the \\"plans across the Rhine\\": this was a reference to the already rumoured launch of the Volkswagen Beetle which would appear only in 1938. Advanced features included independent front suspension, a four speed gear box, hydraulically controlled drum brakes on all four wheels and a twelve volt electrical system. The Simca 5 also offered exceptional fuel economy. In a test it managed to travel 110 kilometers on just 5 litres of fuel, which equates to 4.545 l/100km or 51.75 mpg The car was originally intended for sale on the domestic market for less than 10,000 French Francs, an aspiration soon overtaken by a decline in the currency's value that gathered pace in the second half of the 1930s. By the time of the 32nd Paris Motor Show in October 1938, the manufacturer's listed price even for the base \\"standard\\" bodied car, was 13,980 francs. With an engine size that corresponded with the 3CV car tax band the Simca 5, along with its Fiat sibling, could be presented as the \\"smallest volume production car in the world\\". Production of the Simca 5 was slowed (but did not ever cease entirely) by the war and the period of German occupation in the early 1940s, but resumed in 1946. A number were commandeered by the German Army for use as staff cars. 46,472 of the cars had been produced by the time the car was delisted by Simca in 1949. By now it had been replaced on the company's production lines by the similar but partially reskinned and slightly more powerful Simca 6. * This entry is based on a translation of the French Wikipedia corresponding entry Sources and further reading 5 Category:Cars introduced in 1936 ","title":"Simca 5"},{"id":"24651396","text":"The is a kei car built by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu from 2009 to 2018.

TR670-674  With the introduction of the six-cylinder PV650 Series in 1929, Volvo had a car large and robust enough to be competitive on the lucrative taxicab market. The TR670 Series was introduced in February 1930. Volvo increased the wheelbase by 150 mm (to 3,100 mm), which turned the car into a seven seater with two foldable spare seats in the passenger compartment. The car was built in two versions: the TR S (Stad, ‚Äútown‚Äù) had a glass partition between the driver and the passenger seats. This car also had a higher roof line, so that the gentlemen wouldn‚Äôt have to take off their top hats during the ride. The TR L (Landsort, ‚Äúcountryside‚Äù) lacked the partition and used the same roof line as the ordinary PV651.

The test is used to see if any of the tests or questions (\\"items\\") do not have responses that vary in line with those for other tests across the population. The summary measure would be an average of some form, weighted where necessary, and the item-correlation test is used to decide whether or not responses to a given test should be included in the set being averaged. In some fields of application such a summary measure is called a scale. The test An item- total correlation test is performed to check if any item in the set of tests is inconsistent with the averaged behaviour of the others, and thus can be discarded. The analysis is performed to purify the measure by eliminating ‚Äògarbage‚Äô items prior to determining the factors that represent the construct;Churchill, G.A., (1979). \\"A paradigm for developing better measures of marketing constructs\\", Journal of Marketing Research, 16(1) pp 64‚Äì73, , that is, the meaning of the averaged measure. It is supposed that the result for a particular test on a given individual is initially used to produce a score, where the scores for different tests have a similar range across individuals. An overall measure for an individual would be constructed as the average of the scores for a number of different tests. A check on whether a given test behaves similarly to the others is done by evaluating the Pearson correlation (across all individuals) between the scores for that test and the average of the scores of the remaining tests that are still candidates for inclusion in the measure. In a reliable measure, all items should correlate well with the average of the others. A small item-correlation provides empirical evidence that the item is not measuring the same construct measured by the other items included. A correlation value less than 0.2 or 0.3 indicates that the corresponding item does not correlate very well with the scale overall and, thus, it may be dropped.Everitt, B.S.

It blocks A-type potassium channels in the central nervous system and hERG-channels in the heart. Source/Isolation BmTx3 was originally purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion, Buthus Martensi Karsch. BmTx3 is a ‚Äúshort-chain‚Äù peptide like other potassium channel blockers in the scorpion venom and added to the phylogenetic tree in the subfamily Œ±-KTx15. Its 3D structure has not yet been elucidated, but based on sequence similarity it likely resembles the 3D structure of BmTx1 or Discrepin. Biochemistry BmTx3 consists of an Œ±-helix and two Œ≤-sheet segments cross- linked by three disulfide bridges (Cs-Œ±/Œ≤ motif). It is a short chain peptide with a molecular mass of 3751.6 Da; it consists of 37 amino acids. Œ±/Œ≤ motif of BmTx3 Target BmTx3 is the first toxin from the scorpion Œ±-KTx subfamily 15 with two functional faces. As all Œ±-KTx peptides, BmTx3 blocks A-type (IA) potassium currents (KD = 54 nM). BmTx3 blocks primarily the Kv4.x proteins and has a higher affinity for Kv4.1 channels than for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 channels. The second functional face of BmTx3 blocks the hERG (human Ether-√†-go-go) channel (KD = 2 ŒºM), a characteristic belonging to Œ≥-KTx peptides. BmTx3 binding site seems essentially localized in neurons but could also be present in glial cells, endothelial cells and/or arterial smooth muscle cells. The distribution of BmTx3 binding sites is heterogeneous; a high density is found in the caudate‚Äìputamen and accumbens nucleus, thalamus, hippocampal formation and cerebellum. Mode of Action The functional face of ‚Äúshort-chain‚Äù scorpion toxins is built of two important dyads (Lys and Tyr) on the Œ≤-sheet side. Lysine plugs deep into the channel pore and Tyrosine, as penultimate or ultimate and hydrophobic residue, turns it to fixate it, leading to a physical occlusion of the channel pore. This is supported by the finding that deletion of the two C-terminal residues (sBmTx3-delYP) results in loss of ability to block IA-current. The other functional face is thought to be situated at the Œ±-helix-side and composed of Arg18 and Lys19, like the functional face of other hERG toxins. It is known that Œ±-KTx peptides use the Œ≤-sheet side to interact with the receptor, whereas Œ≥-KTx peptides usually use their Œ±-helix- side. As BmTx3 seems to use both sides to bind to different potassium channels, it might be an evolutionary transient between the two families. Toxicity When injected into mice it causes epileptiform behavior. This might be due to its effect on A-type K+ channels, which, like the Kv4.x, are involved in action potential back propagation, firing frequency, spike initiation and action potential waveform determination. Blocking of the hERG channel can cause drug-induced long QT syndrome, arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation which can result in death.

History A F1G \\"Chevron\\" pull station with the older Faraday logo. Faraday was founded in 1875 in Brooklyn, New York. In the early 1900s, the company was owned by Stanley & Patterson, an electrical supplies conglomerate. Around this time, Faraday began producing notification appliances, such as bells, horns, buzzers, etc. They also rebranded coded fire alarm stations from Holtzer-Cabot. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Faraday was known as \\"Sperti-Faraday\\", and the company moved to Adrian, Michigan. From the late 1960s up until present, many companies rebranded Faraday's popular line of notification appliances, including Simplex, Standard Electric Time Company, Pyrotronics, Gamewell, FCI, and more. In 1978, Faraday bought out Standard Electric Time, and around the same time, moved its location to Tecumseh, Michigan. In 1977, Faraday bought out S.H. Couch, and continued to manufacture the iconic F1G \\"Chevron\\" pull station, originally designed by Couch in the 1950s. Siemens currently manufactures the \\"Chevron\\" pull station as an addressable version.  Purchase by Siemens and Wheelock lawsuit  In 1995, Faraday was bought by Cerberus Pyrotronics, and in 1998, Cerberus Pyrotronics was bought by Siemens. Faraday then moved to their current Florham Park location. Soon after the buyout, Wheelock responded with a lawsuit against Siemens for patent infringement since they thought the Faraday signals they used were too similar in design to their signals, which Siemens lost to. In 2007, as a result of the lawsuit, Faraday discontinued its entire line of notification appliances for 8 years in favor of Wheelock's line as part of the agreement. However, in 2015, eight years after the lawsuit, Siemens did not restart production of their own notification appliances, sticking with the Wheelock devices. Faraday continued to make fire alarm panels for small-to- mid-size applications, along with its own line of initiating devices until 2015, when Siemens discontinued the Faraday brand and absorbed the company.  Product line  In the 2000s, the company announced its Fire-Smart series of alarm detectors which provide advanced detection of true fire & smoke conditions and eliminate false alarms. The MPC series of intelligent addressable alarm panels utilized the electronic signature of each device to determine alarm, trouble, or maintenance alert status. These panels could only provide six-amps of alarm signaling power on the notification appliance circuits, however both six and eight amp power supplies are also available to expand the notification capabilities. The company also offers a line of voice- evacuation systems capable of real-voice recording, redundant amplifiers, over 1,000 monitoring and control points for total control. Programming correlations can define fire alarm or other alert messages. Common uses for alert tones include general evacuation, severe weather messages, or other alerts.

The building was erected in 1960 and served the community for over 44 years. The Magistracy used to handle cases in the Kowloon District, which covers Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Shek Kip Mei, Cheung Sha Wan and Ho Man Tin, and could be considered one of the busiest in Hong Kong. It was closed in 2005 due to cost saving policy of the government and consolidation of magistracies from nine to six.Anquities and Monuments Office, Leisure and Cultural Services Department: \\"Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings\\", p.338 In February 2009, the government declared that the building will be converted into the Hong Kong campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design.

The North Kowloon Magistracy was closed on 3 January 2005 due to cost saving policy of the government and consolidation of magistracies from nine to six. The estimated saving from the closure of North Kowloon Magistracy is HK$6.6 million a year coming mainly from the reduction of registry staff.Judiciary, \\"North Kowloon Magistracy to Close\\", Government Press Release, 24 December 2004 Cases from this court have consequently been dealt with in Kwun Tong, Kowloon City and Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts. Jurisdiction The magistracy was classified as the lowest court that handled indictable and summary offences. It was made up of a Juvenile Court, four Magistrates' courts and government offices. Minor offences such as traffic conviction, littering and juvenile offences were treated in the Special Magistrates and Juvenile Court respectively. Solemn cases were usually transferred to the District Courts or the Court of First Instance. The maximum sentence in the Magistracy is two years' imprisonment and a mulct of $100,000. There were more than forty defendants attended the court daily and could reach up to eighty occasionally.\\"Hong Kong Judiciary Annual Report 2004 Chapter 5\\", The Judiciary The staircase where parties face off in front of the Magistracy in Hong Kong television dramas and movies Important events The cases adjudicated in North Kowloon Magistracy were mostly minor ones including prostitution, illegal hawking and littering in prohibited areas. On 7 December 1998, an elderly hawker suddenly set fire to himself in the Magistracy after he was convicted of illegal hawking, fined HK$400 and had his jade trinkets confiscated. He died two days later in the hospital., Sing Tao, 22 August 2002 In December 2002, someone sprayed red paint on the rear door of the Magistracy to support the implementation of Article 23, he was later charged with criminal damage to property., Ming Pao, 8 February 2008 In December 2003 Kwai Bing Hong (aka King of the Gangsters) (Traditional Chinese: Â≠£ÁÇ≥ÈõÑ) appeared in the Magistracy facing charges of illegal possession of firearms and causing grievous bodily harm to two police officers. Since Kwai was a mastermind of a cross-border gang and the most wanted criminal whom the Hong Kong Police Force had wished to apprehend, there were over one hundred armed police officers stationed outside the Magistracy on the trial date for security purposes., Wen Wei Po, 27 December 2003 Architecture The 7-storey court building was built in granite ashlar blocks in 1960 and designed by Palmer & Turner Architects. North Kowloon Magistracy is featured by the Neo-classical architecture and Stripped Classicism, a form of neo-classicism from which most of the traditional mouldings, ornament and details have been elided, visually emphasizing the structural and proportional systems. Although there are a few other buildings of similar design in Hong Kong, the Magistracy building appears to be the only surviving example of this building type and therefore can be considered as a rarity.Conserve and Revitalise Hong Kong Heritage ‚Äì North Kowloon Magistracy ‚Äì Resource Kit The building is divided into 3 functional zones and characterized by independent circulation access for general public, magistrates and staff, police and prisoners respectively. Its gross floor area is approximately 7,345 m2 with a central atrium. On its front facade, there are central projecting bay, symmetrical tall and narrow windows. Tiled apron panels can be seen. The external wall is mostly grey with blue canopies. A central light well was constructed spanning the third to the fifth floor. Construction materials The materials used for construction of the building is reinforced concrete. For the exterior part, there are mainly granite finishes on the front facade, with granite sprayed as coverage. Dark blue glazed ceramic tiles were used too. For the interior part, various materials were adopted. Emulsion paint was used on the wall with some other floor finishes,e.g. vinyl and ceramic floor tiles and timber floor strips.  Architectural merits  External Stele with words of North Kowloon Magistracy carved both in Chinese and English The door at the main entrance is a pair of bronze doors and the bronze doorcases with moulded architraves. Another major architectural feature of the building is the double half-turn unenclosed symmetrical grand staircase outside the door that form a hexagon. On the balustrade of staircases, there is ornamental ironwork featuring with Grecian motifs. Some landings, strings, spandrels in Italianate palazzo style can also be found. Internal There are ornamental handrails and guard bars to the windows, and Italianate balustrades on the staircases on the first three floors. Defects Minor cracks on walls and beams at some floors are found on the building. Spalling of concrete is also observed on ceilings of some floors. Regular maintenance and monitoring is required to keep the structural slabs, beams and columns in good condition. Conservation Since its closure in 2005, the Hong Kong Government had suggested making the North Kowloon Magistracy a declared monument or turning the Magistracy into the headquarters of the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority. However, this proposal faced strong opposition from the Sham Shui Po District Council, which in turn suggested using the site to build a Legal History Museum. In 2008, the North Kowloon Magistracy was part of the seven buildings of Batch I of the Hong Kong Government's Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership SchemeConserve and Revitalise Hong Kong Heritage: Batch I of Revitalisation Scheme seeking adaptive reuse of government-owned historic buildings. On 17 February 2009, the government declared that the building will be used by the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) (Traditional Chinese: ÁæéÂúãËñ©Âá°Á¥çËóùË°ìË®≠Ë®àÂ≠∏Èô¢) as the school building as well as helping the old court become a Digital Media Centre of Asia.Batch I of Revitalisation Scheme ‚Äì Result of Selection ‚Äì SCAD Hong Kong Campus : North Kowloon Magistracy The Savannah College of Art and Design is granted the right to use the building of the former North Kowloon Magistracy for its Hong Kong branch campus, which is its first campus in Asia and will be in addition to campuses in Savannah, GA, Atlanta, GA and Lacoste, France. The anticipated renovation period for the magistracy building will be around 15 months and the SCAD school is expected to open in 2011, allowing the public to visit the old law courts and passages for prisoners.Mrs. Rita Lau, \\"SCED welcomes revitalising historic buildings for nurturing creative sector and promoting tourism\\", Government Press Release, 17 February 2009 The estimated flow of people is about 130,000 headcounts per year for the first five years of opening. Implementation A branch campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) was established, providing 1,500 student places at tertiary level for studies on digital media, including animation, advertising design, photography, graphic design, illustration, interactive design and game development, motion media design, and visual effects. The revitalisation and reconstruction project was estimated to cost approximately $100 million. SCAD wishes to: # Establish Hong Kong as a pre-eminent site for the study of digital media in Asia; # Offer globally recognised digital media programmes, enhance global competitiveness in digital media and creative industries and increase educational diversity to Hong Kong; # Give more support to the development of creative industry in Hong Kong; # Set up a facility to provide cultural resources to both students and the professional industry; and # Add an international dimension to the Sham Shui Po district and revitalize the community. Apart from the above, it is hoped that the project will obtain synergy effect by cooperating with the nearby Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre () and provide summer art programmes and campaigns to students. The project retains the exterior appearance of the Magistracy. Parts of the building will remain open to the public and a gallery will be set up to display the history of the Magistracy. A website will also be created to show the comparison between the old Magistracy building and the newly renovated SCAD-Hong Kong Campus. A conservation documentary that captures the entire conservation process will be produced. It is expected that the project will house 40 classrooms, 16 faculty and staff offices, one library, one art gallery, two computer laboratories,etc. Also, two court rooms will be converted into a digital studio and a lecture hall respectively. The project will implement a variety of greening measures such as use of high efficiency lighting and fixtures fabricated from sustainable materials. Controversy over revitalisation scheme Much controversy had arisen in the bidding process of the Scheme. Cantonese opera 'big sister' Liza Wang Ming-Chun who led the Chinese Artist Association of Hong Kong had submitted a proposal of renovating the Magistracy into a Cantonese opera training and performance centre. Immediately before the announcement of the result, Wang claimed that her association's plan would be rejected and the outcome was already 'fixed'. Wang's outburst has caused much public outcry and as a result the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Revitalization of Historic Buildings, Bernard Charnwut Chan, had to clean up the rumours on air. On 17 February 2009, Liza Wang strongly protested against the result of the scheme, said she wanted to cry and threatened to take the matter up with Chief Executive Donald Tsang. The emotional outburst had drawn a big audience from the public and the incident was reported in the media for days.Mary Ma, \\"In a fix over Magistrate building\\", The Standard, 21 January 2009Mary Ma, \\"Partnership structure put to a test\\", The Standard, 17 February 2009 It was later reported in the newspapers that the association's initial proposal had a comparable score to the ultimate winner SCAD but fell short at the interview stage because Wang was unable to convince the Advisory Committee with an estimated operating cost of $15 million and foreseeable difficulty in raising funds.\\"Bid Blown by Bad Interview\\", The Standard, 25 February 2009 Other places in the surroundings * The nearest historic building is Mei Ho House (Grade I) of the old Shek Kip Mei Housing Estate * Fook Tak Kwu Miu, 'Happiness and Virtue Ancient Temple' () * Saviour Lutheran School, a special school * Hong Kong Sze Yap Commercial and Industrial Association School, a primary school References External links * SCAD official website * Presentation by SCAD Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited on 17 Feb 2009 Category:Judiciary of Hong Kong Category:Government buildings in Hong Kong Category:Shek Kip Mei Category:Government buildings completed in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in Hong Kong ","title":"North Kowloon Magistracy"},{"id":"24651496","text":"Dalli may refer to: Places * Dalli Rajhara, a city and a municipality, Durg district, Chhattisgarh State, India * Dalli, Guyana, a community in Essequibo Islands-West Demerara, Guyana * Dalli, Tanout, a former town in Tanout District, Zinder Region, Niger Other uses * Dalli (surname) * DALLI Group, a German detergent producer See also * Dali (disambiguation) * DALI (disambiguation) * Dalli Dalli, a German game show, see List of international game shows ","title":"Dalli"},{"id":"24651545","text":"Eduardo Guerrero Cartagena (born February 23, 1971 in Santander, Colombia) is a retired male road racing cyclist from Colombia.

For example, a glass breaking on the floor is an event; it occurs at a unique place and a unique time.A.P. French (1968). Special Relativity, MIT Introductory Physics Series, CRC Press, , p. 86. Strictly speaking, the notion of an event is an idealization, in the sense that it specifies a definite time and place, whereas any actual event is bound to have a finite extent, both in time and in space.Leo Sartori (1996). Understanding Relativity: a simplified approach to Einstein's theories, University of California Press, , p. 9. Upon choosing a frame of reference, one can assign coordinates to the event: three spatial coordinates \\\\vec{x} = (x,y,z) to describe the location and one time coordinate t to specify the moment at which the event occurs. These four coordinates (\\\\vec{x},t) together form a four-vector associated to the event. One of the goals of relativity is to specify the possibility of one event influencing another. This is done by means of the metric tensor, which allows for determining the causal structure of spacetime. The difference (or interval) between two events can be classified into spacelike, lightlike and timelike separations. Only if two events are separated by a lightlike or timelike interval can one influence the other.

Life   Youth  Marie ‚Äì nicknamed \\"Mimi\\" ‚Äì was born in Rome as daughter of Baron Ludwig August von Buch, Prussian ambassador to the Holy See. Her father died in 1845, and her mother, Marie, married Prince Hermann Anton von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg (1808‚Äì1874) in 1847. By this marriage, the economic situation of mother and daughter, which until then had not been comfortable, was improved due to the wealth of Hatzfeldt. von Schleinitz was trained as a pianist from her early youth; taught by such virtuosos as Carl Tausig, she developed a remarkable musical talent. Her acquaintance with Franz Liszt, who also showed interest in the advancement of her musical abilities, dates from this period.  Marriages  Alexander Schleinitz, von Schleinitz's first husband; portrait by Adolph Menzel, 1865 In 1865 von Schleinitz married Baron Alexander von Schleinitz (1807‚Äì1885), then Prussian minister of the royal household. Her husband was thirty-five years older than her. In 1879 they were made count and countess by emperor William I, German Emperor. They had no children. Her first husband died in 1885. In 1886 von Schleinitz married Count Anton von Wolkenstein-Trostburg (1832‚Äì1913), Austrian ambassador first in Berlin, then in Saint Petersburg, and finally (from 1894) in Paris. Henceforth, she called herself \\"Countess Schleinitz-Wolkenstein\\". In summertime, they retired to the country estate of the Wolkenstein family, the castle Ivano in the south of the County of Tyrol. After her second husband's retirement in 1904, they resettled in Berlin, where both died shortly before the breakout of World War I.  Richard Wagner  Cosima Wagner with Count and Countess Wolkenstein at the Bayreuth Festival, 1880s Richard Wagner at Villa Wahnfried with his closest friends, about 1880; painting by Georg Papperitz. On the right, sitting, is von Schleinitz. Marie von Schleinitz became a passionate fan of Richard Wagner (1813‚Äì1883) beginning from the early 1860s, when she made his acquaintance of at a concert in Breslau. As the wife of the Prussian minister of the royal household, von Schleinitz used her social influence that was connected with her new rank to support and publicise Wagner's career among the leading circles of Prussian society. She supported him at the Prussian court; Emperor William I, granted him the opening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1876. von Schleinitz helped found the \\"Bayreuther Patronatsverein\\" (Bayreuth Patronage Club) in 1870, whose purpose was financing the diverse projects of Wagner, among them the building of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which was completed in 1876. Marie von Schleinitz and Wagner were close personal friends from their first meeting, and exchanged many letters. After Wagner's remarriage in 1870, von Schleinitz became an intimate friend of Wagner's second wife, Cosima Wagner, whose daughter Daniela, later Mrs. Henry Thode, she introduced into Berlin society in the 1880s. Wagner died in 1883.  Literary salon  Menzel, 1875. From left to right: Hermann von Helmholtz, Heinrich von Angeli, von Schleinitz, Anna von Helmholtz, count G√∂tz von Seckendorff, countess Hedwig von Br√ºhl, crown princess Victoria, count Wilhelm Pourtal√®s, crown prince Friedrich, Alexander von Schleinitz, Anton von Werner, prince Hermann of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. From the beginning of her marriage, von Schleinitz hosted a literary salon at the ministerial residence of her husband at No. 77 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. She placed particular emphasis on the cultural and intellectual orientation of her salon, which contributed to her later fame as the only aristocratic woman in Berlin involved in modeling the cultural shape of the capital of the recently created German Empire. She mixed aristocratic and bourgeois elements in her salon, which was a novelty in the then still quite feudal society of Prussia. Until then, nobles, officers, and civil officials had scarcely come into contact with intellectuals, scholars, and businessmen. In consequence of her second marriage to Wolkenstein, von Schleinitz gave up her salon in Berlin and accompanied her new husband on his several diplomatic missions. After his retirement from service in 1904, she reopened her house in Berlin, where she received personal friends and members of the political and cultural life of the Reich until her death in 1912.  Bismarck  Besides her friendship to Wagner, von Schleinitz was known for her rivalry with Otto von Bismarck (1815‚Äì1898). The Prussian prime minister and later Chancellor of Germany, who maintained a conservative, authoritarian rule over Prussia and Germany, was unsympathetic to von Schleinitz due to her liberal mentality. Bismarck was an enemy of her husband, who had been one of the protagonists of the so-called \\"new era\\" from 1858 to 1862, when William I and his wife Augusta followed a moderate strategy of modernization and liberalization of the Prussian state. Alexander von Schleinitz was a favorite of the liberal-minded queen Augusta. Nevertheless, von Schleinitz made several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile Bismarck with her husband and herself.  Historical role  Marie von Schleinitz stands as a symbolic figure of the little-known liberal-aristocratic opposition against Bismarck's conservative politics during the foundation of the German Reich, as well as for a short, intense blossoming of culture and intellectuality in Germany historically located between the downfall of romanticism and the beginning of modernity.

This islet is a part of Alagiyamanavalam Revenue Village and Panchayat, Ariyalur taluka of Ariyalur district in the state of Tamil nadu, India . Geography Ramanallur is located at . It stretches 5 km West to East and 2 km North to South. Ramanallur consists of Mela Ramanallur and Kizha Ramanallur. There are only 4 streets in Mela Ramanallur namely * Vadukku Theru (North Street) * Mela Theru (West Street) * Therkku Theru (South Street) * Keela Theru Kizha Ramanallur is another Islet located near to Mela Ramanallur amid Kollidam river. The islet has houses, a panchayat union school, a fair price shop, a temple of Pachaiamman, which was unearthed from a mound of sand by villagers and agricultural lands in which paddy and vegetables like brinjal are grown. They get water in borewells at a depth of 15 ft. Most of the people, who are land owners, said that they have been living for generations in this island village. Demographics Ramanallur had a total population of about 2500. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Ramanallur has an average literacy rate of 55%. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. How they reach Mainland If they want to move on north side to Thirumanur in Ariyalur district or to the south side to Kabisthalam and Papanasam in Thanjavur district, It is a difficult task. During summer, they use bullock carts to cross the Kollidam river to a distance of 1 km on either side. In rainy season, they use coracle when the river is full or wade through waist deep water. When the river is in spate, they are completely cut off from mainland even by the above modes of transport i.e. they are in distress.

Clear discrimination of views pointing at the definitive meaning the four philosophical schools of the Sutrayana traditionally taught in Tibet with reference to the Dzogchen teachings. Source: (accessed: Monday October 12, 2009), p.5 Sound Generally in the Buddhadharma, sound as an object of discourse and a created 'phenomenon' (Sanskrit: dharma) is 'impermanent' (Sanskrit: anitya) because of being a product, it is 'conditioned' (Sanskrit: samsk·πõta-dharma). Philosophical 'views' (Sanskrit: drishti) or 'conclusions' (Sanskrit: siddhanta) on the nature of sound are very important in all Dharmic Traditions, traditions of Dharma and dharma schools of thought. The nature of sound is of particular importance to the early Buddhadharma as it was one of the ways Shakyamuni differentiated his teachings from the prevailing views of his time which held the sounds of the Vedas to be eternally authoritative. As a general rule, Buddhist systems emphasize that sounds do not of their own accord inherently express their meanings but are arbitrary conventions, socially determined and understood by consensus. Historically, Shakyamuni was reactionary to the status of the 'revealed authority' (Sanskrit: apauru·π£eya) of the Vedas the ritual incantations and sounds of which were held as permanent and eternal. In the Vedic system, the sound and sign of the syllable or visible mantra was held to be none-other than what it communicated. This is understood in Linguistics and Semiotic Theory as motivated language or appropriated language where the signifier 'appropriated' the essence or quality of the signified. For example, the sound, sign and signified were all the same in essence. Early Buddhardharma as a general rule ostensibly rejected such reified 'essences' (Sanskrit: svabhƒÅva) as it was such views that supported the notion of the 'self' (Sanskrit: atman) which in turn supported the rigidity of the Varnashrama dharma social system of caste that Shakyamuni challenged (Williams 1980, 1981). But this is not always the case in the Buddhadharma as the sound in the title of this tantra denotes the immutable, unconditioned, uncreated, 'primordial sound' (nada). It is in this notion that the Tantra of the Vajrayana and Mantrayana and that of Sanatana Dharma are in accord. The exoteric and esoteric motifs of sound and speech as permutations and evocation of mantra and bija in the Buddhadharma and the wider tradition of Dharma is ubiquitous. For an entry into this discourse refer Three Vajras. Sound is also to be understood as the 'nada', the primordial sound, the unmade sound, sound is a metaphor for spiritual energy, sound is a metaphor for the vibration of the luminosity of the Five Pure Lights. The Lights are constituted by thigle. Light here is also a metaphor. All thigle are mala or garlands, vajra-chains of spell-letters the oneness and unity of which is the mandala of reverberating spell-letters which is the Thirteenth Bhumi of Rongzompa. They are conceptual tools, all upaya are tools, all tools are let go, released as they are but supports for mind. The great debate of sound internalized in the Buddhadharma There is an embedded irony in Thal 'gyur and Prasanga in that the 'consequence' in Prasangika dialectic, the reductio ad absurdum of Madhyamaka thought, pointing out an undesired consequence of a proposition or premise, those who made assertions or held such premises were given the name retrospectively, Svatantrika. One such stock example was the nature of sound and in refuting the phyogs snga or the snga rgol phyi rgol gnyis la mthun snang grub nges kyi tshul gsum 'god pa'i ngag. That is, against maintaining sound is produced but permanent: the' dharmin sound', is unproduced, because it is permanent or, the dharmin sound is impermanent, because it is produced, phyogs snga sun 'byin par mi 'dod pa'i thal ba 'phen pa'am, rgol phyi rgol gnyis la mthun snang grub nges kyi tshul gsum 'god pa'i ngag dper na, sgra rtag par 'dod pa'i gang zag gi ngor, sgra chos can, ma byas par thal, rtag pa'i phyir, zhes pa lta bu sun 'byin pa dang, yang na, sgra chos can, mi rtag pa yin par thal, byas pa'i phyir, zhes pa lta bu tshul gsum tsang ba'i ngag go. Western discourse has favoured the Gelugpa view of this debate, the champion of which is Chandrakirti who challenged Bhavaviveka. As a general rule the Gelugpa favour the Prasangika. As a general rule the Nyingma view does not foreground the Prasangika over the Svatantrika as this would be an extreme view, a fallacy and failing of the Gelugpa . Indeed, as an evocation of the Two Truths the continuum of Svatantrika-Prasangika interpenetrate and mutually inform and are both of value in pointing to an 'inconceivable' (samye) truth. Themes The Drataljur states that the theoretical view of Ati Yoga coincides with the Madhyamaka Prasangika and that there is no contradiction between them.

Padma Publishing > (1998) , pp.208-209 In the Inner Tantras or esoteric yana of the Nyingma, the Mahayoga-yana, the Anuyoga-yana and the Atiyoga-yana, the buddha-nature is generally referred to as sugata-garbha rather than other renderings that denote other Buddhadharma schools of thought. 'Ordinary beings' is a rendering of 'sentient beings' and does not just denote the human experience. 'Buddha' denotes the potential of the continuum of the base and not that of the waxing of the path and the fullness of the fruit. That said, due to the indivisibility of the Two Truths it also denotes Buddha-potential as well as Buddha-actuality or Buddha- fruition through the disciplines, sadhana and skillful means of the Buddha- path. The continuums of base, path and fruit are a triune, interpenetrating and indivisible as the gankyil. 'Samsara' is to be understood more as a quality of the mindstream and a dimension of experience rather than a location. 'Timeless awareness' is a gloss of 'jnana'. 'Basic space of phenomena' is a rendering of 'dharmadhatu'. 'Phenomena' is a gloss of 'dharmas'. 'Confusion' is a rending of avidya or marigpa (literally: ignorance) which is not the actual absence of rigpa but its adventitious obscuration making it seem absent.

It originally was called Liberty Colored Junior High School. The building is now a community center known as the Rosewood Center. It is at East Main Street (South Carolina Highway 93) and Rosewood Street in Liberty. The school was built in 1937 on the site of a Rosenwald school that had burned down. Because of its role in the education of local African-American students, it was named to the National Register of Historic Places on April 18, 2003. History The first school for African-American students in the Liberty area began in 1899 at the New Hope Baptist Church. A year later, a wooden school was built next to the church. Around 1922, a three-teacher Rosenwald school was built on the site of the current building through funding from the parents, community, and matching funds from The Rosenwald Fund. This school burned in 1935. The current building was built in 1937 on the same site with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration. Additional funds came from the State insurance fund and community contributions. It was named Liberty Colored Junior High School and had grades one through nine. In 1945, grades ten and eleven were added and its name was changed to Liberty Colored High School. Twelfth grade were added in the 1949. It was one of two high schools for African-American students in Pickens County. It served students in Liberty, Norris, Central, Clemson and the adjacent rural areas. In 1955, the two high schools were consolidated into Clearview Colored High School in Easley. After the high school was moved, the school building was used as an elementary school for African-American students. It was named Rosewood Elementary School after its location on Rosewood Street. It had grades one through seven. When the Pickens County schools were desegregated in 1970, the student body was gradually merged with Liberty Elementary School. Then it was renamed as the Rosewood Center and used by Pickens County Schools as a special education, adult, and teacher education center. The building was sold to the City of Liberty in 2001. Although renovations on its interior began to use it as for municipal offices, the project was abandoned. In 2002, it was leased to Liberty Baptist Church for a youth activity center. Currently, the building is used as a community center. It can be rented for parties, receptions, and other events. Architecture The school is a one-story, brick building. It has a gabled, asphalt-shingled roof. A projecting wing has the primary entrance facing East Main Street. The entrance has three brick arches with cast key stones and imposts. There is a louvered vent above the center arch. There is a double door with fanlight transoms. There is a secondary entrance on Rosemont Street in a similar style. The school had an auditorium, four classrooms, and offices. The auditorium stage also served as the lunchroom. Originally, the basement had separate restrooms for the boys and the girls. In the 1950s, the stairway to the basement was closed, and the corridor was converted to new restrooms.

It is located just north of the city of Liborne south of Lalande-de-Pomerol (#15), northwest of Saint-√âmilion (#21) and east of Fronsac (#12). Also pictured in the map is the \\"Left Bank\\" wine regions of the M√©doc including St-Est√®phe (#3), Pauillac (#4), St-Julien (#5) and Margaux (#8). Pomerol is a French wine-growing commune and Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) within the Libournais (\\"Right Bank\\") in Bordeaux. The wine produced here is predominately from Merlot with Cabernet Franc playing a supporting role.Clive Coates An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France pp. 110‚Äì115 University of California Press; First Printing edition (June 2001) Unlike most other Bordeaux communes, there is no real village of Pomerol, although there is a church. The houses are set among the vineyards.Stephen Brooks The Complete Bordeaux pp. 457‚Äì461 Mitchell Beazley (November, 2012) The region was recognized as a distinct wine region apart from Saint-√âmilion and the greater Libournais region by the French government in 1923 and was granted AOC status in 1936 as part of the first wave of AOC establishments by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© (INAO). While it is now one of the most prestigious of the Bordeaux AOCs, this situation is relatively recent, dating to the second half of the twentieth century, which is often given as one of the reasons why Pomerol is not included in any of the Bordeaux classifications. Pomerol is the smallest of the major fine wine regions in Bordeaux, covering an area that is roughly three kilometers wide by 4 kilometers long. It is roughly one-seventh of the size of its much larger Right Bank neighbor Saint-√âmilion AOC and is on par with the smallest Left Bank commune of Saint-Julien AOC in the M√©doc. In 1998, there were 784 hectares of grape vines planted within the AOC boundaries producing 36,066 hectoliters (‚âà 952,763 gallons or 400,733 cases) of wine. In 2003 there were 150 declared producers in Pomerol harvesting 780 ha and producing a year average of 32,250 hl (around 358,333 cases) of wine. Almost all the wine is estate-bottled. Unlike other French wine regions, such as Burgundy and the Rh√¥ne Valley, there are no co-operatives currently operating in Pomerol. By 2007, the number of planted hectares had risen slightly to 800 ha (1980 acres).Oz Clarke Bordeaux pp. 194‚Äì205 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (May 2007) In 2009, there were 140 declared producers in Pomerol, have an average surface area of six hectares and the vineyard of the \\"Pomerol\\" appellation covers 800 hectares for an average production of 35,000 hectoliters per year.https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000024836173&dateTexte;=20180415 While many Pomerol wines now fetch very high prices at wine auctions and in the private market on a par with the most highly rated classified growths of Bordeaux, there is no official classification of Pomerol wine. However, the region does contain one property widely held to be equivalent to premier cru: Ch√¢teau P√©trus. History After the Crusades, many returning Knights Hospitaller established themselves in the Libourne/Pomerol area building hospitals and hostels. The Pomerol region, and its northern border, the Barbanne river was historically considered the frontier boundary between the north where people spoke the Langues d'o√Øl and the south where they spoke the Langue d'oc. Though it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when grapes were first planted in the Pomerol region there is enough evidence to show that viticulture was present in the area during the time of the Romans.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pp 106‚Äì107 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Similarly there is uncertainty as to the origins of the name \\"Pomerol\\", although there is some speculation that it stems from the Latin word poma which refers to a fruit bearing seeds and is the origin of the French word pomme, meaning apple. This theory is supported by the region's long history of polyculture with many other crops, particularly fruits and grains, being cultivated in the area long before viticulture became a primary focus. In 1270, the English founded the city of Libourne, which may have brought the vineyards of Pomerol to wider attention. However, as with most of Bordeaux, the wines of Pomerol were of lesser repute than the wines from further up the Garonne in the present-day departments of Tarn-et-Garonne and Lot-et-Garonne. The area's location along the major pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain also attracted the interest of the Knights Hospitaller, returning Crusaders who set up several hostels and hospitals in the region. Several of these establishments, such as the Gazin hospital, which was first mentioned in 1288, are now the sites of modern vineyards and wineries such as Ch√¢teau Gazin. The Knights remained in the region for several centuries, even helping to replant vineyards that were devastated by Hundred Years War. Transition from white wines to red Since 1936, the planting of white grape varieties has been strictly prohibited in Pomerol with Merlot (pictured) being the dominant grape in the AOC. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch traders wielded considerable influence over the wine trade in the Bordeaux market. While the Dutch were most notable for draining the marshes of M√©doc and paving the way for viticulture in the land north of Graves, they offered the communes of the right bank of the Dordgogne a market in Northern Europe (particularly the Baltic and Hanseatic states) bypassing the grip that the port of Bordeaux had on the English market. However, the taste of the Dutch and these northern markets leant towards white wines and it was white grape varieties that were most widely planted in Pomerol during this period. The transition to red grape varieties was slow. Plantings of Cabernet Franc in the Pomerol area were recorded, under the names Vidure and Bidure, as early as the 16th century but Merlot does not appear to have been introduced to the area until a couple of hundred years later. In 1760, Louis-L√©onard Font√©mong, a Libournais n√©gociant, planted what appears to be the first documented instance of Merlot in the region, in a vineyard that is now part of Ch√¢teau Rouget. However, white wine grapes continued to dominate the vineyards of Pomerol until the late 19th century when the higher prices of red clarets and the waning Dutch influence made red wine production more enticing. When the region received its full AOC status in 1936, the AOC regulation specifically outlawed the plantings of any white grape varieties in Pomerol. Even after its complete transformation into a red wine region, the reputation of Pomerol still lagged far behind that of the M√©doc. A 1943 comparative price list commissioned by the Vichy government listed P√©trus only at the level of a mid-tier Second Growth from the M√©doc with the next highest rated Pomerol estates, Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan and Ch√¢teau La Conseillante commanding prices in line with Third Growth estates like Ch√¢teau Giscours and Ch√¢teau La Lagune. Moueix family and ascent to prominence Jean-Pierre Moueix and his family are widely credited with putting Pomerol \\"on the international map\\". Born in the central French department of Corr√®ze, Moueix moved to the Bordeaux region with his family and first attempted to open up a n√©gociant house in the city of Bordeaux itself. However, he found that market heavily saturated, so he moved across the river to the Libournais region and opened up a n√©gociant house in the city of Libourne in 1937. In 1945, Moueix acquired exclusive selling rights to Ch√¢teau P√©trus.Jancis Robinson: Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pp. 458‚Äì459, Oxford University Press 2006 At first, Moueix mostly traded with Pomerol's traditional market in Belgium. However, as Moueix began buying and leasing properties and exhibiting more creative control over the winemaking process he began looking to expand Pomerol's recognition on the world market. In 1953 he purchased Ch√¢teau Trotanoy and Ch√¢teau La Fleur-P√©trus followed by Ch√¢teau Lagrange in 1959. Then in 1964, Moueix acquired majority share in P√©trus and fully took over the supervision and direction of winemaking. The 1982 vintage was a watershed moment for Moueix and Pomerol. Aided by a strong US dollar and the glowing reviews of American wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr., the region gained a strong foothold in the American market and helped propel estates like P√©trus to unprecedented prices on the auction circuit. In addition to P√©trus, the Moueix family also owns Ch√¢teau La Grave, Ch√¢teau Latour √† Pomerol and Ch√¢teau Hosanna. Climate and viticulture Merlot is highly prone to coulure where the flowers of the vine fail to get pollinated and develop into berries which can create difficulties in Pomerol if the weather is wet during flowering. While the climate of Pomerol is broadly similar to the rest of Bordeaux in the maritime influence, the region's distance from the sea and the Gironde estuary make the climate distinctly more continental than that of the M√©doc. This means that Pomerol sees more diurnal temperature variation during the growing season, between daytime highs and evening lows. Also while the region experiences more rainfall during the spring (which can cause problems for Merlot during flowering) there is overall significantly less rainfall during the summer months after veraison.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (5th Edition) pp. 156, 165 Dorling Kindersley (2011) Nevertheless, the threat of harvest rains is still present in Pomerol, especially for winemakers employing the philosophy of \\"extended hanging\\" time in order to prolong the ripening process. When rain does occur it can pose a significant risk of grey rot, especially for Merlot planted on heavy clay soils which tend to retain water. While some wineries, such as Ch√¢teau P√©trus, can afford the labor costs of covering their vineyard in plastic sheeting to prevent water from soaking down into the roots and employ helicopters to hovers over their vineyards, generating wind to dry out the grapes, not every property can take such measures.Chris Kissack \\"Petrus\\" The Wine Doctor. Accessed: March 16th, 2003Sophie Kevany \\"10 Things Every Wine Lover Should Know About Petrus\\" Wine Searcher, March 1st, 2013 While very hot vintages (such as 2003 and 2009) can create problems of over-ripeness in Merlot, the Pomerol region (and the Right Bank as a whole) tend to fare better during cooler years (such as 2006 and 2008). The main viticultural hazards are spring time frosts, which can occur frequently in the Pomerol region and disrupt entire vintages. Geography Pomerol is a sub-region in the Libournais which is located on the \\"right bank\\" of the Dordogne river as it flows westward into the Gironde Estuary which is home to the \\"left bank\\" wine regions of M√©doc. Pomerol lies immediately to the east and north-east of Libourne. Unlike most of the most prestigious communes of Bordeaux, it has no direct river access, being separated from the Dordogne to the south by the town and by Saint- √âmilion, which lies to the south-east. To the north-east, across a stream called la Barbanne Rau lies Lalande-de-Pomerol. It stands on a gravel bank (a feature it shares with the prestigious appellations of the M√©doc); towards the south and west, the soil is more sandy, while towards the north and east, it tends to clay. The sub-soil is dark packed clay, with a high iron content. The terrain is relatively flat with slight undulating slopes that fall from a height of 35-40 meters (115‚Äì130 feet) above sea level over a course of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to around 10 meters (33 feet). Most of the more highly rated estates in Pomerol are located in the eastern half the region, up to the border of Saint-√âmilion where the vineyards of the Premier Grand Cru Class√© (A) estate of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc can often be seen from the Pomerol estates themselves. The southernmost reaches of Pomerol extend past the hamlet of Catusseau whereas just north of the hamlet the soil contains some of the finest gravel particles in the region. In the northeast is the hamlet of Maillet which borders the AOCs of Lalande-de-Pomerol, Montagne-Saint-√âmilion and Saint-√âmilion with the road running through the hamlet itself being the official boundary between Pomerol and Saint-√âmilion. This has led to some legal issues as a few vineyards which are technically within the borders of Saint-√âmilion but extend into Pomerol have had to be granted \\"honorary citizenship of Pomerol\\". Vineyard soils The soils of Pomerol are varied and include a mixture of clay, gravel and sand. The soils of the Pomerol region are very diverse with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay scattered across the plateau. Roughly speaking the vineyard soils to the north and east, closer to the border of Saint-√âmilion tend to have more clay while the soils to the west and south become lighter and more gravelly. The plateau on which Pomerol sits is bordered by three rivers, the Barbanne to the north, the Isle to the west and Dordgogne and the city of Libourne to the south. As the terrain moves down the slopes of the plateau and towards these rivers the soils become more alluvial and sandy. The majority of the Pomerol plateau is made up of sandy clay marl that is layered with gravel that dates back to the G√ºnzian period (and is the same gravel found in the M√©doc and Graves AOC), with the gravel on the lower slopes closer to Libourne coming from younger Mindel glaciation period. The vines on the lighter, sandier soils tend to ripen earlier than those on soils with higher clay content but also tend to have less powerful fruit and aging potential. Molasse and Crasse de fer One of the vineyards owned by Ch√¢teau P√©trus Within the region of Pomerol lies what is described as a bouttoni√®re (or \\"buttonhole\\") of unique blue-clay (known as molasse) sitting on top of band of sand rich in iron deposits that is known as crasse de fer or machefer. This is a small region of only about 20 hectares (50 acres) that is very atypical of the soils found in rest of Pomerol, but because the vineyard of the noted estate of Ch√¢teau P√©trus is planted on more than half of these hectares, its influence on the wine has been much discussed in the literature. Other vineyards which have at least some planting on this bouttoni√®re include Ch√¢teau La Conseillante, Ch√¢teau L'√âvangile, Ch√¢teau Lafleur, Ch√¢teau Gazin, Ch√¢teau Trotanoy, Ch√¢teau Clinet, Ch√¢teau le Gay, Ch√¢teau Haut Ferrand and Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan. According to Catherine Moueix the \\"clinkers\\" of iron tinted sand adds aroma notes of violets and truffles while Alexandre Thienpont of Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan says its benefits are more viticultural, in limiting the vigor and excessive leaf growth of the vine. However, despite its association with Ch√¢teau P√©trus, not every wine grower in Pomerol extols the virtues of having crasse de fer on their property. Denis Durantou of Ch√¢teau L'√âglise-Clinet believes that iron-rich soils is too impermeable to allow the vines' roots to descend deeply in the soil, which is a feature often associated with high quality terroir. He has been working to break up the ferruginous bands on his property and at other estates at which he consults. Durantou also believes that many of the benefits attributed to the blue-clay bouttoni√®re exist apart from the crasse de fer, namely the clay's ability to retain moisture in dry years and produce wines of body and power, and notes that there is a second bouttoni√®re of this blue-clay without the iron deposit located northwest of P√©trus. Among the vineyards with at least some planting on this second bouttoni√®re are Ch√¢teau L'√âglise-Clinet, Ch√¢teau Trotanoy, Ch√¢teau Clos l'√âglise, Ch√¢teau La Cabanne and Ch√¢teau Nenin. Winemaking Concrete fermentors used at Ch√¢teau l'Evangile For most of the 20th century, the winemaking styles of Pomerol were influenced by University of Bordeaux oenologist √âmile Peynaud and his work on the Cabernet Sauvignon grape in the M√©doc. While Peynaud's techniques were largely successful in the M√©doc, they did not always translate well to Pomerol. Not only was this region working with a different grape, but also with different soil conditions that were cooler (despite the overall warmer climate). In this climate Cabernet Sauvignon didn't ripen well but Merlot grapes being harvested at the same sugar levels as Cabernet Sauvignon on the Left Bank would produce under-ripe flavors and \\"hard wine\\". It wasn't until the 1980s when more Pomerol producers began developing \\"Right Bank\\" techniques, including extended hanging time to ripen the Merlot grapes more fully, that the style associated with Pomerol wines today evolved. As with most wine regions, the style of winemaking varies by winemaker and by vintage. In general, many Pomerol winemakers practice 15 to 21 days maceration and press when the wine has reached full dryness. The wine almost always goes through malolactic fermentation. The wine will receive 18 to 20 months of aging in barriques prior to bottling and release. Tradition in Pomerol has been to separate the free-run wine and blend back in a proportion of the vin de presse as needed depending on the vintage. The rest of the press wine would often be used in the estate's second wine or sold to n√©gociants. The timing of the blending (such as during or after fermentation) will vary by estate with some houses such as Ch√¢teau P√©trus adding the vin de presse during fermentation in order to allow the wine components to mature together and, theoretically, reduce the harshness of the typically more tannic and phenolic press wine. As with many Bordeaux estates, the basket press has come back into vogue but with modern elements such as pneumatic controls. Jean-Claude Berrouet, one of the head winemakers for the Moueix estates helped designed a vertical basket press aimed at more gently handling the pomace and this has been adopted by several estates.  Influence of Michel Rolland and contrasting philosophy  An example of a basket press used at Ch√¢teau Gazin World-renowned flying winemaker Michel Rolland was born in the Pomerol region and has a family estate, Ch√¢teau Le Bon Pasteur, that he co-owns with his wife Dany. As Rolland rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, aided by a style that favored the palate of wine critic Robert Parker, many Pomerol wine estates began adopting the \\"Rolland style\\" either by imitation or by hiring Rolland as a consultant winemaker. This style includes delaying harvest as much as possible to give the grapes a long, extended hang time to produce full \\"physiological ripeness\\" which can give the fruit an \\"over-ripe\\" flavor and the wine alcohol levels over 14%. In the chai the must often goes through an extended period of maceration (3 to 8 weeks) followed aging in new oak barrels. In contrast, the \\"Moueix style\\" places a premium on vibrancy and freshness in the fruit flavor with Moueix owned estates like Trotanoy and P√©trus often among the first estates to pick. Wine Pomerol now produces exclusively red wine, although 100 years ago it produced a great volume of white. Merlot is the most important grape here, accounting for 80% of the vineyard area. Although it is almost invariably blended, the proportion of Merlot can reach as high as 95%, though it is more usually in the range 70‚Äì80%. The next most important grape is Cabernet Franc, locally known as le Bouchet, accounting for around 15% of the vineyard area and usually accounting for 5‚Äì20% of the blend. Malbec, known locally as Pressac, and not much planted in the rest of Bordeaux, is also used. The remaining permitted grapes, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, are barely planted and rarely used in the grand vin though, like Malbec, they may appear in an estate's second wine. Merlot is the most widely planted grape in Pomerol. In the early 20th century, as Pomerol's transition to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed a large portion of the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers. In general, Merlot tends to be planted on predominantly clay soils while Cabernet Franc is more likely to be on limestone outcroppings and Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec planted in the more gravelly soils. Among the few estates with plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon are Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan, Ch√¢teau Beauregard, Ch√¢teau Certan de May, Ch√¢teau Gazin, Ch√¢teau Nenin and Ch√¢teau Petit-Village. Ch√¢teau La Conseillante is among the estates with plantings of Malbec. AOC regulations Cabernet Franc is often added to enhance the aromatics of the wine and to balance the fruit of Merlot with structure and acidity. Pomerol is exclusively a red wine with the only permitted grape varieties for AOC wine being Merlot, Cabernet Franc (Bouchet), Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec (Pressac). Harvest yields are restricted to a maximum of 42 hectoliters/hectare (‚âà 2.2 tons/acre) with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5%. Wine from Pomerol may be labelled as Bordeaux or Bordeaux Sup√©rier (declassified): this would typically happen if the producer felt that the wine was not of a sufficiently high standard to merit the Pomerol label. Styles and aging Cabernet Sauvignon is not widely grown in the cold soils of Pomerol but more producers are planting the variety. The style of the wine varies with the terroir. In the west, where the soil is more sandy, the wines are lighter; in the south, where the soil is more gravelly, the proportion of Merlot is lower, and the wines tend more towards the flavors of the M√©doc. The wine has been described as 'velvety' or 'unctuous'. The characteristic fruit flavor is plum, sometimes tending towards prune. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Pomerols can have, in addition to the characteristic plum notes, honeyed spice, truffles, peppermint, chocolate, roasted nuts and raisin notes with a creamy, sometimes buttery mouthfeel and supple tannins. Master of Wine Clive Coates describes Pomerols as a \\"halfway house\\" between the soft, plump, flesh fruit of a Saint-√âmilion and the austerity and backbone associated with the wines of the M√©doc. Coates notes that Pomerols tend to have less \\"fruitcakey\\" flavors than Saint-√âmilion with more rich, velvety and plum notes compared to the dominant \\"blackcurrant\\" notes in most M√©docs. This concentrated rich fruit stems from the nature of Merlot which also allows the wines of Pomerol to be less overtly tannic than the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines of the M√©doc. According to wine expert and Master of Wine Hugh Johnson, Pomerol requires less aging than most Bordeaux: five years is usually sufficient, and 12 years is enough even for the grandest vintages. Johnson notes that Pomerols are usually distinguished by their deep color and sometimes creamy, concentrated ripe-plum flavors but without the high acidity and tannins that are typical of other Bordeaux wines.  Ch√¢teaux  Exterior of Ch√¢teau Le Pin There is no official classification for the ch√¢teaux of Pomerol. While the reason for this is often touted as the relatively recent prominence of Pomerol on the world market, even now with the wines of Pomerol generating worldwide acclaim and recognition, many of the producers still feel that an official ranking of Pomerol estates is not needed. Some producers, such as Nicolas de Bailliencourt of Ch√¢teau Gazin, believe most of the opposition is from small growers who fear being left off any ranking making their wines perceived to be inferior. Another proprietor told wine writer Stephen Brooks that the current, unranked system \\"allows the mediocre wines to profit from the reputation of Pomerol's best wines,\\" and pointed to the results of the 2002 AOC label tasting panel, determining whether wines are allowed to bear the name AOC Pomerol on their wine label. Despite 2002 being a very difficult and sub-par vintage not a single wine failed to gain AOC approval. However, despite the lack of an official ranking, many wine writers and critics have over the years came up with their own personal classifications that have been cited by other sources. In 2001, Master of Wine Clive Coates included a ranking of Pomerol estates in his book An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France. *First Growth (On a par with First Growths of the Medoc and Premier Grand Cru Class√© (A) estate of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc in Saint-√âmilion) Ch√¢teau P√©trus *Outstanding Growth (On a par with many Second and Third Growths of the Medoc) Ch√¢teau L'√âvangile, Ch√¢teau La Fleur-P√©trus, Ch√¢teau Lafleur, Ch√¢teau Latour √† Pomerol, Ch√¢teau Trotanoy, Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan. and Chateau S√©raphine *Exceptional Growth (On a par with many Second, Third and Fourth Growths of the Medoc) Ch√¢teau Le Pin, Ch√¢teau Certan de May, Ch√¢teau Clinet, Ch√¢teau La Conseillante, Ch√¢teau Clos l'√âglise, Ch√¢teau La Fleur-de-Gay and Ch√¢teau Gazin. *Very Fine Growth (On a par with many Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Growths of the Medoc) Ch√¢teau Beauregard, Ch√¢teau Bon-Pasteur, Ch√¢teau Hosanna, Clos du Clocher, Ch√¢teau la Croix-de-Gay, Ch√¢teau l'Enclos, Ch√¢teau le Gay, Ch√¢teau La Grave-√†-Pomerol, Ch√¢teau Lagrange, Ch√¢teau Nenin, Ch√¢teau La Pointe and Ch√¢teau Clos-Ren√©. Ch√¢teau Gazin Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan's 2001 rankings divided Pomerol into three categories and included a few ch√¢teaux which were not included in Coates' rankings, while omitting some estates that were making less than a 1000 cases a year due to their scarcity. *Class One (On a par with the First Growths of the M√©doc) Ch√¢teau P√©trus and Ch√¢teau Lafleur *Class Two (On a par with the Second and Third Growths of the M√©doc) Ch√¢teau Trotanoy, Ch√¢teau L'√âvangile, Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan, Ch√¢teau L'√âglise-Clinet, Ch√¢teau Clinet, Ch√¢teau La Fleur-P√©trus, Ch√¢teau Clos l'√âglise, Ch√¢teau La Conseillante, Ch√¢teau Certan de May, Ch√¢teau Latour √† Pomerol, Ch√¢teau Nenin and Ch√¢teau La Fleur-de-Gay. *Class Three (On a par with the Fourth and Fifth Growths of the M√©doc) Ch√¢teau Petit-Village, Ch√¢teau Feytit-Clinet, Ch√¢teau Rouget, Ch√¢teau Bon-Pasteur, Ch√¢teau La Croix du Casse, Ch√¢teau Gazin, Ch√¢teau La Grave-√†-Pomerol, Ch√¢teau le Gay, Ch√¢teau Hosanna and Ch√¢teau la Croix-de- Gay. Food matching Ch√¢teau P√©trus Beef fillet or well hung venison is a good partner, particularly cooked in wine. Beef Wellington is to be avoided, as the pastry dulls the palate. Highly flavored game dishes, such as terrine and p√¢t√© can also be good, as they match up to the intensity of the wine. Tourism Pomerol is well noted for the unassuming rural flavor that is a sharp contrast to the grand ch√¢teaux and ornate architecture that distinguishes many wine estates of the M√©doc. Many of even the most distinguished estates are housed in what are often described as \\"simple farm houses\\" with very little exterior identification. As with much of Bordeaux, very few of the estates have tasting rooms and even fewer are open to the public without appointment. This is partly because the bulk of Pomerol wine is sold en primeur, allocated to exclusive distributors and clients shortly after harvest, leaving little to no wine to be sold through the tasting room door.

One third of the council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats lost overall control of the council to no overall control. Overall turnout was 28.61%. The election saw 38 candidates from 4 parties competing for the 13 seats which were being contested. 7 sitting councillors stood down at the election which saw the Liberal Democrats attempting to defend the majority they had won in the previous election in 2002. The Liberal Democrats campaigned on the record of their \\"Clean and Safe Worthing\\" campaign and on plans to upgrade the leisure centre and replace the Aquarena. However the Conservatives attacked them for stopping improvements to the seafront and for the poor state of facilities in Worthing. The Green and Labour parties also stood candidates but did not contest all of the wards with Labour only putting up 3 candidates. The results saw the Conservatives make one gain from the Liberal Democrats in Selden ward, with the winner, Jack Saheid, becoming the first Muslim councillor on Worthing council. After the Liberal Democrats failed by 6 votes to gain Gaisford from the Conservatives, both parties ended the election on 18 seats making Worthing a hung council. The results meant that the Liberal Democrat mayor of Worthing had the casting vote on the council.

Established in 2004, it has thus been described as \\"part industry conference, part awards show\\". Many of the awards are based on Billboards Boxscore chart tracking concert, comedy and other live entertainment attendance and gate receipts, and on real box office performance. As a result, the awards often equate to commercial success. The \\"top tour\\" superlative award is also given on the basis of fan polls. The \\"Legend of Live\\" and Humanitarian awards are given to individuals for their ongoing contributions to the live entertainment touring industry. History The conference and awards are held in November of each year, traditionally at the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in New York City but, since 2016, at hotels in the Los Angeles area. The conference usually takes place over two days and is attended by figures from the music and concert industry. Each year features a keynote speaker from the performance industry, who in the past have included the likes of Gene Simmons of Kiss and 3 Doors Down. While recorded music has an established awards structure headed by the Grammy Awards and also featuring the American Music Awards and the MTV Video Music Awards, live performance music has not had the same. The Billboard Touring Awards are an attempt to fill that gap. Billboard previously attempted to enter the awards arena for recorded music with the charts-based Billboard Music Award, which lasted from 1990 through 2006, returning in 2011. Those awards featured two slots for Concert Venue Award and Touring Venue Award, but were not otherwise live-performance-based. Award names and awards given themselves have varied somewhat each year, with for example the Top Comedy Tour and Concert Marketing and Promotion Awards being added in 2007 and the Fans Choice being added in 2008, both being determined by fan vote. There are typically three nominees in each category. Repeat winners in the awards have been common, with country artist Kenny Chesney winning Top Package Tour six consecutive years through 2009 and Bonnaroo Music Festival winning four times as well starting in 2004.

Established in 1986, it is the only municipal zoo in the Palestinian territories. The zoo houses 170 animals, a natural history museum, a children's entertainment park, and an on-site restaurant. History Hippo at Qalqilya Zoo, 2006 The zoo was the brainchild of the former mayor of Qalqilya. Israeli zoos helped to stock it and it was designed as a symbol of Arab-Israeli cooperation. When it opened in 1986, the zoo was considered a \\"jewel in the crown of Palestinian national institutions.\\" It became a popular attraction and was later expanded to accommodate the increasing flow of visitors, which included both Arabs and Israelis. After the outbreak of the Intifada, visitors from outside Qalqilya were barred entry. In 2003, the Israeli authorities allowed group visits arranged in advance. A child playing outside the main entrance of the zoo on a public holiday was killed by indiscriminate fire which led to a brief drop in visitors. The zoo's survival has been attributed to the hard work and dedication of its resident veterinarian, Dr Sami Khadr and his staff. During the intifada, a giraffe from South Africa, frightened by the sound of gunfire, was killed when it ran into a pole. Ruti, his pregnant partner, miscarried ten days later. In 2002, three zebras died after inhaling tear gas used to break up a demonstration at a high school adjacent to the zoo. Khadr used his knowledge of taxidermy, to preserve some of the animals, including the giraffe, the unborn calf, the zebras, a monkey, wildcats and snakes. Since its inception, an Israeli veterinarian, Motke Levison, has helped out at the zoo, providing phone consultations and meeting with Khader to deliver emergency medical supplies. Levison has served as a mediator, helping the zoo acquire new animals. Three lions, three ibex desert goats and two zebras were donated by the Ramat Gan Safari park in September 2004. The lions were meant to be transferred to Qalqilya in 2000, but the outbreak of the Second Intifada delayed the delivery. Saeed Daoud, director of the Qalqilya Zoo, dubbed the three lions, who were named Jafer, Jaras and Naboko, \\"the kings of peace.\\" According to Khadr, the Ramat Gan zoo also sent him monkeys, an ostrich, and raccoons. Zoo grounds Crocodiles, 2006 The zoo houses lions, brown bears, crocodiles, ostriches, camels, deers, gazelles, zebras, birds, lizards, snakes, and monkeys of various types. There is also a hippopotamus named Dubi, who shares his small concrete wading pool with a family of peacocks. In December 2003, the zoo was described in The Guardian as \\"one of the West Bank's more pleasant surprises [...] there is a small but beautiful landscaped park. There is a large swimming pool packed with children. And amid the trees, in spacious, clean enclosures, a lioness, an ostrich, a family of bears, a pool full of crocodiles.\\" The animals have ample room to move around with some enclosures as big as those in the London Zoo. The zoo can be reached by taking a service taxi from the city center. The zoo also has a small children's entertainment park with a large swimming pool. Schoolchildren are frequent visitors to the zoo's \\"colorful, highly eccentric Natural History Museum.\\" See also *Gaza Zoo References Category:Zoos in the State of Palestine Zoo Category:1986 establishments in the Palestinian territories Category:Zoos established in 1986 ","title":"Qalqilya Zoo"},{"id":"24651958","text":"Czes≈Çaw Jacek Centkiewicz (October 18, 1904 ‚Äì July 10, 1996) was a Polish engineer, explorer, writer and journalist.

Biography Czes≈Çaw Jacek Centkiewicz was born on October 18, 1904 in Warsaw to Stanis≈Çaw and Stanis≈Çawa n√©e Bresteczer. In 1924 he graduated from Saint Kazimierz Gymnasium and then the University of Li√®ge in Belgium. An engineer by trade, until World War II he worked at the State Meteorological Institute in Warsaw. With that institution he organised and led the first Polish expedition to the Bear Island in 1932. Soon afterwards he also published his first books: an account of saving the SS Chelyuskin's crew (1934) and a reportage on Anaruk, a young Eskimo boy (1937). During World War II he remained in Warsaw and after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 he was arrested by the Germans and deported to the Neuengamme concentration camp. After the war he became a director of a large power plant cluster in Lower Silesia (in Jelenia G√≥ra) and at the State Hydrological-Meteorological Institute. In 1950 he returned to Warsaw where he continued to promote the exploration of polar areas and published numerous books on that topic.

Artist unknown. The Westminster Pit was a well-known blood sport arena in nineteenth-century London, England. It reached a zenith of popularity between 1820 and 1830, and hosted such spectacles as dog-fighting, cock- fighting, bear-baiting, badger-baiting, monkey-baiting, and rat-baiting. A legal enterprise at the time, the Westminster Pit openly declared its activities, ushering notoriety on the district in which it existed. The Westminster Pit was located on Duck Lane, Orchard Street (since renamed St. Matthew's Street), and its dimensions were approximately by . The gallery was above the arena and was capable of containing 200 people ‚Äì or, by report of William Pitt Lennox, \\"perhaps a greater number of less refractory persons, for the common run of spectators were so obstreperous and so agitated by various emotions, according to the amount of bets depending, and the various turns of the conflict, that a decent orderly person would feel himself much incommoded by a considerably less number.\\" Prior to the beginning of matches, the stakes would be formalised and the dogs weighed. It was common in the Westminster Pit (and other venues like it) for cheating to occur, often by way of covering a dog with substances ‚Äì such as acid or pepper ‚Äì that would deter his opponent from biting him. For this reason, it was compulsory that all combatants be washed in water or milk, and a participant was permitted to lick his opponent's dog as a precaution. Perhaps the most famous dog to perform in the Westminster Pit was a bull and terrier named \\"Billy\\", whose fame was his rat- baiting ability. The October 1822 edition of The Sporting Magazine describes his feat of killing 100 rats in six minutes and twenty-five seconds: almost six minutes faster than what was wagered. Billy's best time ever is recorded as five minutes, or slightly over \\"by a very few seconds\\". The name of Billy's owner is not consistently documented: some sources refer to a Charles Dew, some to Charley Westropp, and others to Charley Aistrop. Pierce Egan gives Billy's date of death as 23 February 1829. Later commentators have questioned the legitimacy of Billy's success; in particular, James Rodwell, in his 1858 The rat: its history & destructive character: With numerous anecdotes, stated: \\"let it be borne in mind, and I assert it on the testimony of living witnesses, that numbers of the rats were dead before the dog commenced, and that the whole had been poisoned with nux-vomica before being put into the pit . . . and when he did commence, several were thrown out as dead that were able to crawl away\\". In 1830, an indictment was lodged against the Westminster Pit by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Society charged the proprietor, John King, with a nuisance, while noting that it was \\"indebted to corporal Denny, of No. 17, Queen Square, Westminster, and to James Yewen, of No. 6, Horseferry Road, Westminster . . . for obtaining a sufficient number of witnesses, residing on the spot, to prove the case as a nuisance.\\" King was convicted, and, according to The Cottager's monthly visitor, \\"the prosecution completely suppressed that notorious sink of cruelty and vice\\".

The building faces south to the Bretherton road, from which it stands back some distance, and has a foreyard inclosed on the west side by farm buildings. The Stone family Carr House is the ancestral home of the Stone Family. The house was built in 1613 by Thomas Stone, a haberdasher from London, and his brother Andrew, a merchant from Amsterdam. The local church of St. Michael was built in 1628 and was a gift to the people of the local villages of Croston, Much Hoole and Bretherton by Thomas and Andrew, who also built a manor house for the rector of St Michael's. John gave the church its font and his wife donated the silver goblets and plate that are still used in the church today for communion. Andrew shipped goods to England via Hoole and Richard Stone imported Irish panel boards and timber in 1604 for the Shuttleworth family, who were then building Gawthorpe Hall, with 1,000 pieces, storing them till needed in Hoole's tithe barn.Jessica Lofthouse; Lancashire Villages; Robert Hale, London, 1978, P. 48 Architecture The house was built in 1613 and has two wings to each side of a central porch. The building is built of red bricks which have weathered over the centuries to give a pleasant warm colour, with a blue-brick diaper pattern similar to work of the same period at Bank Hall, Hoole Church and Rufford Old Hall, with stone quoins of irregular length. Externally the building has not been altered very much since construction as all the old stone mullioned windows remain as they are, therefore the brick work is unaltered. Blue slates cover the roof instead of the usual stone slabs which can be found on most of the old brick houses in Lancashire from this time period. The porch is the main feature of the front, being centrally situated, and rising to the third-story attic space. There are ten windows on the front facade, four on the ground floor, five on the first, and one in the attic, with hood moulds; all have four panes of leaded glass, except those over the porch, which have five. Between the upper and lower windows are four vertical cuts in the brickwork which are now filled in with plaster/cement; the history behind them is said to have been a partial evasion of the window tax, the argument being that the upper and lower windows are connected, therefore counting as one. An inscription in raised letters on the stone head of the doorway reads: Thomas Stones of London haberdasher and Andrewe Stones of Amsterdam merchant hath builded this howse of their owne charges and giveth the same unto their brother John Stones: Ano domni 1613. Laus. The inscription is curiously divided towards the end by the head of the doorway breaking into it. The walls of the upper rooms are stated to have been formerly panelled in oak, but the panelling is said to have been removed to Bank Hall in 1832 when that building was renovated. An important feature of the house is a rare cage newel staircase; four inner newel posts rise to the full height of the stairwell without interruption.Chorley Historical and Archaeological Society, \\"CHORLEY HALLS - Carr House\\", http://www.chorleyhistorysociety.co.uk/sys2004.htm 2010 Jeremiah Horrocks It is commonly said that Jeremiah Horrocks made his observation of the transit of Venus, 24 Nov. 1639, from the room above the porch while living at Carr House as the guest and lodger of Mr. Stone.Jessica Lofthouse; Lancashire Villages; Robert Hale, London, 1978, p. 49 It is also believed that Jeremiah Horrocks was the tutor to the Stone family's children. Dolls Museum Carr House was once home to a Dolls Museum that housed the Barry Elder Collection.

Along with Ernest Koliqi he is considered as the founder of modern Albanian prose; in Albanian literature his pen name for which he gained fame was Mitrush Kuteli.  Biography  Mitrush Kuteli was born Dhimit√´r Pasko in the town of Pogradec at the shores of Lake of Ohrid, son of Pandeli and Polikseni. He studied at a Romanian commercial college in Thessaloniki, later moving to Bucharest where, in 1931, he graduated in economics with a dissertation on the banking system in the Balkans. And in 1934 he earned a doctorate on the field, evaluaded with \\"Diplomam Magnam cum Laud√¶\\". While in Bucharest he became a journalist and directed the Albanian-language weekly newspaper Shqip√´ri' e re (New Albania), published in Constan»õa, from 1928 until 1933. In 1937 he organized the publishing Lasgush Poradeci's collection of verse, Ylli i zemr√´s (The Star of the heart). From 1934 he was a high official of the Romanian Ministry of Economy and later on he was the director of the CernƒÉu»õi bank. He returned to Albania in 1942, and during World War II wrote and self-published most of his major works. At the end of the war he founded the short-lived literary periodical, Revista letrare (Literary Review), with Nexhat Hakiu, Vedat Kokona and Sterjo Spasse, joined the editorial board of Bota e re (New World), the first Albanian post-war literary journal, and became a founding member of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists. Imprisonment and release The Albanian Communist Party took power after World War II, but by 1947 was in the control of Yugoslavia. Pasko, an official Albanian delegate to Yugoslavia, disapproved of a proposed currency and customs union agreed between the two countries, and of a Serbian re-occupation of Kosovo; an earlier 1944 Pasko poem, \\"Poem kosovar\\" (Kosovar poem), asserted his criticism of Serbian actions. Upon the Albanian delegation's return from Yugoslavia, Pasko was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for his criticism, during which he attempted suicide. Following the freeing of Yugoslavia's hold over Albanian party politics, Pasko was released. After his release from prison, he was informed by the authorities that his family would be banished to Kavaj√´. His personal documents were branded with the stamp \\"Enemy of the people\\", but his family were saved after the intervention of Fadil Pa√ßrami. Kuteli was given new documents and a job. Pasko died of a heart attack in 1967. Statue dedicated to Mitrush Kuteli in his hometown Pogradec  Literary works   Economy  He was the representative of the democratic and bourgeois alternative for the economic development during the reign of King Zog I.  Literature  He published his first authored book, Net√´ shqip√´tare (Albanian nights) in 1938, a compilation of eight tales of village life from his native Pogradec. This edition was largely destroyed by a fire, and only became widely read through a second edition published in 1944. He worked as a translator for Naim Frash√´ri Publishing House, the state-owned Tirana publishing company. Pasko, as with other Albanian writers of the time, accommodated the imposed cultural doctrine of Zhdanovism by translating Soviet-approved Russian authors, although he found himself able to translate his favorite Russian, Romanian, and Spanish writers, publish tales and verse for children, and adapt Albanian oral verse to prose.  Criticism  It is asserted that he followed Poradeci's tread, although his poetry is even more Rumanian in character.

Forty-five Ukrainian intellectuals, theologians, writers, and a librarian were accused of anti-state activities (or counter-revolutionary activities for some). Fifteen of the defendants worked in the organization of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Science. About thirty of them were members of former Ukrainian political parties. One was a former prime-minister while two others were ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Finally, six were members of the Central Rada.

According to the Museum of Soviet Occupation, this proceeding became a sort of political slogan to persecute Ukraine's older and foremost academical intelligentsia, as well as representatives of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC).Article about the process in the Museum of the Soviet Occupation According to one of the defendants, the Senior attorney of the secret department of Kyiv okrug department of GPU Solomon Bruk was repeating during the interrogations: \\"We must put the Ukrainian intelligentsia on its knees, it is our duty and it will be executed; those whom we would not be able [to subdue], we're going to shoot!\\" Soon after that, 700 other people were arrested in connection with the process. The total number is not known, but up to 30 thousand people are estimated to have been arrested, exiled, and/or executed during and after the trial. Accusations According to Soviet sources, the SVU was an underground organization which supposedly existed in Ukraine from June 1926 to July 1929, when it was exposed by the State Political Directorate. The SVU allegedly existed in the Ukrainian diaspora (it should not be confused with the Union of Liberation of Ukraine, which operated during World War II abroad). According to the indictment, the SVU put the task of liberation of the Ukrainian people in all ethnographic Ukrainian territory and the establishment of an independent Ukrainian Republic, which had to be parliamentary and democratic, with a broad right of citizens to private property. The indictment alleges that the SVU was preparing popular uprisings, in close agreement with leaders of Ukrainian diaspora. In addition, the Union of Ukrainian Youth (SUM) was to organize terrorist acts against the Soviet Union, and Soviet Ukrainian leaders. List of the accused Among others in the dock were: * Serhiy Yefremov, an academician of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, former deputy chairman of the Central Rada, and a member UPSF. * Volodymyr Chekhivsky, former member of the Central Committee of USDRP, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, theologian, founder and administrator of the UAOC. * V. Durdukivsky, a teacher, former member of UPSF. * Yosyp Germaize, a historian, professor of Kyiv Institute of People's Education, former member USDRP. * Andriy Nikovsky, a literary critic and writer, former member UPSF, and Foreign Minister UPR. * Liudmyla Starytska-Chernyakhivska, a writer (former member UPSF) and a wife of the renowned scientist histology and the professor of the Kyiv Medical Institute, Oleksandr Chernyakhivsky. * Mykhailo Slabchenko, academician, historian, professor of the Odessa Institute of People's Education, former member USDRP. * A. Hrebenetsky, teacher. * Vsevolod Hantsov, philologist, the former member UPSF. * H. Holoskevych, linguist, the associate of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. * Mykola Pavlushkov, student of the Kyiv Institute of People's Education, which Soviet authorities considered the founder of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM). The Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Court who heard the case was Anton Prykhodko, the chief prosecutor M. Mykhailyk (Attorney-General of the Republic and Deputy Narkom). Among the public prosecutors were Panas Lyubchenko, academician A. Sokolovsky, writer O. Slisarenko. On the side of the defendants were Ratner, Vilensky, Puhtynsky. Among the defendants were three females: Liudmyla Starytska-Chernyakhivska, Liudmyla Bidnova, A. Tokarivska; two doctors - members UNAS, 15 professors of higher schools, two students, a director of a middle school, 10 teachers, a theologian and a priest of UAOC, three writers, five editors, two cooperators, two lawyers and a librarian; 15 defendants were employees of UNAS. Many defendants were united through political activities during the struggle for freedom (1917‚Äì1920): 31 of them were once members of the Ukrainian political parties (15 - UPSF, 12 - USDRP, 4 - UPSR), one was a prime minister, two - Ministers of the Ukrainian government, six - members of the Ukrainian Central Rada. According to the indictment act, 33 of the accused belonged to the Kyiv group of SVU, three represented Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, two - Poltava and Mykolaiv, and a single representation was from Chernihiv and Vinnytsia. Among the defendants were two Ukrainians of Jewish ethnicity: a historian Yosyp Germaize and a lawyer Morhulis. Process and verdict The process had numerous inconsistencies. Leaders of the Ukrainian emigration strongly denied prosecutors' allegations that the emigration gave instructions to SVU. In particular, L. Chykalenko denied that he ever sent a letter of instruction to Yefremov. The existence of such a letter was also denied by J. Hermayze. N. Pavlushkova (sister of the defendant) argues that \\"SVU as an organization was the centre for a very narrow circle of people, not more than 12 - 15, without a strong organized periphery\\" and it recognized that the confessions at the trial of the defendants was forced. Despite the Soviet SVU publicity process, the sentence was considered too moderate. According to K. Turkalo, one of the defendants, the prosecutor threatened 13 of the defendants with the Highest Degree of Penalty (death penalty), but did not demand it. 45 defendants were sentenced to 10 years ofimprisonment in strict isolation, 6 to 8 years, 3 to 6 years, 10 to 5 years, 21 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years, 10 received a suspended sentence and were immediately released. 5 more were pardoned in a few months. Some prisoners had been sent to the Solovetsky Islands. In the 1930s and during the first months of World War II, many participants of the SVU were again arrested and disappeared. Most of the accused died in prison or in exile, only a few emigrated (K. Turkalo), and some were rehabilitated after World War II (V. Hantsov, V. Atamanovskyy). In modern Ukrainian opinion, the dominant thought is that SVU and SUM did not exist as organizations, and were provocations of the GPU (V. Holubnychyy, V. Hryshko, M. Kowalewsky, G. Kostyuk, Yu. Lavrinenko, R. Sallivant, K. Turkalo, P. Fedak), however some sources recognize the existence of SVU (N. Pavlushkova, W. Ivy). The hypothesis that SVU - SUM was a fictitious organization of the GPU is supported by the existence of other show trials (Shakhty process in 1928 or the so-called Prompartia (Industrial Party) in December 1930), which were purely political. It is more probable that the defendants in the SVU process were Ukrainian patriots, who actively worked for the Ukrainian national cultural renaissance in the 1920s, but they did so spontaneously, without creating any anti-Soviet political organization, with no directive from the Ukrainian emigration.

She was the first Atlantic record breaker constructed of iron and was the largest ship in the world at the time of her launch. However, the inefficiencies of paddle wheel propulsion rendered Persia obsolete and she was taken out of service in 1868 after only twelve years. Attempts to convert Persia to sail were unsuccessful and the former pride of the British merchant marine was scrapped in 1872. Development and design Side lever engine of Persia As a result of competition from the Collins Line, Cunard ordered the Arabia in 1852 to retake the Atlantic records. Arabia crammed more powerful engines into a smaller ship than the Collins speedsters, and touched 15 knots on trials. However, she proved too powerful for her wooden construction and was unable to win the records. Cunard realized that in the future, new construction must include an iron hull. For Persia, Robert Napier and Sons of Glasgow designed an iron ship that was 16% larger than the wooden Collins liners and 50% larger than Cunard's Arabia. Her two-cylinder side-lever engine produced and consumed of coal per day. Persia's launch in July 1855 was a national event and she touched on her trials, although her normal service speed was limited to because of her high fuel consumption. She carried 250 first class and 50 second class passengers. Service history On her maiden voyage in 1856, Persia struck an iceberg, but was saved by her clipper bow and the stoutness of her construction. In April, she took the Atlantic speed records in both directions with an eastbound voyage of 9 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes () and a westbound voyage of 9 days, 16 hours, 16 minutes (). She held both records until 1863 when Cunard commissioned the Scotia, the last paddle wheel Atlantic record holder. Scotia was originally intended to be Persia's sister, but was delayed when the Collins Line collapsed. When Scotia was finally built, she was a larger edition of Persia with an extra deck and power. In 1861, during the Trent incident, Persia and several other liners were chartered to rush troops to Canada. She was the only ship to reach Quebec before ice closed the St. Lawrence River. The next year, Cunard commissioned the SS China, its first mail liner with screw propulsion. She proved substantially more profitable than Cunard's mail paddle steamers and the firm quickly ordered two additional screw mail ships to retire the last wooden paddle steamers on the New York express route. Persia remained paired with Scotia on the New York route until 1867 when Cunard commissioned the Russia, the first screw Cunarder that could match Scotia's speed. Because of her fuel consumption, Persia was not a good fit for the other Cunard services and was laid up in 1868. Her engines were removed and she was sold to MacArthur and Wilson of Glasgow for conversion to sail. However, the conversion didn't take place and Persia was sold for scrap in 1872. center References External links  Persia on Chris' Cunard Page Category:1856 ships Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:Passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Victorian-era passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships of the Cunard Line Category:Ship collisions with icebergs Category:Maritime incidents in 1856 ","title":"RMS Persia"},{"id":"24652072","text":"Julio C√©sar Rangel Melo (born February 11, 1968 in Bogot√°) is a retired male road cyclist from Colombia.

It is a protected monument under the Goa, Daman and Diu ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains act. Corjuem Fort is from Panjim. Location The Fort of Corjuem () is situated on an island with the same name in Bardez, to the east of the village of Aldona, from which it is separated by the Mapu√ß√° River (a tributary of the Mandovi). History This fort built in 1705 is one of the only two inland forts that are surviving that are made of pitted laterite. The original occupiers of this Fort were the Desai's of Sankhali but it was traded into maratha hand later into Sawant-Bhonsle of Sawantwadi. Under the Portuguese Viceroy Caetano de Mello e Castro,:pt:Caetano de Melo e Castro, Retrieved 10 May 2012 the control of the fort came under Portuguese India's administration. The fort was subsequently rebuilt by the Portuguese to boost up defenses along Panajim. In the eighteenth century this fort protected the Portuguese from the Marathas, Bhonsles and the Rane Rajputs, who were camped just beyond the Mandovi River. In the early 1800s, the fort was used as a Military School and had in its defenses a battery of four guns. The fortress defended the town of Corjuem and also had a chapel under parochial church of Aldona. Incidents The fort also has an interesting incident in which an ambitious Portuguese woman named Ursula e Lancastre, who determined to see the man's world, dressed as a man and travelled the world.

At the time Houbraken was writing he was still alive and painting in Amsterdam, where he worked as the \\"Hop inspector\\" for the brewers of Amsterdam.

His paintings from his earlier years such as the children blowing soap bubbles (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) are strongly influenced by Gerrit Dou, with architectural elements framing the scene.

It was cancelled when its experimental Mikulin AM-43V engines reached the end of their service life. Development Impressed by the performance of the de Havilland Mosquito the Soviets asked Tupolev to modify a Tu-2 as a high-speed day bomber with a reduced crew as the ANT-63. The second prototype of this project was ordered to be converted in February 1946 for use as a three-seat long-range interceptor capable of carrying an airborne radar set with the internal designation of ANT-63P and the official designation of Tu-1. It was given prototype Mikulin AM-43V engines driving four-bladed propellers, and fitted with new radio equipment. It reverted to the standard Tu-2S undercarriage. Two Nudelman-Suranov NS-45 guns with 50 rounds each were fitted on the underside of the nose, two Volkov-Yartsev VYa-23 or Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon were fitted in the wing roots with 130 rounds per gun. The dorsal gunner was given a UBT machine gun with 200 rounds and the ventral gunner received a UBT with 350 rounds of ammunition. It retained the internal bomb bay which could carry up to of bombs. The Tu-1 first flew on 22 March 1947 and underwent manufacturer's tests until 3 OctoberGordon, p. 91 or 3 November 1947. Sources disagree about the mounting of radar during these tests. Bill Gunston says that a Soviet derivative of the German FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 was tested, however Yefim Gordon believes that no radar was fitted at all and the short service life of the AM-43V prototype engines curtailed the planned tests and development. At any rate, the aircraft was not selected for production because its AM-43V engines were not ready for production.

Approaches to the hill are possible from the north (Glen Garry) and the south (eastern end of Loch Arkaig) although the southern approach is shorter and more popular. The southern route starts at the car park at the Eas Chia-aig waterfall at grid reference and follows a track north through the trees of Gleann Cia-aig to reach open moorland after four km where the hill comes fully into view. A footbridge is crossed and it is a steep climb to the Bealach an Easain from where the summit is easily reached. The northern approach starts at Greenfield in Glen Garry () and takes a path south west through the forest for three km to reach the Allt Coire nan Saobhaidh stream from where the northern ridge can be gained which leads to the summit cairn which stands on the northern side of the old fence.

Interests sections When two nations break diplomatic relations, their embassies are turned over to neutral countries that act as protecting powers. The protecting power is responsible for all diplomatic communications on behalf of the protected power. When the situation improves, the feuding countries may be willing to accept diplomats from the other country on an unofficial basis. The original embassy is known as an interests section of the protecting power. For example, until 2015 the Cuban Interests Section was staffed by Cubans and located in the old Cuban Embassy in Washington, but it was officially an interests section of the Swiss Embassy to the United States.

The film was produced, directed and written by Michael Carreras based on Dennis Wheatley's novel Uncharted Seas (1938). The film was called \\"the strangest film to come out of the Hammer Studios\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063240/ Many parts of the production quality are laughable: a clearly plastic shark fin; a \\"sea\\" which is as calm as a pond; manhandling of canisters of allegedly deadly contents; a crew who cannot row in time with one another; Spaniards only speaking English; men walking with pairs of huge balloons; and an array of deadly creatures etc etc. The film sees the crew and passengers of the dilapidated tramp steamer Corita heading from Freetown to Caracas. While the passengers all have their own reasons for getting out of Africa, the captain of the ship is also eager to leave, as he is smuggling a dangerous explosive cargo. Whilst en route to South America the ship is holed and eventually what's left of the crew and passengers find themselves marooned in a mist-enshrouded Sargasso Sea surrounded by killer seaweed, murderous crustaceans and previously marooned descendants of Spanish Conquistadores and pirates.  Plot  Captain Lansen (Eric Porter) reads the burial rites from the Book of Common Prayer watched mournfully by a motley crew of seamen, pirates, Spanish ladies, armoured conquistadors and priests (all seemingly from different time periods). As the shrouded cadaver is slid overboard from beneath a flag the captain asks \\"What happened to us? How did we all get here...?\\". ... On board the tramp steamer Corita, Captain Lansen first ignores a hurricane warning then ignores a customs launch wanting to inspect his ship, as he is smuggling the explosive Phosphor B ('Phosphore Blanc', i.e. white phosphorus) (which is explosive on contact with moisture/water). His ship's passengers, a mix of the rich and poor, also have various insalubrious reasons for leaving Freetown: Dr. Webster (Nigel Stock) and his daughter Unity (Suzanna Leigh) for his indiscretions with patients; an alcoholic conman Harry Tyler (Tony Beckley) with a jacket lined in cash; and Eva Peters (Hildegard Knef), a trophy wife who has stolen bearer bonds to pay for the ransom on her son in Caracas, with lawyer, Ricaldi (Ben Carruthers), after her to retrieve said pilfered bonds. An accident nearly sets off the explosives and the authority of the captain comes to a head when an anchor chain slips a gear and ruptures the bulkhead and power is lost. Some of the crew mutiny and take to a lifeboat. Chief Engineer Nick (James Cossins) cannot fix the generator and Capt. Lansen, fearing the ship may explode with Hurricane Wendy about to engulf them in a storm, takes the remaining crew and passengers into a lifeboat. In the ensuing chaos, Dr Webster is soon devoured by an attacking shark. The next morning the lifeboat finds itself adrift in a morass of large sentient carnivorous seaweed, which kills the cook. The lifeboat later bumps into the Corita again and they find the propellers fouled with the pullulate seaweed but are nevertheless forced to take refuge in the doomed vessel once more. During the night, Unity is attacked by a huge glowing-eyed octopus, which kills Ricaldi when he attempts to rescue her. Sarah (Dana Gillespie) appears walking on the morass of weed, using buoyancy balloons attached to her shoulders and odd pads attached to her feet, being chased by a bunch of fur-clad barbarians. She warns the captain of an impending attack. The crew and passengers defend the ship, with the surviving attackers returning to a dilapidated large wooden Spanish galleon marooned nearby. Child leader \\"El Supremo\\" (Darryl Read), the princely descendant of the Spanish Conquistadores, along with members of the Spanish Inquisition had ordered the attack to steal their supplies. Sarah attempts to return to her island but is tracked down by the Spanish conquistadors. Whilst standing guard, on an outcrop of rock, the bartender (Jimmy Hanley) is killed by a giant hermit crab, who's in turn attacked by a giant scorpion. Sarah, the ship's engineer, and Tyler are then captured by the Spanish, taken to the galleon and brought before \\"El Supremo\\", though it's soon obvious to all that the one stood beside clad in ominous 'pointy-hatted' capirote Inquisitor garb is calling all the shots (in the guise of God's will.) Capt. Lansen confronts him, states they'll not give in to his demands nor ever stop attempting to get back home; then uses the explosives to destroy the galleon and rescue his crew/passengers. Though, not before, inspired by Capt. Lansen's speech and attitude, the young kid abandons his throne to join them, only to get stabbed by the traitorous cleric the moment he turns his back to leave. Stripped of his power, the plague riddled priest succumbs to kneeling and prayer, his monks to frantic pipe organ playing, as the hell of flames erupt all around them creeping ever closer to the sounds of liturgical hymns and chaos. Capt. Lansen and his crew, along with those Spaniards who have decided to join him, head back to the Corita and we return to the start of the film ... with the burial at sea now revealed to be the funeral of young child \\"El Supremo\\", who never recovered from his wound/stabbing. His previous sad death in Eva's arms reminding her of her own son's perilous predicament and uncertain fate - if they ever find their way home...?

Arriving in 1841 Edwin first worked with his brothers James, William and Daniel in East Liverpool, Ohio and later Pittsburg, after which he moved to Baltimore independently in 1846 and founded his own pottery with his own designs, the business growing to multiple kilns in little time.Beem and Beem, 2012 He became a citizen of the United States in 1848,Baltimore, Vol. III in which year he was also joined by his brother William and the new partnership named E & W Bennett.Beem and Beem, 2012 They soon added new lines in majolica and coloured stonewares, and in 1853 one of the company's most notable early accomplishments was the first industrial production of porcelain in America, a line of jugs of biscuit porcelain not unlike Parian although with some glazing and colored decoration.Beem and Beem, 2012; Campbell; Schneider, p.19 The Bennetts also produced notable Rockingham-style ware, including the famous \\"Rebekah at the Well\\" teapot, modeled by Charles Coxon in Baltimore following Edwin's inspiration.Holland, p. 6 It became the best and longest selling Rockingham ware pattern in history.Claney, p. 81 Following James' retirement William left to run the Pittsburg operation in 1856 and the Baltimore factory renamed to the Edwin Bennett Pottery.Beem and Beem, 2012 The first pitched battle of the American Civil War happened right in front of his business on April 19, 1861 and Edwin moved with his wife and children to Philadelphia, where in the next year or two he entered into a partnership with his friend the glassmaker William Gillinder, with Bennett contributing some new tableware designs.Beem and Beem, 2012 In 1867, the year he sold his interests to Gillinder and his sons, it was the largest glass factory within the city limits.Beem and Beem, 2012; Museum of American Glass at Wheaton Arts Gillinder's son James also married Bennett's daughter Martha. Having returned to Baltimore although with his factory continuing in production throughout the war and after, in 1869 Edwin introduced a general line of various earthenwares which were produced until 1890.Baltimore, Vol. III Malachite glaze ware was produced in the 1860s and 70s as an alternative to the era's yellows, browns and whites (which Bennett also continued to produce).Brooks Among the later original styles his company became known for are the \\"Albion\\" and \\"Brubensul\\" wares,Baltimore, Vol. III both introduced in 1896 and with some rarer specimens bought by foreign governments for their national museums.Baltimore, Vol. III; Glass and Potter World Vol. XII No.1, p. 18 It was also by the 1890s that the company was now the largest single producer of pottery in the United States.Brooks The Bennett Pottery Co. was much later also responsible for the design of the popular infuser-style \\"McCormick teapot\\".Beem and Beem, 2009 Edwin Bennett was a younger brother of James Bennett, who established the pottery industry in East Liverpool, Ohio. The Bennett brothers were long friendly with Andrew Carnegie and his family, who had lived in Ohio. Edwin once entertained Carnegie's mother Margaret, on her way to visit her son in Virginia during the Civil War, in his home on East Baltimore Street.Baltimore, Vol. III Bennett first married Mary J. Huston, with whom he had eight daughters and one son. His second wife, Sarah Elizabeth Day, with whom he had one son, was a 1st cousin of writer Mary L. Day.

In the late 1960s, Read was a member of Crushed Butler, considered by some to be amongst the forerunners of punk rock. He collaborated with musicians such as Bill Legend, Mickey Finn and Ray Manzarek. Read appeared as a child actor in a number of films, including, aged 14, in Daylight Robbery (1964), for which he won a Silver medal for best actor at the Venice Film Festival. He also appeared on stage in two rock-based plays and a number of television programmes. He was a published author of poetry as well as a biographical novel. Read was killed in a motorcycle incident in Thailand in 2013. Early years and career Read was born in Exeter, where his father Hedley Read was working on a stage production of A Streetcar Named Desire. Read struggled at school (he was later diagnosed dyslexic) and following his parents divorce, he lived with his grandparents. Following his grandmother's death when he was seven years old, Read was sent to Parkside Boarding School, in East Horsley. Read attended an audition at the Corona Academy for Dramatic Arts in Chiswick, west London, and he was accepted. He left boarding school the following term in early 1963. Within two weeks of joining Corona Academy Read worked professionally, with a background role on the 1963 film The V.I.P.s. The following week he featured in a Persil commercial. By the end of his first term, he appeared in the Children's Film Foundation film The Young Detectives, replacing the original actor who had fallen ill. He then played Dick in the 1964 film Five Have a Mystery to Solve, based on an Enid Blyton Famous Five book. He left Corona in 1968 with a small number of film and TV acting credits under his belt including a Venice Film Festival award for his role in the film Daylight Robbery. At 17 Read appeared in Fabulous 208, a teenage magazine. Read had been playing the drums and the guitar at the age of 14, and with Michael Des Barres he formed the rock pop group the Orange Illusion in 1967. Read also appeared in a 1967 episode of Dixon of Dock Green, the 1968 film The Lost Continent and a 1969 episode of Z-Cars. Late 1960s bands In early 1968 Read became interested in the Edgar Broughton Band and Mick Farren of the Deviants. Read's then girlfriend, Nikki Johnson, found him his first manager, Robin Hemingway. Hemingway had worked with T-Bone Walker and introduced Read to soul music. Whilst trying to secure a record contact for Read, Hemingway got Read to record demos at Decca Studios, as well as inviting him to a Beatles session at Abbey Road studios, and introduced him to Jimi Hendrix. Read continued to switch between playing drums and guitar whilst continuing acting work. Read was asked by Emperor Rosko to form a group for his brother Jeff Pasternak. Read recruited Lou Martin and Stuart MacDonald, members of blues outfit Killing Floor, and guitarist Chris Gibbons to form the Krayon Angels. They played in London and recorded a demo album but the group split in early 1969, when Jeff Pasternak and Chris Gibbons created a Simon & Garfunkel-type duo. Read did another album demo for them and gave them the name Smooth Loser, which they later utilised as a rock band. The demo album Read made with Krayon Angels was eventually released in 1998. Read joined an Edmonton-based soul outfit called the Keith Locke Band, playing drums. Read was the only white player amongst Locke, Derrick Johnson and Rosko Gee, who went on to become members of Bob Marley's band and Traffic. At this time Read also rehearsed with a rock trio in Pimlico, London, and after one rehearsal, came across Jesse Hector and Alan Butler, ex-mods who arrived to rehearse without a drummer ‚Äì they jammed and decided to work together,Maximum Rock 'n' Roll, Issue 189 and inside eight weeks got backing and management from an East End market worker called Graham Breslau. Read came up with a band name - Crushed Butler - and they recorded a demo at Regent Sound Studios in Denmark Street called 'It's My Life'. The trio played their first gig at the Country Club, West Hampstead, supporting Osibisa. Crushed Butler dressed in hand-cut slash neck red T-shirts, straight legged Levis with studded belts. Hector had short cropped hair with massive mutton chops, Butler had a crop cut centre parting hairdo and large sideburns, Read had a lion's shag of dark hair and continually sported a black leather vintage motorbike jacket, with a blue/white hooped T-shirt and Cuban heels. Altogether their image looked liked the Clash several years before the Clash formed, and Hector's voice sounded like John Lydon only in 1969.\\"Pretty Vacant\\" by Mark Paytress, Record Collector issue 226, June 1998 Breslau pulled in his friend, Gerald Horgan to help manage the group. They recorded at EMI, Dick James Music DJM studios and De Lane Lea studios. They also recorded at Decca's West Hampstead studios and Marquee Studios, but they failed to get a recording deal even though they were supporting major acts like Mott the Hoople, Atomic Rooster and UFO. Within a year Breslau pulled out of the management deal, and took all their equipment back, and though Gerald Horgan remained friends with Read he couldn't do much to help further the group's career. The group changed their name to 'Tiger' and went through a succession of bass players including ex-Smile bassist Barry Wyles, and were managed by Neil Christian for a while. After recruiting Alan Butler back into the group they worked together again and recorded \\"High School Dropout\\" at Marquee Studios. They finally split in 1971 after being continually turned down and out of work. Hector and Butler later found success with their band the Hammersmith Gorillas, later shortened to the Gorillas in 1977. 1970s to mid-1980s In 1971 Read was struggling financially and heavily using amphetamines and sleeping pills. He started working at Track Records as a songwriter and assistant to John \\"Speedy\\" Keen. Read also worked with Terry Stamp and Jim Avery of pro-Castro activist rockers Third World War as a songwriter. In 1972 Read recorded a demo track, 'Razor City', with Terry Stamp and continued to work on-and-off with Stamp and Avery until 2000. In late 1972, Read joined ex-Silverhead guitarist Steve Forest, playing drums in a glam rock trio called Dizzy. The band split after their manager ran out of money, and stopped backing the band ‚Äì reclaiming equipment he paid for. At the end of the summer of 1972, Read joined singer/lead-guitarist Barry Pyatt at Butlin's in Bognor Regis, in a cabaret combo by the name of \\"Sugar and Spice\\". In 1972 Read joined as drummer the theatrical tour of rock musical Hair. Read got Steve Forrest the job as lead guitarist, and they toured with the show for one year, Read had originally got the part of 'the Recruit' in the show and was to be part of the Tribe, but realised he'd make more money if he played drums and became the bandleader. In 1975, Read began pursuing a front man singer/guitarist career and continued to switch between music and acting and got a song publishing deal with Famous Chapel. In early 1976 Read recorded songs at Polydor with Steve Forrest and Charlie Harty, including a track titled 'On The Streets Tonight'. Again Read's songs and band were turned down again by Nick Mobs of EMI who said: \\"It wasn't funky enough!\\" Five months later Mobbs signed the Sex Pistols. In 1977, Read played Keith Richards in the stage production of Let the Good Stones Roll. There were more television performances including a featured role in Rock Follies, Minder and Read taken on by Tony Meehan to record five of his own penned tracks. In 1980 Read landed a role in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Barrie Keeffe's play Bastard Angel, and in the same year, he recorded his first solo single 'Living on Borrowed Time'/'West End Girl' produced by Ray Hendrikson. Read moved to Spain in 1985 but whilst on a stop-off in Berlin, he started playing some bars, caf√©s and clubs, one being the Ex Und Pop punk club where he was rediscovered by Dimitri Leningrad, who put him on the Berlin underground circuit as 'Darryl Read's Hearts of Darkness'. This led to Read recording a cover version of the Rolling Stones' \\"Play With Fire\\", which became an underground hit and played on German radio for three months. He signed a publishing deal with Peter Radzuhn and Tom Muller at Hansa Tone Studios who flew in Paul Thompson of Roxy Music to work with Read in the studio. The Hearts of Darkness now consisted of Read (lead vocals/guitar), Paul Thomson (drums), Volker Janssen (keyboards) and Graham Sears (bass). They recorded a mini album No Soul Through Midnight in 1986 and released a 16mm promo film titled No Place which featured Connover Farndon and ex-Stray Cats manager Tony Bidgood. Read directed the piece with Steve Ingle and other students from the British Film School. California Read was recruited by Terence Pearce (aka Terence Wilde/Terry Wilde) to replace singer Paul Roberts in the band High Frontier in London, after Roberts left to join The Stranglers. High Frontier had American shows planned when the band broke up, but Pearce decided to go anyway. He and Read flew to Los Angeles in 1987, picked up various musicians in Hollywood, where they began writing and recording the album Book of the Dead under the name The Hearts of Darkness. They were at that time managed by Scott Tarlow (later known as Justin Marquis, singer of the band The Veil). Read was a friend of Ray Manzarek of the Doors. When The Hearts of Darkness were booked to play a show at the historic Variety Arts Centre Theatre, Downtown L.A., Manzarek asked if he could play keyboards at the gig, which he did. Whilst making the album 'Book of the Dead' Ray Manzarek listened and advised with Reed and Pearce in the studio. Read collaborated again with Terry Stamp, who now lived in Los Angeles, on some of the song writing duties. During this time Read and the other Hearts of Darkness members appeared in a low-budget B horror film entitled Midnight for Mortica. By chance he was introduced to Gloria Jones and discussed the possibility of doing a film about Marc Bolan as Jones's friend Robert Hyatt had written a script on Bolan's life. Despite critical success in America with The Hearts of Darkness, Read argued with Pearce & Tarlow over writing credits and money and eventually split from Pearce and Tarlow (who went on to form the band The Veil) and returned to Europe. Read started playing with a rockabilly group called the Mighty Hornets and jammed with them frequently at the Spice Club where they were the resident house group. Around this time he met John Entwistle of The Who, and jammed with him at the China Club; the jam was caught on video by the club's engineer as Read sung \\"I Can't Explain\\". The Hornets and Read eventually made an album at Paramount Recording Studios in 1992 titled Beat Existentialist featuring Ray Manzarek on three tracks. Later career Read returned to live in London and joined Dino Dines and Miller Anderson (ex T. Rex) in 1994, to do shows as X T. Rex, featuring the works of Marc Bolan. After X T. Rex split, Read was introduced by Barry Smith to Bill Legend of the original T. Rex. The two struck up a partnership ‚Äì recording three records: Teenage Dream, Gods 'n' Angels and Walking in Shadows as 'Darryl Read and the Nightriders'. Mickey Finn, also of the original T. Rex, joined them on the recordings and some shows, the last being an all-star line-up including Zoot Money and Finn; the concert was filmed at the 100 Club in London. Bernard White then managed Read, and released his records on his White Label Records company. They went on to produce a promo film at the Roundhouse, London with Gerald Horgan. The promo film was for \\"Teenage Dream\\", a Marc Bolan song, and \\"Hard on Love\\", Read's original composition. The video for Teenage Dream was produced, directed and edited by Spyros Melaris who's next project was the infamous 'Alien Autopsy' footage. Melaris came up with the concept for the promo and worked very closely with Read to create a little bit of 'Rock History' by filming in the legendary 'Roundhouse'. Read and the Nightriders continued for a while and did a television slot for the Live TV Television company. Crushed Butler recordings In 1998, Dig the Fuzz Records released Crushed Butler \\"Uncrushed\\",Record Collector Magazine issue 226, June 1998 demos of Read's proto punk group. In 1999 White and Read wrote a screenplay for the low-budget film production of Remember a Day and Richard Wright of Pink Floyd gave White the rights to the track of the same title to use for the drama which was based heavily on Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. The film also starred Zoot Money, Jamie Foreman, Peter Jenner and Jenny Fabian ‚Äì the author of Groupie. Ray Manzarek Also in 1998, Ray Manzarek and Read released a poetry album with music titled Freshly Dug.Mallon, Tom (2003) \\"Quick Fix: Weird Record ‚Äì Pray for the End, Beautiful Friend\\", CMJ New Music Monthly, September 2003, p. 8, retrieved 2012-01-14Heibutzki, Ralph \\"Freshly Dug [2000] Review\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2012-01-14 The album was subsequently re-issued twice thereafter, once in 2005 on the 'Cherryl Red' label (Lemon Records) and in 2006 on the Madstar Records label for Germany. Read was inspired by Ray Manzarek to write a poetry book titled Set, illustrated by George Underwood in 1999, hardcover, and in 2000 in a paperback version. Read continued to play concerts in Europe under the banner of 'Darryl Read's Beat Existentialists', and in 2007 released another poetry/music album with Ray Manzarek titled Bleeding Paradise.\\"Gedichte mit Gitarre und Klavier\\", taz.de, 14 February 2007, retrieved 2012-01-14 In 2008 he filmed additional sequences in the UK for a new version of Remember A Day (distributed by Contemporary films UK) and guested regularly on Radio Eins Berlin, as DJ with his own Beat X show. In 2009 Set was translated into German, and Colectomatic Volume 3 was released. And in the same year \\"Teenage Dream\\" along with the promo from the Roundhouse was re-issued. In mid-2009, Read recorded a Mick Farren song titled \\"We Gotta Find Somewhere to Go\\".Shindig magazine issue no 20 Jan‚ÄìFeb 2011 The track was featured on a tribute album paying homage to the Pink Fairies and the Deviants, which featured the likes of the Damned, the Dead Kennedys, Wilko Johnson, and the Only Ones. In mid November 2009 Crushed Butler Uncrushed was re-issued for the fourth time; this version on 12-inch vinyl with a new bonus track, was released worldwide by Radio Heartbeat Records, New York City. In August 2010, Windian Records USA released Crushed Butler's \\"It's My Life\\"/\\"My Son's Alive\\" on vinyl, and on 19 September 2010 Read released his latest album: All the Ghosts of Rock 'n' Roll, produced by Italo/German producer Stephan Kroll. On 17 May 2011, Read released the single called \\"Money Number One\\" which was recorded in Thailand and produced by Barry Upton. In February 2013 a fifth re-issue on vinyl, of the Crushed Butler 'Uncrushed' album was released by Last Years Youth records in Germany. Read played concerts worldwide as well performing poetry readings and being involved with film production. He was to be featured in a documentary on his prolific career, produced by German film maker Bernd Libbach. This was in early stages of production at the time of his death. Death Read died in a motorcycle road incident in Pattaya, Thailand on 23 June 2013.

Drawing from the lubok. 19th century Kostroma () is an East Slavic fertility goddess. Her name is derived from –∫–æ—Å—Ç—ë—Ä (kostyor), the Russian word for \\"bonfire\\". The rites of Semik were devoted to her. During this festival a disguised girl or a straw figure portrayed Kostroma. First, a scarecrow was honored and revered. Then, participants of the rite mourned the death of Kostroma, and burned or tore the scarecrow. Rituals with Kostroma were aimed at improving soil fertility. The scarecrow of Kostroma is part of East Slavic folklore. Mythology There is a Slavic myth about Kostroma and Kupalo. According to the myth, Kupalo and Kostroma were twins. They were born on the summer solstice. Their parents were Simargl, the god of fire, and Kupalnitsa, goddess of night. Once, Kostroma and Kupalo ran into a field to listen to songs of birds Sirin (the bird of sorrow) and Alkonost (the bird of joy). Both birds, especially Sirin, were dangerous. The one who listened to the singing of Sirin forever went into the Nav, the world of the dead. Kostroma listened to the singing of Alkonost, while Kupalo listened to the song of Sirin. And then, by the order of Chernobog, Sirin and gusi-lebedi (The Magic Swan Geese) stole Kupalo and carried him into the Nav. Many years later, one day, Kostroma walked the shore of the river Ra and made a wreath. She boasted that the wind would not blow the wreath off her head. According to the belief, it meant that she would not marry. This boast was not approved by the gods. The wind become stronger, and wreath was blown by the wind from Kostroma's head and fell into the water, where it was picked up by Kupalo, who was nearby in the boat. According to the Slavic customs, the one who picked up the wreath must necessarily marry the girl who made it. Kupalo and Kostroma fell in love and shortly were married without any knowledge that they were brother and sister. After the wedding, the gods told them the truth. That is why Kupalo and Kostroma committed suicide. Kupalo has jumped into the fire and died, while Kostroma ran to the forest, threw herself into the lake and drowned. But she did not die, she became a mavka (or a rusalka). Walking around that lake, she charmed the men she met on her path and dragged them into the water abyss. She mistook them for Kupalo, and found out that the caught young man was not her lover only when he had already drowned. And then, the gods repented, realizing that their revenge was too cruel. But to give Kupala and Kostroma again the human body was impossible, and they turned them into the flower with yellow and blue petals, in which the fiery-yellow color was the color of Kupalo, and the blue one, like the waters of a forest lake, was the color of Kostroma. The Slavs gave the name Kupalo-da-Mavka (Kupalo- and-Mavka) to the flower. Later, in the time of the Christianization of Kievan Rus', the flower was renamed to the Ivan-da-Marya (Ivan-and-Marya).

Reese Butler II after the death of his wife, Kristin Brooks Rossell Butler, who tragically became one of the more than 34,000 Americans who died by suicide in 1998. Realizing an urgency in this high profile public health crisis‚Äîwhich for many takes on meaning only when it happens nearby‚ÄîKBHC was founded by her survivor with funds from the death benefit provided by her employer. Kristin suffered severe post partum psychosis (PPP) after losing her unborn child on December 5, 1997. Her struggle with PPP was brought on by the prescription drug Zoloft which resulted in an SSRI syndrome. KBHC is more commonly known as the creator of the first network of suicide hotlines in the United States networked under the easy to remember toll free number 1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433).  History  H. Reese Butler II started the Kristin Brooks Hope Center after he received a check from his wife's employer which was a death benefit amounting to one years salary. The amount was $34,017. Reese decided to donate the money to an organization focused on preventing suicide as a result of post partum depression or psychosis. Upon learning there was no such organization in 1998 he decided donate it to an organization that ran a national suicide hotline for people in crisis. Upon learning that in 1998 there was no national suicide hotline linking the more than 800 community based suicide crisis hotlines he founded the Kristin Brooks Hope Center and began linking those community crisis hotlines through 1-888-SUICIDE(784-2433). 1-888-SUICIDE and1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433) were both part of the National Hopeline Network from its activation September 16, 1998 until the FCC temporarily reassigned it in January 2006. The US Surgeon General David Satcher dedicated 1-888-SUICIDE(784-2433) on May 7, 1999 during a press conference organized by KBHC founder, H. Reese Butler II which was held in Senate Dirkson Building. The event was filmed by Dempsey Rice a Brooklyn based filmmaker (Daughter One Productions) for a project she was working on for HBO. The press event wrapped up with Jock Bartley, founding member of Firefall, singing \\"Call On Me\\" written for a 1998 compilation CD to benefit the Colorado based Pikes Peak Mental Health Crisis Center. Jock introduced H. Reese Butler II to Jonathan Cain of Journey with the hopes of creating a benefit concert to pay the phone bill for 1-800-SUICIDE(784-2433). The concert took place on November 12, 1999 at the Warfield in San Francisco. It was called \\"Reason to Live\\" and featured Firefall as the opening act with Journey headlining. Bev Cobain, cousin to Kurt Cobain author of the book \\"When Nothing Matters Anymore\\" was the Master of Ceremonies for the concert.  HELP Grant  During the three year federal grant known as the HELP Project, two separate studies to determine the effectiveness of suicide hotlines were conducted using 1-800-SUICIDE(784-2433) to conduct the evaluations. In the credits for the Mishara led study he specifically thanks Reese Butler, the Kristin Brooks Hope Center staff, Jerry Reed, and the Directors and helpers at the crisis centers who participated in this study.

Sea Trek 2001 was a privately organized commemorative sea voyage in 2001, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the migration of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from Europe to the United States during the 19th century. It followed the church's sesquicentennial reenactments of Mormon pioneer wagon trains of 1997. Events The Sea Trek 2001 commemorative statue in Liverpool The events for Sea Trek 2001 were in two stages. The first, called \\"The Gathering\\", was a tour of tall ships through different European sea ports over a seventeen-day period. Eight sailing ships were rented: the Statsraad Lehmkuhl, Christian Radich, and Sorlandet from Norway; the Europa, Swan fan Makkum, and Antigua from Denmark; the Mir from Russia; and the Mary-Anne from Germany.The Mary-Anne is confirmed as the German ship in this article: They departed from Esberg, Denmark on August 7, 2001 and stopped at ports in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Scotland, and England, where Mormon emigrants had departed in the nineteenth century. Identical statues were donated to a number of port cities visited during the project. The unusual sight of tall ships at these sites drew crowds and publicity, with thousands paying to tour the historic ships. Around 1,700 boarders paid for passage between different ports and durations at sea. The second stage, called \\"The Crossing\\", took passengers across the Atlantic Ocean, from Portsmouth to New York, at $160 per day for 39 days. Three ships (Statsraad Lehmkuhl, Christian Radich and Europa) sailed on to the Canary Islands, Bermuda then New York City. The final arrival on October 4 in New York Harbor was planned as a media event with a concert, fireworks, and exhibits, to generate publicity and souvenir sales. However, these were cancelled because of the September 11 attacks, which occurred while the ships were underway in the Atlantic Ocean. Financial trouble Following the voyage, there was concern for some time that certain bills to the tall ship operators would not be paid, as The Sea Trek Foundation ran short on cash and failed to honor its commitments. However, Property Reserve, Inc, an affiliate of the LDS Church, which was not an organizer or sponsor of the event, stepped in and paid all of the foundation's debts in full. The project reportedly cost more than $4 million, and the LDS Church bought debts of almost $500 thousand.

The Central Ordnance Munitions Depot was constructed in the late 1930s by British for the World War II to combat the Japanese Invasion as well as to store arms and ammunition for the defence of Hong Kong. The British used \\"Little Hong Kong\\", name for the fishing village town of Aberdeen, as a \\"code name\\" to refer to the military site and therefore confuse Japanese spies in the local community before the Japanese invasion. Following a successful proposal made to the Government of Hong Kong for a commercial adaptive reuse of the underground bunkers in 2002, the Central Ordnance Munitions Depot has been renovated to become wine cellars. This revitalisation project won one of the four Awards of Merit of the 2007 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation.UNESCO Bangkok Press release, 16 August 2007  History  The Central Ordnance Munitions Depot was established in 1937 by the British Royal Engineers in preparation for the Second World War to combat the Japanese Invasion, and served as a secure military facility for ammunition and weapon storage. It was composed of 12 pairs of underground bunkers, a depot headquarters and a sentry box. The original structures were constructed almost by the British military to serve as an ammunition and weapons storage depot in preparation for World War II. The site was originally known as the Central Ordnance (Munitions) Depot, and included 24 underground Bunkers, of which only 8 remain. Owing to their intended purpose, the Bunkers are located approximately 20 meters below ground with 1-meter thick concrete walls and 12-meter long entrance passages. Architecture and construction The overall site of Central Ordnance Munitions Depot measures approximately in width and in length. Before its destruction, the facility comprised 12 pairs of underground bunkers, a Depot headquarters building and a sentry box at the Western corner of the area. Each bunker has been created in a similar design including an entrance corridor measuring , an internal width of and a length of , the only difference that some bunkers have is that they have an extra (false) brick wall inner-lining against the 1 meter thick wall since they had been planned for high explosive. The reason for this false wall's construction is to reduce the potential impact of an internal explosion. The corridors are angled in an S-shape to turn aside the explosion wave of a possible burst of munitions. In addition, there are channels built into the corridor walls inclining from ceiling to floor at 45-degree angles. The purpose of these channels' construction is to capture the blast wave of a burst and force them to descend onto the corridor floor at 90-degree angles to the side walls thus preventing the blast waves from exiting the passageways. A second smaller corridor which measures 1.25 meters in height and 50 cm in width can be found at the entrance to the bunker cavity. This smaller corridor travels around the outer wall of the bunkers thus creating a moisture trap which is essential as the bunkers are located under the water table for most of the year. This design of bunkers allows the inner concrete walls to stay free from being humid and therefore keeping armaments and ammunition dry. A pair of 1.27 cm thick steel entrance door which opens up into the bunker area measures approximately 3.3 meters from the ground floor to the lowest point of the ceiling. The ceiling features rugged, wave-like design that rises and falls around 40 cm and it is covered in steel. This design is used again to minimise the effect of possible explosion and to benefit blast wave deflection. Inside of the bunkers, escape hatch measuring one meter in diameters runs horizontally for 5 meters and then perpendicularly until the surface on the top of the bunkers. The metal structure and additional brick has been constructed on the slope to make escape easy under possible explosion or fire. In addition, \\"breather pipe\\" has been built to open up into a hidden structure above the slope for the case in which the troops be trapped inside of the bunkers. One of the bunkers that is located outside the Crown Wine Cellars that can no longer be used. Japanese invasion It was believed that the British military chose the site to keep it a secret since there were many Japanese spies in the local communities before the Japanese invasion. The local fishing village of Aberdeen was located about 5 km away and is known as \\"Little Hong Kong\\" in Cantonese. The British used this version as a \\"code name\\" to refer to the military site and thus confuse those spying for the Japanese. Little Hong Kong was manned by some 60 soldiers of four different nationalities in December 1941. Among these were soldiers from Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Army Service Corps, and Royal Engineers. There were also five soldiers from the Winnipeg Grenadiers; 14 local Chinese uniformed soldiers of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, 18 men from the Middlesex Regiment, as well as Punjabi infantrymen from pre-partition India. It was the last place to surrender during the Battle of Hong Kong, which lasted 18 days and ended with the British colony being taken by the Japanese army. Two days after Hong Kong officially surrendered on 25 December 1941, the Japanese commander became aware that the munitions depot Little Hong Kong was still under the control of the British. The Japanese could either attack and stand the chance of losing more soldiers or negotiate. Since the bunkers were almost impervious to attack and there was sufficient food, water and ammunition for defence, Major Dewar, the British commander, resisted with a defiant message. Captain Suzuki was sent by the Japanese commander to negotiate the surrender. Upon learning that Dewar had wired up all the 24 bunkers to a central detonator, the Japanese captain agreed to an honorable surrender on 27 December 1941. What happened after the surrender was recorded by a British man Lewis Bush. He was the translator used by the Japanese Army. Bush later wrote in his diary about how the Japanese treated the surrendering troops \\"like heroes\\". They were taken down to Aberdeen where a \\"Japanese officer arrived with beer and whisky in plenty\\". The Japanese then occupied the site until Hong Kong was liberated in August 1945, during which time it is believed that the Japanese constructed the current guard house. Post-War The British military ceased its use of the site in 1977. Control was transferred to the Hong Kong Police Driving School until the early 1980s. At least four pairs of the bunkers were destroyed in the mid-1980s as a result of the development of two residential apartments. Starting in the mid-1980s, Hong Kong Geotechnical Engineering Office used the remaining bunkers to store rock core samples. In 2000, the government put forward a partnership proposal to invite private sectors for the revitalisation of discarded military sites in Hong Kong.  Preservation and restoration  Crown Worldwide spent approximately 30 million Hong Kong dollars on the restoration and construction of Crown Wine Cellars. Little Hong Kong's historical significance was long forgotten and the site fell into disrepair until the Government of Hong Kong, under the guidance of the (then) Chief Secretary Donald Tsang, called for the private restoration in 2000. In 2002, Jim Thompson and Gregory De‚Äôeb of Crown Worldwide Group realised that there were no wine cellars in Asia,May George. \\"A Vintage diplomat\\" (13 September 2008), South China Morning Post.

It is constructed with a conventional fiber on the inside, surrounded by a cladding containing a new nanostructured reflector. ClearCurve is hundreds of times more flexible than conventional optical cable, transmitting high-quality signals even when wrapped around small objects like a pen, where a conventional cable would lose the signal completely. Although originally introduced to serve the needs of pulling fiber in apartment buildings and other high-density units where conventional fiber is too inflexible, in 2009 Intel announced their intention to use it as the basis of a new computer interconnect system code-named Light Peak. ClearCurve's small size and high bandwidth capabilities offer great improvements over existing copper wiring in this role, and Intel is positioning Light Peak as a truly universal bus that can carry any existing traffic over a single cable. Background Conventional fiber Conventional single-mode long-haul optical fiber cable. Conventional optical fiber consists of a thin inner cylindrical core of glass or plastic with a similar material layered in a thin coating around it. Slight differences in the index of refraction between the two layers causes total internal reflection, trapping a light beam inside the inner core. This process is limited to a critical angle; when the light beam approaches the interface at a shallow angle most of it will be reflected, but as it gets closer to the critical angle more and more will travel through the interface and be lost.Craig Freudenrich, \\"How Fiber Optics Work\\", How Stuff Works The critical angle depends on the relative difference in index of refraction, larger differences will increase the critical angle and trap more light. However, changing the index of refraction in most materials generally changes its mechanical properties too, which means that different types of cables are used for different purposes. Cables intended to be highly efficient over long runs are generally less flexible, while those that require higher flexibility are generally only useful for shorter distances. Even cables designed to be flexible, like TOSLINK, are less flexible than a similar sized braided copper cable. To keep the fibers as straight as possible, most high-performance optical cables use a form of armour that resists tight bending. This is normally a helical winding, similar to BX cable, or a series of straight fibers running parallel to the core. Since the armour is fairly large, the cables normally carry a number of fibers inside. The resulting armoured bundle is then surrounded in an environmental cladding, typically plastic. The bundle is about the size of a conventional power cable found on an electrical appliance, but much less flexible. Fiber to the home Optical cabling has long formed the backbone of major terrestrial networks, delivering signals over long distances. The signals are then converted into other forms at the company end offices, and distributed from there in some other form, typically telephone wiring or coax cable in the case of cable television. The multi- fiber armoured cable is well suited to this role. Since the 1990s there has been an ongoing effort to supply fiber to the home (FTTH). Using fiber to deliver signals all the way to the home provides the same advantages as it does on the longer hauls, namely much higher bandwidth, lower costs, and less interference with other sources. However, given the deliberate lack of flexibility of the cable, these installations generally end in a utility room where they are converted to copper for distribution within the home.\\"Definition of Terms\\", FTTH Council, 9 January 2009 While this sort of installation is useful for individual dwellings, it is less useful in large multi-unit dwellings. Corning estimates that an apartment installation would require an average of twelve right angle turns between the distribution point and the units. Conventional fiber would lose the signal after one or two such bends, making it useless in this role.\\"The ultimately flexible fiber\\" , Corning, 2009 As is the case for individual homes, the fiber can be converted to copper for the last section of delivery, but the longer runs demand much higher performance, larger cable. Finding room to run these cables in an existing structure may not be possible. ClearCurve ClearCurve fibers are constructed in a fashion similar to existing cables, starting with a traditional glass fiber in the center. ClearCurve then adds a third layer to the sandwich, a plastic sheath that is infused with microscopic reflectors. Light that passes through the conventional interface has a second chance to be reflected back into the center of the fiber. In the corners of tight bends, the reflectors serve to increase the amount of signal retained within the cable, allowing ClearCurve to be hundreds of times more flexible than conventional cables.\\"Bend the rules\\", Corning, 2009 A thin environmental sheath is added on the outside. Unlike conventional fibers, ClearCurve does not have to be held straight, and therefore eliminates the armour. Lacking armour, there is no lower limit to the size of a ClearCurve cable, which can be as small as a single fiber, although normally they contain two fibres, one upstream and one down. Two-fiber ClearCurve cables are smaller than the wire on a typical computer mouse, yet the high-performance single-mode versions carry 25 Gbit/s over long lengths.\\"Nearly unlimited bandwidth for broadband\\" , Corning, 2009 In a video demonstration, Corning showed a ClearCurve drop cable being wrapped dozens of times around a small metal rod, and suffering almost no signal loss and providing a perfect video feed. A conventional cable wrapped around the same rod completely lost the signal after only two turns. FTTH uses ClearCurve is the end result of a Corning research project looking for products better tailored to the fiber to the home market.Stephanie Mehta, \\"Bend It Like Corning\\" , Fortune, 6 August 2007. Running since 1988 at their Sullivan Park research center in New York, Corning announced ClearCurve at a press event on 19 September 2007 and showed it publicly at the FTTH Conference later that month.\\"Corning to Introduce ClearCurve Product Suite at FTTH Conference\\" , Corning press release, 19 September 2007 Using ClearCurve, a FTTH installation can use existing armoured cabling to deliver the signal to a utility room, then connect individual ClearCurve cables to the fibers in the bundle for distribution within the building. This sort of installation dramatically simplifies the overall complexity of FTTH wiring in multi-unit dwellings, eliminating both the large coax cabling and the need to convert formats from light to electrical. Users were quickly forthcoming; announced in September, only a month later an official press release announced that Connexion Technologies would be using ClearCurve on 30 November 2007.\\"Corning Cable Systems Announces First Sale of ClearCurve Product Solution\\", Business Wire, 30 November 2007 Since then many additional partners have been announced. Computer bus uses The single-mode fibers used in conversional telecommunications applications have high performance, but require expensive light sources and highly accurate mechanical positioning in order to gather light from them. In comparison, multi-mode have wider cores that are easier to connect to and can be effectively driven by lower-cost devices like solid- state IR lasers or vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).\\"Mode Theory\\" , Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series Multi-mode fiber found some uses in high-performance computing applications, notably the Fibre Channel system for high speed disks and some parallel computing interconnection systems. However, the relatively inflexible cables made them less useful in general roles, where braided copper wiring remains widespread. Fiber has found one consumer use, the TOSLINK cable used in digital audio applications. This role uses lower quality multi-mode plastic fibre with limited bandwidth, about 125 Mbit/s, driven by red LEDs. However, advances in computers have demanded ever increasing bandwidth, and modern computer bus systems are quickly reaching their limits. There was some discussion of moving to optical fiber for the USB3 standard, but the decision was made to move ahead with copper.Stephen Shankland, \\"USB 3.0 brings optical connection in 2008\\", cnet, 18 September 2007 Corning announced a multi-mode version of ClearCurve cabling on 13 January 2009.\\"Corning Announces Multimode Version of ClearCurve Optical Fiber\\" , Corning press release, 13 January 2009 It has greater bandwidth than any common copper wiring, and is at least as flexible as copper wiring able to carry the same amount of data. Although it was mentioned only in passing, Intel's new Light Peak interconnection system uses ClearCurve cabling as its basis.Brooke Crothers, \\"Sources: 'Light Peak' technology not Apple idea\\", cnet news, 29 September 2009 Light Peak uses a two-fiber cable running at 10 Gbit/s in both directions. Unlike most optical connection systems, Light Peak is being designed to allow daisy-chaining and supply power through a set of coaxial copper wires.

Established as an organization in 1892, it is the oldest of three shul and one temple serving the Jewish community in Perth. The synagogue includes a child care - namely Ruth Landau Harp Early Learning offering education to children aged from 6 weeks to 5 years, educating children on the Jewish calendar of events and Jewish values, with all meals being kosher. The synagogue offers facilities for daily services, educational programmes, PHC also houses a library, a mikveh and a bookshop. In July 2004, the shule was heavily defaced with anti- Semitic vandalism.  Overview  The first two scrolls in the possession of the Perth Hebrew Congregation were gifts from members of the Montefire clan. The synagogue received a grant of as part of the National Community Crime Prevention Programme (NCCPP). The project was to \\"design and erect a perimeter security fence complete with access controls around the premises of the Perth Synagogue\\". The rationale was for protection of the premises and population in the event of a potential attack on PHC.  History  The first Jewish congregation in Western Australia was founded in Fremantle in 1887, when Benjamin Solomon organised the necessary fundraising and construction of the Fremantle Synagogue on the corner of South Terrace and Parry Street. The Reverend Abraham Tobias Boas came to Fremantle from Adelaide to lay the foundation stone of the new building, in 1891. It was opened in 1897, but did not last long as a place of worship because the congregation was absorbed into the Perth Hebrew Congregation in 1907. For the more orthodox Jewish settlers, the more Anglicized services of the Perth Hebrew Congregation had no appeal. They formed the Perth Jewry Association and built a synagogue known as the Palmerston Shule. Possible conflict between the two congregations was avoided thorough the leadership of Perth Jewry's first minister, Rabbi D. I. Freedman who served in the Perth Hebrew Congregation for 42 years from 1897 up until his death in 1939.

Geography  The Wurmberg lies north of Braunlage, in the district of Goslar, and west of Schierke. Its summit is located due south of the Brocken and roughly 400 m (as the crow flies) south of the state border with Saxony-Anhalt. The two mountains are separated by the valley of the Kalte Bode, which in this area is about .  Wurmberg nature reserve  Until October 2006, the Wurmberg lay within the Upper Harz Nature Reserve (Naturschutzgebiet Oberharz). Since then only two areas totalling 183 hectares in area on the west and southwest slopes have been designated as the Wurmberg Nature Reserve.  Wurmbergklippen  On the southern flank of the Wurmberg there are two striking tors or Wurmbergklippen, which are one of the many Harzklippen: * The Gro√üe Wurmbergklippe (also called the Gro√üe Klippe; max. 823.8 m), which is designated as a natural monument (ND GS 32), is located within the Wurmberg Nature Reserve about 220 m west of the Wurmberg Gondola Lift route between the top and middle stations, a little above the filled in upper pit of the Wurmberg Quarry. * The Kleine Wurmbergklippe (or Kleine Klippe; about 690 m) lies between the middle and valley stations of the gondola lift just under 100 m east of the lift route in spruce forest. On the topmost summit level of the crag there is a triangular offering cup (Opferschale or Zwergenmolle). Many legends, mostly about the \\"Wild Hunter\\" (Wilden J√§ger) surround this artificially chiselled out rectangular hollow. The Wild Hunter usually epitomises the god Wodin (or Thor) in Germanic mythology.  History  The named Wormberch had already surfaced by the 13th century in the documents and commodity schedules of the County of Regenstein-Blankenburg in connexion with the mining of iron ore. In the 19th century the mountain was still being called Wormsberg or Wormberg, but a convincing derivation of the name has yet to be found. Around 1850 the first trig post was erected on the summit of the Wurmberg to assist in surveying the Harz mountains. It was replaced in 1890 by a wooden tower, also used for trigonometric measurements, that stood until 1930. In 1922 the wooden ski jump was built with its starting tower, which also acted as an observation tower (see below). Since the 1950s there has been a restaurant next to this tower. The Inner German Border that separated the West and East Germany during the Cold War, ran only a few hundred metres north and east of the summit. During the Cold War there was a listening post on the summit plateau. In 1972 the US Secret Services built an tower, the North Tower on the Wurmberg to monitor and record signals information.Station construction began in 1972, completed in 1976 by the Army Security Agency and NSA and was one in a much larger network. Tower was 90m, not 81m. Remote site complement was 7. This station was demolished on 22 August 1994 and the debris removed. (see also: listening post on the neighbouring St√∂berhai). Since 1963/65 the Wurmberg gondola lift has run from Braunlage up the mountain. The construction of this lift was carried out in two sections; in 1997 the lift was then completely renovated. In a container on the summit is one of the 25 monitoring sites in the Lower Saxony air quality monitoring network (:de:Lufthygienisches √úberwachungssystem Niedersachsen). Since September 2007 a 70 cm amateur radio relay station has also been located on Lower Saxony highest mountain. The relay has the callsign DB0WUR and transmits on 438.550 MHz. This enables large parts of Lower Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse and Saxony-Anhalt to be reached.  Historic stone structures  The peak of the Wurmberg is covered with a variety of odd stone structures that, for a long time, were interpreted as the remnants of an ancient, pre-Christian place of worship, several millennia old. A long, straight staircase of unhewn stone begins at a height of about 90 metres above the iron ore mining district on the eastern flank of the mountain and leads to the edge of the summit plateau in a terraced area with edging of similarly unhewn stones. Colloquially this flight of steps is known as the \\"Heath Staircase\\" (Heidentreppe), although in earlier times the name \\"Witch's Staircase\\" (Hexentreppe) had been common. In 1856 Heinrich Pr√∂hle reported in his Harz Legends that, continuing in a straight line from the steps, there was a stone path on the plateau leading to a round pile of stones. When he collected his tales of the Upper Harz in 1851 from the inhabitants of Braunlage, they reported that a pagan temple had stood on the site. Between 1949 and 1956 Walter Nowothnig (1907‚Äì1971) carried out several archaeological digs on the Wurmberg. Pr√∂hle's collection of legends reinforced his suspicion that the rumour of these steps being laid by a man called Daubert, a horseman- forester who had lived in Braunlage around 1825, was no longer tenable. Nowothnig's excavations, rediscovered the stone path and also uncovered, at the end of the path, a circular rampart of roughly 10 m diameter which surrounded the ruins of a square stone building. Moreover, south of the path, the foundation of a small circular building was found. In 2006, another, larger rampart was found on the western edge of the summit plateau. Nowothnig found no clues as to the age of the site, which is why it was referred to henceforth as a prehistoric site of worship of unknown period. Unscientific speculation quickly claimed that the stone structures were a Celtic place of worship. The square building inside the rampart was quickly made out to be a temple, the path seen as a procession route, the stone terraces as a religious theatre and the ruins of the small circular building were referred to as the Hexenaltar (\\"witch's altar\\"). From 1999 to 2000 further archaeological investigations on the Wurmberg were carried out under the leadership of Michael Geschwinde and Martin Oppermann. The results of this research largely showed the claims to be wildly exaggerated. The square formation proved to be the foundation of a stone hut built between 1820 and 1840, which master forester Daubert had built. The ruins of this hut and the stone cairn mentioned by Pr√∂hle, were used in 1890 for building the above-mentioned trigonometric tower. The circular site first appeared during the construction of this tower as an abutment for the diagonal posts that supported the tower on all sides. And on one of the stones of the Hexentreppe, an English button from the period around 1800 was found, which finally proved the staircase to be another work by Daubert. Even the large rampart is probably an enclosure laid out by the same forester. In the round Hexenaltar the foundations of the old 1850 trig post were found. Only the age of the stone terraces could not be clarified beyond doubt. Geschwinde's team felt it probable that it was originally a severely eroded, natural, geological formation that had later been artificially reworked. Nowothnig appears to have been so blinded by his 'legendary' discovery that he did not include in his investigations either the survey tower, that had been demolished twenty years before his excavations, or the trig post, that would have been known to him from Pr√∂hle's report. Forester Daubert and his daughter were known for their 'feasts' on the mountain, and the superstition of Braunlage townsfolk appears to have assumed there were pagan rites behind them. From these tales the legend of the pagan temple emerged after a few decades. Although the notion that there was once a prehistoric religious site on the mountain can be excluded with certainty, in 2003 the Wurmberg plateau was declared an archaeological conservation area on account of the human traces of activity in the Upper Harz in the Early Modern Era.  Wurmberg granite quarry  The stone quarry on the Wurmberg was established by Herrmann Bachstein as part of the construction of the South Harz Railway around 1899. From 1 September 1899 (until 1958) there was the goods station of Wurmberg at the foot of the mountain on the Brocken path. Rough and dressed stone of Wurmberg granite was loaded onto trains here. From 1925 there was a ballast works at the goods station known as the Knacker. The Wurmberg loading station was initially linked to the lower bed of the quarry higher up the mountain by means of an inclined railway. Stone was transported down this in hoppers attached by a cable. The embankment on which the tracks of this incline were laid is still clearly visible today along its entire length. Later an aerial cableway was built on this embankment. The foundations for its pylons may still be seen in the woods today. In the 1970s the stone quarry was closed. The high stone wall in the lower part of the quarry (now a bird reserve) is still visible. The upper quarry was filled in with spoil that resulted from the construction of the Braunlage ring road (1st construction section).  Winter sports  The Rodelhaus near the cableway middle station Kaffeehorst run on the Wurmberg West side of the summit  Rodelhaus and toboggan run  About halfway up the southern slope of the Wurmberg and 100 m from the middle station of the Wurmberg lift is the Rodelhaus. This used to be a simple farm building before the opening of the toboggan run (Rodelbahn) at the beginning of 1908. It is still open as a restaurant today and is a popular destination for visitors to Braunlage. The toboggan run begins immediately next to the Rodelhaus and runs down into the valley ending at the Verlobungswiese meadow near the valley station of the Wurmberg cable car.  Downhill skiing  There are six downhill ski runs on the Wurmberg with a total length of 12 kilometres. In addition to the Wurmberg Gondola Lift there are three drag lifts, which together have a capacity of 1,700 passengers per hours. The runs are graded from easy to difficult.

It broadcasts on the frequency of 106.3 MHz, with an effective radiated power of 3,000 watts. The station is owned by Seven Mountains Media, through licensee Southern Belle, LLC. It is part of a simulcast of WIBF of Mexico. Although also owned by Seven Mountains Media, WIBF and WDBF do not feature the same programming as the network of Bigfoot Country stations based in Selinsgrove. History History of 106.3 FM A station at 106.3 FM first went on the air as the sister FM to WHUN AM 1150 featuring simulcast broadcast. When the AM signed off at local sunset listeners were invited to switch to 106.3 FM and continuing listening until midnight. In 1976 the FM became WRLR, Raystown Lake Radio and featured a beautiful music format. Heavy rotation of instrumental versions of popular songs, with a few vocals each hour. WHUN AM first went on the air in March, 1947 at 1400 AM with 250 watts, then increased power to 1,000 watts. WHUN AM then switched to 1150 AM a regional signal and operates at 5,000 watts daytime and has decreased pre and post sunset power levels non-directional. In early 1987, WRLR switched from 106.3 to 103.5 FM in order to increase its coverage area from a new tower location on Williamsburg Mountain, leaving the old dial location vacant. History of WDBF-FM In 1992, Mary Lou Maierhofer of Altoona applied for and was granted the license to operate at 106.3 FM in Huntingdon. The station with the call letters WQHG went on the air from the studio location of a now dark directional daytime only AM radio station, WQRO AM 1080 which had signed on the air in the mid 1970s. Utilizing the old studios along Fairgrounds Road, WQHG also acquired the old transmitter location of WRLR on Stone Creek Ridge. One remaining tower from old WQRO was used as an STL facility for WQHG to send its signal to the transmitter site. In 1998, Maierhofer agreed to sell the station to Warren Diggins and his Millennium Broadcasting, who switched the format from Adult Contemporary to Country under the theme Bear Country. Diggins' group then sold the station to Megahertz Licenses, a subsidiary of Forever Broadcasting in Altoona, PA for $620,000. Three years after the sale, Megahertz Licenses successfully petitioned the FCC for a change in the station's community of license from Huntingdon to Mount Union. On September 21, 2009, WBSS changed their call letters to WHUN-FM and flipped from classic rock (simulcasting WBUS 93.7 FM) to oldies, branded as \\"Hunny 106\\". On September 1, 2015, WHUN-FM dropped the oldies format in favor of a country station known as Big Foot Country, along with WIBF and WZBF. This followed the consummation of the sale of WHUN-FM and sister station WHUN by Forever Broadcasting to Southern Belle, LLC, at a purchase price of $100,000. On September 15, WHUN-FM changed their call letters to WDBF-FM, to go with the \\"Bigfoot Country\\" branding.

Born deaf, Libman overcame his \\"disability\\" to run the cookie company by himself for more than 20 years. To supplement his work, Mr. Libman hired other deaf workers, offering them a place to hone their skills, and showing everyone that being deaf is not a limitation on success. History Under Mr. Libman, Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies focused primarily on Christmas-season gift tins, serving individual and corporate customers. All production was accomplished in a small facility on Valley Road in West Orange. Mr. Libman eventually sold the company to a group interested in expanding the Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies brand, from gift tins to a full retail-store experience. This group then opened two retail stores, known as Gimmee Jimmy's Cookie Bars, in Montclair, New Jersey and Livingston, New Jersey, respectively. The Cookie Bars married Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies with coffee and desserts, including cupcakes and muffins. The economic downturn of 2008 forced the group which had purchased the company from Mr. Libman to go out of business. In 2009, Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies was revived when it was purchased by a group based in Sarasota, Florida, which intends to grow Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies into a nationally recognized brand. The following steps have been and are being taken to improve the business: * The original recipes first used by Mr. Libman in 1983 are being revived for use today. * The under-performing retail stores were shuttered. In 2014, Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies moved online, opening a large bakery in Inwood, NY, close to JFK, to facilitate faster shipping. Headed by Freeman Lewin, Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies has returned to its routes of gift tins and corporate gifts and technology enabling large corporations to order en- masse. Since 2014, Gimmee Jimmy's Cookies has been featured in Inc, Business Weekly, and Inquirer, and on BuzzFeed. To re-claim the do-good nature of the company from its founding, the new owners formed the Gimmee Jimmy's Children's Foundation, to steer a portion of company proceeds to cheering children who are hospitalized with pediatric diseases. This foundation has yet to be fully mobilized, as the company decides how best to make use of the funds designated for these charitable purposes. In addition to the Gimmee Jimmy's Children's Foundation, the company is heavily involved in fundraising opportunities for schools, places of worship, and other non-profits.

Starting in the turn of the 19th and 20th century as an opposition to the conservative National Theatre, it became a pioneer institution of Hungarian drama, and one of the oldest theatres of the city still in operation.  The building  The V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z was designed by architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer who worked on over 47 state-of-the-art theatre buildings around Europe. Its construction was financed by the tripartite ownership consisting of Count Istv√°n Keglevich, the writer Ferenc Sz√©csi, and local businessman G√°bor Faludi. I The destined area was a swampland before, but in the next few years it developed into the bourgeois Lip√≥tv√°ros district. The construction started in 1895 and lasted for one year, finishing on 1 May 1896. With 3 main tracts: the stage, including the flies; the lower seating tract; and the entry hall; the building exemplifies late historicism, featuring large sizes, an elevated driveway and baroque decorations, often using golden coloring. As a distinct feature from contemporary theatres, the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z featured three rows of box seats, large corridors and public areas supported by several wide stairs to answer the call of rising social life in the rapidly developing Budapest.  History  The Comedy Theatre in 1904 M√≥r Ditr√≥i was the first director, coming from Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca). He also brought his company of young actors, who were unknown to the Budapest audience at the time. They quickly created a unique and modern repertoire differing from the era's classical theatre, that featured both French comedies, contemporary Hungarian (starting the career of Ferenc Moln√°r, S√°ndor Br√≥dy, or Jen≈ë Heltai), and foreign (like from Irwine Shaw, Bertold Brecht, Anton Chekhov) dramas. The V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z provided starting ground and home for several of the biggest names of the theatrical world from the turn of the century, like Gyula Csortos, Lili Darvas, Lili Mur√°ti, Artur Somlay, Kl√°ri Tolnay or Gyula Kabos. In the last days of World War II, Jan 1 1945 the theatre was hit by bombshells, so the company moved to the Radius Movie Theatre in the Nagymez≈ë Street. The repairs began under the supervision of Oszk√°r Kaufmann. Along with other similar artistic institution, V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z was nationalized in 1949 (before this time, it operated as a private theatre). It reopened in 1951 under the name Theatre of the People's Army. Regaining its original name in 1960, V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z became the main center of contemporary drama again, showing plays from Hungarian authors like G√°bor Thurz√≥, Gyula Illy√©s, Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny, or classical 20th century authors like Arthur Miller or Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt . In 1973 they premiered the popular K√©pzelt riport egy amerikai popfesztiv√°lr√≥l (An Imaginary Report on an American Rock Festival), resulting in several other musical productions under the supervision of G√°bor Presser. The building underwent significant repairs in 1994. With an average of 350.000 tickets sold each year, V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z is still one of the most successful theatrical venues in Budapest.  Pesti Sz√≠nh√°z  Pesti Sz√≠nh√°z Theatre, the chamber theater of V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z, is located in the 5th district. (address: V√°ci str. 9) Its auditorium‚Äôs capacity is 538 persons. Pesti Sz√≠nh√°z Theatre was built in 1840, based on the plans of architect J√≥zsef Hild. Now the building is protected by the law of National Monuments Inspectorate. Initially there was an elegant coffee house with marble columns in the tract opens to the Aranyk√©z street. The upper floors originally accommodated private apartments, but these were rebuilt for suites of Hotel National. In 1902 a new reconstruction program began and the premises of Cinema Corso occupied the ground floor. In 1936‚Äì37 the building was reconstructed again and the auditorium of the Corso Cinema was expanded. In World War II almost the whole building was destroyed. The restoration started only in 1945 and some years later the cinema was renamed to Bart√≥k Hall. From 1967 Pesti Sz√≠nh√°z Theatre is the chamber theatre of V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z with the same company. Its a venue for plays with a more intimate atmosphere. The Pesti Sz√≠nh√°z Theatre also has several English and American successes, musicals and children-plays to its credit. The building was renovated in 2009 in a modern style.  Sources  * ‚Äì Comedy Theatre in the Hungarian Theatrical Lexicon (Gy√∂rgy, Sz√©kely. Magyar Sz√≠nh√°zm≈±v√©szeti Lexikon.

Forest degradation is a process in which the biological wealth of a forest area is permanently diminished by some factor or by a combination of factors. \\"This does not involve a reduction of the forest area, but rather a quality decrease in its condition.\\"The forest is still there, but with fewer trees, or less species of trees, plants or animals, or some of them affected by plagues. This degradation makes the forest less valuable and may lead to deforestation. Forest degradation is a type of the more general issue of land degradation.  Interpretations of the term  Deforestation is much worse than forest degradation, but it is clear and visible. On the contrary, forest degradation may start and go on without showing clear effects. It is difficult to measure and even the very term is controversial. In a paper submitted to the XII World Forestry Congress, 2003, Jean-Paul Lanly states: \\"The situation is even less satisfactory regarding forest degradation due in particular to the imprecision and multiple, and often subjective, interpretations of the term\\". In 2009 Lund identified more than 50 definitions of forest degradation. Previously to this August 2017 editing, the Wikipedia page Forest degradation was redirected to Secondary forest, a forest which has re-grown after a timber harvest. This is a confusion: a secondary forest may be perfectly healthy, and a primary forest may be suffering degradation. The term \\"permanently\\" also poses some difficulties: a forest affected by a mild seasonal drought may experience a loss of its biological wealth, but if it is seasonally reversed, then it is not considered degradation. On the contrary, a severe prolonged drought may seriously degrade a forest and make human intervention advisable to limit damages.  Difficulties which hamper the assessment of degradation  According to Lanly, there are 3 difficulties: * the different choices of the initial state of reference or baseline; * the chosen criteria: health, biodiversity, production capacity; and * the opinion on the evolution prospects: will the final result of the process be desirable or undesirable? For mapping forest degradation in Bolivia, M√ºller et al. consider areas where only between 30% and 70% of the original forest cover remains. If less than 30% remains, the area is considered as deforested, and if more than 70% remains, the forest is considered intact. Davidar et al. also think that \\"Loss of dense and moderately dense forest cover is suggestive of forest degradation.\\" but for the moment no parameter exists \\"that indicates at what speed forests become degraded and how long it will take for the ecosystem to degrade beyond the point of recovery.\\"  Causes  The Dominican Center for Agricultural and Forest Development lists the following causes of forest degradation: * Excessive extraction of forest products like timber, charcoal or resin. * Road building: after it has been built, the road favours soil erosion. * Open mining: the area where extraction takes place is, of course, completely deforested, but also the surrounding zone suffers a degradation of its fauna and flora. * Expansion of urban areas. Davidar et al. add another: * Livestock grazing: goats or sheep eat tree seedlings, thus slowing natural forest regeneration. Earth Eclipse, a platform of environment research articles, adds the following causes: * Acid rain * Pests and diseases * Air pollution. Degradation for this cause is specifically called Waldsterben (German word) or forest death. * Forest fragmentation: a large forest is broken up in smaller woods, which destroys the habitat of large animals. * Land pollution * Soil erosion (see image above) and sedimentation Finally as an additional cause: * Excessive or unrespectful tourism  Remedies to forest degradation  Generally, any measure to prevent deforestation will also reduce forest degradation. Specifically for degradation, Greenpeace proposes: * Attaining a responsible forest products industry * Sustainable forest management Curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide (to combat acid rain) would also reduce forest degradation for this cause. If a coal-fired power plant uses low-quality coal (with a high sulfur contents), this may be alleviated by flue-gas desulfurization.  Initiatives against forest degradation  * Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is an international voluntary climate change mitigation approach to curb deforestation and forest degradation. This mechanism makes part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2005. * The United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (or UN-REDD Programme) is a collaborative programme created in 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It should not be confused with \\"REDD+.

Her passion for gymnastics and her hard work ethic led her path towards achieving good results. Aurelia won the all-around title at the National Championships. Besides that, gold medals also came from beam, floor and parallel bars. Her last competition in Artistic gymnastics was the National Championship from 1997, where she won five medals: two gold (in floor and all around), two silver (in beam and parallel bars) and one silver (in vault). Despite the fact that she was a talented gymnast, she didn't make it to the 1996 Olympic team. At that time she was too young. However, she was considered for the Olympics in 2000. After her retirement from WAG, Aurelia started with fitness. In this sport, she won 3rd place at the National Championships in 1998. But she wanted to do more, and in parallel Aurelia started with aerobic gymnastics, a young sport at that time. Her first appearance, after only 6 months of training, was at the National Championships, where she took the bronze medal. At the age of 17 (1999), Aurelia was hit by a car when crossing the street. She stayed in the hospital for one month with severe trauma and fractures. Doctors told her she would not be able to continue with her sport and that she should focus on other things. But Aurelia couldn't accept that so easily, especially since at the time the accident has happened, she was preparing for an important competition that could have decided a spot in the national team in aerobics. After the recovering period, she returned to the gym. She felt that people didn't believe in her abilities anymore (coach, the club). Together with her mother, who was her main support, made a plan to reshape her figure and regain her strength and mobility. She and her mom started to run together in the evenings. Extra strength training was done home and a special attention was given to the food. The goal was that she should be in the first six gymnasts at the next National, which she succeeded. After she turned 18, she was called to the national team for a test period. Aurelia worked hard and remain as a member of the national team until after the World Championships in 2004. Her accomplishments in aerobic gymnastics are 5 medals in World Championship (4 gold and 1 silver) and 2 medals in European Championships. She also got bronze with the trio at the World Cup Finals, as well as gold medals (trio) in 2003 France & Germany (Leipzig) in the World Cup Qualifications.

It was evaluated for service on 44 Yakovlev Yak-9K aircraft during World War II, but proved to stress the airframes too much. The NS-45 was also mounted on the prototype Tupolev Tu-1 night fighter after the end of World War II.  Design and development  The NS-45 was created as a result of a July 1943 decision of the State Defense Committee to arm Soviet fighters with 45 mm autocannons. As with the 37 mm autocannons already installed in some Soviet and lend-lease single-engine fighters, the intended method of installation of the 45 mm gun was to have its barrel pass through the engine block and the empty propeller shaft, in this case that of the Yak-9. Consequently, the main difficulty in designing the 45 mm autocannon was the limitation imposed by the engine blocks available for this aircraft. Accounting for the diameter of the 45 mm shell, the Yak-9 engine blocks only allowed a wall thickness of 4 mm for the new gun's barrel, which was almost half the thickness of the barrel wall of the NS-37. (Another source gives 55 mm as the diameter of opening in the engine reducer shaft, resulting in a wall thickness of 3.75 mm for the NS-45 barrel relative to 7.1 mm for the NS-37 barrel, both measured at this spot which was approximately 61 cm away from the muzzle.) The decision of the Defense Committee was followed by a short design competition between Soviet designs bureaus OKB-15 and OKB-16. The former proposed an enlarged version of their unreliable Shpitalny Sh-37; although they made a prototype that passed factory tests in a LaGG-3, their 45 mm gun was not accepted for state trials because of the known issues with the Sh-37 design. OKB-16 presented an enlarged version of their successful NS-37. The recoil force of the NS-45 peaked at seven tons, a force roughly 40% greater than that experienced with the NS-37 (about 5.5 tons). Consequently, the NS-45 was fitted with a muzzle brake‚Äîa first in Soviet aircraft-gun design.–®–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ—Ä–∞–¥ –ê.–ë.

(This projectile had a tracer that burned for eleven seconds and was fitted with the MG-8 contact fuse.) The total length of the new cartridge was limited to the same value as for the NS-37 ammunition‚Äî328mm. In order to accommodate the larger shell, the case body (brass) was necked up and also slightly reduced in length from 195 mm of the NS-37 ammunition to 185 mm. The resulting 45 mm cartridge weighted 1.93 kg, of which 1.065 kg was the weight of its shell. The muzzle velocity of the NS-45 was 780 m/s and its rate of fire was around 260‚Äì280 rounds per minute.  Production and service  The NS-45 was built in small numbers at Factory Number 74 in the last two years of the war; 75 exemplars were made in 1944 and 120 were made in 1945.  Yak-9K  This Yak-9T modified to take the NS-45 gun became the first Yak-9K prototype In fighters, the NS-45 gun was first installed on a modified Yak-9T, which was normally armed with a NS-37 gun. This aircraft, with constructor number 0121, effectively became the first Yak-9K prototype. The \\"K\\" suffix stood for \\"Krupnokalibernyi\\", meaning large caliber. The protruding barrel and muzzle brake of the NS-45 made the Yak-9K some 20 cm longer than the Yak-9T. The NS-45 was supplied with 29 rounds of ammunition in the Yak-9K, which were fed using a belt. The only other armament installed on the Yak-9K was a UBS (a propeller-synchronized 12.7 mm machine gun) supplied with 200 rounds of ammunition. The theoretical weight of fire of the Yak-9K was 5.53 kg/s (12.2 lb/s), which gave it a considerable advantage in this department relative to most single-engine German aircraft of the time except the \\"flying gun- batteries\\" such as the Fw 190A-6/R1 or the Bf 109G-6/R6. Compared to these, the Yak-9K maintained however good horizontal maneuverability because its wings were not loaded with armament. Developed in late 1943, the Yak-9K prototype was tested at the Central Research Institute of the Soviet Air Force (VVS NII) between January 12 and April 8, 1944. Between April and June 1944 a limited production run of the aircraft, with the cockpit pushed further to the back to improve the center of gravity, was manufactured at a plant in Novosibirsk and delivered for military trials to the 3rd Fighter Air Corps.Yefim Gordon and Dmitri Khazanov. Soviet Combat Aircraft of the Second World War, Volume One: Single-Engined Fighters. Earl Shilton, Leicester, UK: Midland Publishing Ltd., 1998. , pp. 146‚Äì147 For military (combat) trials 44 Yak-9Ks of this limited production run were used. These trials took place between 13 August and 18 September 1944 at the 3rd Belorussian Front, and from 15 January 1945 to 15 February 1945 at the 2nd Belorussian Front. The Soviet Air Forces units involved were the 274th Fighter Aviation Regiment (IAP) of the 278th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) and the 812nd IAP of the 65th IAD. Twelve German aircraft were claimed by Yak-9K fighters, with an average expenditure of ten rounds per target. Of these twelve German aircraft claimed by Yak-9K pilots, eight were Fw 190 and four were Bf 109G. Combat experience with the Yak-9K showed that although the NS-45 cannon proved deadly to enemy aircraft, realistically only its first shot could be aimed. A three-round burst, even when fired near the maximum airspeed of the Yak-9K, resulted in a noticeable loss of both airspeed and stability of the aircraft. Sometimes oil and water lines sprung leaks after the gun was fired. Firing the NS-45 at airspeeds below 350 km/h even shook the pilot back and forth as if in an automobile suddenly decelerating and accelerating. Another issue affecting the effectiveness of the Yak-9K was that it had a poorer power to weight ratio compared to its proximate predecessor, although this was mostly due to its larger fuel tanks rather than the weight of the armament; its fuel tanks had been enlarged from the 440-liter tanks of Yak-9T to 650-liter tanks, allowing it to carry an additional 153 kg of gasoline. The loss of airspeed relative to the Yak-9K was about 40 km/h at 5,000 m, and climbing to this altitude took about a minute longer with the Yak-9K. In an attempt to address this problem, some of the Yak-9K already in service were retrofitted with smaller 480-liter tanks. To compensate for the Yak-9K's poor maneuverability in the vertical plane, pilots of the 812th IAP developed tactics that essentially employed the aircraft as a heavy fighter, using it for surprise attacks on bombers, and providing it with an escort by nimbler Yak-3s flying top cover. Ultimately, it was decided that the Yak-9K would not go into mass production. Besides the reliability and airframe performance issues, another contributory reason was that the German bombers still active on the Eastern front at this point in the war were mainly Fw 190 Jabo, and the 45 mm shell was overkill for these. A total of 53 Yak-9Ks had been built by then.  Other aircraft  The NS-45 was also tried on an Ilyushin Il-2, with one gun mounted in each wing, but the design was not put into series production. On August 20, 1943, the People's Commissariat of Aviation Industry of the USSR ordered that an Il-2 be tested with the new 45 mm aircraft guns. An Il-2 exemplar fitted with the new guns had been manufactured by September 10, 1943, when it was sent to the VVS NII for trials. Due to various issues which arose integrating the NS-45 gun with this aircraft, testing was delayed until February 8, 1944. The results were disappointing; the Il-2-mounted NS-45s exhibited poor accuracy hitting tank- size targets and their recoil was almost twice what the Il-2's wings could safely handle (about 4000 tons-force).–í. –ü–µ—Ä–æ–≤, –û. –†–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–Ω, \\"–ò–ª-2 –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ —Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤\\", –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ. –í—á–µ—Ä–∞, —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è, –∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞ 2001/7, pp. 1‚Äì10 (info from page 10); the same text/information appears on pp. 86‚Äì87 in the larger monograph (100 pp.) by the same authors published in issue 2001/5-6 of –ê–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è –∏ –ö–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç–∏–∫–∞ One of the three versions of the prototype ground attack (shturmovik) Tu-2Sh was equipped with two NS-37s and two NS-45s as frontal armament.

They were part of a renaissance of Western Australian performing acts that developed during this period, in the wake of the international punk rock and new wave movements - in isolation from the mainstream rock industry in Australia. This unique local musical culture has not been well documented or fully appreciated by histories of Australian popular music, tending to emphasise the culture of the 'Eastern States' - a cultural dichotomy that still exists in Australia today. Perth was notable for having a vibrant musical scene that developed in isolation, being separated by many thousands of kilometres of desert from the other side of the continent - a geographical isolation that established a distinct cultural isolation and independence. This led to the development of a unique musical culture that modelled itself upon eclectic international musical influences, whilst developing a distinct sense of regional identity. Biography Early years (1985-1986) Love Pump was formed in 1985 by art-school friends Val Tarin (drums, vocals), Peter Morse (bass), Thomas Kayser (keyboards), Rodney Glick (rhythm guitar) and Fred Gilbert (vocals). In need of a lead singer and guitarist, Trevor Hilton (lead vocals and guitar) was invited to join - and soon became the principal songwriter of the group. The impulse behind the band was a set of common musical interests that ranged from experimental audio work to popular music parody. An earlier group, The Armchair (1984) had involved most of these performers - an avant-garde music sound performance group that used built and found instruments, along the lines of Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. Having recognised the limited audience for noise performance, despite a cult following, the members of the band decided to terminate the group. Love Pump was formed as an explicitly 1970s pop satire group - a postmodern parody of the musical culture prevalent at the time. Early Recordings (1985-1986) Love Pump released the audio cassette, Moist, in 1987, with cover art by the Western Australian painter Tom Alberts. The album was recorded at two local Perth studios in March and November 1986. In the 1990s, the original digital mix-down masters were found and the album remastered for CD. Because the tracks were originally mixed down onto a VHS tape using digital encoding, it enabled the new CD master to be much cleaner than the original 1/4\\" analog reels that originally became the final edited masters used for the cassette in the 1986. Love Pump played to large audiences at a variety of venues in Perth, building up a regular following, both as a headline act and as support to groups such as The Triffids. The members of the band were, and in many cases continue to be, involved in performance-related activities in Western Australia and in other parts of the world. The networked nature of the band was typical of the Perth music scene during this time, in which artists moved between bands and projects frequently and fruitfully. This feature of the Perth music scene is well documented in the 'Post-Punk to Post- Funk' family tree published in Party Fears 10 (Autumn, 1989) - which clearly delineates the movement of musicians between bands of the time, forming different ensembles and experimenting with a wide range of musical styles. Members of Love Pump were central to the wide variety of bands that formed around this period, including 'Rhythm Method', 'Hugo Au Go-Go', 'Floating Garden', 'The Armchair', 'The Waltons', 'Just Add Water' and 'German Humour', among many others. All of these bands made recordings on cassette, single or LP, as well as experimenting with the new medium of the independent rock music video clip. Love Pump dissolved in 1987, playing their last gig at the Shenton Park Hotel \\\\- having become tired of the 'parody' band label and later formed The Fat - a funk ensemble that performed between 1988‚Äì1993 Reformation (1991) Love Pump reformed in November 1991 to play a handful of shows in Fremantle and Perth.

He is also considered to be a forger of the work of his father, Han van Meegeren, a forger of old masters who became known for this. He was, however, less gifted and his forgeries adversely affected the reputation of his father's work. Life Youth Van Meegeren was born 26 August 1912 in the little village of Rijswijk, near The Hague, the Netherlands, four months after the marriage of his parents. His father was Han van Meegeren, who later became notorious as an art forger, while his mother was descended from an Indonesian royal family. In 1915, his sister Inez was born. Van Meegeren adored his father and loved being allowed to go to his father's studio and help him by cleaning brushes and such. When he grew older, his father took him along to art dealers and museums, teaching him how to observe and assess paintings and other works of art. He soon began to sketch and draw, and demonstrated that he had talent for it.  Stay in Indonesia  In 1923, his parents divorced. It is not certain whether Van Meegeren followed his mother to Paris at that time or remained in The Hague. It is known, however, that in 1927 he went with his mother and sister to Sumatra. They went to live there with his mother's family, who were directly related to the Sultan of Serdang. Van Meegeren attended the government HBS ‚Äì a high school ‚Äì in nearby Medan, traveling every day in a steam train. Choice of a profession In 1930, when Van Meegeren turned 18, he returned from the East Indies. His father was happy to see his son and took him to his many friends, fellow-artists of The Hague Art Circle, painters and actors. They visited theatres and restaurants; for Jacques van Meegeren, it was a joyful introduction to the high life of The Hague where his father spent money freely. Van Meegeren was warned by his father to not become an artist, as it was too uncertain a profession. Van Meegeren studied electrical engineering at the Sorbonne in Paris, though he continued to paint and draw as his father had done in his youth. Paris Student years From 1931, Van Meegeren studied in Paris. He lived in an attractive studio on Boulevard Raspail and enjoyed an ample allowance from his father. Van Meegeren received a letter from his cousins, the Prince Royal of Serdang and the Prince Royal of Deli, Sumatra. They came to visit the Colonial Exhibition in Paris that featured exotic temples and pavilions, with the Balinese-style pavilion of the Dutch East Indies being the finest of all. The princes asked Van Meegeren to make up their daily program. During the day they had to pay official visits, but after these they changed into street clothing and their jewels were hidden in the hotel safe, but they still wore their velvet topies (Indonesian caps). In all the Parisian nightclubs the group frequented, Van Meegeren was seen as a kind of leader. The most attractive Parisian and foreign \\"vedettes\\" were nightly in their company. The famous French actress Mistinguett was besotted with the Prince Royal of Deli and followed him everywhere. The partying lasted a month. Relationship with his father After his studies ended, Van Meegeren worked for a period in the electro-technical industry, but a regular lifestyle did not suit him. He became a journalist and illustrator, and worked for Parisian magazines, while continuing to receive an allowance from his father. Van Meegeren paid incidental visits to his father who lived at that time in Roquebrune, Southern France. In 1938, his father suggested that Van Meegeren should visit the exhibition of paintings of the Dutch Golden Age in Rotterdam, and have a special look at the newly discovered Supper at Emmaus by Vermeer. When his father later asked Van Meegeren about the impression the picture had made on him, Van Meegeren replied: His father did not speak another word and Van Meegeren kept his father's secret. They did not discuss the matter again until 1945, when the fake came to light. Marriage On 22 September 1938, Van Meegeren married Lucienne Combey, a girl from Annecy near the Swiss border. Opposition by the family ‚Äì especially by her father ‚Äì was severe, but the couple persevered. They went to live in Paris at a better address than a starting journalist could afford, helped by his father, who had already earned much from his forgeries. In 1939, their daughter Mich√®le was born; and in 1942, their daughter Chantal.Personal Card J.H. van Meegeren, Institute Genealogy The Hague During World War II, the couple lived in Paris until 1940. Van Meegeren traveled between Paris and the Netherlands which was remarkable during wartime. He also had a home in Amsterdam. Around the end of the war, Lucienne and their two children went to live with her parents in Annecy, as food had become scarce in Paris. After the war, Van Meegeren traveled to the Netherlands to help his father, who had been arrested for his fraud with the Supper at Emmaus and other fake Masters. Van Meegeren didn't unite with his family in Annecy and had no money to help them out. He only wrote letters with vague plans and futile promises for money. In a sense he abandoned his family. After a while, Lucienne got tired of his promises and went her own way. She refused to divorce Van Meegeren, which later prevented him from marrying another woman. A new career Amsterdam From 1946, Van Meegeren lived in Amsterdam in the house at the Amstel-quay, where he was registered since 1940. His father, however, didn't need much help; on the contrary, he helped his son to become a painter. When Han taught his son to paint portraits, he was a stern tutor, making him start over at any flaw. Han used to say: \\"What you have done once, you will do better next time.\\" Van Meegeren became a capable portraitist and his father's best pupil. Van Meegeren's goal was to render the underlying character of a model in his paintings, particularly when children were concerned. After two years waiting, his father's trial began in October 1947. Jacques van Meegeren attended the trial, as did as his sister Inez. It was an emotional experience for him. In the end, his father was sentenced to one year in prison, but soon after the verdict was delivered the elder van Meegeren fell ill and was admitted to a private clinic in Amsterdam, where he died. Van Meegeren made a drawing of his father lying in state in his home in Amsterdam, and delivered a brief eulogy at the funeral, ending with: \\"Too many young artists think that skillful drawing and command of painting techniques are no longer necessary to become an honest artist. They would do well to take an example from my father.\\" As so often had happened with Han van Meegeren's words, this statement of his son was wrongly interpreted by one of the Netherlands' newspapers: \\"Museum directors take care! The son of Han van Meegeren has said that artists today should use his father as an example.\\" Van Meegeren continued to paint and became successful. He received commissions for portraits all over the country and had exhibitions in several towns. He also went to Paris and worked as a scenery painter with the American Theatre and lead a bohemian life. In 1954, he met his estranged wife for the last time in Annecy, and made a portrait of his eldest daughter (age 15) but there followed no reconciliation. France Van Meegeren continued to live and work in Amsterdam and met his second partner in life: Juliette Ledel. In 1957, he traveled with her to Nice where he sold his father's villa. They bought a house in nearby Laghet, and settled there. Van Meegeren worked as a painter and portraitist and they both mixed with the local population and started to play p√©tanque, the popular sport of Southern France.Riviera Gazette, Nice, 16 December 1959 One of the commissions Van Meegeren obtained was the creation of a painted War Memorial, of which he was very proud. In 1959, the couple invested all their money and energy in a private exhibition of Jacques van Meegeren's work in Nice. However, a few days before the opening of the exhibition, Nice was flooded. No public came and no publicity was obtained; Van Meegeren suffered a mental depression which lasted several months. Netherlands again In 1962, Van Meegeren and Ledel returned to the Netherlands without any money. They were lured to Amsterdam by a plan for a Hollywood movie about his father.Dagblad De Tijd, 5 December 1962 Van Meegeren was invited to take part in it and to consult the crew about the details of his father's life. However, the project was dropped and no movie was made. The couple was left without money, always changing their address and living in poorer circumstances. Desperate for money, Van Meegeren started to paint and sell pictures with his father's signature which fetched far better prizes than his own work.Holland Herald, Volume 10, number 6, (1975) p. 26 In the last year of his life he met a nurse ‚Äì a Mrs. Van de Biggelaar ‚Äì who had known him as a boy. He told her the story of his life and confessed that he had abandoned his wife and children. He also admitted that he had made fake pictures with the signature of his father. A year later, in 1977, Jacques van Meegeren died, a poor and lonely man. Juliette Ledel was no longer with him, it is not known whether she had left him, or had died. His funeral was organized by a remote Indonesian cousin who happened to live in the Netherlands. Fake Van Meegerens Jacques van Meegeren was not the only one who faked his father's work. After Han van Meegeren had become famous, his work rose in price and it became worthwhile to fake his paintings. Many existing mediocre paintings got a signature \\"H. van Meegeren\\" and new pictures were made in his style. Among these fakes, the imitations by Jacques van Meegeren are the most difficult to distinguish, as he painted in a style that was akin to his father's and was also able to produce a perfect fake signature. He sometimes authenticated their provenance by writing a certificate. An interesting case in this respect is the collection of Mr. Carlos de Couto, the Brazilian vice-Consul in Amsterdam. He bought pictures directly from Han van Meegeren and also gave him a commission to paint a portrait of his wife. These pictures were entirely authentic Van Meegerens. He also bought some Van Meegerens at auctions which might have been authentic as well. However, he later often lent money to Jacques van Meegeren who paid him back in pictures by \\"Han van Meegeren\\". There are good reasons to assume that many of these were made by Jacques van Meegeren and signed with an \\"authentic signature\\". The present owner of the collection is now left with the question which of these pictures are authentic and which are fakes. The fake \\"Van Meegerens\\" made by Jacques van Meegeren and others are usually of low quality. They are, however, not always recognized as such and have thus adversely affected the reputation of Han van Meegeren's work.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was led by the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic and a number of deputies. However, the Foreign Minister had less actual influence over the foreign policy than the central committee secretary for foreign policy in the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. As a de facto subordinate position, the Foreign Minister could be a member of some of the block parties in the GDR. The West German counterpart was the Federal Foreign Office, that still exists as the current German foreign ministry, and considers itself to be the direct continuation of the Foreign Office that was established in 1870 in the North German Confederation.

The ancient Greek word ' comes from the verb (, \\"I sing\\") which is also the root of (, \\"ode\\") and of (, \\"singer\\"). Description In a general way, the construction of an odeon was similar to that of an ancient Greek theatre and Roman theatre, but it was only a quarter of the size and was provided with a roof for acoustic purposes, a characteristic difference. The prototype odeon was the Odeon of Pericles (Odeon of Athens), a mainly wooden building by the southern slope of the Acropolis of Athens. It was described by Plutarch as 'many-seated and many- columned' and may have been square, though excavations have also suggested a different shape, 208 x 62 feet. It was said to be decorated with the masts and spars of ships captured from the Persians. It was rebuilt by king Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia after its destruction by fire in the First Mithridatic War in 87‚Äì86 BC. Examples The oldest known odeon in Greece was the Skias at Sparta, so-called from its resemblance to the top of an umbrella, said to have been erected by Theodorus of Samos (600 B.C.). In Athens, an odeon near the spring Enneacrunus on the Ilissus was referred to the age of Peisistratus and appears to have been rebuilt or restored by Lycurgus (c. 330 B.C.). This is probably the building which, according to Aristophanes, Wasps, 1109. was used for judicial purposes, for the distribution of corn, and even for the billeting of soldiers. Also in Athens, the Odeon of Agrippa was a large odeon located in the centre of the Ancient Agora of Athens. The most magnificent odeon was the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on the Southwest cliff of the Acropolis at Athens. It was built in about 160 A.D. by the wealthy sophist and rhetorician Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, and considerable remains of the odeon still exist. It had accommodation for 4500‚Äì5500 persons, and the ceiling was constructed of beautifully carved beams of cedarwood, probably with an open space in the center to admit the light. It was also profusely decorated with pictures and other works of art. Similar buildings also existed in other parts of Greece: at Corinth, also the gift of Herodes Atticus; at Patrae, where there was a famous statue of Apollo; at Smyrna, Tralles, and other towns in Asia Minor. The first odeon in Rome was built by Domitian (Odeon of Domitian), a second by Trajan. The Odeon of Philippopolis (present day Plovdiv), with 300‚Äì350 seats, https://plovdivbg.info/objects/antique- odeon/?lang=en and the Odeon of Lyon are another examples.

It was first serialized in The Spirit and later collected into a single volume. Plot An artificial radio signal from Barnard's Star listing prime numbers (although the term \\"prime\\" is never used in the story) is received at the Mesa Radio Astronomy Observatory. One of the radio-astronomers is a Russian spy and tries to inform his superiors; however he is uncovered by his fellows and subsequently killed. The CIA hires James Bludd, a prominent astrophysicist, to try to understand what is going on. Several plotlines follow and intertwine, most of them centering on personal greed. News of the extraterrestrial message leaks to the outside world, with different consequences. A bum and a waitress build a cult, calling themselves the Star People, which seeks to find a new home on the Barnard's planet. Multinational, a corporation, decides to invest money into the cult, in order to have an easy to manipulate spaceship crew ready to take possession of the inhabited planet on behalf of the company. A dying biologist, Dr.Crowben, decides to push on the creation of plant-human hybrids biologically suited to the planet environment, which also falls within the scope of Multinational's plan. Meanwhile, the two surviving astrophysicists have been abducted by the KGB, and Bludd learns that Russians plan to answer to the signal using neutrinos. The international situation further complicates when a small fictional African state, Sidiami, burdened by debts with other countries, decides to \\"secede from planet Earth\\" and declares itself a colony of the planet around Barnard. The \\"Star People\\" decide to relocate in Sidiami, and the Multinational starts plans to launch a probe towards the Barnard's planet from there. James Bludd finds himself implicated in the ongoing struggle between the USA, the Multinational and the \\"Star People\\" to get advantage of the situation. At the end, the space probe is launched towards the Barnard's planet. Bludd, convinced that humankind is not ready for contact with aliens, has sabotaged it and after a while makes it explode with the aid of a remote control. When later, in the observatory, a new possible artificial extraterrestrial signal is received from space, Bludd destroys all evidence of it with a smile. Publication history The story was first published in serial form, under the overall title Life On Another Planet, as eight black and white 16-page chapters appearing in the Kitchen Sink Press Spirit Magazine from issue #19 (October 1978) to issue #26 (December 1980). It was originally collected in colour in 1983 under the title Signal From Space and later republished in black and white, with its original title, by various companies. Collected editions It was originally collected as a color hardcover by Kitchen Sink Press as Signal From Space (November 1983, ) and then later as a black and white softcover, titled Life on Another Planet, by various companies including Kitchen Sink (December 1996, ), DC Comics' Will Eisner Library (June 2000, ) and W. W. Norton & Company (September 2009, ) Themes Life on Another Planet has been called by James Morrow, \\"a kind of science fictional Bonfire of the Vanities.\\" The overall tone is pessimistic, the whole plot turning around the greed of the various characters and the struggle between their conflicting interests. Despite the title, the novel is indeed thin on science fiction, the signal from space being more of a MacGuffin to ignite the story. Eisner himself declared that he has never been enthusiastic about science fiction, but \\"wanted to prove that it could work as a graphic novel.\\" Notes External links   * Category:1978 comics debuts Category:1983 graphic novels Category:Science fiction comics Category:Barnard's Star in fiction Category:Comics by Will Eisner ","title":"Life on Another Planet"},{"id":"24652860","text":"Chai Rachel Feldblum (born April 1959)Professor of Pride: Georgetown Law's Nan Hunter wields academic activism, November 27, 2008.

Characters  Ugo Ugo is the opening character of the novel, and we learn about his involvement in crime when he arrives back in Marseilles to avenge the murder of childhood friend Manu. He stays with Lole, a love interest who Manu was also interested in. Manu Manu is already deceased at the beginning of the novel, and the story follows Fabio, a policeman as he avenges his two friends. He was involved romantically with Lole.

Griffith based upon a comedy of manners play of the same name by Philip Barry. The film stars Leslie Howard, Ann Harding, Myrna Loy, William Gargan, Ilka Chase, and Neil Hamilton. Howard, Gargan, and Chase also starred in the play when it opened on Broadway on 12 January 1932. It was remade 1946 as One More Tomorrow.  Plot  Leni Stengel, with Don Dillaway and Ann Harding in The Animal Kingdom (1932) Tom Collier (Leslie Howard) owns a small press that publishes deluxe books. He has been living in the city with his best friend and lover Daisy Sage (Ann Harding) without being married. Daisy is a successful commercial artist for a fashion magazine. She has just returned from three months in Paris. While Daisy was away, Tom has fallen in love with Cecelia Henry (Myrna Loy). Tom's wealthy banker father, Rufus Collier (Henry Stephenson), describes his lifelong frustration with his son to Cecelia and Owen Fiske (Neil Hamilton), a family friend and attorney. Tom has had every advantage, including education at both Harvard and Oxford, and a position at the bank, yet he is an idler and his friends are uncouth. His father is now afraid that Tom might actually marry Daisy. Cecelia reassures him on that score: She is going to marry Tom in June. Owen is surprised and crushed‚Äîhe thought that she loved him‚Äîbut Tom's father doesn't notice and approves wholeheartedly. Tom tells Daisy of his impending marriage. He assures her that nothing between them need change, but Daisy grows angry and sends him away, saying \\"Good-Bye...‚Äôtil Doomsday\\". Soon, Cecelia has persuaded Tom to publish a book that is \\"the worst tripe\\" that his press has ever published, but it sells wonderfully. She talks him into publishing bad books that will make money and getting rid of his old friends, including \\"Red\\", his prize-fighter friend and butler. She wants Tom to sell his publishing company, live in the city with his father as a \\"proper gentleman\\" and take their place in society, a prospect that Tom has been resisting all his life. Daisy tries to stay away, but she and Tom's Bohemian friends can't believe he's happy. She loves him deeply and wants to have children with him, but cares most about his well- being. Tom complains that he's losing his soul and integrity. Finally, when Cecelia offers Tom champagne to toast selling his publishing company and moving in with his father, Tom realizes that Cecelia's bedroom suite reminds him of a brothel he used to visit, as he says, \\"in vino veritas\\". When Red tells Tom he is going back to the city, that he can't stomach being at that house any longer, Tom insists on driving him to the station, saying, \\"I'm going back to my wife\\", referring to Daisy. As he leaves, he signs over to Cecelia a large birthday check from his father, and puts it on the mantle, just as he used to leave money for the girls in the bordello.

Although the play emphasizes the estrangement between Tom and his father, who has never visited his son's house, before; and that Owen, his one \\"respectable gentleman\\" friend, introduced Cecelia to Tom. These two elements are not as significant in the film Development Although RKO originally purchased the film rights to The Animal Kingdom as a vehicle for Ann Harding, Irene Dunne was substituted when scheduling conflicts arose with Harding. In an ironic twist, when filming of Smilin' Through did not finish on time and MGM refused to release Leslie Howard to RKO to begin filming The Animal Kingdom at the scheduled time, RKO realized Ann Harding would now be available and reassigned her to the r√¥le.Hall, C. \\"Glimmerings from the Cinema Citadel.\\" The New York Times, May 1, 1932.

The five municipalities in the valley (M√∂hlin, Zeiningen, Zuzgen, Hellikon and Wegenstetten) have a total population of around 14,000 people. The upper part of the valley is also known as the \\"Wegenstettertal\\". This name was particularly used by associations and groups related to the upper M√∂hlintal municipalities. In Habsburg times the area was known as Landschaft (territory) M√∂hlinbach. The valley was also sometimes known as the \\"Chl√§fflital\\". The official name of the valley given by Canton Aargau is \\"M√∂hlintal\\". Location and description The valley lies in the North Eastern Tabel Jura, part of the Swiss Jura Mountains which are distinct from the Faltenjura because the strata are not folded. The M√∂hlintal runs in a practically straight line from Southeast to Northwest, surrounded by high table plateaux through which the valley cuts. The M√∂hlinbach flows from its source at the top of the valley between the municipalities of Wegenstetten and Hemmiken (at a height of 520m), through the valley to join the Rein near M√∂hlin (at 280m). Like most other Jura valleys in the Fricktal region, the M√∂hlintal has a relatively narrow valley floor. Because of its climatic circumstances, the valley experiences up to 40 days more sunshine than the Swiss Plateau and is mostly fog-free. On 5 August 2003 the private weather service Meteomedia recorded a temperature of 40.3 ¬∞C in M√∂hlin, a record for Switzerland. Thanks to the relatively mild climate and also the wind shielded location, the M√∂hlintal is suitable for vineyards. On the south side of the Zeinigerberges near Zeiningen the Sp√§tburgunder (Zeininger Pinot Noir, red wine) and M√ºller-Thurgau (Zeininger Riesling x Sylvaner, white wine) vineyards are located. On the valley floor, sides and flat hill summits intensive farming is performed. Particularly important for the M√∂hlintal is the production of Kirsch from cherries. The \\"Chriesiberg\\" near Zuzgen derives its name from the cherry trees that stand on its plateau. \\"Fricktaler Kirsch\\" is a widely known product. On the Northeastern side of the valley lies the Looberg- Wabrig-Hersberg high plateau that is bordered on the other side by the parallel running Fischingertal. On this high plateau the Fricktal-Schupfart Aerodrome is located where each year the Schupfart Festival is held. The small winter sports area of F√∂hrlimatt in Wegenstetten lies on the west flank of the Tiersteinberg has one ski lift and attracts high numbers of visitors from the region through the winter season.

The Landschaft M√∂hlinbach encompassed the villages of Hellikon, Kaiseraugst, Magden, M√∂hlin, Mumpf, Olsberg, Wallbach, Wegenstetten, Zeiningen and Zuzgen. The villagers of the Landschaft M√∂hlinbach were the trigger for the Rappenkkrieg. Population The M√∂hlintal shows a religious anomaly: Mohlin has the highest Swiss-wide population of Christ Catholics (around 1,000) and Hellikon has the highest proportion of Christ Catholics (around 20%). Christ Catholic churches and/or chapels are found in Hellikon, M√∂hlin and Zuzgen. Transport The M√∂hlintal can be travelled in half an hour using the PostAuto Nordschweiz line 89 (M√∂hlin - Wegenstetten). In Wegenstetten the bus line 101 (Gelterkinden‚ÄìHemmiken‚ÄìWegenstetten) terminates, connecting the M√∂hlintal with the neighbouring Canton Basel Land. An infrequent bus route also connects Wegenstetten with the Fischingertal (via Fricktal-Schupfart Aerodrome). M√∂hlin railway station stands on the Basel-Z√ºrich line. The station is served by the S1 route of the Regio S-Bahn Basel that runs from Mulhouse in France, through Basel and terminates in either Frick or Laufenburg. The A3 motorway crosses the M√∂hlintal on a viaduct at Zeiningen. The nearest interchanges are located at Rheinfelden (around 3 km West of M√∂hlin) or Eiken (around 7 km Northeast from Wegenstetten). Along the high plateau between M√∂hlintal and Fischingertal runs part of the Fricktaler H√∂henweg, a regional walking route.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 8, 2009. In the episode, Ann takes Leslie to dinner to help prepare for her first date, while the rest of the parks department tries to learn secrets about each other as part of a game. The episode was written by Harris Wittels and directed by Alex Hardcastle. It featured stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in his third guest appearance as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer who develops a romantic interest in Leslie. The episode also featured a fictional sex scandal mirroring the real-life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford. \\"Practice Date\\" was the first episode to establish the personality of Jerry as the co-worker everyone else in the office picks on, and marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as news reporter Perd Hapley. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 4.97 million household viewers, an improvement over the previous week's episode, \\"Beauty Pageant\\". \\"Practice Date\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising it for fleshing out the characters of Ron and Tom.  Plot  The episode opens with Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the rest of the Parks department watching media coverage of Pawnee Councilman Bill Dexhart (Kevin Symons), a married man, admitting to having four-way sex in a Brazilian cave while pretending to be \\"building houses for the underprivileged\\". He tries to justify it by saying that it was his birthday on the day of the foursome, and that he \\"...really wanted to do it.\\" Tom (Aziz Ansari) insists nobody could find any scandalous information about him, prompting the parks department employees to start a game to see who can get the most dirt on each other. Meanwhile, Leslie tells Ann (Rashida Jones) she is nervous about her first date with Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.). Ann offers to take Leslie on a practice date to help Leslie prepare for the real date. During the practice date, Ann realizes that Leslie has a serious problem: Leslie brought note cards with \\"topics of conversation\\" and engages in fake-sounding \\"practice laughing.\\" Ann decides to use exposure therapy on Leslie to help her deal with the worst-case date scenario. She acts very mean to Leslie, who is initially horrified, but she eventually stands up to Ann. When Ann tells her she is now ready for anything, Leslie feels cheered up and very confident. They go to a bar later to celebrate, where Leslie gets very drunk. After leaving Ann, she visits Dave's house to tell him that she was nervous about their upcoming date, but now realizes he is lucky to have her because of how \\"awesome\\" she is. A seemingly annoyed Dave brings Leslie home. The next day, Leslie feels horrible for ruining her chances with Dave. He arrives at her office later and she starts to apologize, but he says she can make it up to them on their second date, thereby reassuring her the first date is already over. Leslie once again feels cheered up. Meanwhile, during the office game, Mark (Paul Schneider) announces Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession. A distraught Jerry said he did not know he was adopted, making Mark feel terribly guilty. Later, Ron (Nick Offerman) declares himself the winner when he tells Tom he knows Tom's marriage to Wendy (Jama Williamson) is a green card marriage to prevent her from being deported to Canada. A desperate Tom turns to Mark for help in finding dirt on Ron, and Mark suggests Tom visit an out-of-town bar and speak to Ron's old friend Duke Silver. Tom visits the bar and learns Duke Silver is actually the alter ego of Ron himself, who secretly plays saxophone in a jazz club. Tom confronts Ron, who immediately calls a truce to the game to prevent his secret from getting out (in the Pilot episode, Mark \\"cashes in\\" a favor Ron owes him, probably that). After watching more footage of Dexhart, Mark decides he wants Ann to learn all his own dark secrets from him. He visits her late at night and tells him about an affair he had with a married woman at age 16, among other secrets. Although initially confused, Ann is ultimately flattered by the gesture. April (Aubrey Plaza), disappointed nobody found dirt on her, announces she drove a lawnmower through a Nordstrom department store. Production real-life scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford. \\"Practice Date\\" was written by Harris Wittels and directed by Alex Hardcastle. The episode featured stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in his third guest performance as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer romantically involved with Leslie. Kevin Symons also appeared as Pawnee Councilman Bill Dexhart. The sex scandal involving Dexhart mirrored the real-life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who publicly admitted to a long-time extramarital affair with an Argentinian woman. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived the idea for Ron Swanson's jazz musician alter ego before they learned Nick Offerman actually played the saxophone in real life, and had for his entire life. Offerman praised the decision: \\"When he came to me and said, 'You're going to have an alter ego who plays jazz saxophone,' I go, 'How do you see inside me?'\\" After the episode broadcast, NBC created an official \\"Duke Silver\\" website, which included a biography, discography, reviews, gallery, tour schedule and booking information for the fictional band. \\"Practice Date\\" marked a turning point for the character Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and \\"figured we'd work it out later\\". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after \\"Practice Date\\", \\"We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is asking for it all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. \\"Practice Date\\" marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, three deleted scenes from \\"Practice Date\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. The first clip features approximately two minutes of extended scenes, including Leslie talking about her anxiety about the date, Ann offering her advice, a drunk Leslie complaining about the heat in Dave's apartment, which he secretly tells the camera is \\"freezing cold right now\\". The second 75-second clip features more of Pawnee City Councilman Bill Dexhart's press conference about the sex scandal. Dexhart refuses to promise he will not continue his transgressions, which he insists is a sign he is no longer lying to Pawnee residents. Reporters also discuss Dexhart's credit card bills, which include purchases Dong-O-Rama Sex Toy Company, Smut Doctors and a product called \\"vibrating raisins\\". In the third 75-second clip, Ron discusses in detail his \\"scientifically perfect ten-point scale of human beauty\\", the criteria for which he admits is \\"extremely misogynistic\\". It also included more footage of Ron's Duke Silver persona, along with interviews by older women who fantasize about him. Cultural references Leslie worries she will bring up the genocide in the Sudanese country Darfur too much, or not enough, during her first date with Dave. While describing his scale of the attractiveness of women, Ron says tennis star Steffi Graf is a \\"perfect ten\\". Ron believes Tom is wearing the robes of the Taliban, a Sunni Islamist political movement, in a photo he finds for the contest. The photo is actually of Tom wearing a Halloween costume of a Jedi from the Star Wars universe. Tom learns African American co-worker Donna donated money to David Duke, a white nationalist involved in the Ku Klux Klan, because \\"he promised to lower taxes\\". Reception In its original American broadcast on October 8, 2009, \\"Practice Date\\" was seen by 4.97 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 2.2 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. It was an improvement over the previous two episodes, which drew 4.22 million household viewers and 4.63 million household viewers, respectively. The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising it for fleshing out more information about the supporting cast, such at Ron's jazz singer persona and the back story behind Tom's marriage and chronic flirting. In an article reflecting on the show's second season, Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner dubbed \\"Practice Date\\" the episode in which Parks and Recreation \\"truly hit its stride\\". In particular, he called the background-check game \\"a funny, economical way to bring them more vividly to life\\", and said the green card marriage subplot \\"at once punctured (Tom's) slimy fa√ßade and deepened our sympathies for him\\". Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog called \\"Practice Date\\" \\"the most satisfying comedy of the week\\", even compared to the wedding of Jim and Pam on The Office and a Seinfeld reunion on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Fog said the episode \\"managed to be sweet and sharp and absolutely hilarious\\" at once, and praised Poehler's improvising and Ron's jazz singer persona, but he said Mark's appearance at Ann's house to confess his life's sins was the episode's \\"weak spot\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode was \\"completely satisfying - funny when it needed to be, sweet when it wanted to be\\". Sepinwall said Jones was particularly funny during the fake date, as well as the \\"constant one-upsmanship\\" between Ron and Tom. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had a \\"winning formula\\". He particularly praised Jones during the practice date, as well as Jerry's role during the contest, which Fowler said was a good way to allow the supporting cast to work together. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said it seemed like the episode \\"took everything they were warming up to over the last few weeks, and hit them hard\\". Heisler particularly praised Poehler's performance, as well as the interactions between Ron and Tom. In contrast, however, A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said \\"Practice Date\\" \\"was the first time all year I felt like P&R; wasn't firing on all cylinders\\". DVD release \\"Practice Date\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.
