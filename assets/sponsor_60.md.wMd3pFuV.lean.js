She has created chemical paintings that change with the atmosphere, erosion sculptures of salt, stone sculptures that weather, and, worked with crystals that receive radio transmissions from weather stations, local and short wave, along with radio telescope signals from Jupiter. Four mid-career exhibitions include: 1984 Syracuse University, Utica; New York; 1998, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; 2003, The City University of New York, with the publication of Dove Bradshaw, Nature, Change and Indeterminacy, text by Thomas McEvilley and A Conversation, John Cage and Thomas McEvilley; 2008, Pierre Menard Gallery, Cambridge, MA, with catalogue. Represented in the permanent collections of numerous American (Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery), European (The British Museum) and Russian (Russian State Museum , Marble Palace). Exhibiting regularly internationally, she was included in the Gwangju Biennale, South Korea and a solo exhibition in Tokyo. Education, residencies A graduate from the College of General Studies, Boston University, Bradshaw received a BFA from the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts and Tufts University. She has had residencies at the Pier Art Centre, Orkney, Scotland, 1995; Sirius Art Center, Cobh Ireland, 2000; the Statens Vaerksteder for Kunst, Copenhagen, 2000-2001; Niels Borch Jensen Printmaking Studio, Copenhagen, 2000, 2005, 2008; Beuys in difesa della natura.pdf Difesa Della Natura, Bolognano, Italy, 2006; the Spirit of Discovery 1 and 2 in Trancoso, Portugal, 2006, 2007; and The School of Contemporary Art, Pont-Aven, France, 2007. Indeterminacy Taking inspiration from the work of composer John Cage, Bradshaw allows natural forces to act upon her works. Her first work in this regard was a 1969 installation entitled Plain Air,‚Äù in which a pair of mourning doves were introduced to hanging bicycle wheels and floor mounted targets. Other ways in which her work has incorporated indeterminacy into its nature are the chance positioning of work, the use of materials particularly susceptible to weather and indoor atmosphere, the gradual erosion by water of salt and stone, and the use of inherently unstable substance such as acetone, mercury and sulfur. One of her noteworthy and ongoing indeterminate works is Performance. In 1976 Bradshaw ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù a fire hose in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She mounted a guerrilla wall label beside the hose, and placed copies of a self-published postcard in the museum shop. In recognition of her claim, an official museum postcard was issued of the work in 1992, and in 2006, Dadaist collector Rosalind Jacobs acquired the label placed by Bradshaw. Mrs. Jacobs donated this piece to the Metropolitan Museum, who accepted the piece as part of their permanent collection in 2007. Bradshaw‚Äôs equally early fusion of scientific exploration with art practice has been broadly incorporated into the Process and Art/Science Movements. In this vein she made the chemically activated silver Contincency Paintings that are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. Weather serves as a catalyst slowly capturing transient metamorphoses in what she calls Time Sculptures in marble, pyrite, calcstone, and copper, in the Indeterminacy, Material/Immaterial and Notation Series. In the Negative Ions, Six Continents and Waterstones works Bradshaw plots the gradual erosion of salt and stone with water as the transformative agent. Time is the counterpoint. She has said ‚ÄúPoetry is everywhere evident and therefore one only need present materials.‚Äù Three retrospectives and public collections In 1984 an early survey ‚Äì Works 1969‚Äì1984 - was shown at Syracuse University, Utica, New York. Bradshaw has had three mid-career exhibitions, beginning in 1998 with Dove Bradshaw 1988‚Äì1998 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Dove Bradshaw, Formformlessness, 1969‚Äì2003 at City University of New York; and Time Matters 1969‚Äì2008 at the Pierre Menard Gallery, Cambridge, MA. She is represented in the permanent collections of numerous museums in America and Europe, including one in Russia. She also regularly exhibits internationally. Commissions In June 2006 Bradshaw was commissioned by the Baronessa Lucrezia Durini to execute Radio Rocks as a permanent installation in Bologna. Galena and pyrite tuners continuously draw local, short wave and outer space signals echoing the Big Bang. In May 2008, Larry Becker Contemporary Art in Philadelphia will host the first gallery installation, which will add a live reception from radio telescope of storms and other radio emissions from the planets. In the fall of 2006 sponsored by Shu Uemura of Shu Uemura Cosmetics, she traveled to the Asia for the first time exhibiting in Tokyo‚Äôs Gallery 360¬∞. For the 6th Gwangju Biennale in South Korea she presented Six Continents, with salt taken from each of the continents. Important recent exhibitions Recently she was included in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum‚Äôs American Artists Contemplate Asia, 1860‚Äì1989, a solo exhibition at Senzatitolo Associazione Culturale, Rome, inclusion in Elements at The Chemical Heritage Museum, Philadelphia for The Year of Chemistry 2011.

The doves were given free rein of the artist‚Äôs studio. A bicycle wheel was hung for a perch, with an adaptation of a Zen archer‚Äôs target nailed to the floor below. The material trace of the work lay in photographs and 1969 bronze and silver casts of broken eggshells. The first exhibition was at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts, 1969, twenty years later it opened at the Sandra Gering in New York, 1989, then at the Mattress Factory Museum, Pittsburgh, 1990, and PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York, 1991. This was the artist‚Äôs first sound sculpture‚Äîmost apparent in the PS1 exhibition. Every day, after eating and preening, one of four birds flew to each corner room-support near the ceiling. Beginning with out-of-phase rounds they gradually came into sync after three-quarters of an hour, winding their song into a hypnotic crescendo nearing the hour. A pause followed, then softly they would start again, and repeated this pattern many times. Contingency (1984) The Contingency Series is Bradshaw‚Äôs first significant body of two-dimensional work. Beginning in 1984, instead of paint she began using materials reactive to the environment. Silver, which itself is subject to air, light and humidity, became the ground; liver of sulfur the chemical agent; and metal plates, wood, paper, linen, and the wall itself the various supports. The works range in size from a three and a half inch leaf on paper to paintings five feet in height and width. The appearance and composition of these works changes over time as reactions between the materials and environment occur. The amount of chemicals used in each piece significantly affects the outcome. Black comes up faster if the solution is dense, yet if it pools, an ashy white appears, flaking at its edges. Fire seems to be the reference. With rain the works sweat‚Äî-drip lines become visible pouring from denser pools. Silver and sulfur, alchemical elements, are used because they are highly volatile. As the artist explains, the process itself could be related to photography: the silver to the emulsion, the liver of sulfur to the developer. Although without using fixer, the exposure is open-ended. Guilty Marks (1990) These paintings deal with themes of perishability and change. They consist of various chemicals, powdered pigments, ink, and varnish poured and dripped on the canvas. As a Danish reviewer wrote, ‚ÄúWhat the elements will do to one another only time will tell. The fusion between the materials is the essential - [like] the fusion between culture and nature. Bradshaw facilitates it, but after that, the work is out of her hands. It is nature that takes over.\\" Passion, Notation, Indeterminacy, Material/Immaterial: outdoor sculptures (beginning 1993) After Bradshaw‚Äôs environmentally reactive works which were the two-dimensional Contingency Series, she searched for a way to make sculptures that would be similarly reactive, but would also change shape. The first work was a relief, a wall-embedded copper bar titled Passion. It was treated with acetic acid, which left a running stain down the wall. The first outdoor version (1995) was set in the exterior wall of the Pier Art Center, Stromness, Orkney, Scotland. The island atmosphere greatly assisted a natural bleed. Notation (1993) The Notation sculptures consist of copper or bronze cubes or prisms set on marble or limestone and left outdoors to weather. Smaller indoor versions were assisted with ammonium chloride copper sulfate to prompt a bleed. Indeterminacy (1995) The Indeterminacy Stones, begun in 1994, consisted of a chunk of pyrite, set atop a piece of marble, and then left outdoors to weather. The pyrite transformed into limonite when exposed to the elements, leaving a permanent iron rust stain. It may take less than ten years or over a century to dissolve depending on composition and environment. For the first exhibition of these works at Sandra Gering Gallery, New York, 1995, three boulders were gathered‚Äîone flat, one vertical, one wedge-shaped. Ann Barclay Morgan, writing about work in Sculpture Magazine, commented ‚Äú‚Ä¶the action of ‚Äúbleeding‚Äù‚Ä¶could be seen as the female life-force in the process of being released. The transformation into the deep-colored limonite lends a sensuous quality to the marble....Bradshaw‚Äôs use of Vermont marble [also] had intriguing implications. This material appears to embody a freeing from the confining notion of purity, emblematic of Carrara marble, toward the reality of life suggested by the veining of the marble itself, calling to mind the arteries of the human body that become more visible with age.‚Äù Material/Immaterial (2000) The Material/Immaterial Stones, made in Denmark, coupled local spring and aged calcstone and produced a white bleed on a dark stone. Radio Rocks (1999) Radio Rocks are made up of three different kinds of stones each piled into cairns that in Neolithic times were used as astronomical markers. Bradshaw's cairns, in addition to recalling their ancient use, focus on the aspect of sound by functioning as multi-directional antennas. In each of these sculptures there are three radios designed to receive frequencies from three different zones. On top of one is a pyrite mixer designed to receive live emissions from Jupiter transmitted via a dedicated line from the radio telescope at Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute in Rosman, North Carolina. On one side, a galena mixer picked up world-band short wave. On the other, a receiver developed by the satellite industry drew live microwaves identified as echoes of the Big Bang. The other two cairns featured fluorite, tourmaline and hematite, acting as non-linear mixers, were computer programmed to attract random local and world-band frequencies. The hematite mixer continuously channeled Weather Radio. Levels of all the radios were set at a murmur. The outer space sounds invoke celestial harmonies that from the quieter time of Pythagoras have been referred to as the ‚ÄúMusic of the Spheres.‚Äù Six Continents (2003) Six Continents at the 6th Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju, South Korea, 2006 consists of six sculptures made from salt taken from each continent, funnels and water. The various salts, colored by minerals from each locale, react differently when subjected to water. Each sculpture is made of a 150-pound salt mound placed under a suspended funnel, each calibrated to release 7 drops per minute. The salt comes from: * Antarctica: white salt from McMurdo Bay * Africa: gray salt from Egypt * Australia: brown salt from Western Australia * Eurasia: ivory salt from Gwangju, South Korea * North America: green salt from the Dominican Republic * South America: pink salt from Chile The work premiered at Larry Becker Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, 2005 and traveled to SolwayJones, Los Angeles later that year.

Top from left: Paddra Nsu-Yeul, Caius Ballad, Oerba Yun Fang, Oerba Dia Vanille, Noel Kreiss, Snow Villiers, Serah Farron, Mog, Sazh Katzroy, Lumina, Lightning and Hope Estheim. Final Fantasy XIII - a role-playing game released by Square Enix in 2009 - revolves around the struggles of a group of humans over a predestined fate. The game's two sequels, Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, build on the first game's story and mythos. In video game publications and among the staff at Square Enix, the three games have come to be referred to as the \\"Lightning Saga\\", and the core concepts they contain are drawn from the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. The visuals of the original characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura and Nao Ikeda, while many later characters were created by other designers, including Hideo Minaba, Yusuke Naora and Toshiyuki Itahana. Their original stories were created by Motomu Toriyama and written up by Daisuke Watanabe. The series' central characters are Lightning, a former soldier and the core character in all three games; Serah Farron, Lightning's sister; Snow Villiers, an optimistic young man engaged to Serah; Hope Estheim, a young man who develops a strong bond with Lightning; Sazh Katzroy, a former airship pilot; Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang, two women who inadvertently set the first game's events in motion. Three further characters appear in XIII-2: Noel Kreiss, a hunter who sets out to change his bleak future; Caius Ballad, a man from Noel's past who wishes to bring about a predestined apocalypse; and Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a seeress reincarnated through history. In Lightning Returns, two more are added: Lumina, a doppelganger of Serah; and Bhunivelze, the main deity of the Final Fantasy XIII universe. The characters in the games have been the basis of several pieces of merchandise produced by Square Enix, such as statues, action figures, apparel, and jewelry. They have been subject to mostly positive reviews; most observers favorably compared the characters to those in the previous games and praised the voice acting, however some critics have stated that the plot line of the characters have been confusing when introduced. In XIII-2, the shift to new or secondary characters and the change in importance and story role of the previous game's main cast grated with some reviewers, while others applauded the new characters' development and interactions. In Lightning Returns, the characters' stories were often criticized for being underdeveloped, or simply included for the sake of ending their stories. Creation and development The overarching theme of the games was the effects the deities of the core mythos on the human population, especially the fate that was forced upon the main characters. Yuji Abe, a designer on Lightning Returns, defined it as \\"A battle with destiny\\", with the burden of destiny growing progressively heavier for the main characters over the course of the games. The setting and story was written around and drawn from the official mythology for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series, which also includes Final Fantasy XV and Final Fantasy Type-0. For Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels, Toriyama created a story focusing on the existing deities within the mythos and their influence on the world. Different deities from the mythos were focused on in each installment, such as the goddess Etro in XIII-2. One of the defining features of the cast is the game's central protagonist, Lightning. Toriyama wanted Lightning to be an exceptional female protagonist for the Final Fantasy series, with her having great strength and combat ability, as opposed to the gentler figures of Aerith from Final Fantasy VII or Yuna from Final Fantasy X. Unlike those characters, Lightning's personality was conceived well before her outfit was designed or her voice actresses were cast. How the character was portrayed and how her story and personality was evolved became one of the driving forces of the series. Most of Final Fantasy XIII's characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also served as the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII and X. The stories of the characters were created by Motomu Toriyama and Daisuke Watanabe. The main story concept was \\"characters at the mercy of a predetermined, unjust fate\\". Nao Ikeda designed Snow, Jihl Nabaat and Gadot, Lebreau, and Maqui. The cast, along with the world's characters, were intended to mimic the multi-ethnic feel of the United States rather than Asia or Europe. During production of the first game, Toriyama wanted the cast to be a group that was originally combative with one-another, and designed the game's narrative with several key points which would bring them together: these included the scene between Sazh and Vanille in the city of Nautilus, and the reconciliation between Snow and Hope in the town of Palumpolum. The characters went through several changes in the early stages of development, the two noted examples being Sazh's ethnic origin and Fang's gender. For XIII-2, Toriyama wanted a dark and serious tone to the world and story, in contrast to the jovial atmosphere of Final Fantasy X-2, and the story was scripted to play out as \\"pieces of drama\\" like a television series. Its story and characters were focused around the concepts of mortality and, in Toriyama's words, the \\"wish for rebirth\\": the latter theme was directly inspired by the Great East Japan earthquake. Watanabe stayed as one of the game's writers, with writer and novelist Emi Nagashima, better known under her pen name of Jun Eishima, coming on as a story consultant. Lightning's outfit for the game was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo, who worked from a rough outline done by Nomura, who also designed the characters' facial features. Two new character designers were brought in: Hideo Minaba, who contributed to new character outfits such as Hope and Alyssa's, and Yusuke Naora, who designed outfits for Serah, Noel and Caius. Lightning and Serah's designs were created to directly reflect the environments they start out from. The character of Noel was added at a later stage in the original planning, since the original plan for Serah to travel alone with the moogle Mog seemed to clash too much with the game's serious nature. For Lightning Returns, the developers decided to have Lightning as the sole protagonist so that players could get to know her better. The story was created to bring closure for the characters of the series. The core themes of the game were the \\"salvation of souls\\", and the \\"rebirth of Lightning\\", the latter being the main reason the game was not called XIII-3. Norura returned to design Lightning and Snow's new looks and Kamikokuryo returned to design new outfits for Lightning and help with the world design. Two new designers brought in were Toshitaka Matsuda, an artist for Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, and Toshiyuki Itahana, who had worked on Final Fantasy IX and the Crystal Chronicles series. Both designed multiple battle costumes for Lightning, many of them inspired by the artwork of Yoshitaka Amano. Itahana and Matsuda also respectively designed Lumina and Bhunivelze. Watanabe returned as the main scenario writer, while also receiving ideas for scenes from Toriyama and other members of staff. His work on the script was slow, causing problems from the rest of the development team: in response to this, he worked hard to create an appropriate finale. During his work, he had a strong nostalgic feeling while writing the characters' lines. In order to reduce the delay between the local and international releases, the English voice acting for XIII was done while the game was in development. Unfortunately, it lacked the infrastructure needed to support simultaneous development and localization. The lack of deadlines, poor communication and synchronization between the various departments, and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development. One of the most notable knock-on effects was that the game's script needed to be re-translated as the various cutscenes changed, and large parts of the dialogue had to be rerecorded, party because they lacked proper emotional drive at the right moments. For XIII-2, a tool called Moomle, developed by English translator Tom Slattery and his Japanese counterpart Teruaki Sugawara from their experience with the first game, was used to make sure all parts of the localization process were synchronized. For Lightning Returns the Japanese voice actors recorded their dialogue well after their characters' scenes had been created, as opposed to the normal procedure of recording lines before cutscene creation. For the English version, the amount of dialogue translation and recording was so large that there was over two months' delay between the game's local and international releases. , beings who aid the protagonists after being tamed in battle, are the game's versions of summons. The ones featured in the games are series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. Their summon sequences were designed to be flashy, but also mixed with gameplay: this approach was inspired by comments from players of previous titles who had not wanted to wait as long for the summons to take effect as in previous titles. The Eidolons, which could transform into vehicle-like forms for their masters to ride, were built around the game's theme of \\"transformation\\". They were to have been featured in XIII-2 as part of a DLC episode, but the idea was scrapped and the gameplay was folded into one of the title's minigames. For Lightning Returns, although the Eidolons still exist, they were not available in gameplay and merely served as an element of the story. Carried over from the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos are the fal'Cie, demigods who work to find a way of bringing their respective deities back into the world. The fal'Cie can choose people to become l'Cie, servants given magical powers and a task to complete within a given time, called a Focus. Those who succeed go into crystal stasis, while those that fail become monsters called Cie'th. Playable characters Lightning is the key protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels, serving as the primary protagonist in XIII, a supporting character of XIII-2 and the sole playable character of Lightning Returns. Born as Claire Farron, or in the original Japanese-language version, she lost her parents when she was 15 years old. She takes a new name to become a stronger person to help her younger sister Serah, only to cause tensions between them as a result. In the first game, she is a former Sanctum soldier who sets out to save her sister from the fal'Cie, then strives to save Cocoon from destruction. At the beginning of XIII-2, she is whisked away to Valhalla, capital of the Unseen World, to act as the Goddess Etro's protector, sending messages to her allies and guiding Serah through time to put things right. She fails, causing the death of Etro and the release of Chaos, a dark energy kept trapped by the goddess. In Lightning Returns, Lightning ends up serving the god Bhunivelze as the savior for the inhabitants of Nova Chrysalia during its final days, fighting old friends and enemies alike to save their souls. She is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and by Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Oerba Dia Vanille is a 190-year-old l'Cie from Gran Pulse, the childhood friend of Oerba Yun Fang, and the narrator of Final Fantasy XIII. Thirteen days before the start of the game, she and Fang wake from crystal stasis in the Pulse Vestige holding the fal'Cie Anima, initiating the chain of events that would lead to the Sanctum's Purge. When she is with the Purgees of Cocoon along with Nora and Hope Estheim during their exile, she is rescued by Snow Villiers' group, NORA. However, after Nora dies, she encourages Hope to follow Snow to confront him, and she sees them become l'Cie. After the party splits up, Vanille, along with Sazh, resolve to run away from their fate. However, both she and Sazh are captured by Jihl Nabaat. After Lightning and the party rescue the two, Vanille reunites with Fang. On Gran Pulse, Fang regains her memory and remembers it was she who became Ragnarok, a monster designed to bring down Cocoon during a conflict between the two worlds called the War of Transgression. When Vanille enters a state of emotional distress, she summons and defeats the Eidolon Hecatoncheir. After the defeat of Orphan, she and Fang transform into Ragnarok and form a crystal pillar to prevent Cocoon colliding with Pulse. After this event, Vanille remains with Fang in crystal stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing everything that is going on, remaining unaffected by the changes in the timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn. In Final Fantasy XIII, Vanille was originally going to be the main character, but after the game was shown off with Lightning in the central role, the decision was scrapped. In an interview with Siliconera, Vanille's English voice actor stated that she found it relatively easy connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities. Vanille is voiced by Georgia van Cuylenburg in English, and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese. Serah Farron is an 18-year-old human from Cocoon. After their parents die years prior to the start of the game, Lightning, then still called Claire, raises Serah and sets out to become a protector for her, but her devotion to that goal causes tensions between them. Eventually, Serah becomes engaged to Snow days prior to the start of the game, and Lightning strongly objects to their relationship. Serah eventually reveals to Snow and Lightning that, while exploring the Pulse Vestage where the fal'Cie Anima was kept, she has been made a Pulse l'Cie. However, Lightning discovers too late that Serah is captured by Anima after disbelieving her sister. Although given the Focus to become Ragnarok, she changes her Focus through her own will, then imparts her new mission, to save Cocoon, to Lightning and Snow before turning to crystal after being found. The change of her Focus eventually inspires the other l'Cie to do the same. After the party defeats Orphan at the end of the game, Serah, along with Dajh, resumes her life as a human. Serah reconciles with Lightning, who accepts her relationship with Snow afterwards. Serah returns as the protagonist in Final Fantasy XIII-2. She is the only one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She eventually becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world. Early in the development of XIII, Serah was meant to be a playable character, but was eventually delegated to a supporting character because of technical issues. Tetsuya Nomura, in an interview, said that he designed Serah's hair so that her silhouette would mirror Lightning's. For XIII-2, the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning's roles, with Serah becoming the game's protagonist, while Lightning was the object of her quest. Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah's new costume like the \\"plug suit\\" outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons. Part of the challenge for the game was making Serah more active, but maintaining her femininity, which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon. Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range. Aside from Naora's design, Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah: a black combat outfit titled \\"Exposure and Defense\\" (later retitled \\"Style and Steel\\"), and a second red-and-white outfit titled \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", meant to be indicative of Serah's change into an adult. After a popular vote, the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012. Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese. Snow Villiers is a 21-year-old human from Cocoon. Snow proposes to Serah Farron two days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII. During the Purge (a mass exodus of Cocoon citizens after the activation of the Pulse fal'Cie Anima), Snow and his group NORA engages in a battle with PSICOM, the security force of Cocoon. After becoming a l'Cie and finding Serah in crystal stasis, he despairs and is forced to tame his Eidolon, the Shiva Sisters. After meeting up with Cid Raines and Oerba Yun Fang, Snow pairs up with Hope while oblivious to the boy's grudge against him. Once Hope gets Snow alone, he unsuccessfully tries to murder him for his part in his mother's death and reconciles with him soon after. Snow then reconciles with Lightning and receives forgiveness from Hope's father. He and the others then rescue Sazh and Vanille before eventually escaping to Gran Pulse, where Lightning and Snow resolve to see Serah together after destroying Orphan. After Orphan's death, Snow and Lightning reunite with Serah, then start planning to set up a new town on Gran Pulse. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Snow left a year prior to its events promising Serah to find Lightning for her. His search would eventually result with him traveling through time while seeing Lightning in a dream telling him to protect the crystal pillar holding Cocoon, seeing a vision of the world's fate, and becoming a l'Cie once more with the Focus of fighting beside Serah at the final battle. Appearing on Cocoon three hundred years in his future, Snow attempts to destroy a monster threatening Cocoon's supporting pillar. Serah and Noel come to Snow's aid and help him defeat it by negating the anomaly causing its growth. With the threat gone, Snow entrusts Noel with Serah's care and dissolves from the moment in time while promising Serah that they will meet again. Snow then travels to the Coliseum, a fighting arena separated from the flow of time, and after Serah and Noel challenge him to combat and win, he is forced to remain due to being bound to the Coliseum by the Chaos. In Lightning Returns, after being released from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron. Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos at the center of Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world. Snow was designed by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He was designed around a motif of ice, with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo. For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and he was given a new hairstyle. Originally to have been called \\"Storm\\", the development team nicknamed the character \\"Mr. 33 cm\\" in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret. Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns. Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms. He has also been described in interviews as the \\"tough guy\\" type, and not having a jealous side to him. He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his \\"big brother\\" persona. Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as \\"struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah.\\" His design was intended to reflect the state of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate. His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic. Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared \\"cool\\", rather than taking on \\"thankless\\" roles. VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin- Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, one of the most interesting aspects of the original game. Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII, and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform. Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese. Hope Estheim is a 14-year-old boy who is an exile at the start of Final Fantasy XIII. At the beginning of the game, Hope and his mother Nora, on vacation in the town of Bodhum, are selected for the Purge. Under Snow's leadership, Nora joins the resistance in the Hanging Edge, but falls to her death during the battle while trying to protect Hope and after saving Snow's life, which angers Hope greatly. After he becomes a l'Cie, and being separated from the main party, Hope follows Lightning to \\"toughen up\\" while plotting his assassination attempt on Snow for revenge. Despite Lightning's objections, Hope tries to kill Snow once he gets him alone, but after coming to the realization that he had just been blaming Snow to cope with his mother's death, they settle their differences. When Hope returns home to his father, Bartholomew, he tells him what happened to Nora and repairs their relationship. When on Gran Pulse, he tells the others to leave him, afraid they will get hurt because of him, but inadvertently summons his Eidolon Alexander. After the defeat of Orphan, Hope tells Lightning that Fang and Vanille had changed their fate by fulfilling their Focus of transforming into Ragnarok to save Cocoon rather than destroying it. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is leader of the scientific expedition group known as the Academy a decade after the events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 years into the future to oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a plan to build a man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles. In Lightning Returns, Hope resides in a special base constructed within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with Lightning via a wireless com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from the past two games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's eyes and ears, and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies. During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good. At the 2009 TGS event, it was revealed that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Y≈´ki Kaji in Japanese. Sazh Katzroy is a 40-year-old human former airship pilot. His son, Dajh, is taken by the Sanctum in the aftermath of him becoming a Cocoon l'Cie three days earlier when Sazh bought him a chocobo chick. Along with Lightning, he derails the train carrying the Cocoon exiles at the start of Final Fantasy XIII. After the party splits up following Anima's defeat, Sazh goes with Vanille as he tells her about his son. However, Jihl Nabaat reveals Vanille's part in his son becoming a l'Cie, causing him to summon the Eidolon Brynhildr. Unable to kill Vanille, Sazh unsuccessfully attempts suicide. Sazh and Vanille are then captured by Nabaat. Before Lightning's party rescues Sazh and Vanille, he reconciles with her for her role in Dajh's fate. After traveling to Pulse, Sazh eventually forgives Fang for what happened to Dajh. After Vanille and Fang transform to Ragnarok and prevent Cocoon from colliding with Pulse, Sazh is reunited with Dajh. After these events, Sazh leaves to help the civilians of Cocoon, then decides to move onto Gran Pulse. At some point during the events of XIII-2, Sazh is sucked through a rip in time, is separated from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity, a palace in the Void Beyond. While there, he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity's owner. Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds, they go through a time gate and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius. Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls. In Lightning Returns, Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands. After Dajh's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma, Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son. Lightning helps retrieve the fragments of Dajh's soul, lifting Sazh's burden. In the May 2009 edition of Official PlayStation Magazine, Yoshinori Kitase said that Sazh was intended to be an Eddie Murphy-style comic-relief character as well as a sympathetic character. Toriyama was initially worried about the unconventional afro hairstyle. Due to the character having the largest amount of dialogue in the game, an experienced voice actor was chosen for him. His early look was, as revealed in the a special Ultimania guide released during 25th anniversary celebrations for the series, very different from his final design, with him being white with long brown hair, and wielding a shoulder- cannon rather than machine pistols. He was also named \\"Baz\\". He is voiced by Reno Wilson in English and by Masashi Ebara in Japanese. Oerba Yun Fang is a 21-year old l'Cie from Gran Pulse and the childhood friend Oerba Dia Vanille. The two wake from crystal stasis within the Pulse Vestige containing the fal'Cie Anima thirteen days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII, which in turn kicks off the chain of events that lead to Cocoon's descent into chaos. After forcing Vanille to escape possible capture without her, Fang begins serving as Cid Raines's subordinate in the Cavalry. She eventually meets Snow and becomes his partner as part of Cid's plan to overthrow the Sanctum, later befriending Lightning. After rescuing Sazh and Vanille on board the Palamecia, she and Vanille reunite. Later, after being told about their focus and resolving to fulfill it even if she has to fight her friends, Fang has to fight and tame the Eidolon Bahamut. On Gran Pulse, despite Vanille's protests, Fang reveals that she was responsible for scarring Cocoon's shell centuries earlier and bringing deadly recriminations on the population of Gran Pulse. When they face Orphan, despite the party's pleas for Fang to not transform into Ragnarok, Fang eventually transforms into an incomplete version and fights the fal'Cie alone, but gets tortured as a result of her failure, only to be saved by Lightning's group. After Orphan's destruction, Fang and Vanille complete their Focus by becoming Ragnarok to save Cocoon from crashing into Gran Pulse. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Fang and Vanille appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in, and at the end they are rescued from Cocoon's pillar when it finally collapse. By the events of Lightning Returns, after awakening and seeing Vanille being used by the Order, Fang has taken up residence in the Dead Dunes and becomes the leader of a bandit group bent on thwarting the Order from obtaining a relic within the desert. She attempts to destroy the relic so Vanille can be saved from being killed by the ritual. Fang appears on the final day, helping Lightning dissuade Vanille from going through with the ritual and helps her guide the souls of the dead to the new world. Fang was originally scripted to be a male character during the early stages of Final Fantasy XIII's development, but early in the writing stage, was rewritten as a female character. Along with this, the sex appeal that was originally going to be part of Lightning's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard-edged persona. Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese. Noel Kreiss is one of the last remaining humans in a devastated future, Noel is a friend and student of Caius Ballad before the two grow apart due to the latter's wish to destroy time. After the incarnation of Yeul in his time dies, Noel sets out to find Valhalla, intending to change Yeul's fate. On the point of death, he is brought to Valhalla, where he sees Lightning and Caius in battle. Lightning gives Noel the task of finding Serah and bringing to her to Valhalla. Traveling to Serah's time, Noel sets out with her to find Lightning, repair the timeline and change his future at any cost, even erasing himself from existence. Upon meeting Snow, Noel develops a hatred of him because of the former's impulsive attitude. Eventually, Noel gains respect for Snow. As they travel, his memories are restored, and he tries to dissuade Serah from continuing, as her visions of the future would soon kill her. When she decides to go on, he comes too after seeing an image of him and the Yeul of his time meeting again. Though he and Serah finally defeat Caius in Valhalla, Noel is forced into a situation that ends with Caius's death. Soon after returning, to 500 AF, forced to watch Serah die, Noel realizes too late that his actions have triggered the apocalypse Caius wished for. By the events of Lightning Returns, forced to protect the people as the \\"Shadow Hunter\\" after the Order of Salvation take over Luxerion, Noel becomes obsessed with a fabricated prophecy that if he kills Bhunivelze's savior, he will bring about a new world where he can live in peace with Yeul. Ultimately, he has become burdened by guilt because of his actions in causing the world to fall into its current state. Noel's belief in the prophecy is reinforced when Lightning appears as the savior. They briefly ally to rout an extremist sect of the Children of Etro, who have been killing women who resemble Lightning. They later fight at Noel's hideout. Lightning provokes Noel into fully expressing his rage and engaging him in battle. After the battle, Noel destroys the oracle drive playing the fabricated prophecy, finally freeing himself from his guilt. After Bhunivelze's defeat, Noel offers his life to give Yeul a chance to live in the new world, and Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to go with him. Noel was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who did the face, and Yusuke Naora, who designed the rest of the body and clothes. When designing his clothes, Naora took into account he was a hunter, while his swords were based on a Final Fantasy III illustration by Yoshitaka Amano. Noel's weapon, which changes from two swords into a javelin, was designed so that the character could have both short and long-range attacks. In an interview, Toriyama said that Noel was intended to be a grave young man burdened by a heavy responsibility, but also, because of his upbringing on Gran Pulse, with a naivety about the world Serah and Lightning are used to, and certainly about Cocoon. Yoshinori Kitase, in an interview with Impress Watch, described Noel as one of the Final Fantasy series' few \\"orthodox\\" protagonists. Noel is voiced by Jason Marsden in English and by Daisuke Kishio in Japanese. NORA is a resistance group led by Snow Villiers and is an acronym for \\"No Obligation, Rules or Authority\\". The team consists of , Snow's childhood friend; , another friend who runs a local bar in Bodhum for gathering monetary resources; , a teenager who provides mechanical assistance; and , a young man obsessed with fashion. Gadot and Lebreau join as guest characters when Snow is leading NORA to battle the PSICOM soldiers during the opening level. Eventually, they meet up with the party before they enter Orphan's cradle. The group reappears in Final Fantasy XIII-2, living in the town of New Bodhum and acting as its neighborhood watch. Due to not traveling through time, the members of NORA are dead by the events of Lightning Returns. In the supplementary novel Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories, it is revealed that all the members were reincarnated in the new world. Gadot, Lebreau, and Maqui were designed by Nao Ikeda, who based their clothing on the athletic clothing styles of basketball, beach volleyball, and snowboarding, respectively. Gadot, Lebreau, Maqui and Yuj are respectively voiced by Zack Hanks, Anndi McAfee, Daniel Samonas and Jeff Fischer in English, and by Biichi Sat≈ç, Y≈´ Asakawa, Makoto Naruse and Wataru Hatano in Japanese. Antagonists Galenth Dysley/Barthandelus is the Primarch (ruler) of the Sanctum government in Cocoon and serves as the main antagonist of Final Fantasy XIII. His true form is Barthandelus (known as in the Japanese version), lord sovereign of the Cocoon fal'Cie created by the fal'Cie deity Lindzei. Dysley's ultimate goal is to summon back the Maker, a term for a creator god associated with Bhunivelze who created Lindzei, back into their world. This plan involved using the l'Cie-forged beast Ragnarok to destroy Cocoon with the countless deaths from the crash to cause Etro's Gate to manifest in the physical world. He even goes so far as to use anti-Pulse propaganda to instil fear in the citizens of Cocoon. The first attempt, the War of Transgression, fails through the intervention of Etro. In the battle of Cocoon at the end of the game, Dysley manipulates Cid to cause a coup d'√©tat in Cocoon. When confronted by the team in Orphan's Cradle, Dysley plays on their emotions with illusions of Serah and Dajh before being mortally wounded by the party as Barthandelus. His body is then assimilated into Orphan and he ceases to be an independent entity. Dysley is voiced by S. Scott Bullock in English and Masaru Shinozuka in Japanese. Orphan is a wheel-like, sun- elemental fal'Cie who serves as the chief power source of Cocoon, kept within Eden. Both Orphan and the Cocoon fal'Cie had been planning its demise in order to reunite with their creator in the aftermath of the resulting mass genocide of every human in Cocoon. After Orphan assimilates the dying Barthandelus, it fights the party, and seemingly transforms the Cocoon-based members into Cie'th. It then proceeds to torture Fang and Vanille to invoke Ragnarok. However, Lightning and the others gain a new focus for a peaceful world and force Orphan into its true form before the party defeats it in the game's final battle. Orphan's shell is voiced by Julia Fletcher and S. Scott Bullock in English, and by Mie Sonozaki and Masaru Shinozuka in Japanese. Its true form is voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas in English and by Hiro Shimono in Japanese. Yaag Rosch is a Lieutenant Colonel of the Sanctum who acts as a secondary antagonist in Final Fantasy XIII. He serves as the director of the government's military branches and pilots his personal fighter, the Proudclad. Despite questioning the Sanctum's motives, he follows their orders for the sake of Cocoon's people. He first meets Lightning's party in Palumpolum, resulting in a fight that he loses. The party escapes with the help of the Cavalry. When the party escapes from the Palamecia, Rosch attempts to attack piloting the Proudclad, but fails as a result. Rosch again confronts Lightning's party in Eden, but he survives the fight and escapes. He and his troops go into Eden to defeat Orphan, only for his troops to be turned to Cie'th. He confronts the party once more while there, and loses once again. After the battle, Rosch reveals to the party that he knew the fal'Cie were in control the entire time, feeling their guidance and anti-Pulse propaganda was the best for Cocoon without realizing their true intentions. Rosch orders the Sanctum troops to suspend l'Cie operations and allows the party to enter Orphan's Cradle to save Cocoon before sacrificing himself by using a grenade, unleashing an explosion which annihilates him and the monsters pursuing the party. Rosch is voiced by Jon Curry in English and Hiroki T≈çchi in Japanese. Jihl Nabaat is a minor antagonist in Final Fantasy XIII, a Lieutenant Colonel of the PSICOM branch who also serves as Galenth Dysley's subordinate, commanding the airship Palamecia. Days earlier, Nabaat takes Dajh from Sazh so the Sanctum can determine his Focus. Later, using Dajh to lead her to Sazh in the pleasure capital of Nautilus, Nabaat plays on Sazh's emotions by revealing Vanille's part in his son becoming a l'Cie with the intention of killing Vanille. Nabaat's attempt fails, however, and she captures Vanille and Sazh. Nabaat enrages Sazh by her intent to use Dajh as a memorial before detaining them aboard the Palamecia. Lightning's group later infiltrates the Palamecia and rescues Sazh and Vanille, much to Nabaat's dismay. When the party confronts Dysley, Nabaat prepares to fight them to cover Dysley's escape. Dysley states that Nabaat has outlived her usefulness, and kills her using his fal'Cie magic. Though dead, Nabaat's spirit regains physical form during the events of Final Fantasy XIII-2 as a combatant in the Coliseum. Nabaat is voiced by Paula Tiso in English and Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Caius Ballad appears in Final Fantasy XIII-2 as the main antagonist. Hailing from the distant past prior to the War of Transgression, Caius is a former Pulse l'Cie who became the Guardian of the seeress Paddra Nsu-Yeul. At some point, to protect the seeress and her city from an invading army, Caius transforms himself into a Bahamut Eidolon, thus killing himself to save her. Etro, touched by his sacrifice, gives him her own heart, the Heart of Chaos, so he could become Yeul's eternal guardian and eventually as the living repository for her visions. However, this gift soon turns into a curse, as seeing Yeul die repeatedly makes him hateful towards Etro, attempting to condition Noel to be his killer before deciding to enter Valhalla and kill the goddess personally. As Serah and Noel encounter the past versions of him during their journey, Caius uses his knowledge of the timeline to create the various paradoxes they deal with while he battles Lightning in Valhalla. After barely managing to defeat her, Caius enters a final battle with Noel and Serah. Eventually, after being defeated in his Eidolon form and with Noel still refusing to kill him, Caius manages to force Noel's blade through himself, destroying Etro's heart. Though he seems to die, he is later seen in the game's secret ending, seated on Etro's throne and saying that he and Yeul can begin their lives in the \\"new world\\". In Lightning Returns, it is revealed that the contradicting desires of Yeul's incarnations have brought Caius back, with his body and soul becoming one with chaos and thus being beyond salvation. Lightning engages in a fight in the remains of Valhalla before learning of Caius's condition, along with his intention to stay in Nova Chrystalia to serve as custodian of the new Unseen Realm to guide the dead. Caius is seen after Bhunivelze's defeat, where he explains that the Yeuls intend to become the new goddess of the dead. As a final act before the new Unseen Realm is completely formed, Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to depart with Noel for the new world. Caius Ballad was designed by Yusuke Naora, with the final design being selected from several ones offered. Watanabe called Caius a \\"unique\\" villain for the series, due to his almost- noble goal of saving Yeul from her perpetual curse of early death and reincarnation, as opposed to many other Final Fantasy villains who sought destruction. His role in XIII-2 earned the character the title of \\"Best Villain\\" in Game Informers 2012 RPG of the Year awards. Caius is voiced by Liam O'Brien in the English version and Hiroshi Shirokuma in the Japanese version. Adam is a minor antagonist in Final Fantasy XIII-2. It is a man-made fal'Cie created to re-levitate Cocoon. However, utilising a crossroads between time periods, Adam is able to use the AI that helped design it to kill the humans and seize control of the city of Academia. When Noel and Serah fight Adam, it uses the crossroads to continually rebuild itself after each defeat; eventually, Serah uses the crossroads to send a warning to Hope, who halts the project in his time and erases Adam from existence. Bhunivelze is the key deity of the Final Fantasy XIII universe and the main antagonist of Lightning Returns. He plays a key role in the world's history, being the creator of the world's main deities and the indirect creator of both humanity and the fal'Cie. While the attempts by the Cocoon fal'Cie to revive him in Final Fantasy XIII failed, Bhunivelze awakens in the aftermath of Final Fantasy XIII-2 when Granpulse is being transformed into Nova Chrysalia from its mingling with the Unseen Realm. Though Bhunivelze attempts to stop corruption, he gradually accepts that the Nova Chrysalia is beyond saving and makes Lightning the savior to saves the souls of those still alive in preparation for the birth of a new world. His wish is to purge humanity of their memories by destroying the dead, leaving them free of all burdens and knowing only happiness in the new world. While having the Order of Salvation carry out his plans for humanity, he makes Hope his host and conditions Lightning to become the replacement for Etro. When Lightning chooses to rebel and thwarts the Order's mission, allowing the souls of the dead to mingle with the living, Bhunivelze decides to destroy all souls along with his new world with the intent to create his own version of humanity that are practically extensions of himself. Lightning fights Bhunivelze, wounding him and freeing Hope's soul before uniting with the souls of humanity to defeat him. After his defeat, Lightning states that even if he survived, humanity would defeat him once again. Bhunivelze's physical form for Lightning Returns was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda. Matsuda made his design elaborate and detailed as a representation of both Nova Chrysalia and the entire universe. This design motif carried over to him being fused to the arena floor during the final battle. The character is voiced by Daniel Riordan in English and Y≈´ki Kaji in Japanese. Other characters Dajh Katzroy is the 6-year-old son of Sazh Katzroy. Four days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII, Sazh visits a store to get a baby chocobo for his son. After Dajh becomes a l'Cie, Jihl Nabaat captures him and uses him to sense the energy of \\"Pulse\\" to track down other l'Cie. After finding his father, he turns to crystal, having completed his Focus. Dajh, along with Serah, returns to normal after the defeat of Orphan and is reunited with Sazh. In XIII-2, Dajh is separated from his father when they are sucked into the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. After Sazh reunites with him, the two travel to Academia and are witness to the unleashing of chaos after Etro's death. In Lightning Returns, Dajh's soul has fragmented and he has fallen into a coma. As his father is driven into despair trying to awaken him, Dajh becomes frightened of waking. Lightning manages to retrieve the fragments of his soul and rekindle Sazh's happiness, enabling Dajh to wake. Dajh was originally meant to be a nine-year-old, but was made younger by designer Nao Ikeda to gain more sympathy with the player, saying she wanted someone the player would \\"want to pick up and [give] a hug\\". In an interview with Famitsu, Ikeda said that Dajh's afro hairstyle was meant to be a baby version of Sazh's own hair. Dajh is voiced by Connor Villard in English and by Sh≈çtar≈ç Uzawa in Japanese in XIII. In Lightning Returns, he is voiced by Andre Robionson in English and Wataru Sekine in Japanese. Cid Raines is a supporting character in Final Fantasy XIII, a Sanctum Air Force Brigadier and leader of the Sanctum's Calvary branch. Like Rosch, Cid has doubts about the Sanctum in its current state, and believes that Cocoon should be run by its people. Recruiting Fang after she gets separated from Vanille, Cid has her and his subordinate Rygdea capture Snow and use him to find the other l'Cie under the impression that the Calvary would back them up as he helps the party escapes from Yaag Rosch in Hope's home town, and then stage a rescue mission on the Palamecia to save Sazh and Vanille. However, it later turns out that Cid is actually a Cocoon l'Cie, aiding the group under orders from Dysley before acting on his own to kill them for the safety of Cocoon's people. Defeated, Cid returns to Dysley to replace him as Primarch under orders to create chaos in Eden, Cocoon's capital city. After being confronted by the Calvary when the party invades Eden, Cid tells Rygdea to kill him and end his misery. In Lightning Returns, the dead use Cid's visage to communicate with Lightning. Through Cid, they tell her the truth about the Order's plans and that Vanille can save the dead, though in doing so she would be rebelling against Bhunivelze. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy; this appearance is the second Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character in an antagonistic role, after Final Fantasy XII. Cid is voiced by Erik Davies in English and by Yuichi Nakamura in Japanese. Rygdea is a supporting character from Final Fantasy XIII. He is a member of the Sanctum Cavalry, a unit loyal to Cid Raines and secretly opposed to the fal'Cie. It is he who extracts Snow and Serah in her crystal form after Anima made them l'Cie, then he helps save them again when the l'Cie are ambushed at Hope Estheim's house. During the battle that erupts on Cocoon with Cid's appointment as Primarch, Rygdea takes command of the Cavalry and confronts Cid, then ends up fulfilling Cid's request to end his life as a l'Cie. Although he is never encountered during XIII-2, the novels Fragments Before and Fragments After, confirm that Rygdea survives when the rest of the Cavalry is turned into Cie'th. He eventually exposes the Sanctum's secrets and establishes the Academy with Bartholomew Estheim. Rygdea is voiced by Josh Robert Thompson in English and Yasuyuki Kase in Japanese. Bartholomew and Nora Estheim and his wife are Hope's parents and supporting characters in Final Fantasy XIII. Prior to the first game's events, Nora takes Hope to see a festival in Bodhum, and the two end up being selected for the Purge. When Snow and his group NORA free the refugees, Nora chooses to join their efforts. During an attack, Nora saves Snow from a missile attack but a counterattack leaves her gravely injured and she only has time to ask him to get her son home before she dies. When Hope, Lightning, and Fang arrive at Hope's house with a wounded Snow, Bartholomew allows them to take shelter there, managing to forgive Snow for failing to save Nora as he fulfilled her final wish to get Hope home. When the Cavalry help the four escape, Hope restrains his father, making him appear a victim and thus protecting him from Cocoon's authorities. After the fall of Cocoon, Bartholomew helps set up the provincial government after the fall of the Sanctum. He dies of natural causes some years later. A thousand years after Cocoon's fall, the spirits of Nora and Bartholomew appear to Hope after Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control. Nora is voiced by Komina Matsushita in Japanese and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in English, while Bartholomew is voiced by Masaki Aizawa in Japanese and Andr√© Sogliuzzo in English. Paddra Nsu-Yeul is a Pulsian seeress hailing from the city-state of Paddra on Gran Pulse prior to the time of the War of Transgression, having written Analects relating to the event, Etro, Ragnarok, and the Eidolons. In the novel Fragments After, it is shown that Yeul was the first human created, and that for some unknown reason her soul does not fade after reaching the afterlife. Taking pity on her, Etro gives Yeul the ability to see the future, called the Eyes of Etro, and enables her to be continuously reincarnated throughout history. Though meant for the best, Yeul's ability to see the future becomes a curse, since each vision drains her lifeforce and she consequently always dies in her teens. Because of her fate, Caius Ballad, who had seen each Yeul live and die since before the War of Transgression, makes it his goal to destroy Etro and end time itself so Yeul would no longer die. Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that she allowed herself to be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate. In Lightning Returns, the many versions of Yeul take up residence in the ruins of Etro's temple, with Caius as their guardian. It is revealed that Yeul's constant reincarnation caused her soul to fragment, with each previous life mingled with the Chaos and triggered the events of XIII-2. As the world ends, the souls of Yeul choose to stay and become the new goddess of death to restore the cycle of life Etro established. The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human. Yeul is voiced by Amber Hood in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese. Mog is a moogle (a creature frequently found in the Final Fantasy series) who acts as a supporting character in Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. Mog comes from a place called the Ocean of Time, where moogles seem to live in some numbers. After the events of Final Fantasy XIII, Mog is pulled from his home into a paradox, losing his memories in the process, and eventually finds his way into Valhalla. There, he helps Lightning defeat a Bahamut Eidolon, then is sent with Noel to become Serah's \\"good luck charm\\". While traveling with Serah and Noel, he acts as Serah's weapon-to-hand and helps them in their quest. At one point, while resolving a paradox, Mog recovers his memories and is given the chance to return home. Instead, he chooses to remain by Serah's side. In Lightning Returns, Mog has moved to the Wildlands and become the leader of the last moogle community to exist in the world. When Lightning meets him, he feels guilty because of Serah's death, but he is revived by Lightning's promise to rescue Serah's soul. Mog was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda, who was asked to make the character into a mascot for the game. He designed Mog in the image of an infant, and redrew it repeatedly until he was satisfied with the balance of features. Mog was originally designed to be Serah's sole companion during XIII-2, but this was changed at a late stage when it was decided that it would clash too much with the game's general atmosphere. Mog's voice proved a challenge for the sound designers in terms of non-verbal answers and noises: eventually, they created several different versions of \\"Kupo\\", the Moogle's trademark sound, with one signifying each of Mog's possible moods. At one point, Mog was talking too much in-game and the designers had to go through the game toning down the amount of dialogue he had. In XIII-2 Mog is voiced by Ariel Winter in English and Sumire Morohoshi in Japanese. For Lightning Returns, Mog is voiced in English by Bailey Gambertoglio. Alyssa Zaidelle is a supporting character from Final Fantasy XIII-2. Originally a young woman from Cocoon, she is involved in the Purge, hiding the ruined city of Bresha with a group of survivors. During the events at the end of Final Fantasy XIII, the roof of their hiding place collapses. Though Alyssa was meant to die, when time becomes distorted and the paradoxes erupted, she is resurrected, though she is still haunted by dreams of her true fate. She joins the Academy and works as an assistant to Hope, going into hibernation with him after he initiates the construction of the new Cocoon. Although she is initially supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, she eventually betrays the two to Caius after learning that their quest to correct the timeline dooms her to vanish. But they escape and, while planning to kill Hope, the part of the timeline that brought her back is corrected, causing her to fade from existence. She is voiced by Kim Mai Guest in English and Y≈çko Hikasa in Japanese. Chocolina is a supporting character that first appears in Final Fantasy XIII-2. In Sazh's DLC episode, it is revealed that Chocolina is the chocobo chick that Sazh bought for his son before the events of the first game, with Dajh choosing her name after those events. While Sazh is whisked away to Serendipity, the chocobo gets separated from him and makes a wish to help others. This is granted by Etro and she is given a human body that can exist across all of time. After that, she serves as a merchant and helper to Serah and Noel on their journey. She returns as a supporting character in Lightning Returns, minding the Canvas of Prayers, and also appears in her original chick form during the quest to save Sazh's soul. Chocolina was originally meant to be a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese. Lumina is a supporting character in Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. Initially appearing as a doppelganger of Serah, she is eventually revealed to be an embodiment of Lightning's personal trauma as a child that created a physical form from the Chaos to contain Serah's soul. Lumina meddles in Lightning's journey, aiding her or being a hindrance, before eventually revealing her true identity and integrating back into Lightning's mind once she comes to terms with her need to be helped by her friends. Lumina was designed by Toshiyuki Itahana, who had worked on multiple titles in the Final Fantasy series. Her look has been described as a \\"Gothic lolita\\" style. She came about when the team were asking themselves how to portray Lightning's hidden self. Her appearance is a young version of Serah, but her inner feelings reflect Lightning's hidden emotions. Her personality and actions were made to be unpredictable, with her both aiding and hindering Lightning on her journey. In creating her childlike appearance and extravagant movements, the development team tried to make them as realistic as possible. Lumina is voiced by Jessica DiCicco in English and Kanae Ito in Japanese. Cultural impact Merchandise In conjunction with the game's release, Square Enix produced a lineup of merchandise including jewelry, action figures and other goods related to the characters. Most of the merchandise is released in Japan. The items produced include Lightning's necklace, Snow's necklace, a l'Cie-themed lighter and a l'Cie-themed card case. Three full-colored action figures of Hope, Fang and Odin have also been displayed in the Square Enix Japan merchandise page, along with character posters. To promote the game and its heroine, Square Enix also licensed production of a perfume branded as \\"~Lightning~ eau de toilette\\". In 2012, in what Yoshinori Kitase called \\"a very exciting opportunity\\", the April issue of Arena Homme+ magazine showed multiple characters from XIII-2 modeling outfits for Prada's spring and summer collections. Characters from the games appeared on the packaging of snacks produced by Ezaki Glico to promote Lightning Returns. Critical reception The characters of Final Fantasy XIII have received mixed and positive opinions from reviewers. Ben Dutka of PSX Extreme said that the voice acting for the characters are \\"interesting\\" and that the cast was \\"a competent one, even if some characters can begin to chafe after a while.\\" He also said that the player \\"might grow tired of Lightning‚Äôs gruffness and Vanille‚Äôs bounciness in the early goings but they begin to show new emotions as [the player] progress[es].\\" 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish applauded the characters as \\"the best- defined group of protagonists the series has ever seen\\" and also praised them for their development in the story. Parish also commented that the characters \\"worked through their differences and demons and feel like comrades\\" during the story's development. IGN editor Ryan Clements drew a favorable comparison to the characters of Final Fantasy VI and enjoyed the characters' multi-story approach and the flashbacks in the storyline. Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer said the characters were \\"fantastic\\" and also praised the voice acting. However, den Ouden said that in the introduction to the game, the characters \\"lacked any kind of development for the first few hours [of the game], and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression\\". The characters introduced in XIII-2 received a mixed reception, with some praising their inclusion and others saying they were too weak. Ryan Clements felt that the characters seemed to have no clear focus, with the only driving force being the quest for Lightning. VanOrd thought the characters were good, but said that the game focused too much on Serah and Noel, rather than the more engaging characters of Lightning and Caius. Dale North of Destructoid was the most positive, finding the characters very well fleshed out, understandable and well-voiced by the cast. den Ouden thought that the characters alright and well voiced, but \\"[fell] flat when the actors [had] awkward dialogue to work with\\". Juba was extremely critical of the characters and their story, seeing the company taking the \\"weakest\\" characters and placing them center stage, while the \\"best\\" characters, such as Lighting and Fang, were relegated to the background. Parish was disappointed in the character's development, saying that Serah was never given any true power within the game's narrative, and that Noel was under-developed beyond his original premise, with the \\"stronger\\" characters from the original game being a noticeable loss. On top of this, he disliked how the two \\"least liked\\" characters from XIII (Serah and Hope) were given such large roles. Parkin was especially critical, saying the characters were \\"irritating or forgettable, full of fuzzy or weak motivations and stuffed with tortuous, posturing dialogue\\". Despite this, he said that Serah's warmth endowed the game with a comforting atmosphere. The characters' resolutions in Lightning Returns received much criticism. Marty Silva of IGN found the writing for the characters uninteresting, and that the game had \\"forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place.\\" VanOrd stated that every character was \\"defined by the most basic of traits, all of which serve the needs of the plot, rather than the plot flowing from the needs of the characters.\\" He also felt that their dialogue was overly frequent and poorly written. GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick found Lightning off-putting, and saw the inclusion of the other characters as \\"more like a ham-fisted attempt at fan-service than a critical plot element.\\" Kotaku's Mike Fahey was also unimpressed both with Lightning and how the other characters had stayed very much the same between XIII-2 and Lightning Returns, with them needing Lightning to move on. Dave Riley of Anime News Network found that the characters had improved slightly over their previous appearances, saying \\"Dropping the pretense of stoic seriousness transmutes some of the sub-series's most insufferable elements into something marginally more tolerable, especially as it regards its main character.\\" References External links     Final Fantasy 13 ","title":"Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series"},{"id":"29877529","text":"The Committee on Industry and Trade, also known as the Balfour Report because it was chaired by the industrialist Arthur Balfour, was a committee set up to discover the reasons for the United Kingdom's economic decline since the Great War.

Basque Radical Rock, (, ) was a musical genre born in the Southern Basque Country at the beginning of the 1980s and, although there was no specific event, it is considered to have ended in the last years of the decade. Basque Radical Rock bands were particularly influenced by punk bands like Sex Pistols and The Clash. It was considered an underground movement, born in opposition to the values proclaimed by Francisco Franco and spread by thousands of people who felt with the Spanish transition to democracy their Basque national and social aspirations were betrayed. Cicatriz at a concert in the squat house of Hondarribia The name Basque Radical Rock was first used in 1983 in an article published in the newspaper Egin signed by Jos√© Mari Blanco (ex manager of the band La Polla Records), after a music festival against Spain remaining in NATO.F-M Hop: ¬´M√∫sica vasca: un poco de historia¬ª, en el dosier about Basque music by La Factor√≠a del Ritmo: March-July, 1996. The concept of BRR was very controversial from the beginning. Despite sharing a progressive mindset, anti-system stance and often a Basque nationalist view, some bands felt manipulated and denied the label as they considered it commercial. The band Eskorbuto, for one, claimed that \\"rock does not have any fatherland\\".Interview with EskorbutoInterview with Eskorbuto All the bands showed a social and political criticism and a high number of the lyrics criticised organizations in power, such as the Spanish state, the police, the Spanish monarchy, the Roman Catholic Church, the military, the bullfights and the Guardia Civil. Together with independent radio stations, fanzines, squat houses and some alternative groups, the movement surrounding the leftist pro- independence political party Herri Batasuna backed the movement. Herri Batasuna began in a campaign called Martxa eta Borroka (Rhythm and Fight) organizing rock concerts combined with political rallies. This helped the bands spread their music in the whole Basque Country. Moreover, thanks to the contests organized by the newspaper Egin, many bands became more widely known, e.g. La Polla Records, Hertzainak, Potato, Kortatu, RIP, Barricada and Cicatriz. History Zarama in Irun in 1986.  The birth of the movement  Before the invention of the label Basque Radical Rock, there were some minor radical bands in the Basque Country, but these had limited influence. In 1977 the first Basque punk-rock bands were created, mainly influenced by the rhythms coming from England. These bands spread across the Basque region and had limited resources. Linked to the punk philosophy that someone does not necessarily need to know an instrument to play it, more bands were quickly created. Odio (Hate), Basura (Trash), Vulpess, Optalidon, Cirrosis and RIP were some of the early bands, most of them hailing from industrial areas (Bilbao, Mondragon...). In the mid-1980s, as the movement grew stronger, some bands began to stand out and pull together a keen following determined to boost the movement ahead. These bands included Hertzainak, La Polla Records, Zarama, MCD, Eskorbuto, Barricada, RIP, Kortatu, V√≥mito and BAP!! However, Basque Radical Rock hardly left an imprint in the Northern Basque Country, where the punk outlook didn't take hold and rock bands developed along the lines of a concern for Basque culture and cleaner sounds (Minxoriak, Niko Etxart, Errobi,...). Approx. in 1987 the movement reached its peak when the compilation album Bat, bi, hiru... hamar was released by daily newspaper Egin, providing the springboard for many bands, who secured a wide audience. However, it was heralding by then the decline of the movement, gradually losing initial cohesion provided by rage and a common social outlook, diversifying and taking more individual paths. Softer tunes started to find a slot in the Basque society's taste and some BRR flagship bands were hard hit by drugs and AIDS, such as Cicatriz, RIP or Eskorbuto, while others decided to put an end to their course (Kortatu, last live album Azken guda dantza in 1988). Campaigns and contests Member of RIP, Jul (1986). The newspaper Egin, and especially the journalist Pablo Cabeza, had a big influence on spreading the BRR. The promoters of the movement used the music section of the newspaper to promote these bands' names and their philosophy. They also organized a competition (Egin Rock Txapelketa) to choose which were their readers' favourite bands. The final of the competition was held in the football stadium of Gasteiz and thousands of punk fans turned out. The bands receiving most votes in each Basque Spanish province were performing, namely RIP (from Gipuzkoa), Hertzainak (from √Ålava), Barricada (from Navarre) and Zarama (from Biscay). Another important step in spreading the movement was the campaign Martxa eta borroka (Rhythm and Fight) waged by the leftist pro- independence political party Herri Batasuna beginning in 1985. In this campaign political rallies were interspersed by concerts by BRR (RRV) bands. Despite some bands refusing to join the campaign, the initiative was very successful, allowing Herri Batasuna to correct the initial reaction people may have had against punk and rock music, linking it with drugs and the loss of the Basque awareness, and the BRR movement continued along these political lines. The gaining of social support and the increasing number of concerts had a big impact in a short period of time, and the movement that was initially marginal and supported by few people became common ground for thousands of Basque people. Many concerts were linked to the Basque National Liberation Movement, so many were supporting ETA prisoners, Nicaragua, ikastolas or Basque language schools, anti-nuclear movements, local squat houses or free radio, or against militarism, fascism, racism and sexism. Musically it was not a homogeneous movement. Different musical styles were played under the RRV banner. For example, Barricada played rock, Kortatu and Hertzainak ska and punk, Potato played reggae, Vomito dark rock, while La Polla Records and Cicatriz played punk-rock. It was the attitude rather the music that linked all these groups. The movement became known outside the Basque Country. Many groups, particularly those who sang in Spanish, played concerts in Europe or South America. Nevertheless, bands singing in Basque like Kortatu, Hertzainak and Jotakie, played in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and France. In particular the festival held in Barcelona (Catalonia) in November 1985 under the name of Basque Rock, attracted more than 10,000 people to see RIP, Hertzainak (who did not play because of trouble with the Spanish police), La Polla Records, Kortatu and Cicatriz. From Spanish to Basque I√±igo Muguruza, member of Kortatu playing in Egia Even though Spanish was the main language of the movement, some groups chose to sing in Basque, notably Hertzainak and Zarama. Despite the fact they came from very different areas, they both made the same decision, i.e. punk in the Basque Country had to be sung in Basque. The singers of both bands (Xabier Montoia of Hertzainak (who later would create M-ak) and Roberto Moso of Zarama) decided to learn the language. Some groups switched from Spanish to Basque, notably Kortatu, who released their first album only in Spanish. They gradually added more songs in Basque, with their last album Kolpez kolpe featuring a Basque language only track list. Fermin Muguruza, the singer of the band, learnt the language and would later create other bands like Negu Gorriak with virtually all lyrics in Basque. Danba and BAP!! evolved along similar lines. Independent record companies and the media The consolidation of the movement is linked to the social-political reality of the Basque Country in the 80's. The massive birth of black and white fanzines, the network of free radio stations and the squatting movement had a big influence on spreading everything related to the BRR. At the beginning of the decade of the 80s the first independent record companies were created: So√±ua Oihuka, Discos Suicidas and Basati Diskak, while informal magazines reported on the bands recording their discs with these record labels. Slowly the movement initially created in an underground environment of bands, recording studios and managers, became more professional. Record companies such as Elkar, IZ and So√±ua opened recording studios and the first sound technicians, such as Jean Phocas, C√©sar Ibarretxe, Kaki Arkarazo and Angel Katarain, were trained there. The movement even created its own rock management agencies such as Matxitxa. Legacy As well as politics, there were other important influences on BRR, especially drugs. Hundreds of musicians and fans died of heroin. Many others who survived the addiction later discovered they had the AIDS virus, which was unknown at the time. The music and attitudes of the period struck a chord in the whole Basque Country and are still important for many young people. BRR also had a rebirth when many younger bands released their first records inspired by bands such as La Polla Records, Hertzainak, Eskorbuto or RIP, instead of looking for references in the US or England. Some of these bands are Etsaiak, Soziedad Alkoholika, Negu Gorriak, Su Ta Gar, Berri Txarrak, Skalariak, Betagarri. Some other later bands from outside the Basque Country were influenced by the BRR, including Reincidentes, Boikot, Ska-P or Extremoduro in Spain, Banda Bassotti in Italy, and Mokoka in France. There was no clear end to the movement, but it occurred at the beginning of the 1990s, as newer bands began to play in more sophisticated music styles. Nevertheless, the influence of the movement is still present in bands, bars, town festivals and popular movements after almost 20 years.

Miami University Alumni Association, 2008. Web. 5 Oct. 2010. Other organizations began forming as well, including fraternities. Beta Theta Pi was founded in 1839 at Miami University and was the first of the Miami Triad of fraternities to be founded there.Havighurst, Walter. The Miami years, 1809-1984. New York: Putnam, 1984. Print Student and Faculty Conflict Disputes between the administration and fraternities reached a tipping point on January 12, 1848 with the Snowball Rebellion. Numerous students, many of whom were fraternity members, rolled snowballs up to the entrance of Old Main and blocked it, which was discovered early the next morning by the janitor, who informed then President Erasmus D. MacMaster of the snowballs. President MacMaster informed the faculty and students later that day at a chapel meeting, which all students and faculty members were required to attend, that those involved in the incident with Old Main would be expelled. This ultimately backfired though, for the following night even more students broke into Old Main and packed the main floor with snow, along with chairs, tables, benches, and the entire wood fuel supply for the winter, which then froze overnight. MacMaster expelled all students involved over the next two weeks, and Miami‚Äôs enrollment fell to 68 students. However, not wanting to close the university, the Board of Trustees fired MacMaster and hired William Anderson as the next president, who allowed Phi Delta Theta fraternity to be formed in December 1848. Other History Harrison Hall was home to not only academic tradition but also to athletic tradition. The Bell used in Battle for the Victory Bell between the University of Cincinnati and Miami University, who square off each year in football, originally hung in Old Main, which was near where the first football game was played in 1888. The Bell was rung for Miami victories and remained at Old Main until it began traveling with the winning team in the 1890s.‚ÄúTraditions.‚Äù Miami University Alumni Association. Miami University Alumni Association, 2010. Web. 6 Oct. 2010. Phi Kappa Tau fraternity was founded in the Union Literary Society Hall in Old Main in 1906. Before the construction of the new Harrison Hall, a fire occurred in December 1946. It was spotted by a group of students on Sunday, December 1 at 7:45 p.m. resulting in 150 dollars worth of damage, and destroyed one of the stained glass windows inside of Harrison Hall. Although the cause of the fire was never determined, one of the managers of the building believed that cigarette butts were the cause for the fire.The Miami Student. ‚ÄúUnexplained Fire In Harrison Hall Results In $150 Damages.‚Äù The Miami Student 6 Dec. 1946, Vol. 72, No. 22 ed.: 1.

It shows two flying figures hovering over a landscape dominated by a large tabled mountain.Junquera, 72 Asmodea is one of Goya's 14 Black Paintings‚Äîhis last major series‚Äîwhich, in mental and physical despair, he painted at the end of his life directly onto the walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo, outside Madrid. No written or oral record survives as to the series' intended meaning, and it is probable that they were never intended to be seen by those outside his then small immediate circle. Goya did not name any of the works in the series; the title of Asmodea was later given by his friend, the Spanish painter Antonio Brugada. The title is likely a feminine naming of the demon king Asmodeus from the Book of Tobias. Asmodeus also appears in the myth of the Greek Titan Prometheus, in which the goddess Minerva carries him to the Caucasus mountains. The Dog, Goya, 1821‚Äì1823. Museo del Prado, Madrid Two figures, one male and one female, are shown airborne, hovering above a broad landscape. The woman wears a white dress covered by a red-rose coloured robe. Both seem fearful, she covers the lower half of her face with her robe, his face is deeply disturbed.Cottrell, 75 They are each looking in opposite directions, while he points to a town on top of a mountain on the right of the canvas. Critic Evan Connell notes that the mountain's shape resembles Gibraltar, a refuge for Spanish liberals during the aftermath of the Peninsular War.Connell, 207 In the foreground, a row of French soldiers, resembling those from Goya's 1814 The Third of May 1808, take aim at a group of people passing in the lower distance. This group is traveling with horses and wagons, and are perhaps refugees fleeing from the earlier war with France, the victims of whom Goya had detailed so closely in his The Disasters of War. Atropos, Goya, 1821‚Äì1823. Prado, Madrid. Writer Richard Cottrell has noted the similarity in the colouring of the 'livid' sky with another work from the Black Painting series, The Dog. The work bears similarity to Atropos and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro, in that it utilises an elliptical visual device to distort the viewer's perspective. In this case the robe of the male flyer brings him almost out of the canvas and much closer to the viewer than the female flyer.Havard, 74 Like Atropos, this work is one of the only from the series in which its intended meaning can be deduced from its classical sources.Licht, 288 This work was originally created on cloth hung on a wall, and like most of the others in the series, painted over an earlier version of the scene.Junquera, 56 Goya placed the work on the side walls of the upper floor of the Quinta.Junquera,44 It was later transferred to canvas, and today is on permanent display with the other works from the series at the Museo del Prado, Madrid. According to writer Rolfh Kentish, it is an example of Goya's \\"versatility and capacity to reflect large and small groups, darkness and light, the naked and the clothed, landscape and interior, animals, day-to-day themes and themes of the imagination and, sometimes, a strange mixture of the two.\\"  References   Bibliography  * Connell, Evan S.

Bartik, Solving the Problems of Economic Development Incentives in Reining, in The Competition For Capital 103, 104 (Ann Markusen ed., 2007). In practice, however, it is a broadly used term denoting an array of benefits designed to promote new business activity or to encourage business or job retention. These benefits principally encompass tax and economic incentives provided by federal, state or local governmental bodies. Other entities, such as utilities and non-profits, can also make incentives available for these purposes. They accord the recipient, in some manner, a monetary benefit (i.e., tax incentives) or an in-kind benefit (e.g., state regulatory releases of environmental liability, municipal infrastructure improvements). Private enterprises, including individuals, are generally the ultimate beneficiary of economic development incentives. Depending on the incentive in question, other qualified parties are eligible to receive them, as in the case of municipalities, utilities, or economic development agencies. Typology of Incentives Economic development incentives consist of two classes of benefits: (i) one mandatory or automatic and (ii) the other discretionary. The former classes of benefits generally comprise tax incentives, which are established by federal, state or local law, immediately triggered by a specified type of business activity. For example, a private enterprise automatically qualifies for a state sales and use tax exemption or rebate when it purchases manufacturing equipment. Discretionary incentives can consist of either tax or economic benefits and can be established by federal, state or local law, by policy of a public body or other entity, or by negotiation among transaction participants. Generally speaking, discretionary incentives consist of more complicated arrangements than automatic or mandatory incentives, and necessitate a private enterprise to solicit the incentive from, and to negotiate with, the public body or other entity conferring them. Examples of Economic Development Incentives The following illustrates economic development incentives made available to private enterprises or other recipients: ‚Ä¢ Industrial development bond financing, exempting interest from federal or state income taxes, for designated capital expenditures. ‚Ä¢ Federal or state new markets income tax credits for qualified capital investment for low-income communities or for low-income persons. ‚Ä¢ State or local taxable bond financing used to effect ad valorem property tax exemptions. ‚Ä¢ Tax increment financing, allocating all or a portion of new taxes (i.e., ad valorem property taxes, sales taxes) generated by projects or capital investment for the direct or indirect benefit of a private enterprise. ‚Ä¢ Federal or state job training grants funded to local governments or private enterprises for the training of new employees or the re-training of existing employees. ‚Ä¢ Refundable or non-refundable state income tax credits for job creation or retention, or capital investment, by private enterprises. ‚Ä¢ Enterprise or development zones, exempting all or a portion of certain taxes otherwise imposed on property or business activity within the zone from state or local taxes. ‚Ä¢ State and local low interest or forgivable loans made available to private enterprises financing capital investment. ‚Ä¢ State grants or subsidies by public bodies to private enterprises for new project development. ‚Ä¢ Local property transfers to private enterprises at below market or nominal consideration. ‚Ä¢ State and local grants for the rehabilitation of environmentally impacted sites (brownfields sites) funded to local governments or private enterprises. ‚Ä¢ Utility incentives provided by utilities or non- profits for capital investment. ‚Ä¢ Local property tax exemptions for construction or retrofitting of buildings to qualify for LEED certifications. Considerations Affecting Economic Development Incentives A number of factors come into play in the adoption of economic development incentive programs by public bodies. This section summarizes certain of these considerations. Public bodies can develop well-articulated strategies, guiding their adoption and implementation of economic development programs.The Council for Community and Economic Research, 2012 State Economic Development Incentives Survey Report (May 2013). For example, the federal government can offer tax credits, encouraging development of renewable energy sources as a national initiative.See I.R.C. ¬ß 48C (2016). A state can promulgate economic development legislation as a tactical move, seeking to expand the presence of a particular business sector in its jurisdiction, while a municipality can adopt a special property tax incentive program oriented toward redevelopment of its central business district. An uninformed observation about incentives could lead one to the conclusion that a jurisdiction or local community with a weak business and employment base tends to offer more favorable incentives than one with a strong business and employment base. Although this correlation exists in certain instances, it is by no means an accurate reflection in each case of the approach public bodies take in allocating incentives to private enterprises.Alan Peters & Peter Fisher, The Failures of Economic Development Incentives, 70 Journal of the American Planning Assoc. Nos. 32, 33 (2004). For instance, a state with a strong business and employment base can leverage its financial position to offer incentive packages to a certain business class as a way to participate in an emerging national business sector. Similarly, a municipality with a weak business and employment base can be reticent to offer economic development incentives because of financial and political consequences. A municipality fitting this profile, however, could be receptive to providing incentives based on new project taxes, not otherwise available to it, generated by the recipient. The level of competition among adjacent jurisdictions or local communities, or other entities (i.e., utilities) can impact the adoption and implementation of these programs.Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute & Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016). A state may legislate an aggressive incentive program to preempt adjacent states from luring inbound businesses to their jurisdictions. A local community may, however, offer economic development incentives merely as a defensive measure to maintain parity with adjacent communities.Norton Francis, The Perils of Tax Incentives for Economic Development, The Policy Center, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution 6 (March 6, 2016). The composition of a state's or local community's economic base can be a factor in the adoption of incentive programs.Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute & Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016). A state may offer attractive incentive packages to an under-represented business class as a way to diversify its economy.Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute & Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016). Similarly, a local community can orient its incentive policies toward particular businesses in an effort to counterbalance its reliance on one business sector (e.g., manufacturing).Jonathan Morgan, Using Economic Development Incentives for Better or Worse, Popular Government 20 (Winter 2009). The state and local tax structure of a jurisdiction can affect the availability of incentives in the jurisdiction A state may offer to private enterprises a variety of economic development incentives to offset a higher income or property tax regime.Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute & Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016). Conversely, a jurisdiction with a low tax structure can be less inclined to promulgate aggressive incentive programs to benefit private enterprises. A public body's experience with an incentive program can impact its approach toward incentive arrangements. The prior experience with an insolvent company enrolled in a program can prompt a public body to adopt rigorous prequalification criteria as part of its incentive screening process. Likewise, the failure of a recipient to meet public body's expectations about a project (e.g., employment) can prompt it to impose strict project commitments on new incentive recipients. Conversely, an incentive program with a successful track record of business expansion or retention can encourage the expansion of the program or the adoption of new incentive programs. Different constituencies affected by economic development policies can also influence tax incentive programs or arrangements. Taxpayers often use the courts as a vehicle to challenge tax incentives.Sadloski v. Town of Manchester, 668 A.2d 1314, 1319 (Conn. 1995); see also Munger v. State, 689 S.E.2d 230 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010). Taxing districts constitute another pool of opponents to these programs. For instance, certain school districts not infrequently challenge tax incentive programs or arrangements because of a reduction or loss of their tax revenue allocations.E.g., Barker Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Niagara Cnty. Indus. Dev. Agency, 877 N.Y.S.2d 813 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009). Other public bodies can oppose tax incentives, as in the case of county tax authorities, because of their impact on taxing districts and public services.Bd. of Assessors of City of the City of New Orleans v. City of New Orleans, 829 So.2d 501 (La. Ct. App. 2002). Inducement Tests Many discretionary incentive programs require the recipient to meet an inducement test as one criterion to qualify for the incentive. Under this test, the recipient must demonstrate that the incentive in question has induced, on some basis, the targeted business activity. Depending on the program, it can consist on one end of the spectrum a stringent ‚Äúbut for test‚Äù used for tax exempt bond financing under federal tax law and frequently for many state taxable bond issue programs. On the other end of the spectrum, it can be a broad standard of conduct, demonstrating the recipients‚Äô general intention to initiate the targeted business activity as a result of the incentive. A private enterprise seeking an incentive under a more stringent inducement test typically must obtain some governmental or other action authorizing the incentive, such as a resolution or ordinance, before it can make contractual arrangements for the incentivized activity. As a case in point, prior to waiving closing conditions to purchase real estate, or entering into binding vendor contracts for a new project, a private enterprise must receive a resolution or other governmental action, authorizing the incentive from the relevant public body to satisfy this test. Therefore, incentive programs which have more stringent inducement tests often create practical issues for a private enterprise seeking incentives. They necessitate careful management of the underlying business transaction and the incentive transaction, including milestone dates, to meet the legal requirements of the incentive and the business objectives of the recipient. Clawbacks State and local public bodies sometimes establish investment, employment or other project commitments, which must be met and maintained during a test period in exchange for discretionary incentives. Under these arrangements, the recipient must repay all or a portion of the benefit received, if it fails to meet or maintain the designated metric of performance during the test period. These recapture arrangements are commonly referred to as ‚Äúclawbacks.‚Äù For example, if a recipient fails to create or maintain a minimum level of new positions during a specified test period, it may be required to repay a portion of the benefit based on a prearranged formula. In addition, non-governmental entities, such as utilities, can incorporate clawback provisions as part of their incentive packages. A utility offering an in-kind benefit to a private enterprise, such as the installation of on-site energy infrastructure improvements, can stipulate that the project must reach and maintain certain energy usage thresholds as a means for the utility to recover its investment. If the recipient fails to meet these requirements, the utility can assess a charge based on a prearranged formula analogous to a governmental clawback. The Critique of Economic Development Incentives Economic development incentives have come under close scrutiny from many quarters. They question the economic benefit to public bodies and local communities, and the wisdom of the public policies, promoting them. Some suggest that most incentives are relatively modest in relation to the incentivized business activity and, therefore, have no demonstrative impact on the recipient's decision making.Irene S. Rubin & Herbert J. Rubin, Economic Development Incentives: The Poor (Cities) Pay More, 23 Urban Affairs Rev. 37, 50 (1987) (outlining certain factors affecting local public bodies). As a corollary, some argue economic development incentives merely facilitate the relocation of a private enterprise's business or employment from one venue to another venue, and do not foster any new meaningful business activity.Luke Middleton, Tax Abatements and Economic Development Structures, The University of Kansas Center for Economic Business Policy Research Institute 8 (2001). Under this line of reasoning, a recipient can relocate essentially the same operation from one community to another community in a jurisdiction by taking advantage of the other community's ad valorem property tax incentive program. The incentive, in effect, cannibalizes the public resources of the jurisdiction at the expense of affected taxing districts.Norton Francis, The Perils of Tax Incentives for Economic Development, The Policy Center, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution 6 (March 6, 2016). Some commentators have also contended that these programs contribute to the corruption of public officials in their administration as a basis to discredit them.Christopher Olver, Who offers tax- based business development incentives?, Journalist‚Äôs Resource (May 24, 2016, 8:56 PM), http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/taxes/tax-based- business-incentives-corruption. The media have publicized flagrant conduct by some companies, and the mismanagement by certain public bodies, under these programs as a repudiation of economic development incentives.Louise Story, Lines Blur as Texas Gives Industries a Bonanza, N.Y. TIMES, (December 2, 2012). A Response to These Criticisms Negative commentary about economic development incentives can result in sweeping generalizations, without distinguishing the incentives used, the public policy goals sought, or the transaction participants involved. Federal, state and local governmental bodies by their nature have individual agendas in adoption of economic development programs, although they may be complementary. For instance, a state may promulgate legislation, mindful of its economic base as a whole, while regional development consortiums and local public bodies primarily focus their attention on more local considerations.Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning Local Economic Development Incentives, Local Economic Development Incentives in Northeastern Illinois 7 (August 2013). Economic development incentives vary in purpose and by type. For instance, a utility incentive designed to foster economic development in a local community has distinctive characteristics and goals from an ad valorem property tax incentive used to encourage redevelopment of blighted areas in that community. Similarly, state tax incentives directed toward capital investment are different from state income tax credits based on employment. Certain commentators view business operations or facilities as fungible objects, easily portable from one jurisdiction or community to another.Timothy J. Bartik, Solving the Problems of Economic Development Incentives in Reining, in The Competition For Capital 103, (Ann Markusen ed., 2007). Business relocations can, in fact, require significant investment, resources and personnel for planning and implementation. They can be disruptive to the business and undermine morale of employees, if not properly managed. Therefore, such decisions are not made lightly by businesses, irrespective of the availability of incentives to facilitate them.E.g.. The Ugly, Journal of Applied Research in Economic Development, Vol. 8 (March 2011). In addition, economic development incentives should not be viewed as merely promoting static business activity, but as structures promoting and capturing organic growth of the recipient at the project level and indirectly promoting growth of related businesses.Do Incentives Make Good Policy, Global Corporate Xpansion Magazine (June 14, 2013). Public officials no doubt have this expectation in mind by authorizing economic development programs, even in business and employment retention incentives. Critics of these programs also do not fully appreciate the increasing reliance of the private sector in today's business environment on economic development incentives for business expansion or retention. Incentive packages can constitute a meaningful contribution toward project investment. Consequently, business enterprises with incentive experience, frequently will include incentives as part of project site selection checklists and will treat them as relevant budget line items.Jonathan Morgan, What We Know about Economic Development Incentives, Joint Select Committee on Economic Development Incentives 16 (October 25, 2007). As a case in point, a recipient relies on incentives to offset higher development or operation costs (i.e., site or labor costs) in its selection of a location for a new project. The emergence of public-private partnerships reflects the importance that the private enterprises place on the availability of economic development incentives under these initiatives.Jenny Vickers, Feature Story: Public- Private Partnerships ‚Äì An Alliance For Progress That Works, Business Facilities, (August 20, 2014), http://businessfacilities.com/2014/08/public- private-partnerships-for-progress/. Furthermore, the sporadic occurrence of mismanagement or misuse of these programs by either public officials or private enterprises should not be used to undermine their efficacy to promote economic development as a whole. The inclusion of tighter prequalification criteria and effective control and other measures in economic development transactions by public bodies and other sponsors should mitigate many of these anomalies.Luke Middleton, Tax Abatements and Economic Development Structures, The University of Kansas Center for Economic Business Policy Research Institute 11 (2001).

Barometer World makes, sells and restores barometers of a variety of types. It was established in 1979 by Philip Collins. History In 1987 Barometer World moved from The Old Smithy in Merton to its current location at Quicksilver Barn. An exhibition of barometers was opened by Peter Negretti in 1990 and replaced by a new one now on display, the current premises comprises a shop, workshop, and the exhibition. Visitors are advised to e-mail or phone before turning up. The museum's curator is Philip Collins. He started learning the craft of barometer repair in Bideford at the age of 19, and in 1979 established a barometer specialist company. He is an author of barometer books having written numerous books on barometers and restoration techniques. Mr Collins is the secretary of the British Barometer Makers AssociationBarometer makers lose battle over mercury, Daily Telegraph Online, 6 June 2007. Accessed 4 Dec 2010 and was a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society. Exhibition The museum's main exhibition is a small display of different types of barometers and other weather forecasting items from examples of primitive weather indicators, a snorting barometer, a mining barometer, Fitzroy barometers and others to oddities such as a shark oil predictor and weather houses. The museum houses a full size replica of Merryweather's Tempest Prognosticator which was shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851. It is a fully workable copy, although the museum rarely operates it on a regular basis. Between 1995 and 2005 Barometer World housed the Banfield Family Collection of barometers. The exhibition was of 350 barometers, mostly owned by Edwin Banfield, which were loaned to Barometer World for a 10-year period. The collection has subsequently been separated and sold. For National Science Week 2000, Barometer World reconstructed Magdeburg Hemispheres in a demonstration on Great Torrington common. The demonstration used 16 shire horses and 24-inch-diameter hemispheres. On rare occasions Barometer World have staged special displays of the power of the atmosphere with a model of Brunel's 'atmospheric railway' tug of air and weighing the atmosphere. Workshop The museum has an on-site workshop where barometers can be made or repaired. However, since October 2009 the EU regulations resulting in the ban on using mercury, no new mercury barometers can be placed on the market. This has resulted in the workshop reducing its output, customers need to contact them before bringing any item. A replica glass kiln was made in 2001 as an experiment in 17th century glass production methods, it has since be removed. The kiln was built to 17th century designs, with a double fire box and double drawing points. The structure is built of two walls of modern building bricks, the inner layer on top of a layer of firebricks. The gap between the layers is filled with vermiculite and the outside is coated with a layer of lime-based daub and painted. Temperatures achieved from wood firing only are around 1300 degrees Celsius. Lead glass cullet from the nearby Dartington Crystal is generally used for experimenting when the kiln is fired.

She was a pioneer in the study of brain electrical activity and hormonal function in social processes, such as the development of status hierarchies in small social groups. Background Patricia Barchas was a pioneer in the field of sociophysiology - the effects of social behavior on the brain.Barchas, P. R. (1976). Physiological sociology: interface of sociological and biological processes. Annual Review of Sociology, 12, 299-33. She can be considered as one of the founder of social neuroscience. A native of Chickasha, Oklahoma, Dr. Barchas grew up in Los Angeles. She attended Pomona College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in English and History in 1956. She then went on to earn her master's in education from the University of Chicago. In 1971, she earned her doctorate in sociology at Stanford. She also spent many years studying neurophysiology and endocrinology. While at Pomona, she met her future husband, psychiatrist Jack Barchas who served for many years on Stanford's psychiatry faculty. Early in her career, Dr. Barchas taught emotionally disturbed children. Later, she joined the faculty of Stanford's Department of Sociology. She also served as a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, where she headed the Program in Sociophysiology of the Division of Child Psychiatry and Development. Most recently, she was a member of the research staff at the University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine. Academic achievements Patricia Barchas discovered that small amounts of alcohol could alter the formation and retention of social hierarchies in humans; showed that humans and non-human primates form new social hierarchies in analogous ways; and provided evidence that groups of human females and groups of human males use different social processes in solving problems, with the females being more consensual.Barchas, P. R., Harris, W. A., Angwin, P., & Barchas, J. D. (1979). Emergent social behavior and hormonal activity. In E. Usdin, I. J. Kopin and J. D. Barchas (eds.), Catecholomines: Basic and Clinical Frontiers (pp. 1699-1701). Elmsford, NY: Pergamon Press. Barchas was co-author of a report commissioned by Congress, dealing with aggression and violence, and was a co-author of an Institute of Medicine report dealing with mental disorders and substance abuse. Books authored by Barchas include Social Cohesion, Social Hierarchies, and Sociophysiology. Patricia R. Barchas Award The Patricia R. Barchas award in sociophysiology was established through a gift of a permanent endowment to the American Psychosomatic Society. The goal of the Barchas family in providing the endowment is that the recipient of the award be an individual (or more than one individual if they constitute a team) who is making or has made significant contributions to the study of the ways in which social behavior impacts on the physiology of the body in humans or in animals.

It is similar to Jaws, but it does not feature a shark, despite what the title suggests. To avoid confusion and to capitalize on the movie adaptation, the book was republished as Creature in 1997. Plot At the close of World War II, Nazi scientist Ernst Kruger perfects a biological weapon he calls Der Weisse Hai (\\"the Great White Shark\\"). The weapon is packed in a casket-like box and loaded aboard a German submarine to escape the Allied capture of Germany. When the submarine is attacked and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean, all hands, including Kruger, and the box containing Der Weisse Hai are lost at sea. Decades later, unsuspecting divers find the wreckage of the German submarine and recover the box, becoming the White Shark's first victims and inadvertently releasing it into the waters off Long Island, where it kills sea mammals, pets and random people. The novel's protagonist, a marine biologist named Dr. Simon Chase, examines several of the victim's corpses and concludes that the attacker can't be a sea creature, since its teeth and claws leave metallic traces. The creature's exact nature is not described or revealed until near the climax, when Jacob Franks, a Holocaust survivor, tracks down the protagonist and reveals he was forced to assist Kruger's experiments to create an amphibious human to act as the ultimate commando soldier. All of Kruger's test subjects were too weak to survive the experiments, until they were given a psychotic SS officer and ex- Olympic triathlete, who was surgically altered and psychologically manipulated into becoming Der Weisse Hai, including the implantation of steel claws and teeth. Before sealing him into the box, Kruger also put the Shark into a hibernation state, which enabled him to survive the decades following the war. Franks also explains that Kruger had taught the Shark how to drain his lungs and breathe air, but not how to reverse the process, meaning that once the Shark comes ashore, he will be unable to return to the water. Alarmed, Chase reveals to Franks that this has already occurred. Chase and his helper lure the Great White Shark into a decompression chamber and explode it. Miniseries adaptation White Shark was adapted into a 1997 miniseries called Creature. The film was set at a top secret island military base instead of a science lab. Additionally, instead of an amphibious human, the titular creature was redesigned as a human/great white shark hybrid capable of evolving legs, arms and lungs. It starred Craig T. Nelson as Simon Chase and Kim Cattrall as Dr. Amanda Mason (instead of Macy). It was primarily filmed on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia and in Vancouver. To take advantage of the movie's publicity and to avoid confusion with sharks, the book was republished as Creature in 1997.

Thus the dessert gets a pudding-like consistency.Taffel.se. Kalvdans: Utrotningshotad delikatess Due to Swedish health regulations, unpasteurized milk may only be sold directly from the farms. Thus the capacity to produce kalvdans is somewhat limited. As a consequence kalvdans is very rarely prepared in Swedish households today.

Early life and career Born as Helena Johanna Strassburger in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, she was the youngest of six children in a large German American family. After high school, she studied with Anna Shram IrvinHelen Boatwright biodata profile and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in music from Oberlin College. Her operatic debut was as Anna in a production of Otto Nicolai's The Merry Wives of Windsor at Tanglewood. During her career, she worked with many important figures in the world of music, including conductors Leopold Stokowski, Erich Leinsdorf, Seiji Ozawa and Zubin Mehta. She also performed with Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood in the 1940s, sang opposite tenor Mario Lanza in his operatic stage debut, and performed for President John F. Kennedy in the East Room of the White House in 1963. In 1954, she became the first person to record a full-length album of Ives' songs, 24 Songs, with pianist John Kirkpatrick. She also studied with composer Normand Lockwood. Another particular favorite composer of hers was Hugo Wolf. She knew his songs intimately, and in her later years she nearly always included a set or even an entire half of a recital of his work. She met her future husband, violinist Howard Boatwright (who died in 1999), in Los Angeles in 1941 when they were to perform in a National Federation of Music Clubs competition. They married two years later, on June 25, 1943, and had three children. They performed together throughout their married life in North America, Europe, and India. Many of her husband's compositions for voice were written for her. Other notable orchestral and choral groups she sang with were Paul Hindemith's Collegium Musicum, Alfred Mann's Cantata Singers, and Johannes Somary's Amor Artis Chorale. Later career In 1964, her husband Howard became the dean of the Syracuse University School of Music and she joined him teaching there. In 1969 the Boatwrights established a university- sponsored summer program, L'√âcole Hindemith in Vevey, Switzerland. They taught and performed there every summer until 1988. She was a professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester from 1972 to 1979, and was a guest professor at Cornell University and the Peabody Conservatory of Music at Johns Hopkins University.

It is the largest such organization in the region.Citizens Bank, Citizens Bank Foundation announces $25,000 donation Dated July 28, 2010. Retrieved on December 7, 2010 History The organization was founded in 1984 by Pam Lawler. In the year 2005, it merged with The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, and the new entity operates under the name Philabundance.AllBusiness, Philadelphia's Two Largest Hunger Relief Organizations Merge, January 28, 2005. Retrieved Jan 3, 2010.Snapshot Philabundance, Retrieved January 3, 2010. Goals The organization aims to drive hunger from our communities today and end hunger forever. Organization Philabundance serves 90,000 people each week, 30% of whom are children, 15% of whom are seniors, and others served include students, the working poor, veterans and single parents. It has its own programs, as well as a network of 350 agencies, including emergency kitchens, shelters and soup kitchens. As of 2017, 1 in 8 people in the U.S. face hunger while in our area, that number is 1 in 5, making hunger a crisis in the Delaware Valley on which we need all need to collaborate to eradicate. Philabundance works with local grocers and farmers to rescue perfectly good food that would otherwise go to waste; in 2016, it rescued 10 million pounds of food for its neighbors in need. The organization also hosts events alongside the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.https://www.philabundance.org/learn/about-us/programs/grocers-against- hunger/ Trends Clients Who Volunteer - Many of Philabundance's 15,000 volunteers are also clients, especially at its Fresh for All program. These volunteers spend 2‚Äì3 hours a week distributing food to others, while they themselves need help, and are allowed to take the same amount of food as those attending the program. Hungry Students ‚Äì Due to rising tuition, and the rules around qualifications for SNAP benefits, many college campuses are seeing a rise in the number of hungry students enrolled. As a result, many schools are opening pantries on campus to serve those in need. Philabundance's partner, the Chester County Food Bank, and other Feeding America food banks have partner with colleges to ensure this population has enough food to survive and thrive in school. Philabundance will soon follow suit. Programs * Fresh For All Program - To help families and individuals in need gain access to fresh vegetables and fruits, Philabundance operates Fresh For All Program at 9 locations in PA and NJ. * Senior Boxes Program - Gives USDA-sponsored food boxes to approximately 5,000 low-income senior citizens. * Philabundance Community Kitchen - A culinary, vocational job training program that teaches low-income and unemployed individuals life and job-readiness skills. * Grocers Against Hunger- a food rescue program that allows participating grocers to donate surplus inventory to Philabundance. The food is later distributed to clients through direct service programs. In 2015, the program saved 10 million pounds of produce that would have otherwise gone to waste. * KidsBites - The KidsBites initiative provides access to nutritious food in low-income areas for children and their families to help ensure that kids in our service area have the food they need to thrive and grow. Since its inception, KidsBites has provided almost 250,000 pounds of food to children and their families. To meet the needs and size of different communities, Philabundance offers several program models: Mobile pantry; BackPacks; and LunchBoxes. Contributions Received A multitude of generous individuals, foundations and corporations support Philabundance. Following are some of the largest annual contributions: * Phans Feeding Families: The Philadelphia Phillies and the Citizens Bank, sponsor the annual Phans Feeding Families program, which consists of a night at the ballpark at which there are raffles and fundraisers to benefit Philabundance, as well as food collections at AT&T; station and Citizens Bank Park. As part of its support of Phans, Citizen Bank makes an annual donation of $40,000 to support Philabundance' KidsBites initiative. * SEPTA Stop Hunger at Your Station - The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) supports Philabundance annually, by collecting food at more than 40 SEPTA stations. Stations also collected money, leading to tens of thousands of meals for our neighbors in need. * 93.3 WMMR's Preston & Steve Camp Out for Hunger ‚Äì Every year since 1998, Preston & Steve hold a five-day \\"Camp Out for Hunger\\" event ‚Äì most recently, at Xfinity Live! This is the largest single- location food drive in the county, raising more than 2.6 million pounds of food and $200,000 in 2019's drive and over 14 million pounds in since its inception. The event was aimed at increasing hunger awareness, as well as collecting food for Philabundance. The event featured popular bands and distinguished guests showing their support for Philabundance. Keeping with tradition, Preston and Steve camp at the spot in a trailer all through the week. * 6abc's Holiday Food Drive: Each year, 6abc and partners Dunkin Donuts and ACME raise food, funds and awareness of Philabundance from Thanksgiving through the New Year. Elements of the campaign include donations at ACME stores, a 6abc telethon and Dunkin Donuts in-store promotions. * Toyota Hauls Away Hunger: The Toyota Dealership Association of the Delaware Valley holds a literal food drive each December in which more than 50 Tundras caravan from Philabundance's warehouse in North Philly to Citizen Bank Park parking lot, hauling food to help feed those in need.

Its mission is \\"to prevent the crime of genocide worldwide through effective early warning and cooperation with victimized peoples to carry out non-violent prevention initiatives.\\" The Sentinel Project was founded in 2008 by two students, Taneem Talukdar and Christopher Tuckwood, at the University of Waterloo. In 2009, the Sentinel Project's approach was selected as a finalist in Google's 10 to the 100th competition for innovative social application of technology. This organization has been recognized as one of four active anti-genocide organizations based in Canada and is a member of the International Alliance to End Genocide, and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect. Operations (L to R) SP Volunteers Abhishek Bhatnagar, Mikel Cavia and Lisa Leong The Sentinel Project is developing a genocide risk assessment, forecasting and situation monitoring process to monitor vulnerable communities worldwide. Their objective is to systematically collect and assess data using a framework of analysis based on existing genocide research. This framework is used to systematically track \\"Situations of Concern\\" (SOCs), release regular forecasts and guide response strategies. Regular threat assessment updates with background analysis on root cause and context are consistently released. The Sentinel Project works with vulnerable communities to develop non-violent strategies and counter-measures to address the risk factors and operational processes identified as the underlying causes of the genocidal threat by effectively engaging target communities, policy-makers, NGOs and the media and developing on-the-ground information networks in SOCs. To support the process, the Sentinel Project had developed an online threat tracking, visualization, and broadcast early warning platform that aggregates public data from a wide range of sources in real-time: media stories, socioeconomic data, NGO reports, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, etc. The project released its first public threat assessment report in May 2009. This report focused on the persecution of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith community in Iran. Since then, the group released two other reports on Kenya and Azerbaijan, and is currently working on assessment reports on the risk of genocide in Myanmar, Colombia and Indonesia. The group's reports and analysis have been disseminated by various media sources and advocacy organizations. To support its mission, the organization plans to create a Sentinel Hub, one of the world's first workspaces dedicated to developing and employing technologies for predicting and preventing mass atrocities. Organization The Sentinel Project team comprises volunteers from a diverse set of backgrounds including Anthropology, Conflict Studies, Communications and Mass Media, History, Political Science, Public Relations, War Crimes Investigation, Military Intelligence and Software Engineering. The organization has 3 main teams: Research, Technology and Operations. The research team conducts the risk assessment process which involves collecting information based on existing research, is responsible for developing an effective Early Warning System (EWS) to predict and determine the likelihood of genocide occurring in a given SOC, monitors events in SOCs to identify genocidal processes and key actors responsible, and is also responsible for staying up-to-date with current developments in genocide studies. The Technology team is responsible for building the ThreatWiki software platform that enables on-going monitoring and analysis processes and the operations team supports the day-to-day functions of the organization, such as fund- raising and volunteer management. The team is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with some members in the United States. The Sentinel Project also comprises individual experts who make up the Advisory Council. Members of the organization's Advisory Council include Gregory Stanton, Adam Jones (Canadian Scholar), and Jack Chow. These individuals provide advice and guidance in key areas of expertise and fields such as Genocide Studies, Non-Profit Management, and Humanitarian Intelligence. Genocide prevention The Sentinel Project's EWS is meant to strengthen efforts to prevent genocide from occurring in areas at very high risk. Because many genocidal regimes throughout history have been sensitive to internal and external pressure during their preparation process, the Sentinel Project contends that the sooner the threat of genocide is identified, the more options there are for preventing it. While only military force can stop killing in progress, there are many non-violent options available for disrupting the genocidal process before extermination begins. When the threat of genocide is identified, the Sentinel Project aims to share the information with existing advocacy groups which can push for government and international measures while simultaneously consulting with subject-matter experts (SMEs) and targeted groups to craft preventive measures. Examples of such measures include countering hate speech often used to promote violence against specific groups. The Sentinel Project's EWS is a collection of people, tools and processes involved in gathering, analyzing and disseminating information on the risk of genocide. The EWS begins with Research Analyst examining the main characteristics that predispose a country to genocide. Research information is gathered from governmental, NGO, United Nations and academic sources. A list of risk factors is used to create a comprehensive risk profile before initiating active monitoring. Based on Gregory Stanton's \\"Eight Stages of Genocide\\" model, Operational Process Monitoring (OPM) begins when a country is declared an SOC during the risk assessment phase. Operational processes are the components of the overall genocidal process which facilitate the extermination of a specific group of people. The goal of OPM is to consistently gather event-based information from media and NGO reports, correspondents on the ground, and contacts within vulnerable communities. A Vulnerability Assessment is also done to examine the characteristics and actors within an SOC to determine a community's vulnerability to attack. Finally, analysts release regular situation forecasts in anticipation of situation developments and potential changes to the threat level of genocide. Social innovations Through its early warning capabilities, the Sentinel Project occupies a unique niche in the genocide prevention community. While many other organizations do the valuable work of maintaining watch lists of countries with violent, repressive governments where genocide could happen, the Sentinel Project's genocide early warning system fulfills a function not currently done by any other organization. The Sentinel Project strives to identify situations of concern at a much earlier stage when there are many options for prevention, and engages directly with the threatened communities to inform and empower them to participate in the prevention of their own genocides. From gathering information right through to implementing preventive measures, technology plays a key role in almost everything the Sentinel Project does. Here are a few major technological innovations developed by the organization to fulfill its mission: ThreatWiki The Sentinel Project launched its first prototype of ThreatWiki in May 2011 to start actively tracking and monitoring two situations of concern: Kenya and Iran. ThreatWiki is a data visualization platform that helps display operational processes within an SOC in the context of genocide threat. The platform presents an interactive display model that allows visitors to its website to be able to view and explore the root causes, relationships and operational processes behind an early warning released by the organization. The Sentinel Project is currently working on making Threatwiki an open source project and its source code repository is now live on GitHub. Research Analysts at the Sentinel Project use ThreatWiki to input data from reliable sources to track SOCs with the help of a visual time-line that enables them to track the SOCs more closely. ThreatWiki shows exactly where events such as arrests, arson, or raids have taken place and the data point is not just a vague point on the map; \\"we are talking about cities, towns, latitude, and longitude of the area where the incident occurred.\\" ThreatWiki also shows correlations on how incidents are related to one another according to how they are tagged. Improvements to ThreatWiki will soon make visualizations more interactive and informative. Hatebase Launched on 25 March 2013, Hatebase is the world‚Äôs largest online repository of structured multi-lingual, usage-based hate speech. It is an attempt by the Sentinel Project and Mobiocracy to create a repository of words and phrases that researchers can use to detect the early stages of genocide and remains in active development. Hatebase offers two main features: a Wikipedia-like interface which allows users to classify and record location-specific \\"sightings\\", and an authenticating API that allows developers to mesh Hatebase data with other tools for genocide prevention. Critics have identified the challenges of capturing, organizing, and conceptualizing communication data through a cultural lens such as The Human Stain conundrum i.e. some words are only hateful in specific contexts. Data collected through Hatebase alone therefore cannot be used to predict ethnic violence, but used in conjunction with other warning factors (such as those from ThreatWiki), can provide insights about when words are about to spill over into actions. Situations of concern Azerbaijan The Artsakh or NKR, an ethnic Armenian enclave has been claimed by Azerbaijan since its secession from the USSR in 1991. The ethnic Armenian population in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh is vulnerable, at risk of violence, and frequently the object of hate speech, sometimes by government officials. Since the 1992-1994 Nagorno-Karabakh War that followed the NKR secession and resulted in the occupation of former Azeri territory bordering the NKR by Armenian forces, more than 600,000 civilians have been displaced from their homes. Although pogroms, violence against civilians, and alleged genocide has occurred in the past, Azerbaijan‚Äôs ethnic Armenian population is protected by the autonomous but unrecognized state of Nagorno-Karabakh which maintains its own military and receives assistance from the Armenian government. Therefore, the risk of genocide in Azerbaijan is directly linked to the risk of war. The occupation of the NKR by Azeri forces would need to happen before mass atrocities could be committed. Through its application of genocide models and analysis the Sentinel Project has assessed that Azerbaijan does not exhibit many of the conditions often seen as precursors to modern genocides. The Sentinel Project‚Äôs Risk Assessment Report on Azerbaijan concludes that while the risk of genocide in Azerbaijan is high, in the event Heydar Aliyev's regime gains access to the ethnic Armenian population within the NKR, war is unlikely since it is seen as risky and potentially fatal to the regime. Iran Supplementary Report: The Threat of Genocide to the Bah√° º√≠s of Iran (2010) The Sentinel Project initiated its first SOC to assess the threat of genocide to members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Iran. Bah√° º√≠s comprise the largest religious minority in Iran, with an estimated 300,000 members in the country, but are highly persecuted by the government and some non-state groups for their religious beliefs. The Sentinel Project's May 2009 report identified several risk factors that contribute to a high threat of genocide against Iran's Bah√° º√≠s. These factors include economic stresses, prior persecution of Bah√° º√≠s, their exclusion from higher education and ongoing propaganda which links Bah√° º√≠s to foreign enemies. The report also identified various official security forces, such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, and semi-official paramilitary groups, such as the Basij militia, who could potentially or eventually be perpetrators of genocide against Bah√° º√≠. An update to this report was released in November 2010. The update outlined many new developments including the impact of the 2009 post- election violence and persistent tensions surrounding the Iranian nuclear program. The threat level was assessed to remain high, particularly since the regime had demonstrated its willingness (after the election) to use paramilitary forces to suppress what it views as internal enemies. Today, the threat of genocide to the Bah√° º√≠s of Iran remains very high because of the systematic persecution of the Iranian Bah√° º√≠ community, especially in the educational spheres and institutions, the arbitrary arrest of Bah√° º√≠ teachers, raiding of Bah√° º√≠ homes, discrimination of Bah√° º√≠ students in Iranian public schools, abductions of human rights activists by plainclothes agents, an increase in human rights abuses specifically targeted on the Bah√° º√≠s of Iran and an upsurge in executions of Iranians in general. Kenya ThreatWiki: Kenya SOC Correlations Kenya's recent transition to democracy has seen episodes of large scale violence as different groups compete for power. The 2007 Kenyan post-election period was characterized by severe unrest born out of a political and social order marked by ethnocentrism and intertribal antagonism after the Luos and Kalenjin disputed the outcome of the national elections as flawed. After a comprehensive risk assessment of social, economic and political factors that increase the likelihood of genocide in Kenya, the Sentinel Project's May 2011 report identified several risk factors including; a low degree of democracy, isolation from the international community, high levels of military expenditure, severe government discrimination or active repression of native groups, socioeconomic deprivation combined with group- based inequality and a legacy of intergroup hatred among other risk factors. Following its initial risk assessment report and with another national election scheduled for December 2012, the Sentinel Project maintained Kenya as a high risk situation of concern and responded by initiating an operational monitoring process to monitor the situation in Kenya as it developed on a daily basis. Through its continued monitoring and evaluation process, in November 2012 the Sentinel Project released an update to its annual assessment on the risk of genocide in Kenya in order to reflect recent developments that correspond to each of the 30 risk factors in its early warning framework. The Sentinel Project also responded by deploying a small team to Kenya in order to learn more about the work of the dedicated local groups trying to prevent violence in the country. The team conducted field work in the Tana River District, where there had been a series of small skirmishes and ethnic massacres which occurred between August 2012 and January 2013. In their Tana Delta Field Survey Report, the team highlighted the drivers of violence and potential preventive measures for decreasing the risk of violence from escalating. Some of the drivers of conflict that the team identified include: misinformation and conflicting accounts of occurring events, unverified reports of arms flows into the area, accusations of foreign interference, lack of title deeds for land, suspicions of political betrayal, and perceptions of government favoritism. The Sentinel Project recommends establishing a trusted, neutral source of information which can help to dispel much of the rumour and intentional disinformation that fuels violence in Tana River as a potential conflict prevention measure. The team also acted as observers in the general election which took place on March 4, 2013. The team's election monitoring role was directly related to the Sentinel Project‚Äôs risk assessment on the likelihood of mass atrocities in Kenya which determined that the presidential election was the most likely trigger for a repeat or even possible escalation of the 2008 post-election violence. Other The scope of the Sentinel Project's monitoring work includes three other situations of concern: Colombia, Indonesia, and Myanmar. These countries were selected by balancing their apparent risk levels with the organization's resources and the ability to have a positive impact on the ground. Partnerships The Sentinel Project seeks to cooperate with ethnic and religious communities; legislators, policy and decision makers in the United States, Canada and Europe; and other international NGOs to influence government policy towards SOC countries. The Sentinel Projects also seeks to partner with human rights and anti-genocide groups with well-established credibility and the ability to reach governments, institutions and civil society. These partnerships may also be for more effective information gathering or cooperation in disseminating reports. For example, while investigating the situation-of-concern regarding followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Iran, the Sentinel Project worked together with the Bah√° º√≠ Community of Canada and the Middle East-based Muslim Network for Bah√° º√≠ Rights. The Sentinel Project also works with both local and international non- profits or associations with a mandate that focuses on conflict, human rights or genocide and located in the SOC's geographical location. In Kenya, the Sentinel Project has started forming partnerships with two organizations, The Center for Human Rights and Democracy which boasts of a large network of conflict monitors in the Rift Valley and Uchaguzi, a Kenyan-based organization that takes a crowdsourcing approach in mapping indicators of ethnic violence before and during elections. The Sentinel Project is also a partner with the PAX Project, a technology-based data collection project currently being developed in the United Kingdom with the goal of preventing genocide and mass atrocities by assisting partner NGOs in monitoring the media and other information sources.

After attending art college in Czechoslovakia, he worked producing fine china at the Terra Company for twelve years, rising to head of ceramics design. Zavi fled to Canada just five days before the outbreak of World War II. Soon after emigrating, he married Nunzia D'Angelo (1900-1968), a maker of majolica and folk pottery, and they had two daughters together. First located on Gerrard Street in Toronto, the couple renamed their kitchen factory the Ceramic Art Studio. During the war years they produced a large array of ornamental pieces, sought after by buyers. Their output included ceramic fish, prancing horses, vases, candle holders, bowls, teapots and earrings. Zavi diligently experimented with glazes, and he was able to produce colours that included Chinese red. In 1945, he sculpted a bust of Tom√°≈° Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, which was unveiled at a public ceremony with the mayor of Toronto present. Zavi and D'Angelo relocated in 1946 to a rural setting outside Cobourg, where Zavi wanted to establish a ceramic arts centre. In the same year, he was the subject of two features by the National Film Board. His wife gave up studio work, although she appeared in public as a demonstrator and teacher for a few years at the Canadian National Exposition. In 1959, they moved to Brighton. Zavi maintained his studio practice as a lone artist, isolated from the craft community and museums and galleries. He built his ceramic structures with his hands, without wire or papier-m√¢ch√© molds. For his base material he used farm tile clay found in deposits near Arnprior. Zavi's works were not universally praised; one reviewer of an Ottawa exhibit found the pieces on display to be rather commercial and unexceptional, despite their beautiful execution. Somewhat unusually for a Canadian artist, he made his living entirely by his chosen art form. In 2014, some 40 to 50 of his pieces were displayed in a solo exhibition at a gallery in Brighton.

Among other things, the book explores and promotes the Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories and Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories in the form of a novel. In an interview on Fox & Friends, Leboutillier claimed that the book uses \\"real things\\" and has \\"so much real stuff\\". Following the interview, Media Matters for America published excerpts from the book in an article which criticized the book as having an \\"incomprehensible plot\\". Plot summary This book is a parody. Prior to Obama's election, the protagonist, a CIA agent named Theodore J. Higginbothem III, or \\"Higgy\\" uncovers a vast conspiracy surrounding Barack Obama. After Obama is elected, the protagonist attempts suicide, but is unsuccessful; afterwards, he goes to work for the president. Plot details The book presents various conspiracy theories about President Obama and other Democrats as fact, including that: *Obama is a Muslim and was tutored as a child by an Indonesian imam and attempted rapist who was described as plotting to \\"plant converted Muslims inside non-Muslim governments with the hope that they would someday rise to hold high governmental positions.\\" In the book, Obama's circumcision is described by the imam as having \\"cleansed Barry of his impure American ideas.\\" *Barack Obama was born in Mombasa, Kenya. *Bill Clinton avoided the draft because he was an undercover CIA agent. *Jeremiah Wright had a secret office underneath his church, which was used for organizing Obama's presidential campaign. *Obama's campaign was funded by China, Iran, Russia, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates, with help from a \\"Soros aide\\". *The late 2000s recession was purposely created by George Soros in order to get Obama elected. *Barack Obama wants to add his own face to Mount Rushmore and rename Chicago after himself. Other scenes depicted in the book include Jeremiah Wright demanding \\"100,000 a year in reparations for every black man, woman, and child\\", Obama having his feet washed by a \\"Filipino steward\\" and his cigarette smoke fanned away by \\"barely dressed Thai boys\\", and Katie Couric having \\"erect nipples...clearly visible through her blouse\\" while \\"in full swoon over Barack Obama\\" because she wanted to \\"go out on a date with\\" him. Reception Vanity Fair published an excerpt from the book, which it described as \\"satirical\\". The excerpt describes a fictitious episode of the Sean Hannity television show, in which Hannity interviews a conservative activist who believes that John F. Kennedy is still alive, that we never landed on the moon, that 9/11 was an inside job and that Obama's campaign is part of a \\"gigantic conspiracy by leftists to plant a Muslim in the Oval Office and to teach our children to wear shoes with Velcro instead of laces so they can take off their shoes when they come home.\\" Andrew Zarowny of the conservative website Right Pundits wrote a favorable review of the book, which he described as \\"hilarious\\".

In 1999 Chick died and management of the museum was transferred to the Elkhorn City Heritage Council. An organization created to preserve the history of the Elkhorn City area. The museum is still staffed by volunteers; most of whom are former railroad employees. Exhibits More than 1,000 pieces of railroad memorabilia are on display, including two cabooses, velocipedes, motor cars, antique uniforms and equipment. Also on display are exhibits detailing the completion of the Clinchfield Railroad which was considered an engineering marvel at the time. All items and exhibits have been donated to the museum.

Reports The committee's interim report on certain essential industries argued for a Special Industries Board to scrutinise industrial development and promote the manufacture of strategically essential products. This Board should offer state support for efficient businesses but \\"failing efficient and adequate output, the Government should itself undertake the manufacture of such articles as may be essential for national safety\\".Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (London: Eyre & Methuen, 1972), pp. 116-117.

These recommended that British industries should be protected from dumping after the war; that the enemy's economic domination should be countered; and that key industries should be protected. In return for being protected, industry would be obliged to accept the state's conditions for support: cooperation between employer and employees was recommended, as was profit sharing and state control over industrial combinations. The committee's final report dealt with the future of British industry both in commercial competitiveness and capacity for war: > It is in our opinion a matter of vital importance that, alike in the old- > established industries and in the new branches of manufacture which have > arisen during the war, both employer and employed should make every effort > to attain the largest possible volume of production, by the increased > efficiency of industrial organisation and processes, by more intensive > working, and by the adoption of the best and most economical methods of > distribution. > [And] it is only by the attainment of this maximum production and efficiency > that we can hope to secure a speedy recovery of the industrial and financial > position of the United Kingdom and assure its economic stability and > progress.Barnett, p. 117.

It bears many similarities to a chair. It consists of a single seat, for one person, without back or armrests (in early stools), on a base of a stool there are either one , two, three or four legs. A stool is generally distinguished from chairs by their lack of arms and a back. Variants exist with one, two or five legs and these various stools are referred to by some people as \\"backless chairs\\". Some modern stools have backs. Folding stools can become flat, typically by rotating the seat to be parallel with fold-up legs. Some stools are designed with three legs; because three points define a plane, these will not wobble, even if placed on an uneven floor.  History  The origins of stools are lost in time although they are known to be one of the earliest forms of wooden furniture. The diphros was a four-leg stool in Ancient Greece, available in both fixed and folding versions. Percy Macquoid claims that the turned stool was introduced from Byzantium by the Varangian Guard, and thus through Norse culture into Europe, reaching England via the Normans. Table and stools from Bulgaria Milking stool In the medieval period, seating consisted of benches, stools and the very rare examples of throne-like chairs as an indication of status. These stools were of two forms, the boarded or Gothic stool, a short bench with two board-like feet at the ends and also the simple turned stool. Turned stools were the progenitor of both the turned chair and the Windsor chair. The simplest stool was like the Windsor chair: a solid plank seat had three legs set into it with round mortice and tenon joints. These simple stools probably used the green woodworking technique of setting already-dried legs into a still-green seat. As the seat dries and shrinks, the joints are held tight. These legs were originally formed by shaving down from a simple branch or pole, later examples developed turned shapes. Artefacts of the three-legged stools are extant from the 17th century, as is an illustration of an early turned stool of this period., reprinted in One of the uses for three-legged stools is for farm workers in milking cows. Later developments in the 17th century produced the joined stool, using the developing techniques of joinery to produce a larger box-like stool from the minimum of timber, by joining long thin spindles and rails together at right angles.  Royal stools  Several kingdoms and chiefdoms in Africa had and still have traditions of using stools in the place of chairs as thrones. One of the most famous of them, the Golden Stool of the Asantehene in Ghana, was the cause of one of the most famous events in the history of colonized Africa, the so-called War of the Golden Stool between the British and the Ashanti.  Backstools  The backstool represents an intermediate step between the development of the stool and the chair. A simple three-legged turned stool would have its rear leg extended outwards and a crossways pad attached. Backstools were always three-legged, with a central rear leg. Turned backstools led in turn to the development of the three-legged turned chair, where the backrest was widened and supported by diagonal spindles leading down to extensions of the front legs. In time these diagonal supports became larger, higher and more level, leading to the turned armchair design. Early modern stool made of wood  Modern backstools  In modern times, the term \\"stool\\" has become blurred, and many types now have backs. These are particularly common among bar stools, tall stools for seating at a counter, often fixed in place. These are a development of the chair as much as the stool, made more compact to allow dense seating around a serving table or counter. They may even be referred to as \\"backless chairs\\". One type of stool, Windsor-back stools, which \\"are popular in traditional homes\\", has a back. Such backstools developed from around 1900, with the advent of modern materials such as bentwood and later the bent steel tube of Marcel Breuer's work at the Bauhaus. These isotropic materials no longer depended on the shapes of traditional joinery, as developed for earlier stools, and so strong backs could be attached arbitrarily, without relying on particular leg placements for strength.

It is the seat of the suffragan Diocese of San Sebasti√°n and subordinated to the Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela. The most remarkable religious building of San Sebasti√°n, it is endowed with a strong verticality and is the largest in Gipuzkoa. Its construction took place in the last years of the 19th century in a Historicist Neo-Gothic style. The church, dedicated to the Good Shepherd, has held the rank of cathedral since 1953. History In 1881 a Royal Order created a new parish division in San Sebasti√°n. This new division included the creation of a parish, claimed for years by locals in the southern part of the city, which later became known as the \\"Ensanche of Amara\\". In August 1887 the City Council gave an area between the river Urumea and Beach of La Concha, occupied by sand dunes and marshes, to build the church. Until it was finished, the spiritual needs of the local congregation were met by a provisional parish, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Opened in March 1888, this rudimentary church was made of wood and was between Loiola and Pr√≠ncipe Streets. The queen regent, Maria Christina of Austria, and her son, King Alfonso XIII, opened the church in 1897 In December 1887 a construction meeting chaired by the Dean D. Mart√≠n Lorenzo de Urizar Zalduegui-Ari√±o defined the bases of the project competition and set a budget of 750,000 pesetas, and like the capacity of the church and its architectural style, it should be pointed. Four projects were presented, with the chosen design being by the donostiarra architect Manuel de Echave, who was entrusted with the supervision of works. The new church would be dedicated to the Good Shepherd. The Spanish Royal Family, who were vacationing in the city, were invited to the laying of the foundation stone. The events took place on September 29, 1888. The queen regent, Maria Christina, her children and the Infante Antonio, along with ministers and other officials, attended the solemn mass that the diocesan bishop D. Mariano Miguel G√≥mez held in the provisional parish church of the Sacred Heart. Following the ceremony, the royal entourage moved to the site of the new church and there proceeded to lay the foundation stone, which covered a lead box in which were enclosed pictures of the Pope and the Royal family, various coins of the time and copies of the Gazette of Madrid and of the Ecclesiastical Gazette. The minutes of the ceremony were signed by the baby king Alfonso XIII, aged two years and four months, for which his mother had to take his hand. It is the first signature of Alfonso XIII on an official document. Manuel de Echave went on to oversee the works having as master of the same Jos√© Vicente Mend√≠a and, after his (Mendia) death, the master mason Agust√≠n de Zumalabe. The foundation work required a careful drainage of the site to provide consolidated sand. For the general architecture the sandstone quarries of Mount Igeldo were chosen. The vaults were made with tufa from Ocio (√Ålava) and slate roofs were brought from Angers (France). The workers were all Basques. For the size of the stone of the capitals, ornaments, windows and needles that decorate the interior and exterior, the models presented by the local artist Julio Gargallo were accepted. View of the interior of the Cathedral After just nine years of work (including almost two in which work was suspended for lack of resources, and the tower was not yet crowned), the Church of the Good Shepherd was consecrated for worship on July 30, 1897. Again, the Royal Family, the Queen Regent Mar√≠a Cristina, King Alfonso XIII and the Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa attended the grand ceremony. The mass was officiated by D. Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez de Pi√©rola, Bishop of Vitoria, the diocese to which then belonged Guipuzkoa. The tower was completed in 1899 under the direction of Ram√≥n Cort√°zar. In the end, the construction of the church cost more than 1,500,000 pesetas, and that was not including the altars and altarpieces. Pope John Paul I's papal bull Quo Commodus of November 2, 1949 created the Diocese of Bilbao and San Sebasti√°n seceding from the Diocese of Vitoria. The first bishop was the Catalan ecclesiastic Jaime Font i Andreu, appointed to office on May 13, 1950 and took office on September 3 that year. With the need to choose a Donostiarra church to host the local diocese, the choice was, by its magnificence and modernity, the Church of the Good Shepherd. On July 30, 1953, finally, the church achieved the rank of Cathedral with the consecration of the new altar, acting as pastor D. Ignacio Lasquibar Olaciregui, who in 1954 took over from D. Rom√°n Mendiguchia. After four years of reforms and changes that were needed to put the church to its new use as a diocesan church. For this the presbytery was transformed with the installation of a new table after the removal of the original altar, of a florid Gothic style, carved in cedar wood by the Barcelonese workshops of Juan Riera, it was replaced by choir stalls and an image of the Good Shepherd. The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was transformed into a chapter house, and the Chapel of Christ, in the crypt, became the new parish vestry, leaving the former sacristy for the exclusive service of the council. In 1972, Bishop Jacinto Argaya Goicoechea undertook a second improvement of the church to mark the 75th anniversary of his inauguration. The neo-gothic pulpit made by Nicol√°s Medive, which was attached to one of the pillars, was removed. Also removed were the altars dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, Virgin of the Rosary and Virgin of the Pillar. The roofs and windows were restored and walls and vaults were cleaned. The old floor of American oak was replaced by a new one in marble. The interior lighting was improved and new benches were installed. Description View of a facade of the Cathedral In the plans of the architect Manuel de Echave, who apparently was inspired by Cologne Cathedral, the dimensions of the church consist of: * an area of , * a nave height of , * a tower of , * a central nave of long by wide at the crossing, * and a capacity of 4,000 people. This is a church with a Latin cross, three longitudinal aisles, transept nave and a pentagonal sanctuary. There is no ambulatory. The two gables of the transept house two large rose windows that accentuate the light inside the church. The naves up to the crossing, of which the wider and the highest is the central, are segmented into five rectangular sections covered with four-parts vaults of simple ribbing. The two arms of the transept consist of two sections arched in the same way. The crossing is the only section that features complex ribbing, incorporating tiercerons between the main veins. From the crossing to the head, the naves are extended with three sections. In this posterior space, the four aisles, two on each side, balance the width of the transept, resulting in two separate areas of equal height and divided into six sections separated by four pillars. The slender bell tower, located on the portico of the entrance, is clearly inspired by the spires of the Cologne Cathedral. The set of pilasters and buttresses terminating in pinnacles and spirelets decorated with buds enhance the verticality of the building. Indoor furniture The Main Chapel, since the reform of 1972, appears austerely furnished by choir stalls worked by the Goicoechea y Ar√≠n workshop of Vitoria. On it, resting on a pedestal that hangs from the central boss of the apse, the sculpture of the Good Shepherd, which was on the original Neo-gothic altar. A work of the Barcelonan artist Joseph Llimona, also maker of the figures of the Four Evangelists, from the old altar and which today are on the pillars of the crossing. Under the rose windows of the transept the initial design included two small pedestrian doors that were finally replaced by two altarpieces, of Neo-Gothic style and gold-covered, these were placed as the devotions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Conception of Mary. They were installed in 1907 and 1917. Other items of interest are the altars and shrines of the Holy Family, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Saint Anthony and Francis of Assisi, works by Julio Gargallo. This artist also worked on the altars of Teresa of √Åvila and Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The sculpture of the Our Lady of the Rosary presided over an altar that was decommissioned in 1972. Windows of the header Crypt Located under the presbytery, the crypt functions as parish sacristy since the reform of 1949-1953. The remains of first parish priest, D. Mart√≠n Lorenzo de Urizar, are entombed here.. Stained Glass The cathedral's stained glass was designed by Juan Bautista L√°zaro and made by the workshop of Bolinaga and C√≠a., from Le√≥n, and Pujol, from Barcelona. That which occupies the seven double windows of the apse represents the twelve apostles and the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. There are also figurative windows in the baptistry. The rest of the stained glass is incorporated in double (at top) and triple (at bottom) windows and runs around the most of the side walls. Two rose windows open at the ends of the transept. Organ The current organ is the second that has been in the cathedral. It was installed in 1954. According to data published at the time, it was the largest organ in Spain and one of the largest in Europe. Its main console consists of five keyboards for hands, one for feet and 106 stops; also, in the presbytery lies an \\"echo organ\\" with two manual keyboards, pedals and 20 stops. The choir organ houses in its interior and exterior 9,535 pipes, the largest measures 10 meters, the whole thing weighing 30 tons. The huge instrument cost more than 1.5 million pesetas, thanks to the legacy of the Ferm√≠n Lasala, Duke of Mandas (1832‚Äì1917). It was built by Organer√≠a Espa√±ola, of Azpeitia, and its pumps, of several horsepower, were purchased from the workshop of Meindinger from Basel.

Construction started in 1923, funded by a donation from Laura Ogden Whaling. The building was renovated and extended in 1999. Originally it was a residence for male students, but now serves as a dining hall and residence for both male and female students. History In 1923 Laura Ogden Whaling donated $430,000 to Miami University to build a hall of residence in her brother's honor. Her brother, George C. Ogden, graduated from Miami in 1863 and went on to receive his medical degree from the Ohio Medical College. It was part of her request that the Hall must be located west of the Herron Gym, directly across the street from Lewis Place, the President's home. But the president did not want a building directly across from Lewis Place; he wanted green space on either side of the slant walk. So in order to keep with Laura Ogden Whaling's wishes, Herron Gym was moved down the street to what is now the parking lot adjacent to Roudebush Hall. The cornerstone of Ogden Hall was laid on October 12, 1923. The stone was laid by the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge in Ohio, Mr. Harry S. Johnson, of Cincinnati. He was assisted by President Hughes, members of the Board of Trustees, and other University officials. Ogden Hall was the first men's dormitory built on campus since the North and South Dorms were built. It also provided for a place for social activities, as it had a men's auditorium, Y.M.C.A. quarters, game rooms, and a number of conference rooms, in addition to housing 114 men. Ogden Hall was designed by Dittoe, Fahnestock & Ferber Architects and cost $330,000.00 to build in 1924. The general contractor was Fred Wood (Physical Facilities - Ogden Hall). It was to be a three-story red brick, stone trimmed, red tile roof Colonial building, which fit in with the rest of the architecture on campus (Ogden Hall Corner Stone to be Laid). Rumors and ghost stories The Ogden Hall Wall The rumor is that when Laura Ogden Whaling donated money to Miami University, in order to build a new men's dormitory in her brother's name, she made a demand that a wall should be constructed around the new structure to keep it private. After the dormitory was built, it was rumored that Miami did indeed build the wall, but underground. The rumored wall was actually the foundation of the old Miami gymnasium. The gymnasium had to be moved during the construction of Ogden Hall because of the location wanted by Laura Ogden Whaling for the dormitory. Currently there is a tradition that the ‚Äúwall‚Äù was built to keep men out of what would become a women's residence hall. Present: recent renovation In 1999, the building undertook renovations to update the building to then current accessibility and building code standards and to update the dinner facility. The new, state-of-the-art facility, Bell Tower Place, contains many traditional campus brands such as: ‚ÄúHome Style Traditions‚Äù, ‚ÄúPizza Pi‚Äù, ‚ÄúSonora Stop‚Äù, ‚ÄúSunrise Bakery‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Bell Tower Coffee Company‚Äù, ‚ÄúCampus Grill & Steak House‚Äù, and ‚ÄúUncle Phil‚Äôs Deli‚Äù. A new addition to Bell Tower Place was ‚ÄúMiami Spice‚Äù, a noodle-based menu format that utilized a new state- of-the-art concept in food preparation. At ‚ÄúMiami Spice‚Äù students are able to participate in the production of their meals, choosing ingredients and passing them directly to the cook. Also with this addition came the expanding of seating and a new outdoor plaza caf√©. Cincinnati-based architects, GBBN, carried out the renovations. GBBN Architects did . of renovation and a . addition to Ogden Hall. They created 9 food stations, 4 themed interior dining areas, a formal dining area, and an outdoor caf√© (Ogden Hall). This new addition cost $6,103,444.00 and the projects contractor was Wright Seyferth. The building is currently used as a dining hall and a residence hall for freshman students.

It was written by Jonathan Lincoln and has art done by Francis Tsai, Derek Donovan, and Abhishek Malsuni.Lincoln, Jonathan (2010) Tracker, Top Cow Productions, Inc. History Tracker premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con International Convention in 2009. Tracker is a five issue comic book mini series written by Jonathan Lincoln with art by Francis Tsai, Derec Donovan and Abhishek Malsuni. Plot Tracker tells the story of an FBI agent named Alex O‚ÄôRoark, whose pursuit of a serial killer leads him to unexplored territory when it is revealed the killer is also a werewolf. Tracker #1: \\"Survivor\\" FBI Agent Jezebel Kendall is called to the scene of a grisly murder - all passengers on the Blue Line bus have been killed. Jezebel thinks this is the work of Herod, a psychopath killer the FBI has been tracking. Amongst the bodies she finds her partner, Agent Alex O'Roark, barely breathing. Alex miraculously survives, but only with fragmented memories of the incident. He's approached by a mysterious doctor, Cyril Tucker, who tells Alex to contact him once his memory returns. Alex goes back to work; with the help of Agent Isaiah Grant, commander of the FBI's SWAT team, Alex and Jezebel anticipate Herod's next move. Herod kills the only other survivor of the bus attack; Alex tracks him down, but soon loses him. Alex's obsession with the case takes a toll on his personal life. He suddenly loses his temper, has a fight with his girlfriend, Tory Reyes, and storms out. He goes to a bar and leaves a message for Dr. Tucker. After downing shot after shot, yet still unable to wind down, Alex goes looking for trouble, which he finds in the form of a gang threatening a girl. Instead of showing them his badge, he decides to fight them. As the gang swarms over him, Alex transforms into a half-man, half-beast creature and tears the gang apart. Tracker #2: \\"Face of a Killer\\" Alex wakes up in Dr. Tucker's lab and finds one of the gang members on the operating table next to him, barely alive. To his horror, Alex realizes this isn't Herod's work, but his own. Dr. Tucker confirms his suspicion by telling Alex that Herod is a werewolf, and, because Herod bit him, Alex is now one too. Alex refuses to believe him and leaves, not knowing that Tucker has planted a tracking device on him. With his newly acquired, sharper senses, Alex remembers more of the attack and tracks the killer down as Conrad Landon, a truck driver who was bitten by a homeless man a while back. Alex, Jezebel and Grant go to the garbage dump where Conrad used to work. They find him hiding here. Alex chases after him, but when Conrad pleads with him, Alex realizes he cannot let the killer instinct take over. He lets Conrad go and tells his partners that Conrad isn't the killer. Conrad arrives home to find his mother murdered and Herod there, waiting for him. Tracker #3: \\"Sire\\" Things between Alex and Tory are still rocky - she's jealous of Jezebel, and upset that Alex won‚Äôt touch her. Secretly, he is afraid of being intimate with her, fearing of turning into a werewolf in her presence. They find Conrad Landon's severed head at their front door. Alex is puzzled as to why Herod is suddenly taunting them. From Herod's \\"calling cards\\" - pages of Bible with passages about King Herod that he leaves at the crime scenes - Alex, Jezebel and Grant find that the Bibles were shipped to an old hotel. Herod's room, however, is empty save for Conrad's headless corpse. While cross-checking similar case, Alex spots a photo of Dr. Tucker taken at one of the crime scenes. Alex goes to confront Tucker, who tells him that Herod has been living and killing for much longer than other werewolves, because he's been drinking lupines' blood, taken when feral - which is why he attacked Conrad on the bus, in order to get his blood. Tucker has been developing a cure for the werewolf curse - \\"wolfsbane\\" - but it only works with the blood of the sire, the one who turns the subject into a werewolf. Alex agrees to be retrained as part of a treatment to help him remember Herod's face. As Alex turns feral, Tucker extracts Alex's blood. He then injects the blood into the gang member that Alex attacked, whom he called \\"Rosemar\\" (because of the partly erased \\"Rosemary\\" tattoo on his chest.) Tracker #4: \\"Watcher\\" Alex and Jezebel go to a middle school after receiving tips that a man fitting Herod's description has been stalking the parking lot. Alex soon finds Herod's next intended victim - a sixth grader named Jack Rempel. Against Grant's protest, Alex decides to use Jack as bait. Unbeknownst to them, Tucker and his colleagues - all working for a shady organization called the Handel Foundation - have warned Herod of the trap, because they don't want the government to find out about Herod. At home, Tory prepares a romantic dinner for Alex, but he has to leave for the stake-out at little Jack's house. Tory warns him that she won't be here when he gets back. Alex talks to Jezebel about it, and for once their romantic tension becomes clear. However, they're interrupted by Jack, who knows he's being followed. Alex tries to reassure him, when Jack is grabbed by Herod. Herod sets up an explosion as a diversion and takes Jack to an underground drain tunnel. Alex finally has his confrontation with Herod in the tunnel. Again he refuses to let loose the beast within, and Herod escapes. Herod then arrives at Alex and Tory's house and attacks Tory. Tracker #5: \\"Rogue\\" With Tory kidnapped by Herod, Alex is taken off the case. He shows Dr. Tucker the Bible passage Herod left. Tucker deduces that Herod wants a trade - Tory for little Jack Rempel. To save Tory, Alex decides to risk breaking into FBI's Headquarters where Jack is being kept. With Tucker's help, Alex gets Jack out and brings him to the meeting place - an abandoned warehouse. After handing Tory to Tucker, he goes back to face Herod. The FBI tracks Tucker's van to the warehouse. Inside, Alex and Herod are still fighting. Herod convinces Alex to let him live, because if Herod dies, so will Alex's chance of being cured. Alex doesn't listen. Just as he's about to finish Herod, however, the SWAT team, led by Grant, bursts in and takes them down with gas grenades. Alex wakes up in the hospital with Tory next to him, wearing the engagement ring he's been trying to give to her for so long. Little Jack survives, but his parents still make him sleep in the cellar. Meanwhile, back at his lab, Dr. Tucker is working on \\"Rosemar.\\" It turns out that Tucker is keeping Herod alive, hoping to make Herod work for them once he's strong enough. Rosemar then sits up on the operating table, revealing his new face, which has been surgically transformed into that of Alex O‚ÄôRoark.

He became the first secretary of New York City under the English. Biography Nevius was the son of or Joannes Neef(f) Sr. and Maria Becks. He was baptized 14 March 1627 at his father's church in Zoelen, Gelderland, in the Dutch Republic. He moved with the family to Venlo in 1634. Sometime before 1646, the family moved to Kampen (his father may have been dead by that point). Nevius entered the University of Leyden in 1646. In 1651 (or possibly 1650), he sailed to America, probably leaving from Amsterdam. When he landed in Manhattan, it contained perhaps 1,000 inhabitants. Peter Stuyvesant was governor. The village was called Manhattoes until 1653, when it was incorporated as the city of New Amsterdam. Joannes Nevius was probably a merchant when he first arrived. The first record of him in Manhattan is March 3, 1652, when he witnessed a baptism. On March 13, 1653, he was assessed 100 guilders to help pay for the city's defensive wall. On September 1, 1653, he was appointed arbitrator in a suit for wages. On November 18, 1653, he married Adriaentje Bleijck. On November 22, 1653, he signed a \\"Remonstrance of the Merchants of New Amsterdam in Regard to the Imposition of Import Duties.\\" He owned a lot at what is now 80 Broadway and may have had his house there. This land was taken from him by the city on May 3, 1657, for a parade ground. November 30, 1654, he appeared in court as attorney-in-fact for his father-in- law, who was defendant in a suit regarding the construction and outfitting of a ship, the Nieuwe Liefde. This suit dragged on for several years. December 8, 1654, Joannes Nevius was named a city Schepen (filling the term of a Schepen who had been murdered). There were five city Schepens and two Burgomasters, who sat as magistrates and city council in the Court of Burgomasters and Schepens at the Stadt Huis, or city hall. On January 31, 1655, his term as Schepen was renewed for one year. By January 18, 1655, Joannes Nevius was a deacon in the Dutch church. On March 2, 1655, Nevius purchased a house on the north side of Pearl St. (present nos. 35 & 37). He probably moved to this house from the house at 80 Broadway. September 15, 1655, New Amsterdam was attacked by 2,000 Indians, who destroyed 28 farms, killed 100 settlers, and took 150 prisoners. On January 24, 1656, Joannes Nevius appeared as the plaintiff in a suit against Pieter van Couwenhoven for action on a debt of 283 florins. February 7, 1656, Nevius' term as Schepen expired. Some time during 1656 he bought land in Brooklyn, at \\"The Ferry,\\" probably from his father-in- law. October 1657, he was sworn in as City Secretary. He resided in the Stadt Huis (71 & 73 Pearl St.). He kept the minutes of the Court of Burgomasters and Schepens, recorded deeds, and prepared official documents. He was also vendue master, i.e., he conducted all public sales (for a fee of 3 guilders per transaction), and he was law librarian. From this time, started spelling his name consistently \\"Joannes\\" instead of \\"Johannes.\\" On July 22, 1658, he conveyed his house and lot on Pearl St. to Cornelius Steenwyck. September 6, 1664, the British took New Amsterdam and renamed it New York. In October, all the inhabitants were required to swear an oath of allegiance to King Charles II. Joannes Nevius continued as City Secretary under the British. On June 12, 1665, the city government was restructured after the British model of mayor, aldermen, and sheriff. On June 19, it was found that the City Secretary could not keep minutes in English, and on June 27 Joannes resigned his position. The Nevius family moved out of the Stadt Huis and onto Hoogh (High) Street. Not much is known about his whereabouts or activities from 1665 to 1670. By about 1670, Joannes Nevius and family were on the other side of the East River in Brooklyn, leasing and living in the ferry house there. He ran the ferry (probably hiring ferrymen) and a tavern in the ferry house. Joannes Nevius died in May or June 1672. By June 10, 1672, his wife signed a petition to hold the ferry house as \\"widow.\\" Following Dutch custom, his grave was probably unmarked and its location is now unknown.

At 27 stories and 1,331 rooms, it was the largest hotel in Manhattan when it opened on February 13, 1928 as the Hotel Lincoln, one day after the 119th anniversary of the birth of its namesake, Abraham Lincoln. It featured a towering mast on top with neon lettering reading \\"HOTEL LINCOLN\\" which was lit on opening day by Governor Al Smith, who pressed a button in Albany to illuminate it. The sign is visible in the 1933 film 42nd Street.http://nyneon.blogspot.com/2011/11/m-is-for- missing.html It was originally owned by the Kramer family and then by Maria Kramer, a dancer once married to Max Kramer, until the 1950s. It was purchased by prominent American real estate developer William Zeckendorf in September 1957, remodeled and renamed the Manhattan Hotel. The existing Hotel Lincoln sign was removed and in 1958 a sign was added to replace it‚Äîan enormous letter \\"M,\\" 31 feet wide and 12 feet deep. Zeckendorf ran the Manhattan until 1964, when it was sold to the English [which?] and became the Royal Manhattan. American jazz pianist, organist and bandleader Count Basie, as well as jazz saxophonist Lester Young and bandleader and clarinetist Artie Shaw, played in the Blue Room nightclub of the hotel. In the 1960s, things started going downhill for the Manhattan. By the late 1970s the hotel was boarded up. In 1978, the Milstein family purchased the hotel and reopened it in 1980. They named it the Milford Plaza Hotel because they did not want to change the huge neon \\"M\\" sign on the roof. In 2001, Seymour Milstein prepared to auction off the hotel, fueling a feud with his brother Paul. They eventually settled their differences, keeping the hotel in the family. The Milford Plaza used the song \\"Lullaby of Broadway\\" in television advertisements for many years.. On December 12, 2009, 350 employees were laid off, and the hotel was closed to allow renovations to begin. Renovations were expected to be completed by October 2011; however, in February 2010, the Seymour Milstein family decided to suspend its renovation plan indefinitely due to an economic downturn. Rockpoint Group and hotel operator Highgate Holdings purchased the hotel in 2010 for $200 million and began an extensive $140 million renovation. The neon \\"M\\" atop the building was removed in October 2011.http://nyneon.blogspot.com/2011/11/m-is-for-missing.html In February 2013, news broke that the new owners would look to chop the hotel up into three pieces‚Äîthe land, the 1,331-room hotel and the 26,000-square-foot retail unit‚Äîand sell for a combined value of $650 million. In March 2013, Brooklyn investor David Werner, in partnership with Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management‚Äôs real-estate investment business, purchased the land parcel for $325 million. Rockpoint Group and Highgate Hotels will continue to operate the hotel. As part of the renovation, the hotel was briefly renamed The Milford New York Hotel before being renamed in 2014 as Row NYC. Included in the renovation were makeovers of all 1,331 guest rooms and guest suites, renovation of the lobby (including a unique three-story, glass-enclosed lobby design and illuminated grand staircase flanked by see-through guest elevators) and public areas, the International Gift Shop, and District M ‚Äì a European express cafe by day, a Neapolitan pizza bar and cocktail lounge by night. In popular culture The hotel is seen during the musical number \\"I'm a Brass Band\\" in the 1969 movie \\"Sweet Charity\\". The former \\"Hotel Manhattan\\" sign with the giant neon \\"M\\" is visible behind Shirley MacLaine, as Charity Valentine, as she dances with the drummers during a scene shot on the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal's rooftop parking lot on the corner of West 42nd Street and 8th Avenue. The restaurant in the Royal Manhattan Hotel was featured in the 1977 American erotic film Barbara Broadcast, directed by Radley Metzger, an American pioneering filmmaker whose film and audio works are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. The November 19, 1987 episode of Late Night with David Letterman was filmed in a suite at the hotel when it was still known as the Milford Plaza.

Biography Louis Boehmer was born in L√ºneburg in Lower Saxony, Germany. He apprenticed as a gardener, and received an appointment to tend the royal gardens of the Kingdom of Hannover. However, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1867, he immigrated to America and become a successful gardener in Rochester, New York. In January 1871, when Kuroda Kiyotaka was in the United States hiring foreign advisors for his Hokkaid≈ç Colonization Office, Boehmer was recommended as a horticulturist by a mutual friend of Horace Capron. Boehmer arrived in Yokohama, Japan on March 23, 1872 and was initially placed in charge of an experimental farm in Aoyama, Tokyo where he raised carrots, potatoes, asparagus, as well as wheat, barley and soybeans. He also planted apple, cherry, peach and pear fruit trees as well as grapes, and introduced new varieties of livestock. With the end of the Boshin War, the Japanese government redoubled its efforts to settle Hokkaid≈ç, especially with displaced former samurai from pro-Tokugawa shogunate domains. Boehler arrived in Hakodate on May 19, 1874 and spent the next five months travelling around the island exploring sites for experimental government farms. While in Saru District, he discovered the local Ainu tribe growing hops, which when combined with locally-grown barley enabled him to recommend to Horace Capon at the nearby Sapporo Agricultural College that a brewery be established. The new operation was run by Edwin Dun and exists to this date under the name of Sapporo Breweries.Irish.

Plot In an Old West town, young girls are dying of a mysterious wasting disease. Dr. John Carter (John Hoyt) and his daughter Dolores (Kathleen Crowley) have been tending to patients for hours, but just lost another. After Preacher Dan Young's (Eric Fleming) night-long vigil, Cora (Nancy Kilgas) looks like she will survive. During breakfast with Cora's parents (Alan Reynolds, Amzie Strickland), they hear Cora scream. Cora is found dead on her bed, her window open. As he kneels to pray, Dan notices two small, bloody holes in Cora's throat. Returning to their ranch, Doc Carter finds his son Tim (Jimmy Murphy) extremely upset after the actions of their neighbor Buffer, including damming a stream on the Carter ranch and having his men assault anyone who complains. Doc drives back into town to see the local sheriff (Edward Binns). The Sheriff's discussion with Buffer (Bruce Gordon) proves unsuccessful, however, and a black-clad stranger (Michael Pate) follows Doc Carter's buckboard. By the time he gets home, the Doc is dead, his throat bloody. Grief-stricken, Tim snaps after learning a fence has been torn down and cattle are escaping. Convinced Buffer is responsible, Tim goes after him and is killed by Buffer. Dolores hangs up \\"Gun Wanted\\" posters all over town, offering $100 to anyone who can gun down the \\"murderer\\"; After the stranger promises to kill Buffer, one of the rancher's men shoots at the stranger. As the stranger leaves, Buffer sacks the man despite his insisting he hit his target dead center. The stranger, calling himself Drake Robey, arrives at the Carter ranch. He reacts to a thorn cross on a button worn by Dan. When asked, Dan says it was an ordination gift; the thorn coming from the site of the Crucifixion. Despite Dan's protests, Dolores hires Robey. He moves into the house, and that night, Robey sneaks into Dolores' room and drinks some of her blood. Next morning, Dan finds Dolores looking tired, complaining of cold and very compliant. Dolores and Dan spend the day looking for her father's will. They find a map showing the property had once belonged to a Spanish family, the Robles, sold it suffering \\"some kind of tragedy\\". Dan takes the paperwork, including a locked safety box, home with him to continue the search. After Dan leaves, Robey comes to see Dolores and he talks Dolores into hiring him as a night range-rider who can keep an eye on Buffer and his men. She offers him the cemetery caretaker's cottage to stay in if he doesn't mind being near the dead; Robey says \\"The dead don't bother me ‚Äì it's the living that causes me trouble.\\" At home, Dan knocks over the safety box, cracking it open. Within it, he finds the 1860 diary of Don Miguel Robles (Edward Colmans), the former owner of the land. According to the diary, Don Robles sent his son Drago to Madrid on business without his new bride Isabella (Jeanna Cross). Isabella turned to Drago's brother Roberto (Henry Delgado) for companionship. When Drago returns and learns of their relationship, he killed his brother with a dagger; distraught, Drago later committed suicide with the same dagger. Over the next six months, mysterious deaths of young girls take place. One night Don Robles hears Isabella scream and went to her room, finding a man bent over her ‚Äì Drago Robles, who fled, leaving Isabella drained of blood. To end the curse, Don Robles plunged a silver dagger through Drago's heart as he lay in his coffin. After confessing his actions to the priest he learned a wooden stake is needed to destroy a vampire ‚Äì he returns but finds the coffin empty except for the dagger. Hidden within the diary is a photograph of Drago Robles ‚Äì it is Drake Robey in Spanish clothing. As Dan reads Don Robles' diary, Robey summons a sleeping Dolores to him, but is interrupted by the sheriff. After hearing the sheriff denounce him to Dolores, Robey follows him back to town and kills him with his bite. As Dan starts back to his house after examining the body, he is followed by Robey. In a panic he races for the church; Robey enters the shadow of the church cross and flees. Back in his house, Dan is confronted by Robey who defends his actions, protesting \\"What I am is not my own choice. You should pity me, not judge me in my torment. Do you think I wanted this?\\" before attacking Dan. Dan's housekeeper interrupts the attack and Robey flees with his photograph and the Rancho Robles map. When Dan tells Dolores about the evening's events, she doesn't believe him. Dan takes her to the family crypt to find Drago Robles' empty coffin, except for a silver dagger. When Dan insists they look in every coffin for Robey ‚Äì including her father and brother ‚Äì Dolores explodes and throws him out. After Dan leaves to get a court order to do so, Dolores, apparently weakened by blood loss, her anger at Dan, and Robey's hypnotic influence, collapses. Robey emerges from a Carter coffin to feed from Dolores before carrying her back home. After Dolores awakens, Robey shows her the Rancho Robles map; the stream Buffer has been damming is on her property, not his. Robey goes into town to show the map to Buffer, who angrily shoots Robey. Robey fires back, killing Buffer, and walks away unscathed. Robey reports back to Dolores when she sees a bullet hole in his vest ‚Äì he claims his cigar case stopped Buffer's bullet. Robey learns that Dan is heading for the county seat to get a court order to open the graves. Robey promises to join with Dolores to stop him. Warned by Dolores' housekeeper, Dan makes preparations. Robey heads for town to \\"talk\\" Dan out of getting that court order, but Dan will not be stopped. They challenge each other to a shoot-out, and Dan fires first, just as Dolores arrives. Robey collapses and disintegrates into dust, leaving only his empty clothes behind. Dan walks over to Robey's clothes and picks up his bullet...which has his thorn cross on it.

Robey is a vampire not because he was the victim of another vampire, but because he committed the mortal sin of suicide - well into the nineteenth century suicides were buried at crossroads to prevent them from returning as vampires. Because of this, none of Robey's victims will be returning from the dead. Also unlike the film iconography of the previous fifty-odd years, Robey is not incinerated by exposure to the daylight; the pre-cinema vampires were perfectly capable of walking in the sunlight. The final method of Robey's destruction is definitely unique, but appropriate for both the myth and the setting. Preacher Dan's thorn cross, supposedly originating from the site of the Crucifixion, is destructive to the vampire both because of its form (a cross) and its source (Calvary); its supernatural powers are made clear by the fact that it survives being shot from a gun (a normal thorn would have been destroyed). Placing the cross on a bullet used in an old-fashioned Western shootout simply makes it part of the setting.  Production  Curse of the Undead started as a gag idea by husband-and-wife team Edward and Mildred Dein. Universal-International producer Joseph Gershenson heard about the idea from his wife and quickly phoned Edward Dein: \\"Hey, smartass. The good stuff you don't give us.

People generally return an eyebrow flash, unless it was given by someone whom they do not know, or someone who looks away immediately after. The message must be interpreted in context. Psychologists and sociologists say that eyebrow raising can be a reaction to fear or surprise. Measurement Grammer et al. define an eyebrow flash as a contraction of the inner brow raiser muscle (M. Frontalis, pars medialis) and the outer brow raiser muscle (M. frontalis, pars lateralis) as defined by the Facial Action Coding System. An eyebrow flash is subdivided into three time intervals: the onset (the time during which the eyebrows raise to their maximal position), the apex (the time during which the eyebrows are in their maximal position), and the offset (the time during which the eyebrows lower to their original state). Cross-cultural studies A study conducted in 1987 recorded approximately 67 hours of unstaged social interactions conducted by 255 individuals from three locations: Western New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, and Upper Orinoco. The study found significant differences in the age and sex of senders and receivers among the populations studied; for instance, Eipo men from Western New Guinea were more likely to be senders, while Trobriand men from Papua New Guinea were more likely to be receivers. Across all three cultures, a lowering of the eyelids or a head movement often coincided with the beginning of an eyebrow flash. Additionally, people from all three cultures exhibited longer-duration eyebrow flashes at the openings of conversations than during conversations.

R. (2009). Social and personality development (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth This process is important for a child's social and personality development because it largely impacts the child's understanding of expected social behavior and influences social judgments. Gender identity Once aware of ones gender identity, the child will start to behave in gender roles normally adopted by their same-sex models. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards.Pentony, C.G. (1980). Gender, sex typing, and gender identity. 941‚Äì942. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity ‚Äì becoming more feminine or masculine ‚Äì and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for who they are and how they should behave. Theories Freud‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory Sigmund Freud believed that children go through stages of psychosexual development. In the third year of the child's life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the ‚Äúphallic‚Äù stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able to let go of the rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.Mullahy. P. (1948). Oedipus myth and complex: A Review of Psychoanalytic Theory. New York, NY: Grove Press, Inc. The girl's development, Freud argued, is more complicated. Generally, as with males, the first object of interest is also the mother figure and for the first four years and beyond a girl remains attached to her mother. However, when the female child learns about ‚Äúcastration‚Äù it sparks disappointment and she blames her mother for her lack of a penis. Because of this, the girl gives up masturbation and in turn shifts focus from her mother to her father. By abandoning masturbation the girl can no longer be active, thus displaying a passive nature. The father then assists her by smoothly transitioning her towards a more feminine path. Furthermore, the girl's affection towards her father will also influence her to emulate her mother's feminine qualities and eventually adopt more gender-typed behaviors. Kohlberg‚Äôs cognitive-developmental theory The cognitive-developmental theory is also closely linked to Jean Piaget‚Äôs analysis for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. Lawrence Kohlberg suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (‚ÄúI am a boy so I do boy-like things‚Äù). This emphasizes the importance of a child's understanding about gender roles and their permanent placement in it. After a child can fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget's concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages: # gender identity: the child recognizes that they are either a boy or a girl and possesses the ability to label others. # gender stability: the identity in which they recognizes themselves as does not change # gender consistency: the acceptance that gender does not change regardless of changes in gender-typed appearance, activities, and traits. When the child is able to fully grasp gender stable understanding about themselves, usually between the ages of five and seven, the motivation to master their orientation and to socialize themselves allows them to seek out same-sexed models to learn more about gender-stereotypic behaviors.Martin, C. L., Ruble, D. N., & Szkrykablo, J. (2002). Cognitive theories of early gender development. American psychological association. 4(23), 544‚Äì557.Bussey, K. (2011). Gender identity development. Handbook of Identity Theory and Research. 603-628. Gender schema theory A schema is a cognitively organized network of associations that is readily available to help guide an individual's perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as ‚Äúgirls are weak and boys are strong,‚Äù classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed basic knowledge on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In other words, the child learns the contents of the society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge to conceptualize their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.Bem, S. L. (1981) Gender schema theory: a cognitive account of sex typing. Psychological Review.88(4), 354‚Äì364. Social-learning theory (Albert Bandura) Social learning theorists, like Albert Bandura, suggest that adults not only provide models for children to imitate, but that they also are actively involved in influencing a child's gender-role identification. The Social learning theory proposes that gender-identities and gender-role preferences are acquired through two concepts. # Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first concept is represented through direct tuition, also known as differential reinforcement. Early in a child's development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they learn from their parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender- appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child's gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching ‚Äúboys how to be boys and girls how to be girls‚Äù.Shaffer, D. R. (2009). Social and Personality Development (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth # Observational learning: The second concept is represented through observational learning in where children imitate and follow the behaviors of individuals who are of the same sex. Children become increasingly aware of gender stereotypes in preschool and acknowledge these ‚Äúsame-sex models‚Äù when they begin to exercise their preferences for ‚Äúgender-typed‚Äù toys or activities. These same-sex models may include any individual from teachers and older siblings to media personalities. Social models There are many opportunities for a child to learn and develop their own understanding of what ‚Äúgender‚Äù is. Thus as children progresses from childhood into adolescence they will already have been exposed to many factors that will influence their ideas and attitudes for normative social behaviors regarding gender roles. Social models, such as parents, siblings, and the media become extremely important during different stages of the child's development. Parents: Parents play a vital part in a child's early life, for they are the first group of people that a child meets and learns from. The information that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children‚Äôs socialization to gender roles. Adolescence. 32(126). 253-259. Furthermore, various evidence suggest that certain household differences affecting how a child is raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù or ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù the child can potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, in the absence of a father figure boys are generally more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother's desire for a girl and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.Roberts, C. W., Green, R. & Williams, K., Goodman, M. (1987). Boyhood gender identity development: a statistical contrast of two family groups. Developmental Psychlology. 23(4), 544-557. Siblings: Apart from parents, children also seek reinforcement from their older siblings. Therefore, inconsistencies for gender behaviors can also be as a result of children emulating their siblings of opposite sex. Sibling's influence is often most effective when the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation for the child to model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling's gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities.McHale, S. M., Updegraff, K. A., Helms-Erikson, H. (2001). Sibling influences on gender development in middle childhood and early adolescence: a longitudinal study. Developmental Psychology. 37(1). 115-125. Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling's sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters.Kornreich, J. L., Hearn, K. D., Rodrigues, G. & O‚ÄôSullivan, L. F. (2003). Sibling influence, gender roles, and the sexual socialization of urban early adolescent girls. The Journal of Sex Research. 40(1). 101-110. Biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.Mehta, C. M., Strough, J. (2010). Gender segregation and gender-typing in adolescence. Sex Role. Conversely, this can also develop in an opposite direction in which children may try to diverge themselves from their siblings as much as possible, making their differences more salient; however, this may be more evident in first-borns possibly due to the birth order. Peers: At a young age, children can already utilize their knowledge of different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people's behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An example of this is the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys.Van Beijsterveldt, C. E. M., Hudziak, J. J., Boomsama, D. I. (2006). Genetic and environmental influences on cross-gender behavior to problems: a study of dutch twins at ages 7 and 10 years. Arch Sex. Behav. 648-658. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same- gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite- gender peer who has not had prior experience.Martin, C. L. (1989). Children‚Äôs use of gender-related information in making social judgment. Developmental Psychology. 25(1), 80-88. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential. Media: Children learn about different gender categories by observing various forms of media. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child's understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children's literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children's literature, male characters appear to be more central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.Turner-Bowker, D. M. (1996). Gender stereotyped descriptors in children‚Äôs picture books: does ‚Äúcurious Jane‚Äù exist in the literature? Sex Roles. 35(7/8), 461-488. Moreover, these characteristics are also seen in television programing. For example, in most prime-time television shows women receive twice as many comments about her appearance than men. Similarly, a study investigating the cartoon ‚ÄúPok√©mon‚Äù and gender role expresses the differences in ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù characters. Jesse and James (villains of the story) are portrayed to have adopted counter- stereotypical portrayal. While Jesse is seen as more aggressive and James as more feminine, it subtly teaches children that nontraditional or nonstereotypical gender role behaviors are bad. Furthermore, children in the story have difficulty recalling a male Pok√©mon revealing that there is an imbalance in which prominence is given to male characters.Ogletree, S. M., Martinez, C. N., Turner, T. R., Mason, B. (2004). Pok√©mon: exploring the role of gender. Sex Roles. 50(11/12), 851-859. These depictions of male and female character roles can potentially become unconsciously influential in the way a child constructs gender views. Atypical gender development and controversies It is expected for children to develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person's sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, he or she is then diagnosed with gender dysphoria (often termed gender identity disorder or GID).nafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. Journal of Personality and Psychology. 88(2), 400-412. Genetics vs. environmental contributors: The development of gender roles has been associated with both genetic and social factors. Current biological research has suggested that testosterone differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in empathy levels, which is proven to be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women.Hines, M. (2011). Gender development and the human brain. Annual Review of Neuroscience. Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that homosexual traits displayed greater congruence in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins displaying genetic contributions.Knafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. Journal of Personality and Psychology. 88(2), 400-412. Further studies reveal that this is especially true for girls' gender-typed values.Knafo, A., Spinath, F. M. (2011). Genetic and environmental influences on girl‚Äôs and boy‚Äôs gender-typed and gender-neutral values. Developmental Psychology. 47(3), 726-731. Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.Moller, B., Schreier, H., Li, A., Romer, G. (2009). Gender identity disorder in children and adolescents. Curr probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care. 117‚Äì143. While atypical gender role development may be heritable, this does not mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society's negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development. Gender dysphoria: Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder (GID) occurs when the child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has a strong desire to be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross- dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviors. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age. While the onset of these behaviors may occur as early as two years of age, most children that exhibit GID before puberty will not experience it once they become an adult and will instead most likely fall under the category of gay, lesbian, or bisexual. However, if a child's GID persists into adulthood, it will most likely be permanent with medical intervention being the only solution. Gender dysphoria in children can be a controversial topic as some disapprove in diagnosing GID in children that have yet to reach puberty. However, GID in children is included in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. The ICD-10 is in the process of revision by the WHO, but instead of not addressing GOD in children, it will most likely be changed from \\"gender identity disorder of children\\" into \\"gender incongruence of childhood\\". Controversies about gender in DSM-5: For the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there has been a tremendous amount of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a mental disorder. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents.Kamens, S.R. (2011). On the proposed sexual and gender identity diagnoses for DSM-5: history and controversies. The Humanistic Psychologist. 37‚Äì59. Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual's discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.Richmond, K., Carroll, K., Denboske, K. Gender identity disorder ‚Äì concerns and controversies. (2010). Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology. 111-131. Androgyny: Recent studies have shown that androgynous people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù or ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù in the given context. According to a study, a person's activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves.Bem, S. L., Lenney, E. (1976). Sex typing and the avoidance of cross-sex behavior. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 33(1), 48-54. Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher self-esteem and higher self- worth.Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children‚Äôs socialization to gender roles. Adolescence. 253-259. Drawbacks Recent studies have shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to gender-related characteristics that is congruous with the person's biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the perks of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests.DiDonato, M.D., Berenbaum, S.A. (2011). The benefits and drawbacks of gender typing: How different dimensions are related to psychological adjustment. Arch Sex Behavior. 40. 457-463 This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one's identity. Examples of atypical development Boy Raised as Girl After a circumcision accident, Bruce's parents turned to Psychologist Dr. John Money who suggested they raise the boy as a girl. Money believes that biology does not determine our gender identification; our environment does. At 17 months old, Bruce was renamed \\"Brenda\\". However, at age 13, \\"Brenda\\" became unhappy, lonely, and refused to pursue anything female-typed. Brenda's parents chose to tell Brenda the truth, and from then on he named himself David. This story ended in tragedy; David committed suicide after his wife left him and he lost his job.Health Check: the boy who was raised as a girl. (2010). https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300 Kate: Ben had never shown interest in ‚Äúboy‚Äù toys, they wanted to wear girl's clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was ‚ÄúBen‚Äù; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child's gender identity is extremely important.Matthiessen, C.

However, it was against UCLA‚Äôs rules for film students to shoot feature-length films, \\"and for good reason, you don‚Äôt know what you are doing!\\" as Smith has said. She was, after some struggles, able to complete the film, and it got a significant amount of attention at the Sundance Film Festival, and took home several Best Film awards from other festivals, mentioned below. In 1998, Smith graduated from UCLA with her M.F.A. and a growing reputation as an up-and- coming force in the film industry. In 2007, she attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.  Drylongso  Drylongso was a highly acclaimed film that gained Smith much attention and popularity. Smith made the movie while completing film school at the University of California, Los Angeles. The film takes place in Oakland, CA, and follows a young African- American woman named Pica, on her quest to photograph her concept of a dying breed, referring to African-American men. The movie follows Pica through the attrition of the young black men around her and how she balances this with her dysfunctional family's struggles. The film brings up the topic of gang violence that took place in Oakland which claimed the lives of many innocent African-American young men. \\"Drylongso\\" is an old African-American term meaning \\"same old\\" or \\"everyday\\". Drylongso was well received at many film festivals, most notably Sundance Film Festival. in 2000,Drylongso also won best feature at the Urbanworld Festival, Los Angeles Pan-African Film Festival, and the Philadelphia International Film Festival. Yusuf Bey's son Sayyed Yusuf Bey had a minor acting role in the film, he was photographed by the main character Pica. In November, Drylongso will be included as part of the \\"Cinematic Legacy\\" series at the 2018 AFI Fest, screened on a new 16mm print issued by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Chicago Smith has held consecutive residencies in Chicago at ThreeWalls, the Black Metropolis Research Consortium, and the Experimental Sound Studio in addition to an artist residency at the University of Chicago Arts Incubator. In 2012, Smith installed overlapping shows at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and ThreeWalls, and was named Outstanding Artist by the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture. Smith has also been a Visiting Artist at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago while exploring the intersection of art, protest, commerce, and community on Chicago's South Side. Smith's site-specific installation, \\"17,\\" ran from March 10, 2013, to July 7, 2013, both at Hyde Park Art Center and on the corner of East Garfield Boulevard and Prairie Avenue on the South Side. \\"17\\" features approximately 260 feet of hand screen- printed wallpaper. The title of this exhibition materialized from Smith‚Äôs \\"meditations on the number‚Äôs spiritual significance as a marker of immortality\\"Cauleen Smith: 17 March 10, 2013 ‚Äì July 7, 2013 , Hyde Park Art Center and further alludes to numerous aspects of art and culture spanning from ancient history to modern day. \\"17\\" was also inspired by Smith's research of the life and legacy of Sun Ra. Sun Ra, a student of numerology, was interested in a kind of \\"cultural immortality‚Äù for which the number \\"17\\" has been said to carry significance. Smith was one of 63 artists whose work was exhibited as part of the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Her elaborately designed hand- stitched banners were hung from the ceiling. The banners are in response to the artist's \\"disgust and fatigue\\" from having watched videos of police violence against black people. Smith and artist Aram Han Sifuentes facilitated a workshop in conjunction with the Biennial called Protest Banner Lending Library a project Sifuentes had initiated in Chicago. Smith's \\"Human_3.0 Reading List\\" was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2017. The project conceived in 2015 consists of 57 drawings‚Äîeach produced on 8¬Ω √ó 12-inch graph paper in watercolor over graphite, occasionally elaborated with acrylic of 14 books. Smith describes these books as such: \\"These are some of the books that literally changed my life, saved my life and sustain my life, but also, (fair warning) make it difficult for me to go along, get along, look the other way, and gets mines.\\" Los Angeles Smith's \\"Give It or Leave It\\" was exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia in 2018, with support provided by an Ellsworth Kelly Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. The description of the exhibit reads, \\"Through films, objects, and installation, Give It or Leave It offers an emotional axis by which to navigate four distinct universes: Alice Coltrane and her ashram, a 1966 photo shoot by Bill Ray at Simon Rodia‚Äôs Watts Towers, Noah Purifoy and his desert assemblages, and black spiritualist Rebecca Cox Jackson and her Shaker community. These locations, while not technically utopian societies, embody sites of historical speculation and radical generosity between artist and community. In reimagining a future through this mix, Smith casts a world that is black, feminist, spiritual, and unabashedly alive. Smith exhibited her ongoing multimedia work, Black Utopia LP, as a part of the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2019. According to Hyperallergic, \\"The performance was primarily part of a program of Smith's work that included a screening of her recent shorts, a new 16mm restoration of her much acclaimed, rarely seen 1988 feature film Drylongso, and a previously unscreened short film, Sojourner, in the festival's Tiger Short Film Competition.\\" In 2019, Smith's work was included in the exhibit \\"Loitering Is Delightful,\\" at the LA Municipal Gallry in the Barnsdall Art Park. Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band Project Marking Smith's entrance onto the Chicago art scene was her work in creating the Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band Project, the yield from her residency with Threewalls. Composed of members of the Rich South High School (Richton Park, Illinois) marching band and occasionally the South Shore Drill Team as well, the Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band descended like a flash mob on various parts of Chicago that had been hit with waves of youth violence, including Chinatown and the meatpacking district, a few times throughout the fall of 2010, playing and dancing to an orchestration of Sun Ra‚Äôs \\"Space is the Place\\" led by music director Y. L. Douglas. Smith coupled the militant undertones of marching bands with the Sun Ra-style of free jazz in an attempt to combat youth violence with music. Afrofuturism Smith is a player in the movement of Afrofuturism, an emergent literary and cultural aesthetic that combines elements of science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, Afrocentricity, and magic realism with non-Western cosmologies in order to critique not only the present-day dilemmas of people of color, but also to revise, interrogate, and re-examine the historical events of the past. In an interview with BOMB Magazine in 2011, Smith noted: \\"There‚Äôs the strand of my work that is Afrofuturist. Afrofuturism, for me, is about speculating on the potentiality of what is known about technology and physics to create metaphors that allow me to explore an African diasporic past and generate possible narratives for the future. Dark Matter is part of this. I had constructed an alien narrative‚Äînot an alien-abduction story, but one about alien assimilation. Aliens are never caught. Nobody ever notices them. The conflict is that the world that they land in doesn‚Äôt work for them; it‚Äôs toxic for them. But Afrofuturism is also a rumination on memories to which I have no access. My investment in it as a production strategy has run its course; Afrofuturism provides a way to investigate trauma very explicitly. But we only reenact traumas, don‚Äôt we? We don‚Äôt reenact prom night, or our favorite birthday party. This is a problem‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt seem to fix things; it amplifies them. There‚Äôs gotta be something else, the after-the-trauma.\\"  Filmography  *2019 **Black Utopia LP at the International Film Festival Rotterdam *2010 **Remote Viewing. 4K digital Video. TRT: 15:00.

The museum is located in Deir ez-Zor, the capital of Deir ez-Zor Governorate, Syria. It was founded in 1974 and housed in a gallery of a shopping mall. Between 1983 and 1996, it was located in an old law court built in 1930. In 1996, the museum moved to its current location in a building that had been especially designed for the museum. The exhibition halls cover an area of and are arranged around a courtyard. The construction of the new museum was a joint Syrian‚ÄìGerman operation. When the museum was founded in 1974, its collection consisted of only 140 objects, donated by the National Museum of Damascus and the National Museum of Aleppo. The current collection consists of some 25,000 objects, including the majority of the clay tablets found at Mari. The museum also holds many objects found by international teams of archaeologists at sites in the Upper Khabur area, such as Tell Beydar, Tell Brak, Tell Leilan and Tell Mozan. The Euphrates Valley southeast of Deir ez- Zor is represented with objects from the Classical site of Dura-Europos, which was once a border city of the Roman Empire. The collection is organized around five chronological themes: prehistory, ancient Syria (late fourth to first millennium BCE), the Classical period, the Islamic era and ethnography. It includes a number of life-size reconstructions of buildings from different periods, including a house from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Bouqras in the Euphrates Valley, an Early Bronze Age city-gate from Tell Bderi on the Khabur River, the southern fa√ßade with wall paintings of the \\"Court of the Palms\\" of Zimri-Lim's palace in Mari and the gate of the Islamic Qasr al-Heer al-Sharqi. In 2015, the collection was allegedly removed from the museum by the Syrian Army in view of increased ISIS encroachments in Deir ez Zor.

A gender role is \\"everything that a person says and does to indicate to others or to the self the degree that one is either male, female, or androgynous. This includes but is not limited to sexual and erotic arousal and response.\\"Nanda, Serena. Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Pub., 1990. Print. Gender identity is one's own personal experience with gender role and the persistence of one's individuality as male, female, or androgynous, especially in self-awareness and behavior. Gender binary is one example of a gender system. A gender binary is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine. Gender binary Gender binary is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine. Gender binary is one general type of a gender system. Sometimes in this binary model, \\"sex\\", \\"gender\\" and \\"sexuality\\" are assumed by default to align. Non- European gender systems In cultures where the gender binary is prominent and important, transgender people are a major exception to the societal norms related to gender. Intersex people, those who cannot be biologically determined as either male or female, are another obvious deviation. Other cultures have their own practices independent of the Western gender binary. Native American When European settlers first arrived in North America, they discovered different Native American tribes had different concepts of sex and gender. In the Native North American society \\"berdaches\\" were given that name to identify them as gender variants. The Europeans \\"attempted to explain the berdache from various functional perspectives...in terms of the contributions these sex/gender roles made to social structure or culture.\\"Nanda, Serena. Gender Diversity: Crosscultural Variations. Waveland Press, 1999. Print. The term \\"berdache\\" was deemed inappropriate and insulting as time passed and awareness increased, so a new term was coined in 1990, \\"Two-Spirit.\\" There were many roles for male and female Two-Spirits, productive specialization, supernatural sanction and gender variation. Some widespread features of the variety of gender roles are: transvestism, cross- gender occupation, same sex (but different gender) sexuality, recruitment to different roles, special languages, ritual roles, and associations with spiritual power. Cross-dressing was the most visible marker but has proven a variable and less reliable indicator of status as a Two-Spirit. However the main interest is that these people are an accepted portion of their society. In some cases they were even given special respect and various honors. The roles varied greatly between tribes. For example, a male variant might have to wear male clothing during warfare, but women's clothing any other time. These gender roles were often decided at a young age. If a boy was interested in women's activities, or vice versa, a gender variant role would likely be undertaken in adulthood. \\"In some societies, same-sex sexual desire or practice did figure into the definition of one‚Äôs gender variant role, in others, it did not.\\" In the case of the Navajo, there are four genders: man, woman, masculine female-bodied n√°dleeh, and feminine male-bodied n√°dleeh. Intercourse between two people of different genders, regardless of biological sex, was not stigmatized. In the majority of Native American societies, biological sex played no part in any gender variant role. The Mohave Alyha In Mohave society, pregnant women believed they had dreams forecasting the anatomic sex of their children. These dreams also sometimes included hints of their child's future gender variant status. A boy who \\"acted strangely\\" before he participated in the boys‚Äô puberty ceremonies in the Mohave tribe would be considered for the transvestite ceremony. Expressing interest in dolls, the domestic work of women, women's gambling games, and inquiring about the female skirt were all ways a boy may be considered for the transvestite ceremony. Before the ceremony, relatives would try to dissuade him, but if the boy persists, they would assist in the preparations for the ceremony. The ceremony itself was meant to surprise the boy. It was a test of willingness. Other nearby settlements would receive word to come and watch. A circle of onlookers would sing special songs. If the boy danced like a woman, it confirmed his status as an alyha. He was then taken to a river to bathe, and was given a skirt to wear. The ceremony would permanently change his gender status within the tribe. He then took up a female name. The alyha would imitate many aspects of female life, including menstruation, puberty observations, pregnancy, and birth. The alyha were considered great healers, especially in curing sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis.  Juchit√°n, Oaxaca, Mexico  A documentary film entitled Blossoms of Fire, produced in 2000, depicts the people of Juchit√°n de Zaragoza, Oaxaca, Mexico. It follows the daily lives of the women as they run their businesses, wear colorfully bold traditional clothing and hold their heads firmly high as they carry the weight on top. The film clearly depicts the empowered women and the tolerance of homosexuality and transgender individuals. The community exemplifies an alternative gender system unlike the gender binary that has been established throughout the world. On many occasions this community has been criticized and labeled as a matriarchy; however, the individuals who are interviewed throughout the film tend to say otherwise. They strongly believe that their community is able to function because gender roles are not placed on individuals but rather that everyone is equal‚Äîfor example there is no identifiable \\"bread winner\\". Children are taken care of by whoever can help; food is cooked by anyone who is able to and drinking beer and smoking is not only okay for the \\"men\\" of the community. Gay, lesbian, and transgender people tend to feel more accepted in this alternative gender system. Juchit√°n's society operates under a more egalitarian gender system in which men and women have different, but not exclusive roles, and in which these roles are not necessarily expected. Due to liberal gender performance, third genders also have more prominence in Juchit√°n than other parts of the world.Blossoms of Fire. Lydia Nibley. Say Yes Quickly Productions, Riding the Tiger Productions, and Just Media, 2010. DVD.  Machi (Mapuche Shamans) of Chile  The machi are the shamans of the Mapuche people of Chile, and are viewed to a large extent by both Mapuche and the Chilean state as keepers of Mapuche political, cultural, and spiritual tradition and power. In many ways the machi represent an alternative gender system in that homosexual acts are more accepted, gender switching occurs, and the practice of polygamy took place.Bacigalupo, Ana Mariella. \\"Mapuche Shamanic Bodies and the Chilean State: Polemic Gendered Representation and Indigenous Responses\\". Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State. Ed. A.J. Aldama. Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University Press. 2003. However, though it appears there is more gender freedom, gender switching occurs based on different shamanic practices performed, and the gender associated with the practice is either derived from physical sex based on reproduction, etc., or from the hegemonic gender system of the nation of Chile. For example, political participation has become a masculine practice, while spiritual practices are considered feminine. While one does not have to be a physical \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" necessarily to perform these practices, they must channel that gender to perform them. The machi were inevitably influenced by the dominant Western gender system of Chile through state sponsored evangelization, (most Mapuche today are Catholic) and by the Indigenous Law. The Indigenous Law further politicized the machi and further subjected them in national discourse to the gender norms of the Chilean state, changing the way that machi perform gender. \\"Machi juggle various gendered systems of knowledge and identities according to their intentions, who is present, and in what context\\" Indian Hindu In Hindu India, there also exists different concepts of what is socially accepted when gender is in question. When compared to the native North Americans, the gender system is essentially binary, but the ideas themselves are quite different from Western thoughts. These ideas often come from religious contexts. Some Hindu origin myths feature androgynous or hermaphroditic ancestors. Ancient poets often showed this idea by presenting images with mixed physical attributes between the two sexes. These themes still exist in the culture, and are even still institutionalized. The most prominent group are the hijras. Hijras A Hijra from India. \\"The recognition of more than two sex/genders is recorded in India as early as the eighth century BCE\\". In modern India, the term hijra is most commonly meant as \\"eunuch\\" or intersexed, and is a term of sexual impotence. In the culture's definition, a hijra is one born as a male, but adopts the clothing, behavior, and occupations of women. Their status in society is neither male nor female, neither man nor woman. When hijras are asked whether or not they are male or female, most often they respond with comments like \\"We hijras are like women\\", demonstrating their place in culture. Hijras walk, gesture, speak, and use facial expressions more common to women in India. They even take feminine names as part of their gender transformation. Becoming a Hijra however is not outside of Indian society. Being a hijra means making a commitment that gives social support and some economic security, as well as a cultural meaning, linking them to the larger world. \\"A male who is not born biologically intersexed who wishes to become a hijra must transform his sex/gender through an emasculation operation\\". This operation is a rebirth for the hijras, and contains elements of childbirth to symbolize this. The process includes castration, bloodletting, and special rituals. Among the hijra society there is a hierarchy of gurus, or teachers, and chelas, or disciples. In order for one to be accepted into the hijra society they must be sponsored by a guru, who in turn teaches them and helps them form a family. As of November 11, 2013, the country of Bangladesh has decided to begin a third gender birth certificate. SƒÅdhin The sƒÅdhin are similar to Hijras culturally. Their development is quite different however, and their existence is much less prominent. It is a girl's choice to become a sƒÅdhin. They wear men's clothing and keep their hair short. They commonly keep their female name and are still treated as a female in society, although the status of sƒÅdhin, like hijra, transcends the gender labels of India. A sƒÅdhin candidate must be a virgin, and swear to celibacy. Brazil Like in Indian culture, Brazilian culture does follow a gender binary, just not the traditional western one. Rather than men and women, certain areas of Brazil have men and not-men. Men are masculine, and anyone who displays feminine qualities falls under the category of not-man. This concept is a result of sexual penetration as the deciding factor of gender. Any one who is penetrated becomes feminine, and is not-male. Everyone else, regardless of sexual preference, remains a male in Brazilian society. The most commonly discussed group of people when discussing gender in Brazil are the travesti. Unlike in native North America and India, the existence of the travesti is not from a religious context. It is an individual's choice to become a travesti. Born as males, they go to extensive measures to try to appear female. Some inject female hormones and get silicone implants to more closely imitate the curves of the Brazilian female body. The travesti do not identify as female, and do not wish to become female. Instead, their culture is based on this man/not-man premise. Unlike hijras, the travestis do not want to get rid of their penises. They do, however, manipulate themselves to hide their genitalia. They feel that castration would not get them any closer to becoming a woman. Homosexuality also follows the man/not-man binary. If a travesti has a boyfriend, that man is not considered a homosexual, because the travesti is not a man. If, at any time, the boyfriend expresses interest in the travesti penis, the travesti will immediately lose interest in him as a partner because he has also become a \\"not-man\\".Kulick, D. \\"The Gender of Brazilian Transgendered Prostitutes.\\" American Anthropologist 99.3 (1997): 574-85. Page 578 Naples and Southern Italy Femminielli or femmenielli (singular femminiello, cf. Standard Italian femmina, \\"a female\\", -ello, masculine diminutive suffix) is a slur used to refer to a population of males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional Neapolitan culture. It may be hard to define this term within modern Western notions of \\"gay men\\" versus \\"trans women\\" since both these categories overlap to a degree in the case of femminielli It has been noted that this term is not derogatory and does not carry stigma, with femminielli instead traditionally believed to bring luck. It is often considered reductive to insert the Neapolitan femminiello within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo- Saxon and North American contexts. The femminiello, instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon confer to the femminiello a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the femminiello is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters.Hochdorn, Alexander, Paolo F. Cottone and Dania Vallini (2011). Gender and discursive positioning: Doing transgender in highly normative contexts. 69th Conference of the International Council of Psychologists. 29 July - 2 August 2011, Washington DC (USA) http://www.icpweb.org The femminiello in Campania may enjoy a relatively privileged position thanks to their participation in some traditional events, such as Candelora al Santuario di Montevergine (Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine) in AvellinoIl Santuario di Montevergine e la Candelora or the Tammurriata, a traditional dance performed at the feast of Madonna dell'Arco in Sant'Anastasia. Generally, femminielli are considered good luck. For this reason, it is popular in the neighborhoods for a femminiello to hold a newborn baby, or participate in games such as bingo. Feminielli participate in games of Tombola or Tombolata dei femminielli, a popular game performed every year on the 2nd of February, as the conclusive part of the Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine. Achille della Ragione suggests that recent surveys have shown that Neapolitans have a generally negative view of what he calls \\"the politically correct model of homosexuality of a hypocritical do-gooder society\\" (implying the mainstream Western gay culture), yet he contrasts femminielli as enjoying a favorable attitude from part of Neapolitan society. Polynesia In Polynesia there are many different terms for gender roles, for example in Tahiti the role is called mƒÅh≈´. In Samoa the male gender variant is called fa‚Äôafafine which means \\"like a woman.\\" Tuva and Tonga have terms also. In Tonga the term is fakaleiti and in Tuva the term is pinapinnaine. All of these terms are used when a male engages in women's work, clothes, speech tones, and nonverbal gestures. However, in Polynesia when a man crosses genders and \\"acts like a woman\\" he is not viewed as becoming a woman, but is suspended between male and female, being neither at the same time, but having the elements of both. They tend to be effeminate and interested in women's household tasks, but do not dress exclusively as women. They often seek oral sex with men, who may ridicule them in public, but seek them out for pleasure in private.Rupp, Leila J. \\"Toward a Global History of Same-Sex Sexuality.\\" Journal of the History of Sexuality 10.2 (2001): pp. 287-302. Web. Thailand Kathoeys on the stage of a cabaret show in Pattaya. Kathoey is the term used by both males and females that allows them to be alongside the normative masculine and feminine identities. Up until the 1970s hermaphrodites and cross-dressing men and women could all come under the term kathoey, however the term has been dropped for the cross-dressing masculine females who are now referred to as tom. As a result of the shifts, kathoey today is most commonly understood as a male transgender category. Kathoey is derived from the Buddhist myth that describes three original human sex/genders, male, female, and a biological hermaphrodite or kathoey. Kathoey is not defined as merely being a variant between male or female but as an independently existing third sex. Philippines The notable gender variant role in the Philippines is the bakla. Bakla are males with a feminine spirit, or core identity, who cross-dress and are assumed to take the receiving role in sex. In the Philippines, a \\"real man\\" is simply one who is not bakla. Since there are negative connotations of local terms for gender diversity, many bakla prefer to self-identify as gay, rather than a new gender. The baklas' partners are not considered homosexual by Filipino society. Over time, baklas have tried to gain status as a third sex or gender as an attempt to normalize their nonconformity and be equal to males and females in society. Nigeria Oyewumi observes that among the Yoruba people there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before colonialism. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous. The cultural definition of homosexuality In cultures where the difference between male and female in the gender binary is masculine and feminine, it is important to look at how same-sex sexuality changes between cultures. In some cultures, like the travesti, homosexual behavior moves one from one part of a gender binary to another. Homosexuality, and its effects on the individual's place in society is sometimes drastically different in various other cultures. In certain Sambia people of New Guinea for example, it is believed that a boy is unable to reach puberty or maturity without first ingesting the semen, considered life-force, of an older male.Peoples, James G. \\"The Cultural Construction of Gender and Manhood.\\" Men and Masculinity. 1st Edition ed.Cengage Learning, 2001. Print In addition, these Sambian people believe that a man is unable to replenish his semen on his own, so the ritual continues until a certain time, usually marriage, when he is told of a tree that exudes a milky semen-like sap he may ingest instead. In Basotho society in contemporary Lesotho, girls and women may exchange long kisses, engage in cunnilingus, and even fall in love and form a marriage-like union. In this society however, sex requires penetration, and marriage requires a man as a husband. Therefore, in this context, there is no concept of lesbianism. The Alternative Model of Gender In \\"The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough\\", Anne Fausto-Sterling explores the possibilities of the intersex and how these individuals fit into the traditional labeling of \\"male\\" and \\"female\\". Her \\"Alternative Model of Gender,\\" is a proposition that allows for the inclusion of intersexual individuals into the traditional gender labeling system. Anne Fausto-Sterling proposes that a body does not necessarily have to fit into the orthodox gender binary set by a society, but rather can be categorized under the possibility of male, female, merm, ferm, and herm, which are labels given to individuals born with a variation in sex characteristics. Fausto-Sterling's \\"Of Gender and Genitals\\" discuses the fate of the individuals born with \\"ambiguous\\" genitalia and the need to surgically correct the deviations these individuals propel into a male-female society. She explores the need for allowing the body to be labeled as is, rather than configuring it into the expectations of society, as the traditional binary gender labeling calls for. The Alternative Model allows for this type of gender labeling. Gendered violence Gendered violence is an important worldwide issue that can take place in different forms with varying consequences. It can be similar to a hate crime in which physical violence is specifically targeting the victim's gender. Transgender people and women experience the most gender violence but anyone can be a victim. Women are particularly at risk of gender violence in intimate relationships. Women are 10 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner violence. This act of violence occurs in the public as well as the private domain and can sometimes be overlooked. Countless deaths have resulted from these severe crimes as seen in the film Two Spirits.Two Spirits. Lydia Nibley. Say Yes Quickly Productions, Riding the Tiger Productions, and Just Media, 2010. DVD. Organizations nationwide such as California Coalition Against Sexual Assault help to support and aid the Latino communities in particular to put an end to domestic violence. It is also a matter related to the dominant gender system, which often underlies the motives for gendered violence. The dominant gender system also creates structural violence.

[1] This village is part of the district of the Equator and the territory of Bikoro, lying on Lake Tumba. The word Mooto with two vowels -o means star, something that is bright and placed in a higher place. Its plural is \\"Mioto\\" (or stars). When it is written with one closed vowel -o, it means simply a person, the plural is \\"Bato\\" (or people). But when it is written with one open vowel -o between m and t followed by an open -o at the end, it means a Caterpillar in English or \\"Chenille\\" in French. The plural is meto. The main language of Mooto village is Lo-Ntomba, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The language code is \\"nto\\"; it has several alternate names: Lontomba, Ntomba, and Ntomba-Bolia. Lontomba language is classified in group C35; Bangui-Ntomba.[2] The concept \\"Mooto\\" is used in the United States and Canada to name martial arts equipment used for taekwondo, judo, and karate. History Originally, Mooto was founded before the Berlin conference (1884-1885) by \\"Bo-mpembe\\" people. The word Bompembe means a group of people who belongs to the person named \\"Mpembe\\", a clean person. They acquired forest and brooks surrounding Mooto territory a long time ago with or without the assistance of some pygmies. As Masters (Baoto), Mooto people are surrounded by pygmies in the middle and in each side of the village. Historically speaking, the mission of the pygmies was not only to protect their seniors but also to assist them with basic needs such as hunting, fishing, farming, building houses, etc. Newcomers settled in Mooto every year were assigned free portions of lands or brooks (Mekonda, Mpumba, and Mamba) by ‚ÄúN‚Äôsomi enka ehe‚Äù, the chief of the village or first son the village to build houses and forest to exploit. And the place where each group of foreigners settled is called by the name of their ancestor. The following ethnic groups constitute Mooto village: Bompenge, Bobaya, Ngandi, Mekombo, Bongoy, Bompembe, Mission, Meenge, Bonzebu, Mokau, etc. The whole village has three big parts, Liko inka ehe (the North of the village), Iyongo inka ehe (the Middle of the village), and Nse enka ehe (the South of the village). thumb Religion Mooto people believe in one God, so- called Nzakomba, Nkolo, Momba e Ibanda or Nyambe in Lontomba language. There are three types of religion in the village: Christianism, Kimbaguism, and Ebale Mbonge. The majority of people in Mooto village are Christians belonging to Catholic, Baptist, and Pentecostal churches. Besides the Christian religion, there are two indigenous religions: the Kimbaguist (http://irr.org/african-indigenous-churches-chapter-fifteen) and \\"Ebale Mbonge\\". The Kimbaguist religion or church is exclusively composed of pygmies while Ebale Mbonge is composed only with a minority of people. The Catholic Church was founded around 1940 by Roman Catholic missionaries from Belgium. Their parish is named Saint Emile. The Belgian missionaries belong to the Congregation of the Mission known as Lazarist. They have houses in the following places within the province of Bikoro: Bikoro, Mooto, Bokongo, Bolobo, Itipo, Iboko, Mbandaka, Maluku, and Kinshasa. Geography Latitude: 0¬∞45'33.8\\" Longitude: 18¬∞1'13.8\\" Geographically, Mooto is located in the north of Kinshasa, the south of Mbandaka and the west of Lake Tumba. So, Mooto is surrounded by the following villages: Botale (11.7 km), Bobanda (11.7 km), Samba (18.4 km), Iyembe-Monene (18.5 km), Botende (18.5 km), Iyembe-Moke (19.9 km), Ehanga (20 km), Lomposo (26.2 km), Ndote (27 \\"km), Nkake(36.5 km), Ikoko- Bonginda (41.1 km), to name but a few (www.traveling luck.com/Africa/Congo+(Kinshasa)/Congo,+Democratic+Republic+of+The+(general)/_2312533_Mooto.html). There are two seasons in Mooto: the rainy and the dry seasons. In general, Mooto has a dry tropical wet and dry climate. It features a lengthy rainy season which spans from October through May and a relatively short dry season which runs between June and September. As it lies south of the Equator, its dry season begins around its \\"winter\\" solstice, which is generally in June of each year. The dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year. In fact, the rain forest \\"...is working to support people of the Lake Tumba tribes ...\\" Economy There is a trade between Mooto, Bikoro, Mbandaka, Kinshasa, and other places within the Congo. Agriculture is the main business of Mooto, as it is done in other towns of the Equatorial forest. Agriculture is based on the sale of products such as cacao, coffee, corn, cassava, pepper, plantain, etc. Besides the agricultural business, hunting is a significant activity during the rainy season. Between 1978 and 1997, the former bishop Fr√©d√©ric Etsou Nzabi Bamunguabi (3/12/1930 ‚Äì 6/1/2007) established a developmental center in the village called Centre de D√©velopement Rural de \\"Maenge\\", the local name of the place where they built the center. The CDRM is the ONLY business in the area that provides people a paying job. This center went bankrupt for several years. They reopened it no later than 2010 by VZW Mooto & Bikoro (Raeymaekers-Verboven). Mooto people are poor; they literally survive with hunting, fishing, and farming. This picture was in Mooto in 2020 Demographics There are three groups of people living in Mooto village: Baoto (seniors), Batua (pygmies), and Baluma or Babutu (Foreigners). Generally speaking, the majority of the population is constituted by the Senior citizen. They own the village: the land, the brooks, and the forest. The cardinal rule in their contact is the concept of mutual respect and collaboration. Mooto people are hard workers. The village is lead by \\"Nsom'ehe\\" (the first child of the village). He is assisted by two \\"capitas\\" or adjoint leaders. There are 6 ethnic groups in the whole village which are: Palata, Mekombo, Bongoy, Bompembe, Mission, Menge, and Mokau. The population has started growing since 1975 when Bishop Frederic Etsou created a High School for agricultural study and a business called in French Centre de Development Rural de Maenge. Now, the village has a clinic serving not only Mooto villagers but also those of the surrounding villages. Other schools were added since 1992: a high school for technical and Education studies, plus two elementary schools. Actually, the village counts three elementary schools and three high schools. The demography of Mooto changed dramatically with the creation of these businesses.

Their presence is traditionally believed to protect The Crown and the Tower; a superstition holds that \\"if the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it.\\" Some historians, including the Tower's official historian believe the \\"Tower's raven mythology is likely to be a Victorian flight of fantasy\\". The earliest known reference to captive ravens at the Tower is an illustration from 1883. Historically, wild ravens were common throughout Britain, even in towns, the Tower being within their natural range. When they were exterminated from much of their traditional range, including London, they could only exist at the Tower in captivity and with official support. The Tower ravens are tended to by the Ravenmaster of the Yeomen Warders. Local legend puts the origin of the captive raven population at the time of King Charles II (reigned 1660‚Äì85). Some of the ravens at the Tower were specially bred in Somerset.  History   Origins of the legend  The earliest legend that connects the Tower with a raven is the euhemerised Welsh tale of the war against the Irish leader Matholwch who had mistreated the princess Branwen. Branwen's brother Br√¢n the Blessed (King of the Britons) ordered his followers to cut off his head and bury it beneath The White Hill (upon which the Tower now stands) facing out towards France as a talisman to protect Britain from foreign invasion. Br√¢n is the modern Welsh word for raven and the magical and protective qualities of ravens are attested throughout Celtic mythology. The knowledge that Br√¢n's head was buried beneath the White Hill would have served as protective reassurance in the Celtic tradition, just as modern ideas about the presence of ravens does. As such, it is likely to have its origins in British folklore.  Later legends  A view () of thumb It was said that at the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536, \\"Even the ravens of the Tower sat silent and immovable on the battlements and gazed eerily at the strange scene. A Queen about to die!\\" The ravens of the Tower behaved much worse during the execution of Lady Jane Grey in 1554, purportedly \\"pecking the eyes from the severed head\\" of the queen. In his article \\"How Ravens Came to the Tower of London\\", American author Boria Sax came to the conclusion that \\"the ravens were originally brought in to dramatise the alleged site of executions at the Tower\\". One legend attributes the start of the tradition of keeping ravens with clipped wings in the Tower of London to Charles II and to his royal astronomer John Flamsteed, although there are versions of the legend that differ in their details. According to one legend, John Flamsteed complained to Charles II that wild ravens were flying past his telescope and making it harder for him to observe the sky from his observatory in the White Tower. Flamsteed requested that the birds be removed, but Charles II refused to comply with this request. Another variation of this legend says that it was Charles II himself who disliked the wild ravens' droppings falling onto the telescope. The conversation with his astronomer that supposedly followed decided the fate not only of the ravens, but also of Greenwich, where the Greenwich Observatory was commissioned by the King in 1675. In this version of the legend the King complained: Yet another legend attributes the appearance of ravens in the Tower to the Great Fire of London in 1666. Wild ravens, as well as pigs and kites, were the biggest scavengers in medieval London. Allegedly after the fire, survivors started persecuting ravens for scavenging, but Flamsteed explained to Charles II that killing all ravens would be a bad omen, and that the kingdom would not outlive the last killed raven. Charles II then ordered six birds to be kept at the Tower.  Wild ravens in London  Wild ravens are native to Britain (and most other parts of the Northern Hemisphere), although in recent times breeding populations are mostly restricted to the wilder western upland areas of the British Isles. It is quite likely that ravens lived in and around the Tower centuries ago, because until the 16th century, ravens lived in close proximity to people as well as in wild areas; they were welcomed in towns because their scavenging habits of feeding helped keep the streets clean. However, in later years wild ravens were viewed as a threat to livestock, and during the 19th century they were eliminated in many areas by systematic hunting and shooting. The last time ravens nested in the wild in London was in Hyde Park in 1826, but the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reported in 2004 that ravens had been observed nesting in the Home Counties around London, as close as 30 miles from the Tower. Ravens in the Tower of London, from London Town (1883) The first two known depictions of ravens in the Tower of London both date from the year 1883. One is in a special edition of the newspaper The Pictorial World and the other is from the children's Book London Town, written by Felix Leigh and illustrated by Thomas Crane and Elizabeth Houghton.Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 50-53., . Sax found the one early mention of importation of captive ravens in the 1918 book The Tower from Within by George Younghusband. Younghusband stated that the ravens were provided by the 4th Earl of Dunraven (1841‚Äì1926). The second Earl of Dunraven had been a patron of the Druidic scholar, poet, and forger Iolo Morganwg, who convinced the family that their castle in Glamorgan had been the original residence of the raven-god Bran, actually an early king. The Earls may have thought of the ravens as avatars of Bran, and wished to assert a spiritual claim over the Tower.Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 36-40. Geoffrey Parnell, the official Tower of London historian and a member of the Royal Armouries staff, also believes that the allegedly ancient history of captive ravens at the Tower is just a legend that was created during the Victorian era. And during Parnell's research, despite the superstition that the Crown depends on the continued presence of the ravens, \\"[he] has found the blunt statement in the records 'there are none left' ‚Äì and yet the monarchy and the tower have more or less survived\\". This alludes to a period right before the reopening of the Tower after World War II, when the only surviving ravens, the mated pair Mabel and Grip, disappeared from the Tower, perhaps eloping to a nearby wood. The story of their escape appeared in several local American papers.Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 80-84. Dr Parnell also believes that the first captive ravens may have been introduced to the Tower as pets of the staff. After \\"The Raven\\" the famous narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe was first published in January 1845, the Western world became fascinated with the birds. Japanese novelist and scholar Natsume S≈çseki visited the Tower in 1900. He wrote an account published in 1906 reporting a total of six ravens at the Tower as a central focus during and following an execution at the site. It was noted, however, that S≈çseki's writing style \\"blends fantasy, history, and present experience.\\"  World War II  The first reference to an early version of the legend that Britain will fall if the ravens leave the Tower comes from July 1944, when ravens were used as unofficial spotters for enemy bombs and planes during the Blitz of World War II.Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, pp. 62‚Äì73. During the Blitz, all but one of the ravens died from either bombing or stress. The sole survivor was a raven called Gripp. After this, Winston Churchill, then prime minister, ordered more ravens to bring the flock back to the correct size. The Tower ravens are enlisted as soldiers of the Kingdom and were issued attestation cards in the same way as soldiers and police. As with soldiers, they can be dismissed for unsatisfactory conduct.  Recent events  Today the Tower's ravens are one of the attractions for tourists visiting the City of London. However, visitors are advised not to feed the birds and warned that a raven will bite if it feels threatened. Since 1987, the Tower ravens have been the subject of a successful captive breeding programme. For example, over time, 17 chicks were successfully hatched and raised by a pair of ravens known as \\"Charlie\\" and \\"Rhys\\". Charlie came to an unhappy end: he bit a bomb-sniffing dog (who was also named Charlie), and the dog grabbed the raven with his teeth. This dog bite killed the bird. While visiting the Tower in 2003, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is reported to have been taken aback by one of the bird's verbal skills; Thor greeted each person in his entourage with a \\"Good morning!\\". During the global spread of H5N1 virus (\\"bird flu\\") in 2006, the ravens of the Tower were taken inside and lived in \\"custom-built aviaries\\". Raven Jubilee was presented to the Queen to mark the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, and later released in the Tower, bringing the total number to eight. In May 2013, two Tower ravens were killed by a red fox that managed to infiltrate the grounds, the only fox attack inside the walls ever recorded. This reduced the raven population to the minimum number of six. Upgraded security measures were included in the plans for a major refurbishment of the raven accommodations, funded by the independent Historic Royal Palaces organisation. Appointed in 2011, current Ravenmaster Christopher Skaife was caring for seven of the birds in 2018. He has reduced the amount of clipping of the wings and feathers by a third to allow the ravens to fly, instead of merely hopping or gliding. He has allowed one of the birds, Merlina, to fly to the wharf on the Thames, but she always returns due to her bonding with her keeper. During Skaife's tenure, only one raven, Munin, has escaped, but was captured by a member of the public. On St. George's Day (23 April) 2019, four chicks were hatched from ravens Huginn and Muninn, the first to do so at the Tower since 1989. One of the chicks remains at the Tower and has been named George, in reference to the date the hatching began.  Care and diet  The ravens' aviary in 2004 The ravens cannot fly far because the flight feathers on one wing are clipped. With a single wing clipped, they can only fly short distances to perch. Otherwise, as Boria Sax writes, tongue-in- cheek: Each Tower raven has a different coloured band on one leg, to make it easier to identify individual birds. Ravens in captivity in the Tower grounds have had lifespans of over 40 years. The Tower's ravens are given individual names, and are all under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The diet of the ravens is carefully maintained. In 2007, the Ravenmaster Derek Coyle commented: \\"I buy fresh meat from Smithfield ‚Äì liver, lamb, beef, chicken. And occasionally when I‚Äôm at my own place in Suffolk someone will give me some rabbit that‚Äôs been killed. If I see roadkill on the road, and it‚Äôs not been too badly mangled, I normally put it in a black bag and bring it back here. I give them biscuits as well, soaked in blood from the meat that I buy. And in winter I get them capsules of cod liver oil. I know they‚Äôre getting as much vitamins and oil as they possibly can. That‚Äôs why they look so healthy.\\" Their diet consists of raw meat daily, usually liver, lambs' hearts and beef or pork trimming, and every other day includes boiled egg with shell and blood-soaked bird biscuits. Occasionally, rabbit parts with fur are added for roughage. Once a week the birds are given a thorough check-over, and once every third week the lifting feathers on their right wings are trimmed to prevent them from flying away.  Raven stories  Most Londoners are fond of the ravens, but sometimes an individual bird will fall out of favour because of inappropriate behaviour. For example, \\"Raven George\\" lost his appointment to the Crown, and was retired to Wales for attacking and destroying TV aerials. A special decree was issued about the incident: In 1996, two more ravens fell out of favour and were dismissed from the Tower for \\"conduct unbecoming Tower residents.\\" Despite having their flight feathers clipped on one wing, sometimes the Tower ravens desert their duties. In 1981, Grog the raven decided to leave the surroundings of the Tower for those of a pub, after 21 years of faithful service to the Crown. In contrast, a raven named Mabel was kidnapped from the Tower soon after World War II, a mystery that has never been solved. Another story concerns the two ravens named \\"James Crow\\" and \\"Edgar Sopper\\". James Crow, who was a much-loved and long-lived raven, had died. After noticing the commotion surrounding the other raven's death, Edgar Sopper decided he could \\"play dead\\" in order to bring more attention to himself. His trick was so convincing that the ravenmaster fully believed that Edgar Sopper had died. When the ravenmaster picked up the \\"corpse\\", Edgar bit the man's finger and \\"flapped off croaking huge raven laughs\\". Likewise, \\"Merlin\\" has since been known for eliciting a commotion from visitors by occasionally playing dead. In 1990 a chaplain named Norman Hood died in his chamber on the Tower grounds. Former Assistant Ravenmaster Tom Trent has reported that the ravens appeared to be aware of the death, for they soon gathered on the Tower Green near the chapel, called out, and then became quiet, as though to pay their respects. Corvids have been widely reported to hold \\"funerals,\\" in which they mourn and then cluster around a dead bird in silence.Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds.

He was born on December 16, 1978, and raised in Bellerose, New York. Chef Forgione competed on and won season three of The Next Iron Chef in 2010. Early life Marc began his career at the age of 16, joining his father, Larry Forgione, in the kitchen at An American Place. Marc fully embraced his father's livelihood and has built on his unique culinary foundation to carve out an identity of his own. Marc is related to Francesco Forgione, a Catholic saint, who is a great, great uncle of his father Larry. Marc opted for a traditional four-year education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he graduated from the School of Hotel and Restaurant Management. He spent his summers working the line at restaurants in New York, with chef Kazuto Matsusaka. These stints would lay the groundwork for Marc's post-collegiate toils, again alongside his father at An American Place and later under Patricia Yeo at AZ. When Yeo and celebrated chef Pino Maffeo opened Pazo, they took Marc along to serve as sous chef at the short-lived eatery. When Laurent Tourondel set out to develop his flagship, BLT Steak, he recruited Marc as his sous chef. In an effort to diversify his experience, Marc left for France, where he secured a series of humble posts under Michel Guerard in Eugenie les Bains. He worked at three of the region's restaurants, Le Pres D'Eugenie, Ferme aux Grives and Le Cuisine Minceur. Career When he returned to New York, Marc reunited with Tourondel, who invited him to serve as chef de cuisine at BLT Prime. Following his role as chef de cuisine, Marc was named corporate chef for the BLT Restaurant Group, a position that enabled him to develop recipes and maintain the quality of the BLT brand as it went on to include more restaurants across the country. Marc has played a key role in the openings of BLT Fish and BLT Market, as well as the Washington, D.C., San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Dallas locations of BLT Steak. Marc received a star in the Michelin Guide New York City 2012, making him the youngest American-born chef to receive the honor in consecutive years (2010, 2011, 2012). In addition, Marc received a two-star review from Sam Sifton of The New York Times. The restaurant also earned the distinction of being named \\"Key Newcomer\\" by Zagat Guide 2009, \\"Top 25 Restaurants in NYC\\" by Modern Luxury magazine and \\"All Star Eatery\\" by Forbes. Marc was awarded \\"Star Chefs Rising Star of the Year Award 2010,\\" named \\"Rising Star 2008\\" from Restaurant Hospitality and mentioned \\"New Formalist\\" by Esquire in 2008. In January 2012, Marc announced he would be opening a new steakhouse at the Revel Resort & Casino in Atlantic City called American Cut. In summer 2013 he partnered with Executive Chef Soulayphet Schwader to open Khe-Yo, a Laotian-inspired restaurant using local market ingredients. Chef Marc Forgione opened his second outpost (and the flagship location) of American Cut in New York City in September 2013. Chef Forgione's first cookbook, Marc Forgione: Recipes and Stories from the Acclaimed Chef and Restaurant was published in late April 2014 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

It reappeared in Gran Turismo 6. A full-size, non-functioning model appeared at the Goodwood Festival of Speed and in Madrid. The digital creation was a response to Kazunori Yamauchi's question: \\"If you built the fastest racing car on land, one that throws aside all rules and regulations, what would that car look like, how would it perform, and how would it feel to drive?\\" The prototype was designed by Red Bull Racing Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey in conjunction with Yamauchi. It features enclosed wheels, and a fan element to increase low- and medium-speed downforce (much like in a Chaparral 2J or Brabham BT46B). Overview The X2010 was theorised by Newey, head engineer of Red Bull Racing, and Yamauchi, and features exclusively in later Gran Turismo video games. The hypothetical car, designed as an ultimate racing machine, was designed with pure speed in mind, rather than adherence to rules and regulations, making it theoretically superior to a Formula One car in terms of speed and handling. Initially, the concept of the X2010 was based on a low air resistance, single-seat covered-wheel prototype: a car powered by a forced induction engine producing 1479 HP, aiming to achieve a top speed of over 470 km/h (292 mph) (max of 494 km/h whilst using slipstreams in the game) and a maximum lateral G-force of 6g. Upon seeing the machine's concept and design model, Newey proposed the addition of fan car technology, a long-time dream held as a racing designer. The benefit of a so-called \\"fan car\\" is that air is continuously pulled from underneath the car, creating an area of comparatively lower pressure. This difference in pressure above and below the car presses it towards the ground, producing downforce. The fan principle allows the X2010 to maintain high cornering speeds in corners where traditional aerodynamic devices become insufficient at low speeds. After the evaluation of the X2010's technology, the car was redesigned, incorporating refinement advice from Newey. With its low air resistance achieved through a smooth glass canopy and full cowling over the tyres, and the downforce gained from the fans (at lower speeds), the front and rear wings, and the rear diffuser (at higher speeds), the car ultimately achieved a theoretical maximum speed of 500 km/h, a weight of 545 kg, and a maximum lateral G force exceeding 8G. The driver who performed the virtual shakedown test of the car was Red Bull Racing driver Sebastian Vettel. On his first run, he shortened the simulated course record held by Formula 1 cars on GT5's simulation of the Suzuka Circuit by over 20 seconds, drawing out the theoretical potential of the X2010 machine.Car Magazine. \\"Red Bull X1 Supercar 2010\\", \\"Car Magazine\\", 28 October 2010 14:50, accessed 9 December 2010. Due to its great speed and cornering, possession of the car makes simulator progress much easier, and because of this, it became a much sought-after model soon after Gran Turismo 5's release. In the United States, virtual copies of the car were on sale on the auction website eBay for as much as $250. Later versions Version 2.0 of Gran Turismo 5 features an updated version of the car, the X2011, featuring a larger rear wing, a more powerful engine, and lower air resistance. A slightly detuned version of the X2010 with a larger wing and no fan, called the X2010 5G, was only offered in Japan as part of that country's Red Bull 5G competition series. An updated version of the car, the X2014, appears in Gran Turismo 6 (with and without fan technology) and Gran Turismo Sport (without fan technology), alongside an entry-level \\"Junior\\" variant. A model was displayed at Autosport International 2014. On Update 1.40 of Gran Turismo Sport, Red Bull Racing and Gran Turismo released the X2019 Competition, which was developed from the X2014 Standard. Unlike the previous models, the X2019 features a 3-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine rather than a turbocharged V6. The X2019 is designed to be a more realistic version of the car to be used in the FIA-Certified Gran Turismo Championships, as previous versions of the car were considered too fast to be used effectively by most drivers. The car was first introduced in the 2019 FIA Gran Turismo Championships, and will be painted in the colors of the finalists from their represented country in the Nations Cup Finals. Merchandise In September 2012, it was announced that AUTOart would be producing a 1:18 scale version of the X2010. The model was released in a range of colours in 2013 and sold out. In 2016, the same company released a model of the X2014, available in three colours.

The wood and sap have a strong foetid smell that resembles excrement because of the presence of skatole. The oblate to oblong, strongly 3-veined leaves are 50‚Äì130 mm in length. Although the tree resembles Cinnamomum iners in its 3-veined leaves, it can easily be distinguished by its serrated leaf margins. The seed, protected by the 7‚Äì11 mm long fruit‚Äôs hard and durable endocarp, is dispersed by water. Flowers - Inflorescence - male greenish, short racemose cymes; female more slender axillary or terminal cymes. Fruits - beaked, pear-shaped drupe. Distribution and habitat The tree is found throughout the tropical regions of Asia, from India and Sri Lanka, through Indo-China, southern China and Malesia to the Philippines. It occurs on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the northeastern Indian Ocean, where it forms about 1% of the primary rainforest canopy. It grows in drier, seasonal rain forest.

Waddington In 1783, the New York legislature enacted the Trespass Act which stripped Tories of their property and privileges and gave patriots the legal right to sue anyone who had occupied, damaged or destroyed homes they had left behind British lines during the war. On June 29, 1784, the case of Rutgers v. Waddington was presented before chief justice James Duane. The plaintiff, Elizabeth Rutgers, represented by Egbert Benson, had owned a large brewery and alehouse that she was forced to abandon when the British occupied New York City. Under the new Trespass Act, Rutgers demanded rent in the sum of ¬£8,000 from Waddington, who had been running the brewery since it was abandoned. Waddington defense was litigated by Alexander Hamilton, Brockholst Livingston, and Morgan Lewis, who posited that the Trespass Act violated the 1783 peace treaty ratified earlier by Congress.ProbertencyEncyclopedia.com, Rutgers Vs Waddington Duane ruled that Rutgers was only entitled to rent from the time before the British occupation and the two parties agreed to the amount of ¬£800.NovelGuide.com, RUTGERS v.

Course The creek originates about east of Los Alamos in the Solomon Hills. It flows westerly from the hills, through the Los Alamos Valley, the Barka Slough, and the San Antonio Valley, to its river mouth north of Purisima Point on the Pacific coast. It passes through the town of Los Alamos, California and downstream flows through Vandenberg Air Force Base. Water The lower course through Vandenberg AFB has a perennial flow, in part because of irrigation tailwater, but primarily because of a geologic rift at Barka Slough which causes an upwelling. The principal crops grown within its watershed are vegetables in the flat fields, and winegrapes in the transitional upland slopes. All are irrigated from groundwater aquifer resources. In 1996 almost all of the water supply used by Vandenberg AFB was pumped from the San Antonio Aquifer. 36% of the San Antonio Creek Hydrological Unit is within Vandenberg Air Force Base. Ecology West of Barca Slough, San Antonio Creek is inhabited by the endangered Unarmored Three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus williamsoni) which, for all practical purposes, prohibits any stream maintenance. The endangered Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) is also found in the creek's brackish coastal lagoon and several miles upstream in sections of stream impounded by California Golden beavers (Castor canadensis subauratus) which provide ideal slow-moving water habitat for gobies. San Antonio Creek, from Rancho del las Flores Bridge at State Highway 135 to the Railroad Bridge downstream, is impaired from boron, ammonia, and nitrite pollution. History The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, camped near the creek on August 31, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary that they found \\"a large pond of fresh water\\" which has since mostly filled in, leaving a series of small ponds and marshy areas upstream of the creek mouth (Barka Slough). When Mission La Purisima was established in 1787, the San Antonio Creek area became part of the mission's pasture land. In 1837, following secularization of the mission, the area became part of the Rancho Lompoc Mexican land grant.

It was at the heart of a Muslim squatter community, whose size is estimated at roughly 5,000 people. In April 2005, a fire destroyed 170 houses in the squatter community, leaving two children dead. The mosque was across the Catholic National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help; Los Angeles Times writer Richard C. Paddock used this contrast between the large, well-maintained church and the far more modest mosque as an opening allegory to an analysis of the inequalities between Muslims and Catholics in the Philippines.Los Angeles Times: Bridging Philippines' Islands of Faith Jurisdiction The Baclaran Mosque is owned by the Baclaran-Para√±aque City Islamic Center, Inc., whose legal representatives are Nasser Ramos, Jalil Moluk, and Sultan Sohayle Cosain Tanandato.

The MMDA offered residents ‚Ç±5,000 in compensation to move to other sites. Roberto Esquivel, said on behalf of the MMDA that the mosque would remain untouched temporarily, but the residents themselves had to move.Manila Standard Today: 'Baclaran squatters have to go' By June, the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) claimed that 121 out of 344 total families there had accepted ‚Ç±30,000 in compensation to return to their home provinces. Remaining families were quoted as vowing a \\"struggle\\" against demolition attempts. The Office of Muslim Affairs and the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Manila wrote to the government to seek assurances that the mosque would not be affected; the PRA promised that it would not tear down the mosque, and said that a search was underway to identify a suitable relation site for the mosque.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Shanties destroyed in Baclaran Muslim community; Grand Mosque untouched On the morning of 7 June, a PRA demolition team and 50 Pasay City police surrounded the site, planning to begin demolition work.GMA News: Tension up in Baclaran as demolition teams ring Muslim community Some residents took refuge in the mosque; others went out to confront the demolition team and threw stones at them, leading police to respond by beating them with truncheons; furthermore, some residents set fire to their own homes as the demolitions proceeded. The demolitions were completed by noon, leaving 800 people homeless.GMA News: 800 residents lose homes in Baclaran demolition Some evicted residents even appealed to Auxiliary Bishop of Manila Broderick Pabillo for help in delivering a letter to the government. Affected residents remained in the vicinity of the mosque, and on 26 June were granted a 60-day reprieve from the eviction order.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Court grants 60-day reprieve to Baclaran community In the end, the residents rebuilt their homes on the same land. In June 2008, after a court order from the Para√±aque Regional Trial Court for residents to vacate the area, 300 instead armed themselves with wooden clubs and successfully faced off another demolition attempt by 100 Pasay City police officers.The Philippine Star: Informal settlers fight to stay in Baclaran reclamation area 2009 relocation attempt Relocation order In May 2009, then Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita sent a memorandum to the Philippine Reclamation Authority instructing them to reclaim the land and relocate the mosque to another site on Coastal Road, so that the land could be used for the construction of the Southwest Public Transport Intermodal Center. However, local residents claimed that the land would actually be used for high-end residential developments and casinos. Oscar V. Cruz, the founder of anti- gambling organization Krusadang Bayan Laban sa Jueteng (People's Crusade Against Jueteng) and then-Archbishop of Lingayen-Dagupan, spoke out in opposition to the demolition, as did the NGO Urban Poor Associates.The Philippine Star: Cruz warns government vs. demolishing Baclaran mosque In early August, Swiss NGO Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions also wrote a letter to then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to urge her to halt the evictions and to condemn the worsening living convictions faced by the residents due to the repeated demolition attempts.The Philippine Star: Swiss group calls for halt to eviction of Baclaran Muslims The Para√±aque Regional Trial Court Branch 274 issued a writ of execution in relation to the memorandum on 13 August 2009. This writ ordered the settlers and the mosque to vacate the area peacefully, and warned that the court might use force to implement the order. The writ was delivered just before the start of Ramadan that year, leading to further consternation by the Muslims. In September, Catholic priest and activist Fr. Robert Reyes, showed solidarity with the Muslim residents by joining them in their Ramadan fast, and expressed his opposition to the relocation. Violent clash On 18 November 2009, Muslim residents violently clashed with Pasay City police who were attempting to enforce the demolition order. Roughly 170 shanties were destroyed without incident, but among roughly 300 residents who had sought refuge in the mosque, some began throwing stones at police. The police responded with gunfire, killing three residents including a seven-year-old boy, and injuring another seven.Manila Bulletin: 3 die, 7 hurt in Baclaran demolition Nine of the police implementing the demolition order were also injured. The incident led to condemnation against the police by Anak Mindanao Party Representative Mujiv Hataman. In early comments after the incident, the police stated that no one had died. Aftermath After the incident, the Philippine Reclamation Authority, and Pasay Mayor Wenceslao Trinidad, continued to state that they would pursue plans to relocate the mosque. However, in the short term, they stated that the mosque would remain in place and the transit center plans would seek to \\"integrate\\" the mosque. The proposed relocation site, Lot 1555 in Barangay Tambo, was also reportedly the object of a dispute between the government and a private individual. The individual in question, Dr. Bernardo de Le√≥n, asserted that the lot at the corner of Kabihasnan Street and Coastal Road, was actually in Barangay San Dionisio, and belonged to his family after he had inherited it in 1984. Para√±aque Mayor Florencio Bernabe countered that the property had actually been handed over to the city government in payment of back taxes. The lot had been an object of dispute as far back as 1992, when Public Estate Authority security guards entered the compound and destroyed improvements made by De Le√≥n and his family. 2013 demolition On 24 September 2013, the mosque was demolished by the city government, due to the lack of legal land ownership held by a shopping mall, as well as an effort to reduce known pickpocketing and violence in the nearby area. In the early weeks, various illegal shopping stalls were also ordered by the city mayor to be disposed due to congesting the city streets and designated parking slots leading up to the area around the Shrine.

Amherst College had strong ties to the Sapporo Agricultural College in Japan through its connection with Vice Minister for Education Tanaka Fujimaro, who had visited Amherst during the Iwakura Mission and subsequently returned from 1874-1877 for further first-hand research on the American school systems with the aim of modernizing and westernizing education in the Empire of Japan. He approached Amherst president Julius H. Seelye for advice on establishing a curriculum for use in the new state schools being established in Japan. He also visited the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, after which he submitted a report to the Japanese government praising the Amherst style of physical education over the more regimented, military-drill style techniques then in use in Japan. Steele recommended Leland, who was subsequently hired as a foreign advisor by the Meiji government, arriving in Japan on September 6, 1878. After touring several schools, he implemented a two-tier training regime at a Physical Education Teaching Centre, with a \\"heavy course\\" in gymnastics for athletes, and a \\"light course\\" for women and children, involving the use of dumbbells and introducing the sports of croquet, cricket and baseball. His first class of 21 physical education teachers graduated in 1881. Leland's contract was not renewed by the Japanese government for financial reasons, and he departed Japan on July 31, 1881. Although Leland's teacher education facility was discontinued in April 1886, his theories and techniques were adopted by the Japanese high school system, and continue to be used to this day. After departing Japan, Leland travelled to Europe, returning to Boston in October 1882, where he established a private medical practice, and also developed the gymnastics program for the YMCA.

Use of the term Origin Iron Horse was used admiringly when comparing early road and railroad traction engines performance to slower, less powerful horse powered tramways. The Iron Horse term became widely popularized and found frequent use in the century and a half following the competition won by Stephenson's Rocket, in innumerable newspaper articles as well as in various novels.

The editorial effectively defined the student movement as a destabilizing anti-party revolt that should be resolutely opposed at all levels of society. As the first authoritative document from the top leadership on the growing movement, it was widely interpreted as having communicated the party's position of \\"no- tolerance\\" to student protesters and their sympathizers. The contents of the editorial were derived from a Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) meeting at the residence of Deng Xiaoping on the morning of April 25. During the meeting, the PSC came to the general agreement that the students aimed to overthrow Communist rule and were being heavily influenced by similar anti-Communist movements in Eastern Europe.Zhang Liang, The Tiananmen Papers, eds. Perry Link and Andrew J. Nathan, p. 71. New York: PublicAffairs, 2001. As such, it threatened the survival of the existing senior leadership, the Communist Party, and the political system itself. Deputy chief of propaganda Zeng Jianhui wrote the draft, while Hu Qili and Li Peng served as editors. On the evening of April 25, the finished editorial could be heard on national radio and television news stations.Link and Nathan in The Tiananmen Papers, p. 75. The editorial enraged the student protesters, widened the chasm between the students and the party leadership, and emerged as a sore point of contention for the rest of the movement. Students protested in large numbers on April 27, and thereafter continuously asked for the editorial to be retracted. Within the party leadership, Zhao Ziyang advocated for the editorial to be \\"toned down\\" or rescinded, but faced significant opposition and was unsuccessful. Contents Titled \\"We Must Take a Clear-cut Stand against Disturbances\\", the editorial begins by addressing the entire population of China, acknowledging their diverse expressions of grief.Renmin ribao (People‚Äôs daily) editorial of April 26, 1989. Retrieved November 2, 2010. Specifically referencing the need to \\"turn grief into strength\\", the editorial suggests that the poignancy of Hu's death reaffirms the significance of upholding the four modernizations. Carried out by \\"an extremely small number of people\\", subversive responses, which the editorial describes as mostly verbal denunciations of the CPC, are an example of \\"abnormal phenomena\\" to be dealt with swiftly. Focusing in on the students, the editorial references their assembly at Tiananmen Square on April 22 in an effort to participate in Hu's official memorial. The Party, acknowledging that the state of mourning creates \\"emotionally agitated\\" students, demonstrated \\"tolerance and restraint\\" towards this gathering, and the memorial was allowed to proceed without difficulty. The fundamental problem, according to the editorial, is that \\"an extremely small number of people with ulterior purposes\\" have taken advantage of students, teachers, and even workers, to promote a \\"reactionary\\" message against Party leadership. The editorial describes this small group of people as not grieving, but executing a \\"planned conspiracy\\" to \\"plunge the whole country into chaos and sabotage\\", in order to \\"negate the leadership of the CPC and the socialist system\\". This accusation declares actions like the spreading of rumours, the use of posters, and the forming of unions, as completely detrimental to the future of the nation. To put this in perspective, the editorial suggests that \\"reactionary\\" behaviour could potentially reverse the economic progress made by Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs program of reform and opening up. According to the editorial, this jeopardizes existing initiatives to control prices, eliminate corruption, and take on political reform. The editorial therefore calls on the population to help stabilize the political status quo by refusing to take part in any disturbances. Illegal unions, rumour mongering, and \\"unlawful parades and demonstrations\\" are presented as not only violations against the state, but also against a student's right to study. The editorial ends by alluding to a general agreement among students and the Party to eliminate corruption and promote democracy, emphasizing the need to end disturbances for China to move forward. Intellectual critique In mid-May 1989, author Wang Ruowang published a rebuttal, arguing vehemently against the editorial. Wang calls the accusation toward ‚Äúpeople with ulterior motives‚Äù conveniently ambiguous since it allows the Party to target virtually anyone for persecution.Wang Ruowang. ‚ÄúThe Student Movement and Hu Yaobang Represent the Banner of Justice ‚Äì Thoughts on Reading the April 26 Renmin ribao Editorial,‚Äù in Beijing Spring, 1989, eds. Mark Lambert, Michel Oksenberg, and Lawrence R. Sullivan, p. 210-211. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1990. He also claims that the editorial lacks evidence when referring to incidents like the shouting of ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù slogans. Still, Wang argues, it deliberately mentions these incidents to provide a pretext for the Party to suppress demonstrators.Wang Ruowang, p. 213. While he sees the editorial as an attempt to reaffirm the authority of the Party, he argues that it has actually been counterproductive on this point. Wang suggests that by threatening the students, the editorial itself provokes tension, effectively heightening the disturbances it had hoped to curb.Wang Ruowang, p. 216. Influence on the protests Throughout the Tiananmen Square protests, the editorial remained a major point of contention, as Party members argued about its message and students called for its retraction. General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, recognizing the editorial‚Äôs negative consequences, repeatedly made the suggestion among his colleagues to revise it. First, in a private conversation with Premier Li Peng, Zhao explained that though he himself supported the editorial, it had become ‚Äúa real sore point‚Äù with students, creating an ‚Äúus-versus-them mentality‚Äù that could be eased with a simple tweaking of the editorial‚Äôs tone.The Tiananmen Papers, p. 117. Li, on the other hand, argued that the editorial could not be altered, first because it was completely accurate, but also because it was a manifestation of Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs views, which could not be questioned.The Tiananmen Papers, pp. 117‚Äì118. As the movement progressed into a hunger strike, Zhao again pushed to revise the editorial, with the belief that settling the sensitive topic would effectively ease tension.The Tiananmen Papers, p. 180. Following his resignation, Zhao made one last gesture urging Deng to ‚Äúchange the official view of the student movement‚Äù from the editorial‚Äôs perspective,The Tiananmen Papers, p. 201. but by this point, he had been discredited within the Party and his proposal was rejected.The Tiananmen Papers, p. 205. Around this same time in mid-May, an attempt to end the hunger strike with dialogue further displayed the editorial‚Äôs resonance. Speaking to Li Peng, student leader Wu'erkaixi identified the description of the movement as ‚Äúturmoil‚Äù as a major issue concerning the hunger strikers.‚ÄúTranscript of May 18 Meeting Between Premier Li Peng and Students (excerpts),‚Äù in Cries for Democracy, ed. Han Minzhu, p. 243. New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990. He presented as a solution the publishing of a new, apologetic People‚Äôs Daily editorial, ‚Äúrepudiating the one published on April 26‚Äù. In response, Li denied ever labeling the movement as turmoil, and no apologetic editorial was published.Cries for Democracy, p. 244.

Two manta rays feeding at night Description Depending on the amount of microscopic plankton present, the number of manta rays will vary. Some days no manta rays are seen while on days with high plankton levels upwards of a dozen may be present. While diving, scuba divers shine lights up while snorkelers shine them down creating a column of light which attracts millions of minuscule plankton, which in turn attracts the manta rays. A popular site is just off the coast of Hawaii Island called Garden Eel Cove, as well as the Kona Surf Hotel. Located just off the coast of Keahole Point (near the Kona International Airport), it attracts scuba divers for the abundance of manta rays. Its official name is Hoona Bay, at . Other sea life includes garden eels, Hawaiian turkeyfish, and Heller's barracuda.Jack's Diving Locker : Dive Sites History For decades travelers to Hawaii observed manta rays from restaurants and hotels along the coast, such as the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and the in 2002 closed Kona Surf Hotel. In 1992, dive operators began occasionally taking scuba divers to areas such as the Kona Surf Hotel for manta ray encounters. The frequency of these dive trips increased over the years with many dive operations offering trips most days.

Conservation and the Manta Pacific Research Foundation Manta birostris feeding With the increasing popularity of this dive the conservation and protection of manta rays has become a priority for dive operators and organizations. Manta rays in other parts of the Pacific Ocean have been hunted by fishermen as a result of the increasing demand for manta ray gill plates.Manta Pacific Research Foundation : Conservation Programs Local organizations, such as the Manta Pacific Research Foundation, try to protect the local manta rays and educate the public about manta rays and other sea life. The Manta Pacific Research Foundation's mission is to \\"study manta rays in their natural habitat, conduct scientific research, provide education programs for the public about manta rays and the marine environment, and to establish and promote global manta ray conservation\\". As a result of manta rays' fragile biological composition, guidelines to protect the health of the manta rays at this dive have been set forth by The Ocean Recreation council of Hawaii and PADI's Project AWARE. The guidelines are strictly enforced by dive operations that conduct this dive.Founder of Manta Pacific Research Foundation talk about the Manta Ray night dive rules Dive shops Several dive shops in Kailua-Kona and offer one-tank or two-tank dives.

It also worked with Netflix on the Academy Award nominated Virunga, directed by Orlando von Einsiedel, and Kip Anderson's Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret. Appian is in partnership with Netflix on several additional documentaries, including critically acclaimed The Ivory Game, How to Change the World and Catching the Sun. Recently released projects include; Sea of Shadows with National Geographic, which won the Audience Award at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, Ice on Fire with HBO, along with And We Go Green which premiered at the 2019 Toronto Film Festival. The company's first film was The Assassination of Richard Nixon (2004), which was screened at the 57th Cannes Film Festival. In the company's second film, the 2004 biopic The Aviator, DiCaprio starred as Howard Hughes. The film was a critical and commercial success, and earned several Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Its following productions were released three years later‚Äîthe comedy drama Gardener of Eden (2007) and the documentary The 11th Hour (2007). DiCaprio secured a three-season television series Greensburg (2008‚Äì2010) for the company. Appian Way produced three profitable films from 2009 to 2010, the mob drama Public Enemies (2009), the psychological horror Orphan (2009) and the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010). Three films were released by Appian Way in 2011, none of which were particularly successful. The company had three releases in 2013, including the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), which was a critical and commercial success. Banned in several countries for its controversial scenes, the film was downloaded illegally over 30 million times via BitTorrent sites. The Revenant (2015) followed, a highly successful western thriller about the life of the frontiersman Hugh Glass. History 2004‚Äì2010 Appian Way Productions was founded by Leonardo DiCaprio and takes its name from the Italian road of the same name. Its first film was The Assassination of Richard Nixon (2004), starring Sean Penn as Samuel Byck, who attempted to assassinate US president Richard Nixon in 1974. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The company's next film was the 2004 biopic The Aviator, produced in association with Forward Pass, Intermedia, and Initial Entertainment Group. Based on the 1993 non-fiction book Howard Hughes: The Secret Life by Charles Higham, the film depicted the life of Howard Hughes (DiCaprio), an aviation pioneer who became a successful film producer between the late 1920s and late 1940s while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu described the film as \\"a gorgeous tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood\\" even though it \\"tips the balance of spectacle versus substance in favour of the former\\". He praised Martin Scorsese's direction, DiCaprio and the supporting cast. The film proved to be a commercial success, with a worldwide gross of $213.7 million against a budget of $110 million. It earned a total of eleven nominations at the 77th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Scorsese) and Best Actor (DiCaprio), and won five of them, including a Best Supporting Actress award for Cate Blanchett. alt=A photograph of Leonardo DiCaprio. Kevin Connolly, a close friend of DiCaprio, directed Appian Way's next film‚Äîthe comedy drama Gardener of Eden (2007), which, according to The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck, \\"lack[ed] the necessary dramatic urgency or black humor to connect with audiences\\". A few months later, Appian Way released The 11th Hour, a documentary about global warming. The film, featuring 50 experts who suggested solutions to various environmental problems, won the Earthwatch Environmental Film Award through the National Geographic Channel in March 2008. DiCaprio wrote a three-season television series Greensburg (2008‚Äì10) which was produced by the company. Appian Way later produced another biopic, Public Enemies (2009), a Michael Mann-directed mob drama starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Following the final years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp) as he is pursued by FBI agent Melvin Purvis during Great Depression, the film was an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933‚Äì34. A commercial success, it also received generally positive reviews, though critics found historical inaccuracies in the film. The company, along with Dark Castle Entertainment, released the 2009 psychological horror film Orphan, which told the story of a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year- old girl. The film was considered by the adoption community to promote negative stereotypes about orphans. Although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. Scorsese reunited with the company to make the film Shutter Island (2010), a psychological thriller based on the 2003 novel of same name by Dennis Lehane. DiCaprio played U.S. Marshal Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels, who investigates a psychiatric facility located on an island but eventually comes to question his own sanity. A commercial success, the film received generally positive reviews; Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised the film's direction and performances but criticized its \\"silly twist ending\\", calling it \\"supremely exasperating\\". 2011 onward Red Riding Hood, directed by Catherine Hardwicke, was Appian Way's first release in 2011. The film, set in a village haunted by werewolves, follows a young girl who falls in love with an orphan woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure. Earlier in production, the film was titled The Girl with the Red Riding Hood. Although it was poorly received by critics‚ÄîMary Pols of Time named it one of the Top 10 Worst Movies of 2011‚Äîit had moderate box-office returns. The company's second release in 2011 was Detachment, a Tony Kaye-directed drama about the high school education system. George Clooney directed and co-produced the company's final film of the year The Ides of March, which is based on Beau Willimon's play Farragut North. Starring Ryan Gosling, Clooney and Philip Seymour Hoffman, this political drama takes place during a presidential primary, when an ambitious press secretary (Gosling) becomes embroiled in a political scandal. The film received positive reviews; one from The Guardian praised the direction and the performances of the cast. alt=A picture of Martin Scorsese smiling away from the camera. Three films were produced by Appian Way in 2013; the first was Runner Runner, an ensemble crime thriller, which The Guardian Xan Brooks described as \\"a lazy, trashy film that barely goes through the motions\\". The thriller Out of the Furnace, the company's second release, was also negatively received by critics and was a box office bomb. Scorsese directed the company's final film in 2013‚ÄîThe Wolf of Wall Street, a biopic on the life of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and money laundering on Wall Street in the 1990s. The screenplay was adapted by Terence Winter from Belfort's memoir of the same name. The film was banned in Kenya, Malaysia and Nepal for its controversial depiction of events, explicit sexual content, profanity, and hard drug use. Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, becoming the 17th- highest-grossing film of 2013. According to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio, the film was the most widely infringed of 2014, as it was downloaded illegally over 30 million times via BitTorrent sites. It was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, although it failed to win in any category. In 2015, DiCaprio produced and co- starred with Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson in The Revenant, directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. This biographical western thriller is based on in part on Michael Punke's 2002 novel of the same name, which itself was inspired by the frontiersman Hugh Glass's survival after being mauled by a grizzly bear in 1823. Co-produced with Regency Enterprises, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, Anonymous Content and M Productions, the film was well received with particular praise for the performances, direction and cinematography. \\"Bleak as hell but considerably more beautiful, this nightmarish plunge into a frigid, forbidding American outback is a movie of pitiless violence, grueling intensity and continually breathtaking imagery\\", according to Justin Change of Variety. Built on a budget of $135 million, the film earned $533 million worldwide. The Revenant received 12 nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, and won three, including Best Director and Best Actor. In May 2016, Appian Way Productions signed a three-year, first-look production deal with Paramount Pictures. In December 2016, the company released Live by Night, based on the 2012 novel of same name by Dennis Lehane. Directed by, written by and starring Ben Affleck, this Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. Also that year, the company produced four documentaries, Davi's Way, The Last Shaman, The Ivory Game and Before the Flood, the last of which won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Documentary. In 2017, Appian Way produced Under the Bed, a television film thriller about a young woman trying to get over a breakup, while befriending a stalker on social media. In association with Blumhouse Productions and GK Films, the company will produce Delirium, a supernatural horror film scheduled for a 2017 release.

Post office In 1906, a post office was established and was named Ellwood after two men who were instrumental in its development, Charles O. Wood and William Ellis. The post office was located just south of Ledbury on Bank Street and was operated by Jane Cutts (1846-1923) in the general store that she and her son George ran, which dated back to the 1870s. The post office closed in 1943. School A school house, Gloucester School Section 3, was built in 1856 and was located on the site of an apartment building on Bank Street just north of Ledbury Avenue. It served Gloucester students of the area until 1956 and Ottawa Public School Board students for a year or two beyond that. It was used for private businesses until it was demolished in the 1980s. Railway station A small railway station existed on the north side of Walkley Road, west of Bank Street where a shopping centre now stands. Passenger service was provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway until October 1957. The station was the scene of a four-car derailment on January 21, 1922 which claimed the life of engineer Howard Edward White and left twelve passengers hospitalized.\\"The Village of Ellwood Lost to The Greber Plan\\" by Glenn Clark, Historic Gloucester, Vol 14, No 4 2013, pgs. 8-9 Housing During the pre‚ÄìWorld War I land boom, subdivisions were registered covering the area between Walkley Road and Ledbury Avenue and between Bank Street and Albion Road. These were named Ridgemont Park and Paardeburgh Park (in honour of a Boer War battle). Only a small number of houses were built. Power During the early 1930s, transmission towers were built between Kitchener Avenue and Ledbury Avenue. Hall Around the start of World War II, a dance and reception hall named the Right Spot Inn was built on the corner of Ledbury Avenue and Bank Street and lasted for about 10 years. Development As a result of the Greber Plan, the original village was expropriated in 1949 and 1950 to make room for the Walkley Railway Yards, the Bank Street overpass and a never built federal parkway. All the houses and other buildings with the exception of the school were either demolished or moved. About this time, many houses began to be built in the earlier mentioned pre‚ÄìWorld War I subdivisions except in the hydro and parkway corridors. This gave the community its current general appearance.

By this time so intimately acquainted had he become with the habits and manners of Isl√°m, that in the spring of the same year he boldly joined the annual Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca),The cyclop√¶dia of India and of eastern and southern Asia ‚Ä¶, Volume 2 3rd ed., Edward Balfour, p. 903 (London 1885). and successfully accomplished a dangerous exploit which no other Englishman had achieved without disguise of person or of nationality.Christians at Mecca, By Augustus Ralli, pp. 200‚Äì3, (London 1909). In 1868 he passed by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Shir√°z, where he resided some months in 1869, employed in making himself thoroughly acquainted with the scenes and life of Persia, to carry out more efficiently the great work of his life, a metrical and literal translation of the chief poems of H√°fiz,Through Persia by caravan, Volume 2, Arthur Arnold, pp. 135‚Äì6, 212, (London 1877). which, during fifteen years, had been under revision. But on 14 March 1875, before the manuscripts had received their final corrections, his life was abruptly terminated by disease, induced or hastened by the wear of constant change of climate, exposure in mountain exploration, and by an accident in an attempt to ascend the Matterhorn. He died in London, and was buried at Ramsgate. As a traveller he had great powers of endurance, he was a fair draughtsman, and as a linguist of unsurpassed ability; his varied accomplishments being also united with the happiest power of lucidly explaining the most abstruse theories of metaphysics and etymology, which his extensive reading had mastered. Besides a few pamphlets, he published the translation of H√°fiz (posthumously issued), which include a variety of chronograms two centuries prior to their European introduction.Chronograms: 5000 and more in number, James Hilton, pp. v. 540, (London 1882).H√°fiz of Sh√≠r√°z: selections from his poems, By ·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì, translated by Herman Bicknell, p. xi‚Äìxii.

It was discovered on 11 July 2010 by the Pan-STARRS-1 survey at the Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in the United States. American astronomer Michael Brown considers it a \\"highly likely\\" dwarf planet.  Classification and orbit  ' has an observation arc of 1774 days, and there are currently no known precovery images to help refine its orbit. It is currently 53.7 AU from the Sun. Based on JPL's best-fit solution for the orbit, it reached aphelion around 1829. It is estimated to come to perihelion around 2079. Although the discovery is credited to Pan-STARRS, the object was first announced in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular by American astronomers David Rabinowitz, Megan Schwamb and Suzanne Tourtellotte observing from La Silla Observatory on 9 September 2010.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.  Physical characteristics  Assuming a generic trans-Neptunian albedo of 0.09, it is about 580 kilometers in diameter. However, since the true albedo is unknown and it has an absolute magnitude of 4.4, it could easily be from about 350 to 780 km in diameter (for typical albedos of 0.05 to 0.25). Michael Brown estimates a similar diameter of 561 kilometers, also using a geometric albedo of 0.09 and a fainter 4.6 absolute magnitude.

The larvae or maggots feed on onions, garlic, and other bulbous plants. Morphology and biology Onion damaged by D. antiqua larvae The onion fly has an ash-grey body and resembles a housefly. The male has a longitudinal stripe on the abdomen which is lacking in the female. The legs are black, the wings transparent, and the compound eyes brown. The eggs are white and elongated and are laid in groups on the shoots, leaves, and bulbs of host plants and on the ground nearby. The larvae are white and cylindrical and hatch in 3 to 8 days. Each batch of larvae tends to keep together and collectively create large cavities in bulbs. More than 50 maggots may feed on one bulb, sometimes originating from eggs laid by several females. The larvae moult three times, feed for about 20 days, and grow to about 1.0 cm long. The pupa is brown, ringed, and ovoid and measures long. Pupation occurs in the ground with the pupal phase from the spring generation lasting two or three weeks. Late-generation pupae overwinter in the soil. Distribution The onion fly is found in North America, Western Europe, Russia, Central Asia, China, Japan, and Korea, but is absent from deserts. In the far north of its range, it has one generation per year, but further south, two, three, or four generations may occur in one year. Economic significance The larvae damage bulbs of onions, garlic, chives, shallots, leeks, and flowering plants. The first generation of larvae is the most harmful because it extends over a long period owing to the females' longevity and occurs when the host plants are small. Seedlings of onion and leek can be severely affected as can thinned-out onions and shallots. Less damage occurs in wet and cold springs, as this delays the development of the larvae. When plants are attacked, the leaves start to turn yellow and the bulbs rot quickly, especially in damp conditions. Control measures include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, survey and removal of infested plants, and autumn digging of the ground to destroy the pupae.

Her Christian faith was critical to her activities in social and church- related clubs.Collier-Thomas, Bettye.Jesus, Jobs, and Justice: African American Women and Religion (New York: Random House, 2010), 385.For more on the history of women's roles in Baptist churches, see Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Righteous Discontent: the Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920. Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1993. Background Fouse grew up in Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She started her teaching career in 1893 in a segregated high school in Corydon, Indiana. She also taught penmanship to white students at Harrison County Institute, and played clarinet in a band though she was the only Black person. She married William Henry Fouse (1868‚Äì1944), a school principal, on August 10, 1898. Who's Who of the Colored Race, Vol. 1, Frank Lincoln Mather, ed. (Gale Research Company, 1915), 106. Social activism Fouse was well known for her membership in the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), and became the President of the Kentucky Association of Colored Women (KACW). During her time in the KACW, Fouse started and maintained a scholarship loan fund, which she sustained for over 40 years. Papers from the NAACP showed Fouse as the Principal Correspondent for the Lexington, Kentucky chapter.

She held the officer position at many organizations, including the Acme Art and Culture Club, the Women's Improvement Club and Day Nursery, the Women's auxiliary of the Emancipation League, and the Baptist Women's Educational Convention. \\"In opposition to discrimination, segregation, and limited public assistance, Fouse followed a strategy that encouraged self- help, self-sufficiency, and respectable behavior. Although it served the community, club work also allowed black women to cultivate leadership skills and establish a base of organizational strength. Through their civic activism, women like Fouse created and sustained institutions that enabled the Black community not only to survive racism, but demand civic and political rights.\\"Heinecken, Dawn. \\"Woman Activists and Politicians.\\" Kentucky Women Radio Project. WFPL. Accessed 29 November 2010. Another important aspect of Fouse's activism was temperance. The first state convention of the Kentucky Woman's Christian Temperance Union (KWCTU), was held in Lexington in 1881. Membership was not open to African American women, though there was some cross-organizational work with Black women's clubs in Kentucky. During the KWCTU Executive Committee Meeting in 1905, local branches were requested to organize auxiliary unions for African-American women to join. In 1907 the newly created Lexington Negro Woman's Christian Temperance Union established a Colored industrial school in the former Good Samaritan Hospital on East Short Street. The school had a day nursery and a vocational training school for children.\\"Industry,\\" Lexington Leader, 08/31/1907, p.8. In addition, Fouse and a Mrs. Ballard led the Lexington Sojourner Truth WCTU.

History  The academy was opened by Cesar Gracie. It rose to prominence in the late 2000s based on the success of a close-knit group of Gracie students known as the \\"Skrap Pack\\": Jake Shields, Gilbert Melendez, and brothers Nick and Nate Diaz. All fought primarily in the Strikeforce promotion at that time and were some of its most popular stars. Prior to Jake Shields' UFC signing in 2010, Cesar Gracie Jiu-Jitsu housed champions in three of five weight classes in the Strikeforce promotion. This success helped Cesar Gracie secure a position among the nominees for \\"Coach of the Year\\" at the Fighters Only 2010 World MMA Awards. On April 17, 2010, members of the Cesar Gracie Jiu Jitsu camp were involved in a brawl following the main event at Strikeforce: Nashville in Nashville, Tennessee. The incident began as Jason Miller, a former opponent of Jake Shields, interrupted Shields' post-fight interview following his decision victory over Dan Henderson. Shields, Nick Diaz, Nate Diaz, and Gilbert Melendez scuffled with Miller after he asked Shields for a rematch. In response to the brawl, the Tennessee Athletic Commission recommended a range of fines and suspensions for the fighters involved.

Harrison wrote the song as a tribute to Frank Crisp, a nineteenth-century lawyer and the original owner of Friar Park ‚Äì the Victorian Gothic residence in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, that Harrison purchased in early 1970. Commentators have likened the song to a cinematic journey through the grand house and the grounds of the estate. The recording features backing from musicians such as Pete Drake, Billy Preston, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Alan White. It was co-produced by Phil Spector, whose heavy use of reverb adds to the ethereal quality of the song. AllMusic critic Scott Janovitz describes \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\" as offering \\"a glimpse of the true George Harrison ‚Äì at once mystical, humorous, solitary, playful, and serious\\". Crisp's eccentric homilies, which the former Beatle discovered inscribed inside the house and around the property, inspired subsequent compositions of Harrison's, including \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\" and \\"The Answer's at the End\\". Together with the Friar Park-shot album cover for All Things Must Pass, \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" established an association between Harrison and his Henley estate that has continued since his death in November 2001. The composition gained further notability in 2009 when it provided the title for Harrison's posthumous compilation Let It Roll. My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James and Dhani Harrison are among the artists who have covered the song. Background Frank Crisp, by Leslie Ward, 1891 Since 1965, George Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, had lived in Kinfauns in Surrey, south of London.Clayson, p. 178. The house was a bungalow and too small to accommodate a home recording studio,Greene, p. 164. so the couple began a year-long search for a larger property,Boyd, pp. 142, 143. concentrating on an area west of London encompassing the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire.Clayson, p. 299. In January 1970, Harrison purchased the 120-room Friar Park, set on 33 acresHuntley, p. 46. of land, just west of Henley-on-Thames.Clayson, pp. 299‚Äì300. Previously the home of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Salesians of Don Bosco,Clayson, p. 301. the four-storey house and its grounds were in a dilapidated state,Inglis, p. 29.Boyd, pp. 144, 145, 146. and it was not until the start of March that the Harrisons moved from a worker's cottage and into the main residence.Clayson, pp. 301, 302. The entrance to Friar Park, including caretaker's lodge; photo by Steve Daniels The house was built in 1898,Boyd, p. 144. on the site of a thirteenth-century monastery, by Sir Frank Crisp, a successful City of London solicitor, microscopist and horticulturalist well known for his eccentricities.Clayson, p. 300. Harrison described Crisp as a cross between Lewis Carroll and Walt Disney.Greene, p. 165. While compiling Harrison's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, in the late 1970s, Derek Taylor observed that Harrison \\"frequently talks as if [Crisp] were still alive\\".George Harrison, p. 37. Clean-up work during the first few months at Friar Park unearthed various legacies of Crisp's time there, such as stone and wood engravings containing whimsical homilies, some of which the Salesian nuns had concealed or painted over.O'Dell, p. 137. The 10 acres of Crisp's formal gardens were so overrun with weeds that Harrison and his friend from the Hare Krishna movement, Shyamasundar Das, used World War II-era flamethrowers to clear some of the land.Greene, p. 167. Among the garden features was a series of tiered lakes connected by tunnels, to the south-east of the house, and an Alpine rock garden topped by a 100-foot replica of the Matterhorn, to the north-west. On 17 March 1970, despite the property's state of disrepair, the Harrisons threw a party to celebrate Pattie's 26th birthday and St Patrick's Day.O'Dell, p. 143.Miles, p. 372. According to their friend and assistant Chris O'Dell, the guest list comprised all the other Beatles and their wives, as well as insiders such as Derek and Joan Taylor, Neil Aspinall and his wife Susie, Peter Brown, and Klaus and Christine Voormann.O'Dell, p. 144. In what was a rare social get-together for the Beatles, three weeks before Paul McCartney announced he was leaving the band, the party was a \\"great success\\", O'Dell writes. Shortly afterwards, Harrison invited members of the London- based Hare Krishna movement to help with the restoration work, primarily in the grounds of Friar Park,Tillery, p. 90.Boyd, p. 155. and accommodated the devotees and their families in a wing of the house.Greene, p. 166.O'Dell, p. 153. While satisfying Harrison's spiritual convictions, these visitors proved less welcome to Boyd,Boyd, p. 156.Greene, pp. 166‚Äì67. who found herself shut out of her husband's life.O'Dell, pp. 153‚Äì54.Tillery, p. 92. Composition Following the Beatles' break-up on 10 April 1970,Miles, p. 374. and having long discussed the possibility of recording a solo album of his songs,Tillery, p. 87. Harrison committed to the project over dinner at Friar Park with Boyd, O'Dell and Terry Doran,O'Dell, pp. 155‚Äì56. his friend and temporary estate manager.George Harrison, p. 71fn. The following month, Harrison performed a selection of his compositions in London for Phil Spector, his co-producer on All Things Must Pass,Spizer, p. 220. one of which was \\"Everybody, Nobody\\".Badman, p. 10. With its reference to roads and the UK's Highway Code, \\"Everybody, Nobody\\" has been described by musical biographer Simon Leng as Harrison's first \\"motoring\\" song.Leng, p. 95. Harrison soon completely rewrote the lyrics and took part of the melody for his first musical tribute to Crisp and Friar ParkClayson, p. 303. ‚Äì titled \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\".Olivia Harrison, p. 268. The result, in Leng's opinion, was a signpost to its composer's future involvement in film,Leng, p. 94. an interest that, like gardening and motorsport, would flourish in a dwelling that offered \\"privacy without imprisonment\\". Leng writes that the song's lyrics read \\"like a movie script\\", with verse one \\"panning\\" from the house outside to the garden: Japanese stone lantern and dwarf wistaria at Friar Park in the late 1890s, during Crisp's time as owner In his book The Words and Music of George Harrison, Ian Inglis similarly views the song as \\"a guided tour of the house and grounds\\", with Harrison \\"pointing out features of particular interest\\". After \\"scene two\\"'s setting ‚Äì \\"among the weeds\\" and inside Friar Park's formal maze ‚Äì the third verse focuses on the property's grottos and extended woodland. Verse three includes the lines \\"Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile / Handkerchiefs and matching tie\\", the last of which Leng describes as Harrison's \\"first clear reference\\" to Monty Python, his favourite comedy troupe.Clayson, p. 271. Part of the property's rock garden, pictured in 1905 The song's \\"final scene\\" focuses on what Leng calls \\"the illusions within the illusion\\", as the narrative returns to the interior of the house and the \\"real people\\" living there. The lyrics include mentions of housekeepers and \\"the spiritually awakened Lord and Lady\\", Leng writes, before the scene \\"rolls off into the unknown beyond\\": Rather than people, Inglis views the first of these lines as a reference to the \\"many extraordinary features Crisp had installed\\", among them \\"fantastic statues, bizarre gargoyles, illuminated caverns ... and hidden stepping-stones\\". In a song otherwise free of religiosity, theologian Dale Allison interprets \\"Fools illusions everywhere\\" as a typical Harrison statement regarding mƒÅyƒÅ ‚Äì the illusory nature of human existence.Allison, pp. 63, 136. According to Harrison's later recollection, Spector suggested that \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" might attract a few cover versions if he changed the lyrics. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that the song was \\"a piece of personal indulgence\\", but \\"those words were written because that's what it was\\" ‚Äì a tribute to Frank Crisp.George Harrison, p. 208. A number of Crisp's homilies directly inspired other Harrison songs during the first half of the 1970s,Spizer, p. 224. such as \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\" and \\"The Answer's at the End\\".George Harrison, pp. 280, 300. Harrison went on to identify philosophically with Crisp,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 42.Huntley, p. 58. of whom he writes elsewhere in I, Me, Mine: \\"Sir Frank helped my awareness; whatever it was I felt became stronger, or found more expression by moving into that house, because everything stepped up or was heightened.\\" Leng considers that the song, along with \\"All Things Must Pass\\", predicts Harrison's eventual \\"retreat into an internal musical dialogue, set amid the woods and gardens of Friar Park\\", a change of perspective marked by his 1979 eponymous solo album.Leng, p. 210. Recording Harrison's solo performance of \\"Everybody, Nobody\\" for Phil Spector took place at Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970,Madinger & Easter, p. 426. a recording since made available unofficially on the Beware of ABKCO! bootleg album.Unterberger, p. 286. Harrison completed the rewrite, \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\", within a matter of weeks, judging by the appearance of pedal steel virtuoso Pete Drake on the session,Rodriguez, pp. 275‚Äì76. which was held at Abbey Road between 26 May and early June.Madinger & Easter, pp. 427, 431. By late June, Drake was home in Nashville producing Ringo Starr's second solo album, Beaucoups of Blues (1970),Badman, pp. 11‚Äì12.Schaffner, pp. 139‚Äì40. the recording of which, author Bob Woffinden suggested in 1981, \\"was probably completed more quickly than any one of the tracks on All Things Must Pass\\".Woffinden, p. 37. Part of the reason for Harrison taking so long to make his album was the interruption to recording caused by his frequent visits to Liverpool's neurological hospital,Clayson, p. 289. where his mother was dying of cancer.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40. Following her death on 7 July,Badman, p. 12. Harrison invited his elder brothers Harry and Peter to live on the Friar Park estate and manage a team of full-time gardeners and botanists.Greene, pp. 178‚Äì79. The released recording of \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\", in Leng's words, is as \\"an ethereal and echoey version of the Band's minimalist melodicism\\", in which Drake's pedal steel guitar represents the \\"ectoplasmic\\" Crisp floating through the song, and Harrison \\"sounds like he's recorded his vocal track in one of the park's legendary caves\\". The line-up of musicians included three keyboards players, which Leng and author Bruce Spizer list as Bobby Whitlock (on piano), Billy Preston (organ) and Gary Wright (electric piano). Whitlock himself has stated that he played piano very rarely during the All Things Must Pass sessions, however.Whitlock, pp. 75‚Äì76. In his song-by-song discussion of the album, Whitlock offers a line-up that includes Preston on piano and he writes of the other keyboard parts: \\"This track is swimming with the two Garys\\" ‚Äì Wright and Gary Brooker.Whitlock, p. 81. Although Leng credits the song's two acoustic guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied one of these parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park.Klaus Voormann interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Village Roadshow, 2011; directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese). Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971,Badman, pp. 32‚Äì33. when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.Doggett, pp. 149, 164. While relatively free of the Wall of Sound production style found elsewhere on the album,Harris, p. 72. the song's \\"sense of the mysterious\\" is conveyed through Spector's liberal use of reverb, Alan Clayson writes,Clayson, pp. 302‚Äì03, 323. particularly on Alan White's snare drum and Harrison's murmured backing vocals following verses two and four.Madinger & Easter, p. 431. The words that Harrison half-sings are \\"Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp\\"; this part and the lead vocal were overdubbed at Trident Studios in central London, at Spector's suggestion. Aided by the swirling sound of Hammond organ, and Leslie treatment on the piano and pedal steel tracks, the effect of Spector's production enshrouded \\"the whole tale in a reverb-induced haze\\", as Scott Janovitz of AllMusic puts it. Release and reception Cover of Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album, depicting him at Friar Park surrounded by four of Crisp's garden gnomes Delayed from its intended release date by over a month due to the extended period of production,Madinger & Easter, p. 427. All Things Must Pass was issued on Apple Records in late November 1970 to great acclaim.Spizer, pp. 219‚Äì20. The triple album featured a cover photo of Harrison dressed in gardening attire,Spizer, p. 226. seated on the main lawn of Friar Park's south garden and surrounded by four figures from Crisp's extensive collection of Bavarian gnomes. Having been stolen \\"in about 1871\\", according to photographer Barry Feinstein, the figures had just been returned to Friar Park and placed on the grass.Dennis McLellan, \\"Barry Feinstein dies at 80; rock music photographer\\", Chicago Tribune, 21 October 2011 (retrieved 22 November 2014). Commentators interpret Feinstein's photo as representing Harrison's removal from the Beatles' collective identity,Harris, p. 73. and the cover helped establish a synonymity between Harrison and Friar Park that Alan Clayson has described as equalling that between Queen Elizabeth II and Windsor Castle. On release, \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\"'s lyrical affectations provoked comment from American reviewers in particular. Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone remarked that there were \\"lots of 'Ye's' to remind us it's a ballad\\", but identified the song as part of the album's \\"musical core\\", the \\"brooding essays on living, loving, and dying\\".Ben Gerson, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971 (retrieved 3 July 2012). Village Voice contributor Nicholas Schaffner recognised it as an \\"olde English ballad\\" dedicated to what he mistakenly called \\"George's 17th-century castle\\".Schaffner, p. 142. To the NMEs Alan Smith, the track was a \\"meandering song-tale ... which may take a little longer for me to appreciate\\".Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 15 July 2012). Acknowledging that listeners in 1970‚Äì71 might have been \\"mystified\\" by Harrison's lyrics, Bruce Spizer has written of this \\"catchy ballad\\": \\"its beautiful melody and hook-laden refrain ensured that it would be one of the album's highlights.\\" More recently, Clayson has described \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" as \\"[c]ouched in mediaeval expression\\" and the most \\"Beatle- esque\\" of all the songs found on All Things Must Pass, featuring an arrangement that is \\"a breath of fresh air\\".Clayson, pp. 302‚Äì03. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow also acknowledges the cryptic quality of the lyrics ‚Äì \\"unless one happened to know that George and Pattie had just moved to ... a magnificent Gothic pile near Henley-on-Thames\\" ‚Äì and considers the song \\"hauntingly beautiful\\".Snow, p. 25. Less impressed, in The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham deems the track \\"drearily whimsical\\" and an example of how \\"the main song set [on All Things Must Pass] dips in the middle\\".Ingham, p. 133. Along with his description of it as a \\"rolling filmic snapshot\\" of Friar Park, Simon Leng views \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" as a \\"musical companion piece\\" to Feinstein's album cover image: \\"[The song] conjures an allegorical dream world, populated by smirking gnomes ... a disembodied Victorian lawyer, and, in George Harrison, a refugee from the world's attention.\\" Leng sees Harrison's 1976 film clip for \\"Crackerbox Palace\\" as \\"the celluloid realization of the 'Let it Roll' script\\".Leng, p. 196. Scott Janovitz likewise views the track as \\"a tour of the grounds\\" while praising its \\"darkly beautiful\\" melody.Scott Janovitz, \\"George Harrison 'Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 3 July 2012). \\"Like no other Harrison song,\\" Janovitz adds, \\"'The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp' offers a glimpse of the true George Harrison ‚Äì at once mystical, humorous, solitary, playful, and serious.\\" Subsequent releases and cover versions The title of Harrison's only career-spanning compilation album, Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison (2009), was derived from \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\", which also appears on the album.Inglis, p. 128.

It sets a contrast to the position on judicial review in England. The petitioner complained that on being moved from his employment at one prison to another, he had been told that his moving expenses would be paid, but that they were not. The respondent said that the terms of his employment were that he was to be mobile, and that as a Crown employee his terms of employment were variable at the instance of the crown. Held: Wherever there is an excess or abuse of the power or jurisdiction which has been conferred on a decision-maker, the Court of Session has the power to correct it. Judgment The Court of Session held that does not require that the decision complained should have any public law element in order to be reviewable: > ‚Ä¶ the Court of Session has power, in the exercise of its supervisory > jurisdiction, to regulate the process by which decisions are taken by any > person or body to whom a jurisdiction, power or authority has been delegated > or entrusted by statute, agreement or any other instrument > The public or private nature of the inferior body or tribunal is not > decisive, nor is it necessary to enquire whether the decision of the > inferior body or tribunal is administrative in character. The essential > point is that a decision-making function has been entrusted to that body or > tribunal which it can be compelled by the court to perform‚Ä¶ The essential > feature of all these cases is the conferring, whether by statute or private > contract, of a decision-making power or duty on a third party to whom the > taking of the decision is entrusted but whose manner of decision-making may > be controlled by the court. [per Lord President Hope at page 650, emphasis added]. Crucially, in Scots administrative law the competency of an application to the supervisory jurisdiction > ‚Ä¶ does not depend upon any distinction between public law and private law, > nor is it confined to those cases which English law has accepted as amenable > to judicial review... Significance The law of Scotland is different from the law of England on this matter: see, for England, R v Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Great Britain ex parte Wachmann[1992] 1 WLR 1036 in which Simon Brown J held that a decision of the Chief Rabbi to terminate a rabbi‚Äôs employment was not reviewable: to attract the court‚Äôs supervisory jurisdiction, there must be ‚Äònot merely a public but potentially a governmental interest in the decision-making power in question.‚Äô [at page 1046, emphasis added].

Malher's division managed to capture a bridge and hold it against Austrian counterattacks. The battle occurred during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the larger Napoleonic Wars. After Mack's Austrian army invaded Bavaria, it found itself the target of a powerful offensive by the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France. When Napoleon's corps threatened to envelop Mack's army, the Austrian general unwisely held his ground near the city of Ulm. As the French armies blocked the Austrian retreat routes to the east, Mack attempted to move his army to the south bank of the Danube. After receiving orders to seize the Danube bridges, Marshal Michel Ney sent Malher to capture the crossing at G√ºnzburg. Malher's main attack on two bridges failed in the face of a vigorous Austrian defense. However, a late-arriving French unit captured the eastern bridge that had just been rebuilt by the Austrians and was able to hold on to it until evening. Discouraged by the encounter, Mack ordered his soldiers to march back to Ulm which is 22 kilometers west-southwest of G√ºnzburg. Background War plans Austria, defeated by France in the War of the Second Coalition and forced to accept a French client state in Italy, planned to take revenge. In November 1804, Austria made a secret alliance with the Russian Empire whereby Austria's 235,000 soldiers would be supported by 115,000 Russian troops and financial backing from Great Britain. The head of the Austrian army, Feldmarschall Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen believed his soldiers were not ready for war, but the pro-war faction at the court of Emperor Francis I of Austria outmaneuvered him.Schneid, Frederick C. Napoleon's Italian Campaigns: 1805‚Äì1815. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 2002. . 15 Karl Mack von Lieberich developed the war plan. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Lieberich, who had the full confidence of the emperor, became largely responsible for developing Austria's war plan. Mack's strategy called for 120,000 troops in Italy commanded by Charles, 25,000 in the County of Tyrol under Archduke John of Austria, 70,000 in Bavaria under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este, and 20,000 in reserve. Mack would accompany Ferdinand's force, which would be joined by a Russian army and attack across the Rhine River into France. Charles would sweep across Italy and invade southern France. It was hoped that the Kingdom of Prussia could be induced to join the coalition.Schneid, 16 Mack convinced Emperor Francis I that he should invade Bavaria first, while Charles marked time in Italy. The general believed that by the time Napoleon intervened in Bavaria, the Russian army would have arrived to help the Austrians. This erroneous assumption caused Mack and the war hawks to fall into \\"a comedy of errors\\".Schneid, 17 Foreseeing trouble with Mack's plan, Charles talked the emperor into transferring 30,000 soldiers from Italy to Germany, but these troops would arrive too late to remedy the situation.Schneid, 18 Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e numbered 219,000 soldiers and consisted of seven corps, the Reserve Cavalry, and the Imperial Guard. Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res led the 7,000-strong Imperial Guard; Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte commanded the 17,000-man I Corps; General of Division Auguste Marmont directed the 20,000 troops of the II Corps; Marshal Louis Davout controlled 26,000 soldiers of the III Corps; Marshal Soult led the 40,000-strong IV Corps; Marshal Jean Lannes had 18,000 men in the V Corps; Marshal Michel Ney commanded the 24,000 soldiers of the VI Corps; Marshal Pierre Augereau directed the 14,000-man VII Corps. Marshal Joachim Murat led the Cavalry Reserve with 22,000 troopers in seven divisions, while the Artillery Reserve had 5,000 gunners.Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. 1103 In the summer of 1805, the Grande Arm√©e lay in its camps on the English Channel. Napoleon planned for the Grande Arm√©e to march to the Rhine, then execute a vast right wheel from the Rhine to the Danube, picking up his 25,000 Bavarian allies on the way. Meanwhile, Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na with 50,000 troops would hold Archduke Charles in northern Italy, assisted by 20,000 reinforcements from central Italy led by General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Marshal Guillaume Marie Anne Brune would remain on the northern coast of France with 30,000 soldiers. Napoleon issued his marching orders on 26 August.Chandler, 384‚Äì385 Operations Battle of Gunzburg Campaign Map, situation morning 9 October 1805 On 8 September, the army of Archduke Ferdinand invaded the Electorate of Bavaria, with a plan to defend the line of the Lech River. The Bavarian army acted according to its secret treaty with France and marched north to the Main River.Rothenberg, Gunther E. Napoleon's Great Adversaries, The Archduke Charles and the Austrian Army, 1792‚Äì1814. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1982 . 88 Mack changed the plan on 12 September and insisted that the army continue to advance farther west to the Iller River. Ferdinand and the army chief of staff General-major Anton Mayer von Heldensfeld both opposed the move and appealed to the emperor. Francis, however, upheld his favorite Mack and dismissed Mayer from his position. Relations between the archduke and Mack deteriorated to the point where the two communicated only in writing.Rothenberg, 89 On 24 September, Napoleon's corps began crossing the Rhine. Lannes corps and part of Murat's cavalry advanced directly east into the Black Forest to trick the Austrians into believing it to be the main attack.Chandler, 390 But the real attack was coming from the northwest, and on 2 October the line of corps acted like \\"a door swinging on its hinges\\" as the corps angled south, aiming for Ingolstadt and Donauw√∂rth on the Danube.Chandler, 392 Marshal Michel Ney ordered Malher to attack. By 7 October, Napoleon's corps had reached the Danube and secured crossing points. When he became aware of the French threat, Mack made the questionable decision to stand at Ulm. To oppose the French, Mack organized his army into four corps under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg with 28 infantry battalions and 30 cavalry squadrons, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck with 30 battalions and 24 squadrons, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer with 19 battalions and 34 squadrons, and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic with 15,000 in 16 battalions, six J√§ger companies, and six squadrons. Schwarzenberg massed at Ulm, Werneck defended G√ºnzburg, and Kienmayer held Ingolstadt.Kagan, Frederick W. The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801‚Äì1805. Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2006. . 391‚Äì393 Meanwhile, Jellacic's troops held a line farther south near Biberach an der Ri√ü where they were watching the Black Forest.Kagan, 387 Mack apparently made no preparations to defend the line of the Danube. Instead, he planned to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication stretching back to France.Kagan, 397 The French easily penetrated Kienmayer's outnumbered cordon defense of the Danube at Donauw√∂rth. After a series of minor clashes, Kienmayer retreated southwest toward Munich via Aichach.Kagan, 397‚Äì398 Lannes, Murat, and Soult crossed the Danube near Donauworth. On 8 October, Lannes and Murat marched southwest and collided with Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xavier von Auffenberg's division in the Battle of Wertingen.Kagan, 396 map The French crushed Auffenberg's isolated force and forced it back toward Ulm.Smith, 203 On this day, Soult marched toward Aichach and Davout reached the Danube at Neuburg an der Donau, while Bernadotte and Marmont arrived at Ingolstadt. Ney marched to Donauw√∂rth,Kagan, 395 but he never crossed the Danube and instead moved west to Giengen while following orders to proceed to Ulm.Kagan, 406 Napoleon judged that Mack would try to retreat through Augsburg or Landsberg am Lech and sent his corps to block those routes. He rejected the idea that the Austrians would cross to the Danube's north bank and attack his supply lines. In fact, that what exactly what Mack was contemplating.Kagan, 400‚Äì401 Battle Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher was ordered to seize the G√ºnzburg bridges. After the debate at Wertingen, Mack gave up the idea of striking east along the south bank of the Danube. He instead decided to cross at G√ºnzburg and march east on the north bank. At this time, Mack and Ferdinand deployed a significant part of their army on a line from Reisensburg, just east of G√ºnzburg on the Danube, to Limbach which lies five kilometers to the southeast. General-major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr√© commanded a force on the north bank designed to watch for the French and protect the bridges.Kagan, 408 Unknown to Mack, Ney's VI Corps received new instructions to seize a crossing at G√ºnzburg. Ney sent off General of Division Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's 3rd Division to capture the bridges. Malher's 8,000-man division included six battalions of the 27th, 50th, and 59th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions of the 25th Light Infantry Regiment, and six artillery pieces. One of his brigade commanders was General of Brigade Mathieu Delabass√©. For the attack, Mather split his force into three columns. The western column under Colonel √âtienne Nicolas Lefol moved to LeipheimThiers, Adolphe. Histoire du Consulat et du l'Empire. Vol. 6. Paris: Plon Fr√®res, 1847. 92‚Äì93 but he abandoned the effort when the street led into a marshThiers, 94 (now the Badesee G√ºnzburg and Mooswaldsee).The Badesee G√ºnzburg and Mooswaldsee can be seen on Google Earth. The central column led by General of Brigade Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet moved directly south toward the two main G√ºnzburg bridges. Led by Delabass√©, the 59th Regiment made up the eastern column which moved toward a bridge just east of the town. The bridge at Reisenburg was ignored. Ignaz Gyulai was ordered to rebuild the eastern bridge. Marcognet's central column bumped into d'Aspr√©'s picket line. Alerted, the Austrians in G√ºnzburg immediately destroyed the bridges. Trapped between the French and the now-unbridged river, d'Aspr√© surrendered with 200 Tyrolean j√§gers and two cannons. Malher pressed on and attacked the town. G√ºnzburg sits on high ground overlooking the Danube and an island in the stream. The island was crossed by two bridges. From the south bank, positions suitable for artillery dominate the low banks and the island. The soldiers of the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment Nr. 3 and 20 cannons laid down a deadly curtain of fire. Malher brought forward four cannons, but they were overwhelmed by Austrian counter-battery fire. After a futile effort to rebuild the bridges under fire, the French gave up and took cover. Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr√© was captured. Despite the previous fighting, Mack persisted in his idea to cross to the north bank. Accordingly, he ordered Feldmarschall- Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai to take seven battalions and 14 squadrons to the eastern bridge. Mack directed Gyulai to repair the span, cross over, and form a bridgehead on the north bank. He intended that the army would cross to the north bank that night and operate there.Kagan, 409 The 7,000-man Austrian force included four battalions of the Kaunitz Infantry Regiment Nr. 20, three battalions of the W√ºrttemberg Infantry Regiment Nr. 38, one battalion of the Franz Jellacic Infantry Regiment Nr. 62, one J√§ger battalion, the Grenadier battalions of the Stuart, Colloredo, Erbach, and Kaunitz Infantry Regiments, four squadrons of the Archduke Palatine Hussar Regiment Nr. 12, two squadrons of the Rosenberg Chevau-l√©ger Regiment Nr. 6, two squadrons of the Schwarzenberg Uhlan Regiment Nr. 2, and six artillery pieces.Smith, 203. This order of battle clearly does not include the Archduke Charles Regiment and the 20 cannons that defended the main bridges, nor it does not add up to the seven battalions and 14 squadrons that Gyulai commanded. However, Gyulai's command probably includes the Kaunitz and W√ºrttemberg Regiments. D'Aspr√© led the J√§ger battalion and possibly more troops. No sooner had Gyulai's men repaired the bridge, then the 59th Regiment appeared, hours behind schedule. In close order column, the French smashed through the Austrian defenders and seized the span. Austrian cavalry appeared and charged the 59th three times but the French formed square and drove off each attack. Malher concentrated his division to defend his newly acquired river crossing. As night fell, the French controlled both ends of the span. Ney's other two divisions were also busy on 9 October. General of Division Louis Henri Loison's 2nd Division of VI Corps captured the bridge at Elchingen, defeating the single Austrian regiment defending it. General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Etang's 1st Division advanced toward Ulm. Result The Austrians lost six guns and 2,000 casualties including d'Aspr√© captured and Major Franz Muller of the Kaunitz Regiment killed.http://www.napoleon- series.org/military/organization/Austria/infantry/c_austrianinf2.html Millar, Stephen. Austrian Infantry Regiments and Their Commanders 1792‚Äì1815, Infantry Regiment Nr. 20 Their losses fell heavily on the W√ºrttemberg Regiment. The French suffered 700 casualties including Colonel G√©rard Lacu√©e of the 59th killed. With crossings at G√ºnzburg and Elchingen controlled by the French, Mack gave up his plan to cross at G√ºnzburg and ordered the army to retreat to Ulm. Mack later excused his mistake in instructing Gyulai to rebuild the bridge. He claimed that he was so absorbed in writing orders on the 9th that he did not notice the cannon fire.Kagan, 410 Ney reported to Napoleon that both Mack and Ferdinand had been at G√ºnzburg on the 9th and suggested that a strong enemy force lay at Ulm. However, after interviewing his prisoner d'Aspr√©, Ney concluded that the Austrians were retreating to Biberach. Napoleon then ordered Ney to attack Ulm, not understanding that he was sending a single corps against the entire Austrian army.Kagan, 412 The next action was the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October.Smith, 203‚Äì204 Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References     External links * Obscure Battles: Gunzburg 1805 These are excellent sources for the full names and ranks of Austrian and French generals. * Broughton, Tony. napoleon- series.org Generals Who Served in the French Army in the Period 1789‚Äì1815 * Smith, Digby & Kudrna, Leopold (compiler). napoleon-series.org Austrian Generals during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars 1792‚Äì1815 Category:Conflicts in 1805 Category:Battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Battles of the War of the Third Coalition Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Battles involving France Category:1805 in the Austrian Empire Category:1805 in France Category:1805 in Bavaria Category:October 1805 events Category:Battles in Bavaria ","title":"Battle of G√ºnzburg"},{"id":"29883383","text":"The Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) is an Indian quasi-judicial body that hears appeals against orders and decisions passed under the Customs Act, 1962 and Central Excise Act, 1944 as amended from time to time.

The specific epithet tomentosus refers to the hairy leaves and hairy young shoots. It grows in many different types of rainforest on a variety of soil types. Seen as far south as the Hunter River, New South Wales and growing to the most far north eastern point of the Australian continent. In its natural habitat it may reach 15 metres (50 ft) tall and a stem diameter of 30 cm (12 in). It is generally a lot smaller in cultivation. The average normal flower and fruit drop are 40% and 90% respectively. The endosperm development is ab initio nuclear and cell formation commences at the micropylar end, proceeding towards the chalaza. The outer layers of the outer integument differentiate into the edible flesh of the fruit. Alectryon tomentosus is an attractive tree, featuring jagged edged leaves, pink flowers and red fruit. The trunk is grey and smooth. It is often planted in gardens, parks or as a street tree. Green catbirds have been noticed eating the fruit. First described in 1857 by Ferdinand von Mueller as Nephelium tomentosum from a collection on the Brisbane River, it gained its current binomial name when reclassified by Ludwig Adolph Timotheus Radlkofer.

He is best known for his role in the \\"Egg Washing\\" of Mao‚Äôs portrait in Tiananmen Square, along with two friends, Yu Dongyue and Yu Zhijian during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The three men were caught by students and workers in the square, and turned over to the police. They were charged with counter revolutionary sabotage crimes against the Chinese Communist Party(CCP). Lu Decheng was sentenced to 16 years, Yu Dongyue received 20 years and Yu Zhijian was sentenced to life in prison. Lu Decheng was released after 9 years and left China for Canada in 2006.\\"Chinese writer goes on trial over articles put on Internet.\\" April 12, 2006.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/technology/12iht- china.html?_r=3&scp;=8&sq;=lu%20decheng&st;=cse Life Before Tiananmen Lu worked for the bus company in Liuyang, Hunan, China. His family had deep roots in the Communist Party, his grandmother was a martyr‚Äôs widow. His mother died when he was a young boy. His father remarried shortly after her death.Chong, Denise. Egg On Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship. Toronto: Random House Canada, 2009. At 19, Lu and his first wife, Qiuping, ran away together because their parents did not approve of their relationship. In 1982 Qiuping found out she was pregnant. As an unmarried 18-year-old, Qiuping‚Äôs pregnancy was considered illegal. The One Child Policy in China makes having children in China difficult for underage and unmarried people. Qiuping was too young to be pregnant; they were unmarried and did not have a childbirth permit. The couple chose to then fake an abortion then got married and prepared to have their child in secret. Their child was healthy at birth but after a week he fell ill and was taken to the hospital where he died. After the death of their child the couple returned to Liuyang. In 1984, Decheng and Qiuping became pregnant and had a healthy baby girl. The egg washing of Mao In May, 1989, Lu and his two friends ‚Äúhad lost all faith in the CCP‚Äù. After participating in a parade in Changsha City, Hunan province, the three men decided to go to Beijing and voice their protests alongside the students.Xiu Lu. June 4, 2006.http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-6-4/42319.html They traveled by bus to Beijing, and on May 22, they had decided that they were going to deface Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square. Lu stated in an interview with Xiu Lu of the Epoch Times, ‚ÄúOn May 22, as the three of us sat on the stairs in front of the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square we decided to throw ink and eggs at the official portrait of Mao. Our intent was to demonstrate our complete denial of the authority of the CCP at its root ‚Äî Mao.\\" May 23, the three friends entered Tiananmen Square and hurled the eggs filled with ink at the great portrait of Mao. Shortly after they had thrown the eggs, students and workers quickly caught the three men and handed them over to the police. They were instantly arrested and taken to a Beijing jail for counterrevolutionary sabotage.Mickleburgh, Rod. \\"Canadians win freedom for Chinese dissident.\\" The Globe and Mail, April 12, 2006, http://www.proquest.com.

Lu Decheng was sentenced to 16 years, Yu Dongyue 20 years and Yu Zhijian life in prison. The three men were kept in the same prison, No.2 Prison in Hunan province. In 1990, the three men were separated. The authorities did not feel that they should be held in the same prison and continue to be in contact.Richards, Gwendolyn . \\"Calgary man is Tiananmen Square \`hero'.\\" June 4, 2009.http://64tianwang.com/bencandy.php?fid=13&id;=4505 On top of the hard physical labour they were expected to do as prisoners, Lu was also tortured psychologically because of his status as a political prisoner. Yu Dongyue was also tortured so badly that he has been reduced to insanity. In July, 1995, Qiuping came to the prison and asked Lu for a divorce. Lu Decheng was released from prison after serving 9 years, in 1998. Life after prison After his release in 1998, Lu remarried and started a new family. He tried to find work, but the Chinese authorities continued to hound him, making it an impossible task. In 2004, Lu secretly traveled to Thailand in order to fly to Canada. In August 2004 he left Liuyang and trekked over the mountains and through the jungle until he reached Burma. Lu was not allowed to leave China and was not given exit visa by the government, so he had to travel in secret. From Burma he was able to get to Bangkok, though it took him over two months. When he arrived in Bangkok, he campaigned for Yu Dongyue‚Äôs release.\\"Lu Decheng's claim.\\" The Globe and Mail, March 21, 2006, http://www.proquest.com. The Thai officials arrested Lu in December, 2004, at the insistence of the Chinese government, who wanted to have Lu extradited and returned to China immediately. Lu spent over a year in Thai prison. Thai authorities release Lu in 2006 and he arrived in Vancouver 11 April 2006, with the help of a private group of people working with the Canadian government sponsoring him as a refugee under a United Nations High Commissioners resettlement program.

It is the only remaining station in Reichenbach, which once had three stations, and is located on the Saxon-Franconian trunk line between Nuremberg and Dresden. It is also the last major station before the junction with the main line to Leipzig from the direction of Nuremberg and Plauen. Together with Plauen station, it used to be one of two DB Fernverkehr stations in Vogtland. Regional services stopping at the station are operated by DB Regio Regional- Express services and Vogtlandbahn. Regional and city buses also stop at the station. The station is located in the transport district of the Verkehrsverbund Vogtland (\\"Vogtland transport association\\", VVV). History  The first station in Reichenbach was built in 1845. The former station building is situated on a disused railway line about 300 metres to the west of the current station (halfway to the now abandoned train depot). The current station was built in about 1848 when the Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company extended its line from Leipzig, which had previously terminated in Reichenbach, to Plauen and Hof, following the completion of the G√∂ltzsch Viaduct (the largest brick bridge in the world) and the Elster Viaduct. Originally the current Reichenbach station was identical with the \\"Upper station\\" in Plauen, which was destroyed in the Second World War and then rebuilt to a different plan. Both stations were ‚Äúisland stations‚Äù (Inselbahnh√∂fe), with the main station building built between the tracks, with three tracks on each side of the island. The island platforms (tracks 1/2 and 5/6) were accessed by subways from the main building, along with tracks 3 and 4. A third pedestrian underpass linked the street of Am Bahnhof (\\"at station\\") and Fedor-Flinzer-Stra√üe (street), running under railway tracks 1-3 to the large waiting hall in the main station building. For vehicles and pedestrians from the city centre there was a large tunnel (also running under tracks 1 to 3) carrying Bahnhofstra√üe (\\"station street\\") to Bahnhofsvorplatz (\\"station square\\"), which was between the tracks. Branch lines  In 1895, a secondary line was opened from Reichenbach to G√∂ltzsch Viaduct and a connecting line was opened to Lengenfeld in 1905. This line started at an additional platform at Reichenbach station (track 7), located at the end of platform track 4. The new line had two other stations in Reichenbach: Oberreichenbach (\\"upper Reichenbach\\")‚Äîlater Reichenbach Ost (east)‚Äîand Reichenbach (Vogtland) Unterer Bahnhof (\\"Lower station\\"), which connected with passenger services on the narrow gauge Rollbock Railway to Upper Heindorf from 1902 to 1957. At the same time as the lower station was opened, the name of the main Reichenbach station was changed to Reichenbach (Vogtland) Oberer Bahnhof. Demolition and reconstruction (since 1963)  Since the closure in 1957 of the branch lines starting in Reichenbach, the upper station has been the only station left in Reichenbach for passenger traffic, but it has not been renamed. With the end of branch lines, track 7 (the platform for the secondary line) was demolished, leaving only the original six tracks. From 1963 to 2001 the station hardly changed. In 2001, the station (but not the station building) was completely rebuilt. First a new island platform (platform tracks 7 and 8) was built in the same style as the original platforms next to platform 6. The existing underpass to platform 5/6 was extended to the new platform. The platforms of tracks 4 to 6 were completely renovated and provided with new information displays, seating and lifts. In addition, two new sidings and bypass for freight traffic were built. Then tracks 1 and 2 and the associated underpasses and pedestrian and road tunnels were demolished. On the cleared space a link was built in 2006 between Fedor- Flinzer Stra√üe and Bahnhofstra√üe, including a roundabout and the station forecourt was provided with parking and redesigned taxi stands. A new bus station was built next to the station. The remaining platform tracks were renumbered 1 to 5.

His estates were forfeited. Life George Clerk was born in Edinburgh on 31 October 1715, the second son of Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet of Penicuik, and Janet Inglis, daughter of Sir John Inglis, 2nd Baronet of Cramond. He was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Leyden. From his father he received in patrimony the lands of Drumcrieff in Annandale, and by marriage with his cousin Dorothea Clerk-Maxwell, daughter of his uncle William by Agnes Maxwell, heiress of Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, he obtained the lands of Middlebie, adopting thereupon his wife's name, Clerk Maxwell. He was a commissioner of the customs, king's remembrancer in the exchequer, and one of the trustees for improving fisheries and manufactures in Scotland. Both in his private and public capacity he promoted the agricultural and commercial interests of the country. At Dumfries he erected at considerable expense a linen manufactory, and he set on foot a variety of projects for the mining of lead and copper in the county. In 1755 he addressed two letters to the trustees for the improvement of the fisheries and manufactures of Scotland, regarding the common mode of treating wool, which were published by direction of the board in 1756. He was also the author of a paper on shallow ploughing, read before the members of the Philosophical Society, and published in the third volume of their essays. He was a remarkably clever draughtsman, and etched a variety of views of Scotland. On the death of his elder brother in 1782, he succeeded to the baronetcy and estates of Penicuik. In 1783 he was one of the joint founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died 29 January 1784. George's father, his brother John and himself were friends of James Hutton.

Clater wrote 'Every Man his own Cattle Doctor' (1810) and 'Every Man his own Farrier.' In the preface to the last-named work, which was published at Newark-on-Trent in 1783, when the writer was twenty-six, Clater describes himself as 'farrier, late of Newark,' and states that he served a regular apprenticeship and one year as journeyman to 'the late W. Frost, farrier, of Nottingham, and being his nephew, succeeded to all the secrets of his profession.' The work was published at the desire of the numerous gentlemen and farmers who were Clater's employers, and appears to have roused the hostility of farriers generally. The writer insists chiefly on careful diagnosis of individual cases, and the use of pure drugs. Clater afterwards resided for many years at East Retford, where he practised as a chemist and druggist, as well as a cattle doctor, and, according to the inscription on a small memorial tablet set up in the methodist chapel in Newgate Street in that town, was much respected, and there died, on 29 May 1823, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. The publication of his works marked a stage in veterinary progress, and their lasting popularity may be judged from the fact that, at the hands of the writer's son, John Clater, and subsequent editors, the former went through over twelve, and the latter over thirty editions.

Clater was the third son of Francis Clater, farrier, of East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and Anne his wife. Thomas Clater was baptised on 9 June 1789 at East Retford. He first exhibited in London in 1819 at the British Institution, sending two pictures, ‚ÄòChildren at a Spring‚Äô and ‚ÄòPuff and Dart, or the Last Shilling‚Äîa Provincial Game,‚Äô and at the Royal Academy, to which he sent ‚ÄòThe Game at Put, or the Cheat detected.‚Äô In 1820 he exhibited at the Royal Academy a portrait of his brother John Clater, and in 1823 portraits of Mr. C. Warren and of his father Francis Clater; the latter picture was subsequently engraved by Lupton. Clater continued to send many pictures to the Royal Academy, British Institution. Suffolk Street Gallery, and all the principal exhibitions in the country every year up to 1863. In 1843 he was elected a fellow of the Society of British Artists. They were usually of a quietly humorous character, scenes from domestic and provincial life, and executed in a manner based on that of the Dutch genre painters.

They only have a thin layer of peat of between 30 and 100 centimetres thick. The term misse is local to the Northern Black Forest and also surfaces as Mi√ü, M√ºsse or M√º√ü. These names probably derive from the German Moos (\\"moss\\") because peat mosses (Sphagnum) play a key role in their development. Due to the poor tree growth associated with them, however, it could also stand for mies (\\"bad\\"). Missen are most common on plateaus where the precipitation is heavy and the drainage is poor. But event silted-up tarns and shallow tarn soils may have missen on their hillsides (Hillside or swamp bogs). Floristically and depending on location, missen may transition into raised bogs, whereby ombrotrophes, i.e. areas exclusively fed by rainwater, (initially) are formed, albeit they only have a small surface area.  Formation  Missen are formed on base-poor soils that have a tendency to become waterlogged. In addition, other climatic factors such as high levels of precipitation, a relatively short vegetation period and a cool, moist, montane climate are basic pre-requisites. Human exploitation may also favour the emergence of missen. The introduction of stall feeding in the 19th century forced forest farmers to use the ground vegetation as bedding. On poor bunter sandstone soils raw humus is laid down as a result of the constant removal of nutrients. The blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), an indicator of acidicism, becomes the dominant type of dwarf shrub. Moor grass (Molinia caerulea, M. arundinacea) colonises the shore areas in dense tussocks.

She is known as Devayanai, Deivanai or Deivayanai. in south-Indian texts. Her name is also spelled as Teyvanai or Tevayanai (). Devasena is often described as the daughter of Indra, the king of the gods (devas). She is betrothed to Kartikeya by Indra, when he becomes the commander-in-chief of the gods. In south-Indian accounts, Devasena is generally depicted as an antithesis of Valli, her co- wife; together they complete the god. Devasena is generally depicted with Kartikeya and often is also accompanied by Valli. Devasena does not enjoy independent worship, but is worshipped as Kartikeya's consort in most of his temples. She plays a greater role in the Tirupparankunram Murugan Temple, believed to be the site of her marriage. Etymology The Sanskrit name of the goddess Devasena means \\"army of the gods\\" and thus, her husband is known as Devasenapati (\\"Lord of Devasena\\").Clothey p. 214 The epithet Devasenapati is a pun which also conveys his role as commander-in-chief of the gods. She is called Deivanai or Deivayanai (Tamil, literally meaning \\"celestial elephant\\"), as she was raised by Indra's divine elephant Airavata. Legends and textual references In North India, Kartikeya is generally considered as celibate and unmarried. Sanskrit scriptures generally regard only Devasena as the consort of Kartikeya, while in South India, he has two consorts, Devayanai (Devasena) and Valli. Devasena is described as daughter of the king of the gods, Indra and his wife Shachi or at least the adopted daughter of Indra. Indra (center) betroths Devasena (left) to Kartikeya. The third book of Mahabharata narrates the tale of the birth of Kartikeya which mentions Devasena. Devasena and Daityasena (literally \\"army of demons\\") are the daughters of Prajapati Daksha. Once, while the sisters are enjoying leisure at the banks of Lake Manasa, the asura (demon) Keshi abducts them so that he could marry them. While Devasena refuses, Daityasena consents. Meanwhile, the gods are defeated in a battle by the demons. Indra, who is searching for an ideal Devasenapati (commander of the army of the gods), reaches the place where Devasena is held captive. On her request, Indra defeats the demon and rescues her. Devasena asks Indra to find her a husband (pati) who can protect her and defeat the gods, the demons and the yakshas. Indra discusses the matter with the god Brahma and they agree that a son born of Agni would be suitable for being the Devasenapati, the husband of Devasena and the commander-in-chief of the gods. Accordingly, Agni is forced to have a son, who becomes Kartikeya. After many exploits which prove his supremacy over the gods, Kartikeya is made the general of the army of the gods and is married to Devasena by Indra. At this point in the text, Agni is identified with Shiva, who is proclaimed as the father of Kartikeya. Ultimately, with the aid of Devasena and Kartikeya, the gods defeat the demons.Clothey pp. 51‚Äì53 In this narrative, Devasena is identified with many other goddesses like Shashthi, Shri-Lakshmi, Kuhu-Sinivali and others. The south-Indian manuscripts of the Sanskrit scripture Skanda Purana mentions Devasena and Valli as daughters of the god Vishnu in a previous life. Thus, Kartikeya is regarded as the son-in-law of Vishnu as their husband. An interpolation in the southern recensions of the scripture as well as the Kanda Purana (the Tamil version of the Sanskrit Skanda Purana) narrate the story of the marriage of the two maidens to Kartikeya. The two maidens are fated to be married to the god. The elder sister Devasena is born as Amritavalli. She follows the path of traditional Hindu rituals and practices to gain her husband. Appeased by her penance, Indra adopts her as his daughter and marries her to Kartikeya in an arranged marriage, following custom, after Kartikeya triumphs over the demons. The Kanda Purana describes Devayanai (Devasena) as the daughter of Indra, without any mention of adoption. The couple is described as taking their abode in the hills of Thiruttani, where one of Murugan's chief temples, Thiruthani Murugan Temple, stands. Another version describes the couple as residing in heaven, the abode of the gods. Meanwhile, Valli is born as Sundaravalli. She is adopted by a tribal chieftain and grows up as a huntress. Murugan wins Valli's hand and takes her to Thiruttani. The god is worshipped at the Thiruthani temple, flanked by Devasena on his left and Valli on his right. In the end, the trio settles in the abode of the gods and lives in harmony thereafter.Clothey pp. 83‚Äì84Handelman pp. 44‚Äì45 An alternate ending found in Sri Lankan lore describes Murugan as staying on in the forest with Valli after their wedding at Kataragama, where his temple stands. Devayanai tries in vain to compel the god to return to the abode of the gods, but finally joins Kartikeya and Valli to reside in Kataragama.Handelman p. 55 Unlike the Skanda Purana which talks about harmony between Devasena and Valli, the Paripatal ‚Äì part of Tamil Sangam literature ‚Äì speaks about conflict, resulting in a battle between Devayanai's royal soldiers and Valli's hunter clan, which the latter win. Folk ecal (a folk poem, presented as a dialogue of two persons) tradition also talks about the mistrust and quarrel between the co-wives. In one version - where Devayanai is the elder sister of Valli, Valli tries to woo Murugan, before Devayanai's marriage. As per tradition, the elder sister has to be married off first. Infuriated, Devayanai curses Valli to be born in the forest in her next life, and the curse is then fulfilled when Valli is born as a huntress.Handelman p. 56 In the Jayantipura Mahatmya, the details of which correspond to most of those found in the Skanda Purana tale, Devasena and Valli are married to Kartikeya from primal times. However, in this version, the god condemns Valli to be born on earth as punishment for mocking her sister Devayanai.Clothey p. 225 The Thirumurugatrupadai from Sangam literature describes Murugan being accompanied by his chaste wife Devayanai and honoured by a procession of gods and rishis (sages).Clothey pp. 64‚Äì5 Iconography Lord Murugan with Deivaanai (on right of image) and Valli (on left of image). Deivanai is generally depicted with her husband, particularly in an iconographic form called Senapati. She sits on the left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left- hand side.Clothey p. 79 Her complexion is yellow; she is often depicted adorned with a crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has two arms. She holds a lotus in her left arm, while her right hand hangs down. Symbolism The presence of the two consorts is said to denote the dual nature of Murugan, as the god of heaven and earth. Devasena, the celestial wife, is married in a traditional arranged marriage while the earthy Valli is won by Murugan, resulting in a love marriage. The consorts also represent a syncretism between Shaiva and Vaishnava sects, dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu respectively. The son of Shiva, Kartikeya, becomes the son-in-law of Vishnu, due to the marriages. Both the consorts are identified with the soul (Atman), while their husband (pati, Lord) represents God. The marriage of Devasena conveys Vaishnava ideals, where the soul (Devasena) remains detached from God; she has her own relative autonomy and earns the love of the god by her own merit. In contrast, the Shaiva philosophy says that God is attached to the soul (Valli) and hence he woos her. The Paripatal contains a Tamil panegyric dedicated to Murugan. It praises him as the god who is allowed to have two wives, Devasena ‚Äì the daughter of Indra and Valli, a hunter princess. Murugan is described to equally spend his time on earth and in heaven. This is also conveyed by his wives, Devasena is a daughter of the heavens, while Valli is an earthly maiden. Another interpretation regards the trio as the three eyes of Shiva. Devasena and Valli are representations of kriya shakti (the power of action) and Iccha-shakti (will-power) respectively; while their Lord Kartikeya is the third eye, the symbol of the transcendental jnana-shakti (the power of knowledge).Clothey pp. 84‚Äì85Handelman p. 47 In Tamil literature, two kinds of love are mentioned: karpu (\\"chastity\\"), love bound in the traditional marriage, represented by Devasena and kalavu, love before marriage, conveyed by Valli.Clothey p. 142Handelman p. 46 Devasena represents \\"the conventional, control, ritualized approach to worship\\" God, while Valli is worship through \\"ecstasy and self- abandonment\\". Devasena is the epitome of chastity and purity. In trinity of gunas, she is the middle guna ‚Äì Rajas, symbolizing \\"rulership, fixity, and stability\\". Kartikeya is the most superior Sattva (pure), while Valli is the inferior tamas (dark).Handelman p. 52 As per another interpretation, Devasena is an embodiment of how virtuous people should live considering her steadfast and uncompromising fight against evil.Bhanu p. 5 Worship Tirupparankunram Murugan Temple in Tirupparankunram near Madurai is dedicated to Murugan and Devayanai. It is believed that she was married to the god at this location. A festival icon depicts the god seated close to his divine consort.Clothey pp. 76, 125‚Äì6 The Latankovil temple at Yanaimalai is one of the earliest temples dedicated to the divine couple.Clothey p. 76 Devasena and Valli, the consorts of Murugan, do not have independent temples dedicated to them. Their images are installed in shrines of Murugan, where they flank their Lord on either side. They are worshipped with Murugan and receive offerings as part of his worship (see Puja (Hinduism)). A fast is observed on Tuesdays to placate the consort goddesses. Festival icons of Murugan used during temple festival processions generally depict him with his consorts.

Founded in the 8th century, its collegiate church dedicated to Saint Candidus, rebuilt in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries, is considered the most important Romanesque building in Tyrol and the Eastern Alps.Guide di Touring Club Italiano: Piccole citt√†, borghi e villaggi. Milan 2006 It is home to a 13th- century sculpture and a fresco cycle from the same age in the dome. History The original nucleus of the complex was established in 769, when Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria gave to Abbot Atto of Scharnitz extended estates lands in the Puster Valley stretching from the Gsieser Bach at current Welsberg eastwards down the Drava to Anras, called India, provided that a Benedictine convent would be founded here to convert the pagan Slavs who had settled in the principality of Carantania. When Atto became Bishop of Freising in 783, he added Innichen to his episcopal territories. Of the original abbey construction, however, no certain traces have been found. When the monastery was turned into a college of canons, the church was entirely rebuilt from about 1140; of this edifice today the external walls, the piers, the apses and the crypt remain. A second reconstruction was carried out from around 1240, when the vaults of the crypt and the nave, the transept and the dome at the crossing were added, including the frescoes with the History of Creation. Once finished, the new church in 1284 was consecrated to Sts. Candidus and Corbinian, patron saint of the Diocese of Freising, to which the abbey still belonged at the time. The large bell tower was built later, from 1323 to 1326. The edifice did not undergo any substantial modification. In 1969 a restoration was held, removing the few minor additions it had received during the centuries (especially in Baroque times), in particular re-discovering the crypt's frescoes, which had been covered with a layer of plaster. Description Rear view Exterior The church has a simple fa√ßade, in crude stone blocks. Over the central portal are two small mullioned windows, surmounted by a small frame dividing the fa√ßade in two and a rose window. On the left is the massive bell tower, also in stone, with a square plane: each of the sides has a row of thin mullioned windows, except for the top floors, which have a larger single- and double- mullioned windows. The top is pyramidal in shape. The rear area is more complex. The crossing is the background of a descending sequence of blocks, started by the presbytery, and followed by the nave's apse, the roofs of the aisles' apses and finally the apses themselves. Another block on the left is the sacristy. The apses' exterior is decorated by Lombard bands. On the right side are a pilaster- shaped tabernacle, frescoed in the 15th century, and the Museum of the Collegiate. Interior Interior The interior has a nave and two aisles, the latter smaller in height, with a transept, a presbytery and three aisles. At the crossing is a crypt. This houses a 13th-century wooden sculpture portraying on the two patron saints of the church. The dome is frescoed with the Stories of Creation, painted in the 13th century.

It is named after the exceptionally fast southward current that passes here, part of the Mozambique Current, with a tendency to form eddies at this cape.

Sailing in the other direction was even more dangerous, as the velocity of the current at the cape could easily throw a ship headlong into the numerous shoals and protruding rocks that characterize this stretch of coast. It is estimated that 30% of the ships lost in the yearly Portuguese India Armadas in the 16th and 17th centuries capsized around Cape Correntes, more than any other location.Guinote (1999). As a result, for much of the 16th century, captains returning from India to Portugal with heavy-laden (and thus less- maneouverable) ships were forbidden from sailing into the Mozambique Channel and were required to chart a course via the 'outer route', that is, east of Madagascar island, through the Mascarenes, coming back under the island, thereby avoiding the treacherous and fast waters of Cape Correntes. The peculiar terrors of Cape Correntes were alleviated with the development of reliable instruments to measure longitude, allowing ships to avoid sailing near the headland, and chart a more comfortable course through the middle of the Mozambique Channel.

Lips Tullian (or Lips Tullian, nejob√°vanƒõj≈°√≠ n√°ƒçeln√≠k lupiƒç≈Ø) (in English: Lips Tullian, the Most Redoubtable Leader of Bandits) is a comic series written by Jaroslav Weigel and drawn by K√°ja Saudek in 1972. It is set in the 17th century and features an eponymous highwayman. The series was published by the popular Czechoslovak weekly magazine Mlad√Ω svƒõt. The plot is based on romantic adventure stories by Kvidon of Felses (in Czech: Kvidon z Fels≈Ø), published in the late 19th century. The comic won wide acclaim from the readership in Czechoslovakia. In a 1973 letter to his friend Pavel Nosek, Saudek notes that the circulation of the magazine increased by 105,000 during the period of publishing of Lips Tullian.Prok≈Øpek (2010), p. 124 The series was only published for one year; it was banned by communist censorship in December 1972. In 2010, thirty-eight years after its creation, the complete series was published as a book. In a poll organized in 2009, the Czech comics server Komiksarium selected Lips Tullian as the third most significant Czech comic in the history of the genre.  Background  Saudek won his first recognition in 1966, as the creator of special effects and illustrations for the film Kdo chce zab√≠t Jessii? (Who Wants to Kill Jessie?). However, the promising start of his career was complicated by the events of the Prague Spring and subsequent \\"normalization\\" of Czechoslovak society. The official cultural apparatus considered Saudek's style too \\"American\\", and some of his critics labelled his work as an example of bourgeois kitsch. \\"V komunistick√©m ƒåeskoslovensku se Saudek c√≠til jako cizinec ve vlastn√≠ zemi, jeho tvorba byla p≈ô√≠li≈° ‚Äûamerick√°‚Äú, jej√≠ kritikov√© ji oznaƒçovali za bur≈æoazn√≠ k√Ωƒç.\\" His early mature works were banned and published only after the fall of the communist regime.Diesing (2009), p. 269 In the late 1960s, Saudek met and befriended the journalist Rudolf K≈ôes≈•an, an editor in Mlad√Ω svƒõt. K≈ôes≈•an enabled him to publish a part of his album Muriel a andƒõl√© (Muriel and Angels) in the magazine.Prok≈Øpek (2010), p. 123 In 1971, Saudek became a regular contributor to Mlad√Ω svƒõt. However, the first significant opportunity to work for the magazine only came a year later.Diesing (2009), p. 298 At the beginning of 1972, Saudek began collaborating on a new series with Jaroslav Weigel, a member of the J√°ra Cimrman Theatre. The series, titled Lips Tullian, nejob√°vanƒõj≈°√≠ n√°ƒçeln√≠k lupiƒç≈Ø, was published weekly as a part of the magazine. During the period of \\"normalization\\" in Czechoslovakia, comics were considered potentially damaging to young people. The creators and the editorial board attempted to select a non-controversial topic in order to \\"keep the balance between the attractiveness of the magazine and the political pressure\\". For that purpose, Weigel paraphrased the stories from the popular novelettes depicting the adventures of the highwayman Filip of Mengenstein, alias Lips Tullian. According to the Czech comics expert Tom√°≈° Prok≈Øpek, the series achieved \\"phenomenal success\\" and a long queues of impatient readers crowded in front of newsstands each Wednesday (the day of publishing of Mlad√Ω svƒõt). However, the success of the comics attracted the attention not only of readers, but also of the communist censors and the official media. The first problems came in the summer of 1972. In reaction, the editorial board of the magazine attempted to protect the series by publishing an interview with Saudek in which he resolutely repudiated any association with Western comics. Paradoxically, the interview provoked another seditious campaign against the series. Despite the protests of readers and fans, Lips Tullian had to vanish from the pages of Mlad√Ω svƒõt in December, 1972. In 1973, the editorial board of Mlad√Ω svƒõt made a covert attempt to resurrect the series. The hero was renamed ƒåern√Ω Filip (Black Filip) and the plot was moved to another period of Czech history. However, the intention was disclosed and the renewed series was banned again without an explanation. Only six episodes were published.Prok≈Øpek (2010), p. 127 Lips Tullian later appeared in other of Saudek's works, most notably in the albums St≈ô√≠brn√Ω poklad (Silver Treasure, 1982) and Konec Sahrbergovy bandy (The End of the Sahrberg Bunch, 1985). (\\"Saudek si ho nakonec tak obl√≠bil, ≈æe kdy≈æ byl komiks komunisty zak√°z√°n, potaj√≠ ho umis≈•oval do dal≈°√≠ch seri√°l≈Ø i ilustrac√≠.\\") The disfavour of the censors didn't prevent the continuing popularity of the series in Czechoslovakia; the original pages of the series are a valuable collector's artifact. The comics series Lips Tullian is considered an example of creative freedom in communist Czechoslovakia.  Style  Working on Lips Tullian was an unusual task for Saudek. Up to that time, he had mainly depicted the contemporary world or visions of the future. The historical theme of the series required a different approach and technique. Another problem was the lack of space intended for a large amount of plot and text in each episode. Gradually, he managed to adapt the format to his own style. Saudek's style changed significantly from the previous period (Muriel albums), however, he has retained one of the most characteristic elements of his style: the need to paraphrase and cite his previous works in a new and surprising associations. Additionally, the series utilizes \\"innumerable\\" double entendres, jokes and hidden meanings (in the text as well as in the illustrations) in each episode. Lips Tullian, a highwayman from the 17th century, bears closer resemblance to modern superheroes than to a historical character. As a defender of the poor and tormented, he doesn't hesitate to help anywhere; however, his efforts focus mainly on rescuing beautiful women from the hands of evil villains. Eroticism and reflection of female beauty is another important element, characteristic throughout the whole of Saudek's oeuvre. The plot is na√Øve (based on kitschy 19th-century novels) and the main theme of the series is, in Saudek's words: \\"revenge and love in many variations, the topic still living\\".

The MIRA Procedure is a result of combining efforts from different medical fields developed in the University of Chicago in 1992. It basically consists in medically grafting live rejuvenated tissue in the form of autologous adipose adult stem cells to a damaged organ in order to restore it and improve its function. This method is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). History The MIRA Procedure originated as a result of combining medical innovations and was developed as a multidisciplinary technique for applications in a wide range of medical fields. In other words, this procedure was not developed for a specific application, it is a compilation from data and experience retrieved through years of research as well as practice that have been put together to create a new alternative to treat many diseases and other applications. In 1989 Dr. Christoph Broelsch performed the first successful living donor liver transplantation in the University of Chicago. Nearly two years old Alyssa Smith was the first to receive part of a living‚Äôs person liver donated in this case by her mother. The remarkable results improved current prognosis on patients who required a liver transplant but even then there were far from meeting the demand and many hundreds to this date die waiting for a donor. This procedure has also sparked some controversial and legal issues for enticing organ trafficking and its practice is currently restricted in some countries. In 1992, at the University of Chicago Dr. Fushih Pan is amongst the first to attempt repairing damaged organ tissue by tissue grafting, but with little success due to technological limitations for keeping the grafted tissue live and functional. Dr. Fushih Pan later becomes much more involved in the steps that followed in order to develop the MIRA procedure. In 1995, the University of Pennsylvania caught the first glimpse of regenerative medicine after successfully regenerating cranial bone.Properties of Coralline Hydroxyapatitie and Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene Membrane in the Immature Craniofacial Skeleton, B. Reedy, F. Pan, W. Kim, F. Gannon, A. Krasinskas, and S. Bartlett, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 103: 20 (1999) During the same year these results led to determination pressure of adequate tissue growth in cases with anophthalmia.The Effect of Intraorbital Pressure on Orbital Growth in the Anophthalmic Piglet, B. Reedy, F. Pan, W. Kim, and S. Bartlett, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 104: 713 (1999) In 1998 Dr. J. Peter Rubin from the University of Pittsburgh developed a basic science research program in the biology of adipose derived stem cells and serves as co-director of the Adipose Stem Cell Center at the University of Pittsburgh. More recently he has determined the safety on fat derived stem cells for breast reconstruction after mastectomy as long as there is no evidence of cancer. In the year 2002 the UCLA under direction of Dr. Marc H. Hedrick M.D. started research on possible applications of Adult stem cells generating positive results. Opting for research on Adult stem cells rather than Embryonic stem cells resulted amidst the stem cell controversy that involve diverse ethical concerns and religious groups, most prominently the Catholic Church. Embryonic stem cells till this day are frowned upon many for the implication of the destruction of human embryos, yet the progress of adult stem cells has produced more promising results. After the introduction of the subject of stem cells into the mainstream it was of utmost importance to keep the public aware of the difference of Embryonic Stem Cells and Adult stem cells. To help clarify the matter, in 2006 the Pope of the Catholic Church openly stated the encouragement on research on Adult stem cells.http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/bioethic/bishopsESCRstmt.pdf In 2008, after years of research the University of Pittsburgh and the UCLA come together sharing their progress in order to the develop a viable stem cell treatment. Dr. Kotaro Yoshimura was one of the first to implement an alternative to breast augmentation by safely grafting fat stem cells in 2006.http://www.cosmetic- medicine.jp/english/new/Stem%20Cells%20and%20Breast%20Surgery.pdf In 2009 at the University of Tokyo he was able to determine the adequate pressure for grafting ADSC more effectively, paving the road to diverse applications for the future. After this breakthrough the engraftment rate was improved even further thanks to the development of a nanoscale shielding using biomaterials approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With this, Dr. Fushih Pan was able to successfully develop a safe and reliable medical procedure now known as the MIRA Procedure. The concept of the MIRA procedure can be considered more off as a minimally invasive tissue graft which function restoring capabilities work under the principles of Adult stem cells. The treatments potential use lies in improving patients with chronic diseases such as heart and liver failure as well as those with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer and multiple sclerosis. In 2010, the MIRA procedure spawned highly efficient alternatives to some operations in the field of cosmetics. The MIRA Lift is now an alternative for a face lift that rejuvenates the face's skin cells in order to produce more collagen for better and more natural results. Currently an alternative for breast augmentation surgery is also being implemented. All this is done in a minimally invasive way that involves almost no downtime to the patient. Clinical procedure (simplified) The MIRA procedure consists of the following steps: #Harvest the resting progenitor cells- Bone marrow and/or adipose tissue are collected through liposuction by a reconstructive surgeon which are then harvested by a MIRA specialist. #Activate them intro-operatively- The cells capable of restoration are usually in a resting state. Through a proprietary method, these cells are awakened and activated into their growth stage. This allows the cells to replicate themselves and eventually increase the number of the arm force. #Package the activated cells with a protective shield- Activated progenitor cells are very fragile after being harvested and manipulated, making their engraftment rate less than 10%. Therefore, experts on the field developed a porous nanoscale shielding using biomaterials that are FDA approved that drastically increases engraftment rate and improve the results of organ function. #Delivery to the damaged tissue- Lastly, all of the packages are delivered to the nearest location to the injured site of the organ using a high-resolution angiogram operated by a high-skilled reconstructive surgeon for approaching, identifying, and isolating the feeder arterioles. This step is further assisted by an interventional radiologist for a more precise application. * The MIRA Lift, alternative to a facelift, is combined with photorejuvenation for optimal results. The treatment of choice typically being Thermage. Applications  The MIRA Procedure has numerous applications for different fields and many more are still in development: Clinical applications * Ischemic Incidence :* Heart disease, kidney disease, brain damage, muscle damage * Fibrosis :* Liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis * Growth impairment :* Epiphyseal plate * Degeneration :* Neurological ::*Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, retina damage :* Integument ::* Osteoarthritis, certain types of skin diseases * Cancer :* Prostate cancer :* Pancreatic ductal carcinoma Cosmetic applications * Facial rejuvenation * Breast augmentation * Alopecia or hair loss Advantages  Medical field: * Unlike organ transplants, patients who opt for the MIRA Procedure do not rely on availability of a compatible donor for operation. * The procedure, as it names indicate, is minimally invasive therefore is the safest and most reliable alternative up to date. * There is minimal downtime after the procedure and the cost is much more affordable to the patients. * If necessary, the patient can decide to repeat the procedure for further improvement on his or her condition. * No risk of scarring. Cosmetic field: * More natural appearance after the procedure compared to surgical alternatives. * Removes uneven pigmentation and reduces the appearance of scars. * No risk of scarring. Limitations or complications  Patients who are not physically adequate to undergo a liposuction may not be subject for a MIRA procedure. A drawback for the breast augmentation surgery is that it only provides half the extra volume when compared to current implants. Future  Currently the MIRA Procedure is most well known as an alternative to cosmetic surgery but has proved to be successful in restoring health to patients with chronic heart disease and cirrhotic liver. Soon enough further research will be employed to develop an adequate treatment for certain types of cancer as well as neuro- degenerative diseases with more efficacy. The MIRA Procedure has proven to be a significant alternative to Embryonic Stem Cell treatments which still are under development. The procedure also has some advantages over Embryonic Stem Cell treatments due to its simplicity and therefore its financial cost.

Joan died on August 3, 1997, in a nursing home in Brewster, Massachusetts, three years after the death of her husband, Erik.\\"Joan Erikson, Life Cycles Theorist, Dies\\" in Harvard University Gazette, September 11, 1997. Online at http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1997/09.11/JoanEriksonLife.html. Mrs. Erikson's survivors included two sons, Kai of Hamden, Conn., and Jon of Port Angeles, Wash.; a daughter, Sue Bloland of Manhattan, and three grandchildren. Education and professional accomplishments Joan obtained an undergraduate degree from Barnard College and a master's from Columbia's Teachers College. She completed doctorate course work before moving to Europe to conduct research for a dance dissertation. She spent time observing dance schools and teaching dance to children in Austria and Germany. After meeting husband Erik Erikson, Joan stopped research for her dissertation and took a job at the progressive school in Vienna, where he was working. She believed that children should be taught based on their interests, and structured lessons accordingly. She taught English to many of the psychoanalysts at the school, including her husband. During their time spent at the University of California at Berkeley, the Eriksons created the eight cycles of psychosocial development and Joan began her interest in arts and crafts, crucial to her later work in art therapy. In 1951, Joan became the director of activities at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric treatment facility for children and adults in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She created the Theatre Program and the Montessori Nursery School there. Joan and Erik later returned to Harvard, where they taught classes together at the Joan and Erik Erikson Center. In the 1970s, Joan continued her art therapy work with adolescents at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco. She wrote several books, including The Universal Bead; Activity, Recovery, and Growth; and Wisdom and the Senses. Psychosocial development Joan Erikson was the main collaborator in developing husband Erik Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development. Her contribution to Erikson's theory of personality could have been neglected, but was nevertheless important: Erik admitted being unable to distinguish between his own contribution and his wife's.L'intelligence collective √† petite √©chelle Joan had a great influence on the development of the stages and on the inclusion of the eighth stage. The pair created the stages as they were experiencing them themselves, and after Erik's death in 1994, Joan added a ninth stage of very old age. This ninth stage is experienced in the eighties and nineties and is accompanied by a loss of physical health, friends, family members, and independence, in addition to isolation from society. Often during this time, individuals are put into retirement communities and assisted living facilities, which Joan believed was isolating them from society and from youth. She believed that \\"aging is a process of becoming free\\" and should not be treated as the opposite. As a result of these changes, individuals experience a loss of autonomy, self-esteem, and trust. Death is near and seen as an inevitable reality. Joan contributed to the writings on the first eight stages in the book, The Life Cycle Completed, and later added the final part on the ninth stage. Art therapy Joan Erikson believed that the arts possess their own healing properties and can be used as an exclusive form of therapy. She believed that people's artwork should not be psychoanalyzed or interpreted but should be used solely for healing through creative process. She came into conflict with Anna Freud over this issue while working at the school in Vienna, stating that children's creativity should not be psychoanalyzed. Joan created the Activities Program at the Austin Riggs Center in Massachusetts, which included a theatre program and other artistic outlets for patients. There, Joan worked with Ellen Kivnick to determine which types of creative practices led to improved psychological development in children and youth. They thought that using materials that can change shape could change the shape of a child's psyche. Joan encouraged artwork to be its own form of healing and to help patients learn new skills, instead of focusing on an absence of skills or abilities. Her relationship with patients was not one of a therapist to patient, but one between artists. Importance of play Joan Erikson was an advocate of play throughout life, which she defined as something to do \\"for your own pleasure because you find it amusing and enhancing somehow.\\" (page 2) Play can be anything from art, to sports, to conversation. Joan thought that adults spend too much time doing what they think they are supposed to be doing, and not taking time to do what they enjoy. She related play and humor, and believed that without a sense of humor, people lose freedom and the ability to play.

Playing career Randall was born in Barking, Essex and started his football career with Barking in the South Essex league. Starting for West Ham as an amateur and playing as an inside- forward he scored on his debut against Fulham on 27 April 1907. Fans took an immediate dislike to Randall because of his slow, methodical approach to the game and he was subjected to constant barracking and was nicknamed \\"Old-Mother Randall\\". On the verge of giving the game up he was persuaded to play at left half-back. He was such a success that he signed a full-time contract for 30 shillings a week and gained a reputation as one of the best defenders in the league. Going on to captain West Ham, Randall made 205 appearances in all competitions, scoring ten goals. He died in 1946.

His ≈ìuvre, particularly abundant, was published primarily by publisher Fleuve Noir. Bessi√®re was one of the leading authors of publisher Fleuve Noir's popular imprints Anticipation and Espionnage. Bessi√®re was born and died at B√©ziers - a year after his death, his home town announced that a street would be named in his honour. His first science fiction series (1951‚Äì54) featured the Conqu√©rants de l‚ÄôUnivers [Conquerors Of The Universe], a band of Earthmen led by professor B√©nac, the inventor of a spaceship called Meteor, who explore the Solar System. Bessi√®re's most popular series featured the adventures of American journalist Sydney Gordon, his ditzy wife Margaret, his catastrophe-prone son, Bud, and his scientist friends, Archie and Gloria Brent. The series began with serious tales of alien or extra-dimensional invasions, but eventually took a satirical turn. Bessi√®re's other popular series involved the hard-boiled adventures of Dan Seymour, a futuristic James Bond. Bessi√®re also made his mark on French science fiction through a number of non-connected novels that featured an original blend of horror and science fiction. Monstrous aliens threatening to take over mankind were featured in Escale chez les Vivants [Stop-Over Among The Living] (1960); evil entities from beyond human ken whose only weakness was sound invaded Earth in Les Ma√Ætres du Silence [The Masters Of Silence] (1965); Cette Lueur Qui Venait Des T√©n√®bres [That Light Which Came From The Dark] (1967) featured ghastly body-snatching parasites. The ultimately doomed reconquest of a post-cataclysmic Earth ruled by mutants and deadly lifeforms, was the subject of L√©gion Alpha (1961), Les Sept Anneaux de Rh√©a [The Seven Rings Of Rhea] (1962), in which Earth was described as seven concentric spheres with Hell at its core, and Les Jardins de l‚ÄôApocalypse [The Gardens Of The Apocalypse] (1963). Les Marteaux de Vulcain [The Hammers Of Vulcan] (1969) described a nightmarish planet where survival was all but impossible. Bessi√®re also wrote almost a hundred spy thrillers for the Espionnage imprint of Fleuve Noir under the pseudonym of F.-H. Ribes. Many of these starred a hero called G√©rard Lecomte.

He was the first NBI Director who rose from the ranks and rose to prominence at the NBI with the killing of Number 1 Most Wanted Man in Cavite, Leonardo Manecio aka Nardong Putik.  Early and career  Epimaco A. Velasco was born on December 12, 1935 in Tanza, Cavite. He finished his college at the Lyceum of the Philippines with a Bachelor of Laws (1960). A virtuous man dedicated to duty, Epimaco A. Velasco rose from the ranks to become one of the most admired directors of the National Bureau of Investigation. As an agent, he worked hard to solve many baffling cases, and as Bureau chief, he spearheaded the NBI in its quest to solve crimes and at the same time, to curb corruption among its ranks.  Capturing Nardong Putik  As a fugitive, Putik and his men continued to instill terror in Cavite. Among the cases he was involved in were the illegal cultivation of marijuana and money extortion activities. On February 10, 1971, the National Bureau of Investigation's Narcotics division surveyed a marijuana plantation in Imus, Cavite allegedly being protected by Putik. Two NBI Agents, Rogelio Domingo and Antonio Dayao were captured, tortured, and killed by Nardong Putik and his men. The incident sealed Putik's fate: Angered by the heinous crime, NBI Director Jolly Bugarin ordered all his Agents to capture dead or alive Nardo and all responsible for the death of Agents Domingo and Dayao. NBI Agent Epimaco \\"Eppy\\" Velasco was then installed as the new Chief of the NBI Narcotics Division. In a month's time, they were able to record the movements of Nardong Putik. Later, with enough data, they were able to track his full whereabouts confidently to enable them to launch the operation to capture him on October 10, 1971. The operation which was a joint NBI-PC-Imus police force was composed of some 20 men. Troopers from the 233rd PC Company were led by Capt. Manuel Bruan. At 5:00 in the morning, the light of the house of the mistress of Nardo went out. After a few minutes, Nardo drives his Chevrolet Impala car out to the main Manila-Cavite highway. For unknown reasons, or maybe Nardong Putik senses that he is being tailed by the Philippine Constabulary, he was able to escape the PC dragnet or checkpoint at Panamitan and Talon, Kawit, Cavite. However, Nardong Putik did not notice a Volkswagen Kombi tailing him in the highway at the same time. The Kombi contained NBI Agents Velasco, Nasol, Utico, Bautista and others. They chased Nardo's car, and at Noveleta, Cavite, they were able to overtake the Impala and was at the right side of the car. Velasco shouted \\"NARDO!\\". He sensed the danger and immediately reached for his .45 pistol. At that moment, the NBI Agents opened fire with their revolvers, carbines, and submachine guns, peppering the car, and causing Nardo's instant death. The car lurched to the side of the highway and stopped. The Agents then immediately jumped out of their vehicle and took cover. Some Agents were still firing their guns to make sure that Nardo will not retaliate. The Impala was later hauled into NBI Headquarters in Manila, with the dead Putik inside, in full view of Director Bugarin. The news became a flash report on local television, and a top newspaper story the next day. That mission cemented the fame of Agent Velasco, who later became NBI Director in the nineties.

This led to Mark becoming the co-designer and lead programmer for Flight Simulator 5.0 and designing the next generation flight technology standard.

After leaving the Bruce Artwick Organization in mid-1994, Mark and Brett founded Terminal Reality in October 1994, which required Mark leave Chicago where he had just finished up on his BSE and MS in electrical engineering from University of Illinois. The goal of Terminal Reality was to exploit texture mapped 3D game engines, with only $1,000, and working out of Brett Combs' home. During that time they were developing their first release, Terminal Velocity, and pulled together $120,000, received advances on the game and were basically able to avoid giving up ownership and primary decision rights to venture capitalists.

Hobman was one of the first homegrown stars to emerge from the Dominion Wrestling Union, and later Steve Rickard's All Star-Pro Wrestling, during the 1960s and 70s such as Tony Garea, Peter Maivia and The Sheepherders. Hobman twice won the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship from John Da Silva in 1960 and Steve Rickard in 1964 with a combined reign of nearly 6 years as champion. He and Rickard were also the first New Zealand Tag Team Champions. Prior to wrestling, Hobman had a successful athletic career playing rugby union at Rongotai College as a lock for Oriental Rongotai as well as a professional bodybuilder winning both the Mr. Australasia and Mr. New Zealand bodybuilding competitions in 1951. Hobman wrestled throughout the world during his career, most often in Asia and the South Pacific, but also had successful stints in the United States, most notably, against then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski in 1969. He was a successful promoter both prior to and during his later career, mainly working with Da Silva's Central Wrestling Association, and trained a number of wrestlers with Bruno Bekkar at the famed Koolmans Gym including Jock Ruddock and Butch Miller; two of his four children, Kurt and Linda Hobman, both became wrestlers as well with the elder Hobman staging the country's first officially sanctioned women's wrestling match between his daughter and Dutch female wrestler Monica Schumaker. He was among several New Zealand wrestling legends involved with Kiwi Pro Wrestling, one of the first wrestling promotions to open since the close of All Star-Pro Wrestling in 1992, and inducted into KPW's New Zealand Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006. He also attended live events made other public appearances until his sudden death two years later. In 2009, less than a year after his death, Hobman was ranked No. 5 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers by Fight Times Magazine. Career Early athletic and wrestling career A lifelong resident of Wellington, Allan Hobman was active in sports and athletics at a young age and began playing rugby union at Rongotai College as a lock for the Oriental Rongotai. Hobman weighed around 75 kg at this time and suffered constant injuries going up against 100 ‚Äì 130 kg sized opponents. He was soon introduced to weightlifting by a friend of his and, with nutrition and training regimen, gradually built up his body-weight to around 110 kg. In addition to improving his performance in rugby, Hobman also took up competitive bodybuilding and won both Mr. Australasia and Mr. New Zealand titles in 1951. Hobman spent much of his training at Koolman's Gym in Wellington where he also acted as a sparring partner to boxers and wrestlers from both New Zealand and overseas. It was during this time that Hobman became interested in a professional career as a wrestler, which he described as being claimed by its \\"call\\", and was wrestling for promoters throughout the country by the late-1950s. His debut match against Australian wrestler Rick Wallace ended with his losing two falls to one in the Wellington Town Hall. Wrestling for the New Zealand Wrestling Union, he soon became a familiar face to New Zealand wrestling fans wrestling in nearly every town and city \\"from Kaitaia to Invercargill\\". Hobman was soon invited to his first overseas tour for Greek promoter George Gardiner in Australia followed by visits to the United States, Canada and the South Pacific; specifically the Cook Islands, Tahiti, Fiji, Malaysia and Singapore. He was also brought over to Japan by Canadian and Commonwealth Champion, Gordon Nelson. Headliner during the 1960s and 70s Hobman was not only as a formidable journeyman wrestler but was also a top draw in his native country with bouts at the Wellington Town Hall against The Great Zorro, Tony \\"The Greek\\" Kontellis, John Da Silva, Pat O'Connor and Bruno Bekkar among others. One of his bouts against Becker in New Plymouth featured Lofty Blomfield as special guest referee. The proceeds from this match were donated to the Intellectually Handicapped Children's Society of which Blomfield was president. On 26 October 1960, Hobman defeated Da Silva for the vacant NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship. He won the title a second time from Steve Rickard in 1964 and held the belt for three years before losing it to Da Silva in Wellington on 7 September 1967; his combined title reigns totalled nearly six years. He and Rickard also became the first New Zealand Tag Team Champions. On 22 April 1969, Hobman wrestled Gene Kiniski for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Portland, Oregon. Much of his early career was spent in Rickard's NWA-affiliated All Star-Pro Wrestling, however, he also competed for smaller promotions such as South Pacific Wrestling Association and John Da Silva's Central Wrestling Association. Towards the end of the decade, he became a promoter for the CWA as well and trained a number of wrestlers out of Koolmans Gym with Bruno Bekkar and George Kidd. Among his students were Jock Ruddock and Butch Miller. Two of his four children, Kurt and Linda Hobman, also became professional wrestlers with Al Hobman promoting the first-ever women's wrestling match between his daughter, wrestling under the name Linda Tyson, and daughter Dutch professional wrestler Willen Schumaker, Monica Schumaker. Prior to 1973, female wrestling was illegal in New Zealand. He also made appearances on the popular television programme On the Mat.Afi, Siva. Reign of Fire: My Testimony from the Depths of Hell I Rose into the Majesty of God Almighty. Lulu.com (pg. 20) Retirement and later years Retiring by the 1980s, he remained absent from the industry for a quarter of a century until the opening of Kiwi Pro Wrestling in May 2006. It was one of the first promotions to open since the close of All Star-Pro Wrestling in 1992, one of three major companies to emerge during the 2000s, with Hobman as one of its strongest supporters. He appeared at many of its live events and was one of several New Zealand wrestling legends to be interviewed by KiwiProWrestling.co.nz. Hobman was also inducted into the New Zealand Wrestling Hall of Fame by former student and KPW Commissioner Butch Miller on 8 December 2006, along with Bob Crozier, Bruno Bekkar and Rip Morgan. He and other veterans also worked with KPW's younger wrestlers and remained closely associated with the promotion until dying unexpectedly at his home on 21 September 2008. A month after his death, Kurt Hobman, Steve Rickard, Bruno Bekkar, Juno Huia, Cowboy Billy Wright, Ricky Wallace and Bob Crozier appeared at the KPW supercard \\"Halloween Howl 3\\" held in Wellington High School to pay tribute to Hobman's death; the main event between KPW Champion H-Fame and Inferno was dedicated to Hobman's memory. In a statement from KPW's website, Off the Ropes play by play announcer Blair \\"The Flair\\" Rhodes wrote \\"Mr. Hobman was renowned not only as an exemplary sportsman in the ring, but was also remembered amongst all his peers as a gentleman outside the ring.

Mithun Chakraborty played a dual role in the film of both father & son. The film depicts the dynamics of upbringing of children by parents and how few wrong practices of parents can misguide their children. The movie was Hit at the box office. Plot Swarg Yahan Narak Yahan is the story of a dignified father (Mithun) and his conflict with his brat son (Mithun in a double role). Sumalatha and Shilpa Shirodkar play the leading ladies for the father and the son, respectively. The film resembles Ramesh Sippy's Shakti. The film starts by showing a hard working, principled police inspector, Vijay Kumar and his sad wife, Suman Kumar. They are childless couples and very sad. By their prayers, finally they get a son and they name him Suraj (as a signifier that he has brought new light in the lives of parents). Suraj is brought up in a typical middle-class family background whose father is an honest and respectable police officer. Vijay earns Rs 3000 per month and is very proud of himself because he is a dedicated government servant. He is not able to give a luxurious life to his son but believes that family love and bonding are more important. Everything seems going well when Suraj's classmates lure him into lavish lifestyle. Few of his classmates come from very rich and wealthy families. One of his best friends, who is son of Haveliram (Gulshan Grover) invites him to his birthday party. Haveliram is a smuggler and makes large money through illegal trades. He defends his son for all his mischiefs and never scolds him for any blunder he makes. Suraj breaks an expensive glass at the birthday party but Haveliram does not complain about anything, as he knows that money can bring new glass. Suraj comes late from the party for which his father scolds him but Suman defends her son by covering his mistakes. One day, Vijay is called by the principal of his school and shows him Suraj's attendance which is 20% and similar in last few months. He shows him an application which is signed by Vijay but he is ignorant of this letter or application. He comes to know that his son is not attending school properly and goes out of school with his friends. Suraj is caught outside a film theater after watching an adult film. He is a minor, around 12-13 years old. He beats him after bringing him home by taking him to a closed room. Mother still covers his acts and requests father to not be strict. She brings him food. But the son is extremely angry but can't do anything. Jagatram (Kader Khan), Suraj's maternal uncle, suggests the parents to send him to a boarding school to convert him into a good person. Film jumps into the future and Suraj is now an adult Mithun. He is in love with Radha (Shilpa Shirodkar) and plans to continue his love story after going back to Mumbai. Returning home, he bows in front of his mother and hugs her. Father looks extremely excited that now his son must have become a good son and would respect him. Suraj bows and bends to touch his feet but gets up with a lighter in his hand and with an angry expression admits his intentions towards his father. He lights up the lighter and moves away, leaving behind a grieving father. Jagatram is surprised that his suggestion has failed. He blames the mother for covering his mistakes and making the son filled with revenge against his father. Friendship between Suraj and Haveliram's son (Adi Irani) deepens and Haveliram promises to give him money for any of his business needs. Suraj does not want to live the life like his father who is now a police commissioner and is earning Rs 4000 per month. He is always happy with his salary. But Suraj wants to earn huge money with less effort and is attracted to Haveliram's lifestyle. Haveliram is a typical lala who is always carrying a small bag with thousands of money seen hanging through it. He is always ready to give his son as much money as he wants. Haveliram suggests Suraj to be less angry towards his father as his father is a police commissioner and would help him in future to make the way easier for his business. Cunningly, he is only trying to influence Suraj in order to help himself in his illegal trades. Suraj now turns into a good person, who agrees to work at Rs 4000 per month salary and marries Radha. Haveliram has a business of manufacturing helmets, but people are not buying them. He asks Suraj to convince his father to make a law which would make it mandatory for people to wear helmets. Suraj tells his father a lie that one of his good friends has died in a road accident because he was not wearing a helmet. He blames police and government for not showing concern towards strict helmet laws. He convinces the father to do the needful. And within a day Vijay makes it mandatory to wear helmets while driving a two wheeler. He appears in a press conference where journalists tell him that indirectly he has helped Haveliram who has sold all his helmets at triple rates in order to fulfill the immediate demand of the public due to stricter laws. He comes to know that this was done by manipulations of Suraj because there has been no such accident which Suraj had mentioned. Vijay gets it confirmed and also gets to know that Suraj is hiding illegal drugs at his home which are given to him by Haveliram. His perception towards Suraj again changes and his expectations shattered as he was believing that Suraj is becoming a good citizen. On finding drugs at his home in the flush tank of toilet pot, he asks his subordinates to arrest Suraj. Vijay now hunts for Haveliram to expose his smuggling business. He is gathering evidence against him and open his file for investigation. It is somehow stolen by Suraj by mimicking his father and he wants to destroy the file. But his father runs after him which brings them in a state of head-to-head fight. The fight turns bloody and Suraj is killed by his mother in the end because Suraj points the revolver against his father which the mother could not tolerate. Meanwhile, Radha gives birth to a son. Jagatram gives his final message to Suma that all this consequence could have been prevented if Suman had not defended her child's mistakes and misbehaviors blindly and had differentiated between disciplining acts and childish behaviors.

A Doctor of Laws and an advocate of the Court of Arches, he was also sent on missions to France for King Edward III. In April 1377, with the Caroline War going badly for the English, Edward sent Houghton to seek a peace settlement with Charles V of France, but in June Edward died, and Houghton was recalled. In 1380 he helped to negotiate the marriage of King Richard II to Anne of Bohemia. Early life It was long reported, by a local tradition dating at least from the 16th century, that Houghton had been born in Dewisland, or the immediate neighbourhood of St David's, although from his name he is plainly of an English or Anglo-Norman family.William Basil Jones, Edward Augustus Freeman, The history and antiquities of Saint David's (1856), p.303 There is a long- standing local claim that the farm of Caerforiog, in the parish of Whitchurch, Pembrokeshire, was his birthplace,Jones & Freeman, op. cit., p. 232 and this is stated as a fact in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Glanmor Williams, 'Houghton, Adam (d. 1389)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004), online edition, May 2008 (subscription required), accessed 4 December 2010 although Wilkinson's The Chancery under Edward III reports that there is \\"slender evidence\\" for it.Bertie Wilkinson, The Chancery under Edward III (1929), p. 142 In 1856 a small medieval building survived at Caerforiog, then in use as an outhouse, which had a doorway with an ogee head, possibly dating from the 14th century. He was educated at the University of Oxford, and by 1340 had graduated Doctor of Laws.W. H. Bliss, ed., Calendar of Papal Registers, Petitions, vol. 1 for 1342‚Äì1419 (1896), p. 106; Calendar of Papal Registers, Letters, vol. 3, p. 238 In 1338, an Adam de Houton, clerk of Oxford, was accused of wounding a man named John le Blake of Tadyngton, and Anthony Wood thought it likely this was Houghton.Andrew Clark, ed., The Survey of the Antiquities of the City of Oxford, composed in 1661‚Äì66 by Anthony Wood (Oxford Historical Society, 1889‚Äì1899, 3 vols), vol. 1., p. 434 Career St David's Cathedral Houghton gained the office of precentor in St David's Cathedral,William Latham Bevan, St. David's (1888), p. 135 to which he was admitted on 26 December 1339. In June 1344, Houghton and Geoffrey Scrope were in dispute with the university of Oxford over elections. He resigned as precentor about 1350, and had become a king's clerk by 1352. On 18 July 1355 he was admitted as an advocate at the Court of Arches. In 1360 and 1361 he was in France on business for King Edward III. On 20 September 1361 Pope Innocent VI provided him to be Bishop of St David's, and he was consecrated a bishop by William Evendon, bishop of Winchester, at St Mary's, Southwark. Houghton received possession of the temporalities of St David's on 8 December 1361 and was consecrated to the diocese on 2 January 1361/62. While bishop, Houghton endowed the choristers and was the first founder of the cathedral school. In 1365, with John of Gaunt, he founded, endowed, and began to build the College (or chantry) of St Mary, with the object of increasing the number of clergy and choristers, and later built the cloister which connects it to the cathedral. Although he appears to have worked conscientiously as Bishop of St David's, he was simultaneously receiver in parliament for the trial of petitions from 1363 to 1367. He also served on a Royal Commission appointed to settle disputes at the University of Oxford, and at some point in his career he was in the service of the priory of Arundel. Richard II and his queen, Anne of Bohemia, from the Liber Regalis On 11 April 1377, two months before the death of Edward III, Houghton was appointed Lord Chancellor of England. The most likely cause of this is that he was chosen by John of Gaunt, whose friend he was, and that his very obscurity and lack of political and administrative skill recommended him to Gaunt. His speech to the opening session of the parliament of January 1377 was noted for its tactlessness. Two letters from Gaunt to Houghton survive which begin \\"Our reverend father in God, and our great friend...\\" At this time, the Caroline War, a phase of the Hundred Years' War, was going badly for the English in France. Houghton immediately led a commission sent to France to negotiate for peace with Charles the Wise, but when in June Edward III died, he was called home. Under the new king, Richard II, Houghton was reappointed as chancellor on 26 June 1377, but he was replaced by Lord Scrope on 29 October 1378. In 1380 Richard II sent Houghton to begin negotiations for his marriage to Anne of Bohemia. These were ultimately successful. From 1379, Houghton and William Nicoll, prebendary of Llanddewi Brefi, were embroiled in litigation at the Roman Curia which dragged on until 1382. Houghton made a Will on 8 February 1388/89 and died a few days later, on 13 February, at St David's. He was entombed in the chapel of his new college, but his tomb was later destroyed and his remains were moved into the cathedral in 1965.

His father was especially significant in the history of whaling in the United Kingdom. The Champion family was from Berkshire and moved to London in the early 18th century. The father of British whaling Alexander Champion was heavily involved with his partners in whaling and is credited as ‚Äúthe founder of British whaling‚Äù about 1775.bc20 - The Blackheath Connection An embargo had been placed on whale oil exports from New England in 1775, as a result of the American Revolutionary War. Samuel Enderby was Alexander's business partner, and he elected to pursue the whaling trade in the South Atlantic. When James Cook returned to Britain from his voyage into the South Atlantic in 1775, during which he crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time, he reported that the seas were full of whales and seals. This was timely. Samuel Enderby founded the Samuel Enderby & Sons company the following year, when he and his business partners Alexander Champion and John St. Barbe assembled a fleet of twelve whaling vessels on the Greenwich Peninsula, in the London Borough of Greenwich. By November 1784 Alexander Champion had accepted to deal with US whaler Francis Rotch and Mary Hayley (widow of two of Alexander's father's partners), possibly to accept from Rotch sea otter furs from Nootka Sound.http://www.danbyrnes.com.au/blackheath/thebc20.htm In 1786 Alexander Champion and his brother Benjamin sent the first British whaler, The Triumph, east of the Cape of Good Hope. Later in 1786, in the Council Chamber at Whitehall, Samuel Enderby and Alexander Champion and others, were examined regarding the southern whale-fishery. They were asked whether they had any reason to believe that great quantities of Spermaceti whales might be found east of the Cape, and they replied: ‚ÄúYes, we have very good information from captains and mates of East Indiamen.\\" In proof of it they produced ‚Äòquantities of ambergris which is part of the dung of the whales.‚Äô This is a quaint way of expressing the nature of ambergris which is worth more than its weight in gold.http://www.whales.org.au/published/whalemen/intro.html Ambergris is a waxy substance secreted by the sperm whale used in making perfumes. In his whaling exploits he was often referred to together with his brother Benjamin.Ships employed in the South Sea Whale Fishery from Britain: 1775-1815: By Jane M Clayton A prominent personality in London In the 1780s he was recorded as living at 3, Great Winchester Street, London.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=008-duncombe&cid;=-1&Gsm;=2008-06-18#-1 Alexander Champion was a London alderman.

History Officially designated as No. 1 RAF Hospital Nocton Hall, the facility opened for medical use in June 1947.Mackie, p. 366 The hospital was situated in the grounds of Nocton Hall which was used to provide accommodation for female officers. The hospital was used by forces personnel, their families and local civilians until it closed as an RAF facility on 31 March 1983.A commemorative postal First Day Cover was issued that day. In 1984 it was leased to the United States Air Force (USAF) for use as a wartime contingency hospital. During the Gulf War, over 1,300 US medical staff were sent to the hall and many were billeted at RAF Scampton, although ultimately only 35 casualties had to be treated. In its later days 13 American personnel remained to keep the hospital serviceable. The USAF handed back RAF Nocton Hall to the UK Government on 30 September 1995.

As a result, Munro was beset with anxiety, fear, and a loss of confidence for six months to a year, and began to think again about simple experiences of connection as source material for making personal work.Cork, Dr. Richard, Bruce Munro: Catching the Light, Sea Hill Press, 2013, p XX In 2003 the Munros, now a family of six, purchased Long Knoll, a sixteenth-century derelict farmhouse and outbuildings, with a ten-acre large field bisected by a public footpath.

The Quartet agreement was formed following a decade of increasing trade and diplomatic traffic between Turkey and the other member states. The Levant Business Forum was set up, with a secretariat at Beirut, with the intention of enabling free circulation of goods and people among the Quartet states. Also planned was a customs union called Shamgen, a pun on Sham and the EU's Schengen Agreement, in which Iran and Iraq would participate by issuing joint visas with Turkey and Syria. The project was effectively put to a stop when Turkey imposed economic sanctions on Syria in the wake of the uprising in Syria, less than a year after it was first announced. The participants in the original Levant Quartet agreement did announce their intention to resume negotiations \\"as soon as the situation normalizes\\".

Ordained a diocesan priest of the Archdiocese of Cebu on 14 December 1941, he was eventually appointed an auxiliary bishop on 23 March 1955 and receiving the titular see of Clysma. He became coadjutor archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro on 10 June 1958, becoming titular archbishop of Marcianopolis. While waiting for then- archbishop James Hayes to retire, Camomot resigned for health reasons on 17 June 1970. He was killed in a vehicular accident in San Fernando on 27 September 1988 at the age of 74. Biography Camomot was born on 3 March 1914, in Barangay Cogon, Carcar, Cebu, to Luis Camomot and Angela Bastida. He was christened the following day, and on 22 August 1915, he received the Sacrament of Confirmation. At an early age, Camomot was already exposed to a very religious environment. He spent his elementary years at Carcar Elementary School where he was fondly called \\"Lolong\\" by his classmates, friends, and relatives. After graduating from elementary, Camomot decided to help his father in the farm and dreamt of being an agriculturist, which his mother disapproved of. Even at a young age, he already showed signs of love and concern for the poor, asking his mother for some rice or food so that he can give to the farmers and poor people. Once when his elder brother, Diosdado, visited and saw Camomot was not attending school, he asked him if he wanted to enter the seminary. Camomot entered the Seminario Menor de San Carlos in Mabolo, Cebu City, for his secondary education from 1932 to 1933, pursuing his philosophical and theological studies at the Seminario Mayor de San Carlos. He was ordained a priest on 14 December 1941, celebrating his Cantamisa (first mass of a newly ordained priest) at the second floor of his home instead of his parish in Carcar because of the outbreak of the Second World War. For twelve years, he served as cur√© of Santa Teresa de √Åvila Parish in Talisay. In 1955, the Third Order of Carmelites Discalced (now the Secular Order of Carmelites Discalced) was established at the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, and Camomot was elected as the first prior of the San El√≠as Chapter. On 25 March 1955, Camomot was appointed auxiliary bishop of Jaro, Iloilo, receiving episcopal ordination on 29 May 1955, and staying in Jaro until 1959. After masses, he kept himself busy by visiting the poor especially those who are sick. In 1959, he was sent to the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro as coadjutor archbishop with right of succession. It was during these years that he formed communities that would help the church in the work of evangelisation: the Paulinian Faith Defenders and the Carmelite Tertiaries of the Blessed Eucharist, the forerunners of the Daughters of Saint Teresa. Between 1962 and 1965, he attended the first (11 October 1962 ‚Äì 8 December 1962), third (14 September 1964 ‚Äì 21 November 1964), and fourth (14 September 1965 ‚Äì 8 December 1965) sessions of the Second Vatican Council. Due to kidney problems, he had to resign his position as coadjutor archbishop in 1970. He came back to Cebu and was assigned in Santo Tom√°s de Villanueva Parish in Barangay El Pardo, Cebu City. Together with him were some sisters from the congregation he founded in Mindanao. While serving Pardo, he also frequently visited his former Parish in Talisay. In 1976, he was assigned to his native town in Carcar. Aside from being the pastor of the parish, he was also auxiliary bishop to Julio Cardinal Rosales. Again, his generosity became very well known that rectory workers began complaining about the number of poor people lining up to ask for food. His brothers and sisters would even remind him to be more cautious of the people whom he was helping because his generosity might be abused, but he always saw the goodness in every person he met. On 27 September 1988, after celebrating the feast of Saint Vincent de Paul at the Seminario Mayor de San Carlos and visiting the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Camomot travelled home to Carcar with his chauffeur. While he was asleep, his vehicle overturned in Sitio Magtalisay, Barangay Sangat, San Fernando, Cebu. Camomot immediately died from his injuries at about 14:00 PHT, but his chauffeur survived. Thousands attended Camomot's funeral at the municipal cemetery. In 2009, his body was exhumed for transfer to the Daughters of Santa Teresa convent in Valladolid, Carcar City. Fame and cause for beatification and sainthood Camomot was not an eloquent preacher or a convincing speaker, but his actions spoke louder than words. He was noted for his diligence in his pastoral duties (spending hours in the confessional), devotion to prayer (waking up very early for his morning prayers and meditation), as well as his numerous works of charity. His parishioners until now cannot forget his simplicity, his personal holiness, and his apostolic works especially among the poor, the sick, the homeless, and the suffering. His simplicity was attested by so many people even fellow prelates. There were many stories about Camomot's Franciscan-like poverty. Cardinal Vidal once told that on one occasion he noticed that Camomot was not wearing his pectoral cross, the cross that a bishop wears on his breast. Curious, he asked Camomot about it. He made some excuse. Later a priest told Vidal that Camomot had pawned his cross to give some money to the poor. Vidal later gave him a new cross and told him not to give it away. During the Second Vatican Council, he was one of the participants for which he had to endure travelling by sea from the Philippines to Rome in the fourth class of a luxury liner. Even though he was in Europe, his generosity especially to the poor and his simplicity were observed by those around him. He was also known for his spiritual gifts of healing, reading hearts, levitation, and bilocation. Cebu archbishop emeritus Ricardo Jamin Vidal said there were several testimonies about Camomot's bilocation or there were people who would see him present in two places at the same time. Vidal himself has signed an affidavit in relation to a witness' account on this phenomenon where Camomot was drowsing beside him at a meeting of the College of Consultors. \\"I have already authenticated his presence at a meeting. But a woman said at that time he was in a mountain barangay (in Carcar) giving the last sacrament to a dying person,\\" he said. \\"He (Camomot) was at my left, and Archbishop (Manuel) Salvador-- discussing about the pastoral (thrust) of the diocese‚Äîat my right. I said 'Monsignor, we have a votation and you have to vote,'\\" he added. The Daughters of Saint Teresa formally petitioned for the opening of a cause for beatification and canonization. On 15 October 2010, Cardinal Vidal announced that the Holy See has approved the opening of the cause for beatification and canonization. On 27 December 2010, Vidal formed a commission to look into the possibility of beatification. Members of the commission are the bishop Antonio Ranola (instructor and episcopal delegate), Dennis Villarojo (postulator), Raul Go (promoter of justice), Jasper John Petralba (notary), and Trinidad Calleno (adjunct notary). Guillermo Gorre, Marnell Mejia, and Patricio Ornopia were designated as theological censors to study the writings of Camomot. Tasked with historical research are Marvin Mejia, Ramon Ofredo, and Cayetano Gelbolingo. After the Diocesan Phase, the Congregation for the Causes for Saints will have to certify the results. Then a Positio Super Vita et Virtutibus (On the Life and Virtues) will have to be written and submitted. The Congregation will then study the life, writings, and virtues of Camomot, which mayy lead to the issuance of a Decree Super Virtutibus, earning Camomot the title \\"Venerable.\\" A major miracle (complete, instantaneous, permanent, and scientifically inexplicable) will have to be investigated, documented, and scrutinized. Only when a Decree Super Miro (on the miracle) is promulgated can the date for beatification be set. Beatification grants a limited liturgical veneration to the Blessed with his own assigned feast day, a proper Collect, and Office of Readings for the Liturgy of the Hours, but only within his own ecclesiastical territory or country and his religious order. Another major miracle after canonization is required to proceed to Canonization. His tomb behind the chapel of the DST Convent in Valladolid, Carcar City has become a pilgrimage site for devotees of Camomot, who admire the example of his life and believe in the efficacy of his intercession. The major dates of pilgrimage are on his birthday on 3 March and his death anniversary on 27 September. Near the tomb, a museum displays various items he had used in his lifetime.

Located in Centurion, Gauteng near South Africa's administrative capital Pretoria, the mint manufactures coins and planchets for both domestic and international markets.  History  Following the discovery of gold in the South African Republic (causing the 1886 Witwatersrand Gold Rush), the country's President Paul Kruger decided to establish a national mint. This was established in 1890 and opened on 6 July 1892 in Pretoria. After the end of the Second Boer War in 1902, the country was annexed into the British Empire and became the Transvaal Colony, leading to the closure of the mint after the pound sterling became the legal tender of the new colony. Under the Mint Act of 1919, the British established a branch of the Royal Mint on 1 January 1923, which produced ¬£83,114,575 worth of sovereigns during its lifetime.

In 1957, the church tower and lower doors were used as the walls of a courtyard for a small Welsh Congregational chapel designed by Eustace Button, who designed a number of churches in the area. This small chapel lay across the old church, with the old halls at the rear. The Eustace Button church was low with tip-up seats and a wide open-span ceiling. The Welsh congregation moved here from the Castle Street area where their chapel had been destroyed during bombing and not rebuilt. The Welsh Congregation closed the chapel in 1988 ‚Äì the adjacent hall was in an appalling state of repair. The Victorian tower and doors were incorporated in the office development and the 1957 chapel and Victorian hall were demolished.

He was the founder of a judicial dynasty, several of whose members were noted for eccentricity. He was also the first of the Cusack-Smith baronets of Tuam. Background and early career He was born at Newtown, County Offaly, the son of William Smith (died 1747) and his wife Hester Lynch of Galway. The Smith family had come to Ireland from Yorkshire in the seventeenth century, and acquired substantial property in the Irish Midlands.Burke's Peerage 4th Edition 1833 Michael evidently revered the memory of his father, who died when his son was only seven, and later composed a eulogy which was inscribed on his father's tombstone.Burke's Peerage He graduated from the University of Dublin, and was called to the Bar in 1769. He was elected member of the Irish House of Commons for Randalstown in 1783, and was noted for his eloquence in debate. Judge He was raised to the Bench as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1793; in 1801 he became Master of the Rolls in Ireland, retiring in 1806. The Mastership of the Rolls had long been a notorious sinecure for politicians, many of whom had no legal qualifications whatever, and some of whom were Englishmen who rarely visited Ireland. The appointment of Smith, a lawyer of undoubted ability, is thought to have been the result of a conscious policy of making the Mastership a full-time and responsible judicial office; the policy was successful. Family His first marriage to Maryanne Cusack, daughter and heiress of James Cusack of Ballyronan, County Wicklow, was an interesting one for an ambitious young lawyer as Maryanne was an open and devout Roman Catholic. They had two children, William and Angelina.Burke's Peerage Their son Sir William Cusack-Smith, 2nd Baronet followed his father into the law and as a Baron of the Exchequer. His appointment caused some disquiet, both because he was only 35 years old, and because he was already showing marked signs of eccentricity. William's second son Thomas Berry Cusack Smith continued the family traditions of judicial eminence and oddity: like his grandfather he was Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and like his father he was notably eccentric. William's sister Angelina married twice but had no issue. Her husbands were Smith Steele , a younger son of Sir Richard Steele, 1st Baronet, and William Borrowes, a younger son of Sir Kildare Borrowes, 5th Baronet. Maryanne died in 1798. Michael remarried his cousin Eleanor Smith, daughter of another Michael Smith. In 1799 he was made a baronet of Tuam in King's County. By his second marriage he had one son, Michael, born posthumously.Burke's Peerage He died at Newtown on 17 December 1808.Bridget Hourican Smith, Sir William Cusack, Dictionary of Irish Biography. Accessed 2 August 2020 Reputation According to Elrington Ball he was noted for learning and eloquence; in contrast to his son and grandson, who were both notably hot-tempered, he was invariably calm and self-controlled.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray, London, 1926 Daniel O'Connell, then a rising young barrister, who thought poorly of Irish judges in general, complained of Smith's inefficiency, yet praised him as \\"a gentleman and a scholar, polite, patient and attentive\\".Geoghegan, Patrick M. King Dan- the rise of Daniel O'Connell Gill and Macmilan 2008 Dublin p.64 While his first marriage to a Roman Catholic suggests that he was personally tolerant of the practice of Catholicism, one of his best-known judgments, Butler v. Moore,(1802) Macnally Ev. 253-4 held that a priest has no privilege to withhold evidence of what was said under the seal of the confessional. This decision was overruled in the twentieth century.Cook v Carroll [1945] I.R. 151 which established the legal privilege of a priest not to reveal anything said under the seal of the confessional.

On 4 December 2010, the Tupolev Tu-154 operating the flight skidded off the runway following an emergency landing at Domodedovo Airport, 45 km south-east of Vnukovo. Two people on board were killed.http://lenta.ru/news/2010/12/04/noengines Accident The plane was flying a scheduled trip from Vnukovo Airport in Moscow to Uytash Airport in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan. Two of the aircraft's three engines failed shortly after take off at 14:07 local time (11:07 UTC); the pilots reported the loss of engines when the aircraft was at a height of around . An emergency landing at Domodedovo Airport was requested, and as the aircraft was in the process of landing, the third engine failed. The aircraft approached runway 32R from the right at an almost right angle, overflying the threshold before turning right at to the left of the runway and crossing over the runway, flying parallel with but to the right of the runway. The aircraft touched down to the right of the runway centerline, and only short of the end, breaking up into three section as it came to rest. Aircraft RA-85744, the aircraft involved, already in South East Airlines colours following Dagestan Airlines' rebranding The aircraft operating the flight was a tri-jet Tupolev Tu-154M, registered RA-85744, cn: 92A-927. Built in 1992, it had been overhauled in 2009 and was acquired by Dagestan Airlines in January 2010. Around that time, the airline rebranded itself as South East Airlines, and RA-85744 was painted with the new livery. The aircraft reportedly met all relevant European safety standards, and one month before the accident had been used to transport the Belgian national football team, a flight that required compliance with European regulations. Casualties The emergency landing resulted in 2 fatalities and 92 injuries, of which 39 were serious.Final report, section 1.2 One of the two dead was Gadzhimurad Magomedov, the brother of Magomedsalam Magomedov, the president of Dagestan. The other, the mother of a judge of the Constitutional Court of Russia, died of a heart attack. The number of people on board the plane was unclear; early reports said that between 163 and 172 people were on board, but a number of 168, eight of which were crew members, was later settled on. Investigation and trial The final report by the Interstate Aviation Committee into the crash Russian authorities dispatched investigators to the site of the emergency landing, classifying the investigation as a \\"criminal probe\\", according to the Russian Investigative Committee. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika was said to be \\"keeping a watchful eye\\" over the proceedings. Several hours after the incident occurred, the lead prosecutor in the investigation said that the preliminary results suggested a bird strike was responsible for the loss of engines. By the day after the incident, investigators had recovered the flight data recorder and a second data-storing device. The Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) said that it had begun analysis of both recovered devices, which were said to be in \\"satisfactory condition\\". The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on 10 December. Analysis of the flight data recorder showed that eight minutes after the aircraft took off, at an altitude of , the fuel supply to the engines fluctuated, and as the aircraft passed , the outer two engines shut down. The crew at this point began a descent towards Domodedovo Airport. The central engine had a \\"period of instability\\", but its normal status was \\"restored and maintained\\" until the aircraft's landing. The fuel supply at Vnukovo Airport was confirmed to meet standards. On 1 April 2011, investigators announced that poor fuel quality had been ruled out as a cause of the crash, despite instrument readings that indicated issues with the fuel supply before the aircraft crashed. On 26 September 2011, the MAK released its report concluding that the cause of the accident was the erroneous actions of the crew during the flight and approach in instrumental meteorological conditions with one engine running (out of three), which resulted in the aircraft approaching significantly to the right of the extended center line, exiting the runway after landing and colliding with an embankment. The flight engineer accidentally shut off a fuel pump while transferring fuel. As a result, fuel flow fluctuated, leading to unusual altitude and engine readings before the outer two engines shut down. At this point, the crew chose to bring the plane to Domodedovo Airport. The report said that the crew had not used all available options to deal with the loss of engine power and had not followed procedures for landing with two nonfunctional engines. The report also noted that the crew had not been sufficiently trained to deal with the situation. On 22 January 2015, the airplane's pilot Zakarzha Zakarzhayev was found guilty in court under article 263.3 of the Criminal Code of Russia (violating safety rules of transportation and air travel, which led by neglect to death of two or more people). He was given a suspended sentence of 3 years and then immediately amnestied.

His work in economics and related social science includes his analyses, concepts and results in Public Economics and Normative Economics (hence also social ethics and political philosophy) focusing on equality, distributive justice, and efficiency of economic measures, and in other fields and problems often applying them. Biography Born in Paris in December 1932, Serge Kolm studied at the Ecole Polytechnique where his rank permitted him to join the civil service body of the Corps des Ponts et Chauss√©es (which has a long tradition of applied and theoretical economic research). He worked in Africa, heading water and river basin management in the Sahel region and setting up development plans for the new independent post-colonial states. He held teaching and research positions in France (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, Institut d'Etudes Politiques, General Planning Commission) and in the USA (Harvard University and Stanford University), and advisory and planning functions in Europe, in various countries in transition, and for international organizations (OECD, IMF, WHO).

Work Public economics Kolm's work in Public Economics includes: *The Theory of Value Constraints: second-best optimum with constraints involving prices such as financial result, budget structure, price relations, etc. For each such constraint or set of such constraints, there is a focal point towards which the vector of outputs and inputs moves when the vector of marginal costs and productivities moves towards the price vector. Applications are to optimum taxation, duties, subsidies, management, public firms, tariffs and balance of payments, planning. *The Theory of Public Goods: types and theory of mixed goods, \\"Kolm triangles\\", voluntary contributions, mixed public and private financing, crowd out, reasons for and types and effects of \\"warm- glows\\", cases of large numbers,types of tacit cooperation (social contracts,matching or lateral reciprocity, Kantian solutions), application to the alleviation of poverty and to environmental management. *Optimum non- linear public tariffs and income taxation. *The Theory of Mass Services: utilities with externalities between users (e.g. congestion).Optimum prices, investment and management.Financial result. The theory of \\"qualitative returns to scale\\". Applications to transportation, energy, environment, queuing. * Ecological economics applying the above results plus specific values to environmental issues and policies. Normative economics Kolm's works in Normative Economics include: *The Comparison and Measure of Inequalities: of income (one good), intensive, addition-neutral, intermediate, synthetic, transfers, Schur-convexity, concentrations, truncations, etc., multidimensional, of freedom of choice. *The reasons for and types of equality. *\\"Equity-no-envy\\" as no one preferring any other's allocation to her own, identical to equal potential freedom of choice, consistent with efficiency. Applications. The dual \\"adequacy\\"; relation. Actual envy and the definition of envy-free preferences and their properties. Other related principles. *Super-equity. Efficient multi-dimensional equality. Cases of equal partial or total incomes. *Comparable \\"fundamental\\" utility or preferences. Eudemonistic justice as equality, \\"practical justice\\" as leximin. Minimax in suffering. *The definition of welfare as utility or preferences cleaned for individual differences in tastes and hedonic capacities. Computation. Consequences and applications. *Social liberty, \\"liberal social contracts\\" and freedom-based public economics. Analysis of social liberty, a liberty fundamental to the laws and individual rights of the modern world, and its implications. Indications of the general liberal theory, including the Liberal Social Contract, in contrast to the classical liberal theory regarding the role of the public sector. *Macrojustice: redistribution taxation respecting efficiency, basic liberties and equal freedom of choice in \\"Equal- Labour Income Equalization\\". Application by tax exemption of overtime labour. *The Justice and Equity: Compatibility and relations of equity, efficiency, and preferences. Reciprocity and giving Kolm's works on pro-social conducts include the analyses of: *Reciprocity as favouring one's benefactor, generalized to \\"extended\\", \\"reverse\\" and \\"general\\" reciprocity, including \\"balance\\" and \\"liking\\" reciprocity, applied in particular to explain spontaneous corrections of a number of \\"market failures\\". *Joint giving as contributions to a particular public good. Transitions Kolm's studies and theory of transitions between various kinds of economic systems include the various types of development, and transitions from or to various kinds of socialisms. Financial and monetary choices and macroeconomic policy Kolm's works on financial and monetary choices and macroeconomic policy include: *The theory of stochastic dominance and related comparisons and measures of risk (see above \\"Inequalities\\"). *The concept and theory of external liquidity: an agent's cash balances also benefit potential sellers to it and influences other agents; resulting optimum monetary policy. *Explanation of inflation from uncertainty and from the allocation of pricing efforts. *The shifting unemployment-inflation political cycle and spiral and crises forecast, with international synchronization. *Optimum external monetary policy. Paths to monetary union and integration. *Are Elections Democracy?

Building commenced in 1389 at the order of the Wallsee family. The ruins of an older castle built in the eleventh century by the Patriarch of Aquileia are located on the grounds. In the nineteenth century, it became one of two residences for Prince Alexander von Thurn und Taxis and his wife Princess Marie of the Czech branch of the House of Thurn und Taxis. While not the wealthiest of the Thurn und Taxis line, Alexander and Marie supported artists and writers, among these included Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke. While a guest of Princess Marie in early 1912, Rilke began to write his Duino Elegies, a collection of ten long deeply philosophical and mystical poems which are considered to be his greatest work. Rilke dedicated his work to Princess Marie when they were completed in February 1922 and published the following year. Duino Castle remains property of the Thurn und Taxis family, and is owned by Prince Alexander and Princess Marie's great-grandson, Prince Carlo Alessandro della Torre e Tasso, Duke of Castel Duino. The castle has been opened to the public as a museum and park. History Duino castle in an engraving from 1679. Duino Castle Early history Near the castle are the ruins of the Old Castle which dates back to the 11th century. It belonged to the patriarchy of Aquileia. The castle dates back to 1389, when the Wallsee family commanded the construction of a strong fortress. Over time, the Wallsee family disappeared and the castle, after having been used as a prison, became the residence of the Luogar and Hofer. The House of Thurn und Taxis At the end of the 19th century it became the property of Prince Alexander Johann Vincenz Rudolf Hugo Karl Lamoral Eligius von Thurn und Taxis from the Czech branch of the House of Thurn and Taxis. It remains with the family to this day with his great-grandson Prince Carlo Alessandro della Torre e Tasso, Duke of Castel Duino the current owner. The castle has been opened to the public as a museum and park. Rilke and the Duino Elegies Rainer Maria Rilke (1875‚Äì1926) in a sketch by Leonid Pasternak In 1912, Austrian-Bohemian writer and poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) began to write portions of his famous work, Duino Elegies, while visiting Duino Castle as a guest of the Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (born Princess of Hohenlohe).Freedman, Ralph. Life of a Poet: Rainer Maria Rilke. (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1998), 317-320. While walking along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic Sea near the castle, Rilke claimed to hear a voice calling to him speaking the words of the first line, Wer, wenn ich schriee, h√∂rte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen? (\\"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?\\") which he quickly wrote in his notebook. Within days, he produced drafts of the first two elegies in the series (of ten) and drafted passages and fragments that would later be incorporated into later elegies‚Äîincluding the opening passage of the tenth elegy.Gass, William H.

B. and Spender, Stephen (translators). \\"Introduction\\" in Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies. (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1939), 10. The Duino Elegies are recognized by critics and scholars as his most important work and one of the chief transitional works between the apex of German Romanticism and Modernist poetry.Hoeniger, F. David. \\"Symbolism and Pattern in Rilke's Duino Elegies\\" in German Life and Letters Volume 3, Issue 4, (July 1950), pages 271‚Äì283.Perloff, Marjorie. \\"Reading Gass Reading Rilke\\" in Parnassus: Poetry in Review. Volume 25, Number 1/2 (2001). They are ten intensely religious, mystical poems that weigh beauty and existential suffering. The poems employ a rich symbolism of angels and salvation, and are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's \\"ontological torment\\" and an \\"impassioned monologue about coming to terms with human existence\\" discussing themes of \\"the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness ... man's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet\\".Dash, Bibhudutt. \\"In the Matrix of the Divine: Approaches to Godhead in Rilke's Duino Elegies and Tennyson's In Memoriam\\" in Language in India Volume 11 (11 November 2011), 355-371. Rilke finished the work in Switzerland after a ten-year period where depression and an existential crisis rendered him unable to continue writing. Upon publication in 1922, Rilke dedicated the work to the Princess, who he esteemed as one of his greatest patrons and closest friends.

According to Steve Bush, they were originally going to be called Essence of Bop, but instead opted for Essential Bop.Steve Bush interview on RPM BBC1 West  Career  Their first release was the track \\"Chronicle\\" on the seminal 1979 Bristol compilation LP/CD Avon Calling. This was followed by line-up changes and the 1980 EP Eloquent Sounds on their own Monopause label. This resulted in NME journalist Paul Morley interviewing Steve Bush and writing that Essential Bop would be one of the bands that would make it in the 1980s. Further line-up changes in 1981 saw them emerge as a guitarless four-piece band with 2 tracks on Bristol Recorder 3 and their second release on Monopause of the single \\"Croaked/Butler (In Running Shorts)\\". The single received some notice in the New York independent charts and resulted in a US east coast tour in the summer of 1981; however the band split after their return. A third single \\"Monkey Glands\\" was never released, but did appear on both of the band's albums. Their second compilation CD Chronicles included the track \\"Mau Mau\\" which was recorded in 1981 by Art Objects/The Blue Aeroplanes and included on their cassette/CD Weird Shit. Gerard Langley of The Blue Aeroplanes has a long history of producing, performing and writing with Steve Bush, ever since their initial group The Biros. Langley on the cover notes of the Avon Calling CD referred to Essential Bop as \\"closet Doors fans with a grudge.\\" In 1984, Steve Bush and Simon Tyler reformed the band in London with Mike Fewings on bass and Martin Kiernan on drums, and subsequently released their debut LP on TSAR, The Flick Was Boss. The album included tracks from a variety of sources and line-ups, covering the years 1979, 1980, 1981 and two new songs from 1984. The band folded for good in 1985. Bristol Archive Records released a second compilation album in 2008 called Chronicles, which included both studio and live tracks. The Avon Calling 2 CD from 2010 also included the track \\"Audition Room\\" by the band. As of autumn 2016, work was due to start on a live album comprising recordings from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Steve Bush Steve Bush later went on to collaborate with Christian Clarke of Various Artists and The Art Objects as a duo, alternatively known as 'A Pair of Blue Eyes' or 'Bush & Clarke', under which latter name they released the Allergies album. This album was produced by Stephen Street who later found fame as a producer/writer with bands such as The Smiths, Blur, The Libertines and Morrissey. Stephen Street was also responsible for assigning Andrew Paresi as the drummer for A Pair of Blue Eyes, who became a part of Morrissey's first solo band shortly afterwards. Bush also produced a solo album, Blossom Freak (Green Goat 2001), and also released the album Row of Ashes (Green Goat Records) with Fran Fey. Bush and Fey's latest album Earl Grey and Leather was released in November 2016, also on Green Goat Records.

It has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. Vermilion is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. History Vermilion began in 1994 as Vermilion Resources Ltd, an Alberta focused oil and gas company. Vermilion had its initial public offering on the Alberta Stock Exchange in April 1996 for $0.10 per share. In 1997, it entered to the French market. The company changed its status to that of a trust in December 2002 when it became known as Vermilion Energy Trust for eight years; in September 2010, it converted back to a corporation. In 2004, Vermilion started to operate in the Netherlands. Vermilion acquired an 18.5% non- operating stake in the Corrib field in the Republic of Ireland from Marathon Oil in 2009, which grew to 20% along with operatorship when Royal Dutch Shell exited the project in 2018. In March 2013, Vermilion began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \\"VET\\". Vermilion entered the US market with the acquisition of properties in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming in 2014. Vermilion acquired a 25% contractual participation interest in a four partner consortium in Germany from GDF Suez in February 2014. In April 2018, Vermilion announced the acquisition of Spartan Energy, a Saskatchewan-focused light oil producer, for $1.4 billion. Operations In Canada, Vermilion's operations are focused in the West Pembina/Drayton Valley region of Alberta and the Northgate Region of southeast Saskatchewan. In West Pembina, Vermilion has the potential for three significant development projects sharing the same surface infrastructure: * Cardium light oil development (1,800 m depth) * Mannville liquids-rich gas inventory (2,400 - 2,700 m depth) * Extensive position in Duvernay liquids-rich gas resource play (3,200 - 3,400 m depth) Vermilion's activities in the United States are targeting oil and gas development in the Turner Sands tight-oil play. Vermilion has become the largest oil producer in France.France Is About to Ban Oil Production and No One Will Even Notice In 2017, under a new climate change bill, Vermilion will no longer be an oil producer for France as of 2040. The company estimates there are more than 1.7 billion barrels of original oil in place in the five biggest conventional oil pools. In the Netherlands, the company has undeveloped land base approximately . The Netherlands is characterized by high impact natural gas drilling and development. Vermilion's natural gas production in the Netherlands is priced of Title Transfer Facility (TTF). In Germany, the assets include four natural gas producing fields across 11 production licenses, spanning in the prolific North German Basin. Vermilion is the operator and minority owner of the Corrib gas project in Ireland. At peak production, the Corrib project has been projected to supply 60-65% of the country's natural gas demand and over 90% of the country's natural gas production. First-gas from Corrib began on December 30, 2015. Wandoo is Vermilion's Australian asset, an offshore oil field and platform approximately off the northwest coast of Australia. Wandoo production receives a premium to Brent Crude pricing. Vermilion originally purchased a 60% operated interest in Wandoo in 2005. The company then purchased the remaining 40% interest in Wandoo in 2007.

The reaction was reported by Sebastian Juli√° at the Chemical Institute of Sarri√° in 1980, with further elaboration by both Juli√° and Stefano Colonna (Istituto di Chimica Industriale dell'Universit√†, Milan, Italy). :The Juli√°‚ÄìColonna Epoxidation of a chalcone proceeds with poly-L-leucine and hydrogen peroxide in generic triphasic conditions. Image adapted from Juli√° et al. In the original triphasic protocol, the chalcone substrate is soluble in the organic phase, generally toluene or carbon tetrachloride. The alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidant is soluble primarily in the aqueous phase, and the reaction occurs at the insoluble polymer layer at the interface of the two phases. Alternative biphasic and monophasic protocols have been developed with increased substrate accessibility and reaction rate. The efficient enantioselective catalytic epoxidation under mild conditions is of great synthetic utility. Not only are epoxides effective synthons for a range of transformations, they have a significant presence in natural products structures. Furthermore, the reaction has been effectively scaled up to industrially useful levels, with work conducted notably by Bayer and Evonik. Finally, the enzyme-like activity of the poly-amino acid segments is suggestive of a role of the reaction in the prebiotic origin of life. Reaction mechanism The Juli√°‚ÄìColonna epoxidation is an asymmetric nucleophilic epoxidation of electron-deficient olefins such as Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones. The general mechanism shown in Figure 2 applies to all nucleophilic epoxidations but is controlled in this reaction by the poly-leucine catalyst. Figure 2: The generic mechanism for nucleophilic epoxidation of an electron- deficient olefin indicates that the reaction proceeds through a resonance stabilized peroxide enolate intermediate. The hydroperoxide anion and chalcone assemble in a complex with the poly-leucine catalyst before reacting to form a peroxide enolate intermediate. The intermediate subsequently closes, as controlled by the catalyst structure, to form the epoxide product stereoselectively. Ternary complex formation The poly-leucine strands demonstrate enzyme-like kinetics with a first-order dependence on and eventual saturation with both the hydroperoxide anion (KM= 30 mM) and the olefin substrate (KM=110 mM.) Kinetic study suggests that the reaction proceeds by random steady-state formation of a ternary (polyleucine+hydroperoxide anion+olefin) complex. Both substrates must bind prior to reaction, and while either may bind first, initial hydroperoxide binding is kinetically preferred. The rapid equilibrium enabling complex formation is followed by the rate- limiting formation of the peroxide enolate (Figure 3).Carrea, G.; Colonna, S.; Meek, A. D.; Ottolina, G.; Roberts, S. M., \\"Kinetics of chalcone oxidation by peroxide anion catalysed by poly-L-leucine\\". Chem. Comm. 2004, (12), 1412-1413. Mechanistic origin of stereoselectivity All of the reactants associate with the polyleucine catalyst prior to reaction to form the hydroperoxide enolate intermediate. The catalyst orients the reactants and, even more significantly, the peroxide enolate intermediate by a series of hydrogen bonding interactions with the four N-terminal amino groups in the poly-leucine Œ±-helix. While other models have been proposed,Berkessel, A.; Gasch, N.; Glaubitz, K.; Koch, C., \\"Highly enantioselective enone epoxidation catalyzed by short solid phase-bound peptides: Dominant role of peptide helicity\\". Org. Lett. 2001, 3 (24), 3839‚Äì3842. computations by Kelly et al. have suggested that the NH-2, NH-3, and NH-4 form an isosceles triangle available for hydrogen bonding as an intermediate-stabilizing oxyanion hole. While olefin binding to either the endo or exo face of the helix is sterically allowed, only endo binding orients the NH-4 group to bind with the hydroperoxide moiety allowing for hydroxide displacement in the final reaction step (Figure 4).Kelly, D. R.; Roberts, S. M., The mechanism of polyleucine catalysed asymmetric epoxidation\\". Chem. Comm. 2004, (18), 2018-2020. Catalyst Poly-amino acid selection Enantioselectivity is maximized by poly-amino acid sequences containing the greatest Œ±-helical content; these include poly-leucine and poly-alanine. Both poly-L- and poly-D-amino acids are available and cause the opposite stereoinduction.Bentley, P. A.; Cappi, M. W.; Flood, R. W.; Roberts, S. M.; Smith, J. A., Towards a mechanistic insight into the Julia-Colonna asymmetric epoxidation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones using discrete lengths of poly-leucine. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39 (50), 9297‚Äì9300. Catalyst generation leucine-N-carboxyanhydrides with an initiator such as n-butylamine. The original poly-leucine catalysts were formed by reacting leucine-N- carboxyanhydrides with an initiator such as an amine, an alcohol or water (Figure 5). In triphasic systems, the polymer catalyst must be soaked in the organic solvent and peroxide solution to generate a gel prior to reaction.Adger, B. M.; Barkley, J. V.; Bergeron, S.; Cappi, M. W.; Flowerdew, B. E.; Jackson, M. P.; McCague, R.; Nugent, T. C.; Roberts, S. M., \\"Improved procedure for Julia‚ÄìColonna asymmetric epoxidation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones: total synthesis of diltiazem and Taxol (TM) side-chain\\". J. Chem. Soc.-Perkin Trans. 1 1997, (23), 3501‚Äì3507. ‚Äì Especially in biphasic systems, reaction time may be reduced and enantioselectivity increased by activating the catalyst with NaOH prior to reaction. Furthermore, in biphasic systems the polymer may be immobilized on polystyrene, polyethylene glycol (PEG), or silica gel and formed into a paste. Catalyst secondary structure The active component of the catalyst assumes an Œ±-helical structure where the four to five N-terminal residues are actively involved in catalysis. While active catalysts have been generated from scalemic leucine, consistent enantiomeric content must be maintained through the N-terminal region to give appropriate handedness to the structure. While the greatest enantioselectivity was originally observed when n=30 residues, a 10-mer Leucine polypeptide is of sufficient length to provide significant enantioselectivity Following improvement of the original procedure, greater enantioselectivity has been observed for lower molecular weight polymers, presumably due to the greater number of N-termini available per mass used. Scope The Juli√°‚ÄìColonna epoxidation of electron-deficient olefins was originally demonstrated with chalcones, but it was soon extended to other systems with electron withdrawing moieties such as Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones, esters, and amides. The reaction has also demonstrated efficiency with sulfone substrates, and the scope of the reaction is being expanded with further methdological investigation.Lopez- Pedrosa, J. M.; Pitts, M. R.; Roberts, S. M.; Saminathan, S.; Whittall, J., \\"Asymmetric epoxidation of some arylalkenyl sulfones using a modified Julia‚ÄìColonna procedure\\". Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (26), 5073‚Äì5075. Several classes of substrates, however, are not suitable for the Juli√°‚ÄìColonna Epoxidation. These include: * compounds sensitive to hydroxide. * compounds with acidic protons on the Œ± or Œ±‚Äô positions. * electron rich olefins. The nucleophilic epoxidation is naturally complementary in scope to electrophilic epoxidations such as the Sharpless epoxidation and Jacobsen epoxidation. Stereoselectivity Catalyst structure The stereoinduction of the Juli√°‚ÄìColonna epoxidation is dependent on the Œ±-helical secondary structure of the poly-leucine catalyst. While the consistent stereochemistry of the N-terminal amino acids is necessary for this induction, even a 10-mer leucine polypeptide is of sufficient length to provide significant enantioselectivity. Chiral amplification by scalemic catalysts This dependence solely on the N-terminal region of the helix is most pronounced in enantioselective stereoinduction by scalemic catalysts. Even a 40% enantiomeric excess of L vs. D-leucine in catalyst formation can yield the same enantiomeric enriched epoxide as the enantiopure catalyst. The relationship between catalyst and product enantiopurity can be closely approximated with a Bernoullian statistical model: een=(Ln-Dn)/(Ln+Dn) where L and D are the proportions of L- and D-leucine used to generate the catalytic polymers and n is the length of the catalytic component. Chiral amino acids, including leucine, have been generated in electrical discharge experiments designed to mimic the prebiotic conditions on Earth, and they have been found in scalemic mixtures in meteorites. It has been suggested that poly-amino acid fragments analogous to the Juli√°‚ÄìColonna catalyst may have been initiated by imidazole or cyanide derivatives, and the resulting fragments may have played a catalytic role in the origin of enantiomeric enrichment ubiquitous in life today. Variations Silica-grafted catalysts Silica-grafted polyleucine has been shown to effectively catalyze epoxidation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aromatic ketones. The silica graft allows for the catalyst to be easily recovered with only mild loss of activity and is particularly useful for scale-up reactions.Yi, H.; Zou, G.; Li, Q.; Chen, Q.; Tang, J.; He, M. Y., \\"Asymmetric epoxidation of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones catalyzed by silica-grafted poly-(L)-leucine catalysts\\". Tetrahedron Lett. 2005, 46 (34), 5665‚Äì5668. Biphasic (non- aqueous) reaction conditions For the alternative biphasic protocol, the olefin substrate is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) along with the urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) oxidant and a tertiary amine base such as 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU.) The immobilized polymer catalyst forms a paste which serves as the reaction site. The two phase reaction conditions extended the range of enones to which the reaction could be applied. Monophasic reaction conditions with PEG-immobilized polyleucine A soluble initiator O,O‚Ä≤-bis(2-aminoethyl)polyethylene glycol (diaminoPEG) for poly-leucine assembly was utilized to generate a THF-soluble triblock polymer. Utilization of this catalyst in homogeneous reaction conditions enabled marked extension of the methodology to Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones, dienes, and bis- dienes. Phase transfer co-catalysis Addition of tetrabutylammonium bromide as a phase transfer catalyst dramatically increases the rate of reaction. The co-catalyst is presumed to increase the concentration of the peroxide oxidant in the organic phase enabling more efficient access to the reactive ternary complex.Geller, T.; Gerlach, A.; Kruger, C. M.; Militzer, H. C., \\"Novel conditions for the Julia‚ÄìColonna epoxidation reaction providing efficient access to chiral, nonracemic epoxides\\". Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (26), 5065‚Äì5067. These conditions were developed for application to two phase systems but also function for three phase systems and have been utilized up to the 100g scale Scale-up Immobilized catalysts have been used in membrane reactors and are being investigated for application to continuous flow fixed bed reactors. Applications to synthesis Total synthesis of Diltiazem Adger et al. utilized the biphasic Juli√°‚ÄìColonna epoxidation with immobilized poly-L-leucine (I-PLL) and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP), and 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as the key step in the efficient synthesis of Diltiazem (Figure 6.) Diltiazem is a commercially available pharmaceutical which acts as a calcium channel blocker. Figure 6: The Juli√°‚ÄìColonna Epoxidation has been applied to the Total Synthesis of Diltiazem. Total synthesis of (+)-clausenamide Cappi et al. utilized the Juli√°‚ÄìColonna epoxidation with PEG-immobilized poly-L-leucine (PEG-PLL) and DABCO hydrogen peroxide (DABCO-H2O2) or urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in a miniature fixed-bed continuous flow reactor system (Figure 7.) This protocol was exploited to synthesize (+)-clausenamide as a proof of concept in the development of the novel reaction protocol; (+)-clausenamide exhibits anti-amnesiac and hepatoprotective activity.Cappi, M. W.; Chen, W. P.; Flood, R. W.; Liao, Y. W.; Roberts, S. M.; Skidmore, J.; Smith, J. A.; Williamson, N. M., \\"New procedures for the ‚ÄìColonna asymmetric epoxidation: synthesis of (+)-clausenamide\\". Chem. Comm. 1998, (10), 1159-1160. Figure 7: The Juli√°‚ÄìColonna Epoxidation has been applied to the Total Synthesis of (+)-Clausenamide.  Total synthesis of (+)-goniotriol 7, (+)-goniofufurone 8, (+)-8-acetylgoniotriol 9 and gonio-pypyrone Chen et al. utilized the biphasic Juli√°‚ÄìColonna Epoxidation protocol with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP), poly-L-leucine (PLL), and 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a key step in the synthesis of a family of styryl lactones isolated from Goniothalamus giganteus (Figure 8.) These compounds, including (+)-goniotriol 7, (+)-goniofufurone 8, (+)-8-acetylgoniotriol 9 and gonio-pypyrone, have demonstrated cytotoxic activity against human tumor cells.Chen, W. P.; Roberts, S.

It has gained many regional and national accolades with some individual athletes representing England and Great Britain at junior and senior level. Primarily a running club, the men's team have won every Leicestershire Senior County Cross Country team title since 1995. The club is also known for developing its junior athletes and its distinctive vests (bearing black and white stripes). History The club began as 'Oadby and Wigston Legionnaires' (acronym OWLS) at the Royal British Legion in Wigston in 1981. As it expanded, two sections formed to cater for differing competitive aspirations. A social running club at the original base in Wigston; and a multi-disciplinary athletics club for junior and senior athletes based at Saffron Lane sports centre in Leicester. The two sections made a complete split in 2008 when the Wigston-based section became \\"Wigston Phoenix\\" Running Club, and the Leicester-based section adopting the name Owls AC Leicester. Originally, the club was founded by a trio of Mick Strange, Phil Starmer Geoff Matthews with the aim to compete against other Leicestershire-based clubs. At a later date, Wayne Walker was recruited as coach for a newly formed junior section and led them to many outstanding successes. After over 25 years service to the club he remains the head coach.

On 1990, the park was named as a National Tourism Object by Soesilo Soedarman, the Minister of Tourism, Postal, and Telecommunication at that time. The park used to exhibit two polar bears named Bjurn and Tasha delivered from Adelaide Zoo after a breeding program in 1992. However, Bjurn died on March 31, 2004 while Tasha died on March 30, 2005, both due to old age. The exhibit is now used as a Humboldt penguin exhibit, the polar bears can be seen as a taxidermy in the exhibit. The polar bears was originally came from Ruhr Zoo until they were moved to Adelaide Zoo. On February 2012, Taman Safari saved a Sumatran tiger in Riau, named Bimo. Bimo's body condition was wet with oil, his eyes were open and helpless, it was suspected that Bimo was poisoned. At the time of capture, the male tiger, estimated to be four years old, had a wound on his toenail. After being treated for three days, Bimo has begun to roar, but has not been able to sit normally. So the rescue team decided to take Bimo to the Taman Safari's animal hospital. Bimo's condition gradually improved after receiving intensive care. Although Bimo cannot be released into the wild, Bimo can contribute to the genetic preservation of Sumatran tigers with the Sumatran Tiger Captive Breeding and Genome Resource Bank program conducted by Taman Safari. Now, Bimo's reproductive condition has improved, and currently Bimo has three children named Praja, Binsar, and Bulan from brooders named Cut Nyak. Cut Nyak is a female tiger also originating from the wild, more precisely in Aceh, because it is suspected to be a man eater.https://twitter.com/TSI_Bogor/status/1288350715346169856 On September 2017, Taman Safari introduced two giant pandas named Cai Tao (Ëî°Ê∂õ) and Hu Chun (ËÉ°Êò•).

Their name is derived from the town of Chiprovtsi where their production started in the 17th century. The basic colours are yellow, brown, red, blue and green. The first carpets were in only two colours - red and black. This unique and typically Bulgarian craft flourished during the Bulgarian National Revival. The carpets are made of natural materials like cotton and wool. Their thickness is 3‚Äì5 mm. The kilim making of Chiprovtsi was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage list of UNESCO in 2014. Chiprovtsi carpets collection from Montana, Bulgaria History Museum History Chiprovtsi kilim The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 Chiprovtsi Uprising against Ottoman rule. The western traveller Ami Bou√©, who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836‚Äì1838, reported that \\"mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving. They earn only five francs a month and the payment was even lower before\\". By 1868, the annual production of carpets in Chiprovtsi had surpassed 14,000 square metres.–ö–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞, p. 20. In 1896, almost 1,400 women from Chiprovtsi and the region were engaged in carpet weaving. In 1920, the locals founded the Manual Labour carpet-weaving cooperative society, the first of its kind in the country.–ö–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞, pp. 20‚Äì22. At present. the carpet (kilim) industry remains dominant in the town. Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, but in recent years it is up to the customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the primary material is wool, coloured using plant or mineral dyes. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in London, Paris, Li√®ge and Brussels. In recent decades, however, the Chiprovtsi carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.

Late antiquity Andrew Stephenson describes late antiquity as \\"one of the darkest periods in the history of Christianity\\" characterizing as mingling the evils of \\" worldly ambition, false philosophy, sectarian violence and riotous living.\\" Constantine initially persecuted the Arians but eventually ceased the persecution and declared himself a convert to their theology. Sectarian violence became more frequent and more intense during the reign of Constantius II. When Paul, the orthodox bishop of Constantinople, was banished by imperial decree, a riot broke out that resulted in 3000 deaths. Paul was deposed five times before finally being strangled by imperial decree. Monks in Alexandria were the first to gain a reputation for violence and cruelty. Although less frequent than in Antioch and Constantinople, sectarian disturbances also racked Antioch. At Ephesus, a fight broke out in a council of bishops resulting in one of them being murdered. Gibbon's assessment was that \\"the bonds of civil society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions.\\" Gregory of Nazianzus lamented that the Kingdom of heaven had been converted into the \\"image of hell\\" by religious discord. Athanasius of Alexandria Statue of the saint in St Athanasius' Roman Catholic Church in Evanston, Illinois. There are at present two completely opposite views about the personality of Athanasius. While some scholars praise him as an orthodox saint with great character, others see him as a power-hungry politician who employed questionable ecclesiastical tactics. Richard Rubenstein and Timothy Barnes have painted a less than flattering picture of the saint. One of the allegations against him involves suppression of dissent through violence and murder.Barnes, Timothy D., Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993),37Rubenstein,106 Arianism Following the abortive effort by Julian the Apostate to restore paganism in the empire, the emperor Valens--himself an Arian--renewed the persecution of Nicene hierarchs. However, Valen's successor Theodosius I effectively wiped out Arianism once and for all among the elites of the Eastern Empire through a combination of imperial decree, persecution, and the calling of the Second Ecumenical Council in 381, which condemned Arius anew while reaffirming and expanding the Nicene Creed.See Vasiliev, A.,\\"The Church and the State at the End of the Fourth Century\\", from History of the Byzantine Empire, Chapter One. Retrieved on 2010-02-02. The text of this version of the Nicene Creed This generally ended the influence of Arianism among the non-Germanic peoples of the Roman Empire. Circumcellions The Circumcellions were fanatical bands of predatory peasants that flourished in North Africa in the 4th century.\\"Circumcellions.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 At first they were concerned with remedying social grievances, but they became linked with the Donatist sect. They condemned property and slavery, and advocated canceling debts and freeing slaves. Donatists prized martyrdom and had a special devotion for the martyrs, rendering honours to their graves. The Circumcellions had come to regard martyrdom as the true Christian virtue, and thus disagreed with the Episcopal see of Carthage on the primacy of chastity, sobriety, humility, and charity. Instead, they focused on bringing about their own martyrdom‚Äîby any means possible. They survived until the fourth century in Africa, when their desire for martyrdom was fulfilled due to persecution. Council of Chalcedon In 451, Pope Leo I urged Anatolius to convene an ecumenical council in order to set aside the 449 Second Council of Ephesus, better known as the \\"Robber Council\\". The Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries.The acts of the Council of Chalcedon by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 , pages 1-5 Severus of Antioch is said to have stirred up a fierce religious war among the population of Alexandria, resulting in bloodshed and conflagrations (Labbe, v. 121). To escape punishment for this violence, he fled to Constantinople, supported by a band of two hundred Non-Chalcedonian monks. Anastasius, who succeeded Zeno as emperor in 491, was a professed Non-Chalcedonian, and received Severus with honor. His presence initiated a period of fighting in Constantinople between rival bands of monks, Chalcedonian and Non, which ended in AD 511 with the humiliation of Anastasius, the temporary triumph of the patriarch Macedonius II, and the reversal of the Non-Chalcedonian cause (Theophanes, p. 132). At the Council of Constantinople in 518, Syrian monks placed the responsibility for the slaughter of 350 Chalcedonian monks and the appropriation of church vessels on Severus' shoulders. The associated theological disputes, political rivalry, and sectarian violence produced a schism that persists to this day between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches. France Albigensian Crusade Jonathan Barker cited the Albigensian Crusade, launched by Pope Innocent III against followers of Catharism, as an example of Christian state terrorism. The 20-year war led to an estimated one million casualties. The Cathar teachings rejected the principles of material wealth and power as being in direct conflict with the principle of love. They worshiped in private houses rather than churches, without the sacraments or the cross, which they rejected as part of the world of matter, and sexual intercourse was considered sinful, but in other respects they followed conventional teachings, reciting the Lord's prayer and reading from Biblical scriptures. They believed that the Saviour was a \\"heavenly being merely masquerading as human to bring salvation to the elect, who often have to conceal themselves from the world, and who are set apart by their special knowledge and personal purity\\". Cathars rejected the Old Testament and its God, whom they named Rex Mundi (Latin for \\"king of the world\\"), whom they saw as a blind usurper who demanded fearful obedience and worship and who, under the most false pretexts, tormented and murdered those whom he called \\"his children\\" They proclaimed that there was a higher God‚Äîthe True God‚Äîand Jesus was his messenger. They held that the physical world was evil and created by Rex Mundi, who encompassed all that was corporeal, chaotic and powerful; the second god, the one whom they worshipped, was entirely disincarnate: a being or principle of pure spirit and completely unsullied by the taint of matter ‚Äì He was the god of love, order and peace.See Catharism and Catharism#Theology According to Barker, the Albigenses had developed a culture that \\"fostered tolerance of Jews and Muslims, respect for women and women priests, the appreciation of poetry, music and beauty, [had it] been allowed to survive and thrive, it is possible the Europe might have been spared its wars of religion, its witch-hunts and its holocausts of victims sacrificed in later centuries to religious and ideological bigotry\\". When asked by his followers how to differentiate between heretics and the ordinary public, Abbe Arnaud Amalric, head of the Cistercian monastic order, simply said \\"Kill them all, God will recognize his own!\\". Catholic‚ÄìProtestant Historically, some Catholic countries once persecuted Protestants as heretics. For example, the substantial Protestant population of France (the Huguenots) was expelled from the kingdom in the 1680s following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In Spain, the Inquisition sought to root out not only Protestantism but also crypto-Jews and crypto-Muslims (moriscos); elsewhere the Papal Inquisition held similar goals. In most places where Protestantism is the majority or \\"official\\" religion, there have been examples of Catholics being persecuted. In countries where the Reformation was successful, this often lay in the perception that Catholics retained allegiance to a 'foreign' power (the Papacy), causing them to be regarded with suspicion. Sometimes this mistrust manifested itself in Catholics being subjected to restrictions and discrimination, which itself led to further conflict. For example, before Catholic Emancipation in 1829, Catholics were forbidden from voting, becoming MPs or buying land in Ireland. , bigotry and discrimination in employment are usually restricted to a few places where extreme forms of religion are the norm, or in areas with a long history of sectarian violence and tension, such as Northern Ireland (especially in terms of employment; however, this is dying out in this jurisdiction, thanks to strictly-enforced legislation. Reverse discrimination now takes place in terms of employment quotas which are now applied). In places where more \\"moderate\\" forms of Protestantism (such as Anglicanism or Episcopalianism) prevail, the two traditions do not become polarized against each other, and usually co- exist peacefully. Especially in England, sectarianism is nowadays almost unheard of. However, in Western Scotland (where Calvinism and Presbyterianism are the norm) sectarian divisions can still sometimes arise between Catholics and Protestants. In the early years following the Scottish Reformation there was internal sectarian tension between Church of Scotland Presbyterians and 'High Church' Anglicans, the former regarding the latter as having retained too many attitudes and practices from the pre-Reformation Catholic era. European wars of religion The Battle of the White Mountain in Bohemia (1620)‚Äîone of the decisive battles of the Thirty Years War Following the onset of the Protestant Reformation, a series of wars were waged in Europe starting circa 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to Miroslav Volf, the European wars of religion were a major factor behind the \\"emergence of secularizing modernity\\". Netherlands The Low Countries have a particular history of religious conflict which had its roots in the Calvinist reformation movement of the 1560s. These conflicts became known as the Dutch Revolt or the Eighty Years' War. By dynastic inheritance, the whole of the Netherlands (including present day Belgium) had come to be ruled by the kings of Spain. Following aggressive Calvinist preaching in and around the rich merchant cities of the southern Netherlands, organized anti-Catholic religious protests grew in violence and frequency. Repression by the Catholic Spaniards in response caused Dutch Calvinists to rebel, sparking devades of war until the Dutch Republic won its independence from Spain. France The French Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì98) is the name given to a period of civil infighting and military operations, primarily fought between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources. The Massacre of Vassy in 1562 is generally considered to be the beginning of the Wars of Religion and the Edict of Nantes at least ended this series of conflicts. During this time, complex diplomatic negotiations and agreements of peace were followed by renewed conflict and power struggles. At the conclusion of the conflict in 1598, Huguenots were granted substantial rights and freedoms by the Edict of Nantes, though it did not end hostility towards them. The wars weakened the authority of the monarchy, already fragile under the rule of Francis II and then Charles IX, though it later reaffirmed its role under Henry IV. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations, followed by a wave of Roman Catholic mob violence, both directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants), during the French Wars of Religion. The massacre began two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. Starting on 23 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle) with murders on orders of the king of a group of Huguenot leaders including Coligny, the massacres spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre extended to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead vary widely between 5,000 and 30,000 in total. The massacre also marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re- conversions by the rank and file, and those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it \\"was the worst of the century's religious massacres.\\"H.G. Koenigsberger, George L.Mosse, G.Q. Bowler, \\"Europe in the Sixteenth Century\\", Second Edition, Longman, 1989 Throughout Europe, it \\"printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion\\". & Evans, G.R. (1987), Atlas of the Christian Church, Macmillan, London, hardback, pp. 113; Pope Gregory XIII sent the leader of the massacres a Golden Rose, and said that the massacres \\"gave him more pleasure than fifty Battles of Lepanto, and he commissioned Vasari to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican\\". The killings have been called \\"the worst of the century's religious massacres\\", and led to the start of the fourth war of the French Wars of Religion. Ireland :See also: The Troubles, demographics and politics of Northern Ireland Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. Northern Ireland has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for absentee landlords, aspiring politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late eighteenth century (See 'Two Hundred Years in the Citadel') This has been particularly intense in Northern Ireland since the 17th century. There are records of religious ministers or clerics, politicians, and members of the landed gentry stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late eighteenth century. William Edward Hartpole Lecky, an Irish historian, wrote \\"If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland\\". Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, 1649-53 Lutz and Lutz cited the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland as terrorism; \\"The draconian laws applied by Oliver Cromwell in Ireland were an early version of ethnic cleansing. The Catholic Irish were to be expelled to the northwestern areas of the island. Relocation rather than extermination was the goal.\\" Daniel Chirot has argued that genocide was originally the goal, inspired by the Biblical account of Joshua and the genocide following the Battle of Jericho: Northern Ireland Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote \\"The Northern Ireland conflict is a religious conflict. Economic and social considerations are also crucial, but it was the fact that the competing populations in Ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality\\". Reviewers agreed \\"Of course the Northern Ireland conflict is at heart religious\\". John Hickey wrote \\"Politics in the North is not politics exploiting religion. That is far too simple an explanation: it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use. In the case of Northern Ireland the relationship is much more complex. It is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion. It is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth‚Äëcentury England than to the last quarter of twentieth century Britain\\". The period from 1969 to 2002 is known as \\"The Troubles\\". Nearly all the people living in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to either the Protestant or the Catholic community. People of no religion and non-Christian faiths are still considered as belonging to one of the two \\"sects\\" along with churchgoers. In this context, \\"Protestants\\" means essentially descendants of immigrants from Scotland and England settled in Ulster during or soon after the 1690s; also known as \\"Loyalists\\" or \\"Unionist\\" because they generally support politically the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom. \\"Catholics\\" means descendants of the pre-1690 indigenous Irish population; also known as \\"Nationalist\\" and \\"Republicans\\"; who generally politically favour a united Ireland. Reactions to sectarian domination and abuse have resulted in accusations of sectarianism being levelled against the minority community. It has been argued, however, that those reactions would be better understood in terms of a struggle against the sectarianism that governs relations between the two communities and which has resulted in the denial of human rights to the minority community.Mulholland, P. (1999) Drumcree: A Struggle for Recognition There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The Corrymeela Community of Ballycastle operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The Ulster Project works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, non-denominational environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities. Northern Ireland has introduced a Private Day of Reflection,Day of Reflection : Ireland since 2007, to mark the transition to a post-[sectarian] conflict society, an initiative of the cross-community Healing through RememberingHealing through Remembering : Ireland organisation and research project. United Kingdom Saint Thomas More The Act of Supremacy of 1534 declared the English crown to be 'the only supreme head on earth of the Church in England' in place of the pope. Any act of allegiance to the latter was considered treasonous because the papacy claimed both spiritual and political power over its followers. It was under this act that saints Thomas More and John Fisher were executed and became martyrs to the Catholic faith. The Act of Supremacy (which asserted England's independence from papal authority) was repealed in 1554 by Henry's daughter Queen Mary I (who was a devout Catholic) when she reinstituted Catholicism as England's state religion. Another Act of Supremacy was passed in 1559 under Elizabeth I, along with an Act of Uniformity which made worship in the Church of England compulsory. Anyone who took office in the English church or government was required to take the Oath of Supremacy; penalties for violating it included hanging and quartering. Attendance at Anglican services became obligatory‚Äîthose who refused to attend Anglican services, whether Roman Catholics or Protestants (Puritans), were fined and physically punished as recusants. In the time of Elizabeth I, the persecution of the adherents of the Reformed religion, both Anglicans and Protestants alike, which had occurred during the reign of her elder half- sister Queen Mary I, was used to fuel strong anti-Catholic propaganda in the hugely influential Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Those who had died in Mary's reign, under the Marian Persecutions, were effectively canonised by this work of hagiography. In 1571 the Convocation of the Church of England ordered that copies of the Book of Martyrs should be kept for public inspection in all cathedrals and in the houses of church dignitaries. The book was also displayed in many Anglican parish churches alongside the Holy Bible. The passionate intensity of its style and its vivid and picturesque dialogues made the book very popular among Puritan and Low Church families, Anglican and Protestant nonconformist, down to the nineteenth century. In a period of extreme partisanship on all sides of the religious debate, the exaggeratedly partisan church history of the earlier portion of the book, with its grotesque stories of popes and monks, contributed to fuel anti-Catholic prejudices in England, as did the story of the sufferings of several hundred Reformers (both Anglican and Protestant) who had been burnt at the stake under Mary and Bishop Bonner. Anti-Catholicism among many of the English was grounded in the fear that the pope sought to reimpose not just religio-spiritual authority over England but also secular power in the country; this was seemingly confirmed by various actions by the Vatican. In 1570, Pope Pius V sought to depose Elizabeth with the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which declared her a heretic and purported to dissolve the duty of all Elizabeth's subjects of their allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth's subjects who persisted in their allegiance to the Catholic Church politically suspect, and made the position of her Catholic subjects largely untenable if they tried to maintain both allegiances at once. Elizabeth's persecution of Catholic Jesuit missionaries led to the executions of many priests such as Edmund Campion. Although at the time of their deaths, they were considered traitors to England, they are now considered martyrs by the Catholic Church. Later several accusations fueled strong anti-Catholicism in England, including the Gunpowder Plot, in which Guy Fawkes and other Catholic conspirators where accused of planning to blow up the English Parliament while it was in session. Glasgow, Scotland Sectarianism in Glasgow takes the form of religious and political sectarian rivalry between Roman Catholics and Protestants. It is reinforced by the Old Firm rivalry between the football clubs: Rangers F.C. and Celtic F.C. Members of the public appear divided on the strength of the relationship between football and sectarianism. United States Anti- Catholicism Anti-Catholicism reached a peak in the mid nineteenth century when Protestant leaders became alarmed by the heavy influx of Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Some believed that the Catholic Church was the Whore of Babylon in the Book of Revelation. In the 1830s and 1840s, prominent Protestant leaders, such as Lyman Beecher and Horace Bushnell, attacked the Catholic Church as not only theologically unsound but an enemy of republican values. Some scholars view the anti-Catholic rhetoric of Beecher and Bushnell as having contributed to anti-Irish and anti-Catholic mob violence. Beecher's well-known \\"Plea for the West\\" (1835) urged Protestants to exclude Catholics from western settlements. The Catholic Church's official silence on the subject of slavery also garnered the enmity of northern Protestants. Intolerance became more than an attitude on 11 August 1834, when a mob set fire to an Ursuline convent in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The resulting \\"nativist\\" movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, was whipped into a frenzy of anti-Catholicism that led to mob violence, the burning of Catholic property, and the killing of Catholics. This violence was fed by claims that Catholics were destroying the culture of the United States. Irish Catholic immigrants were blamed for spreading violence and drunkness. In the late nineteenth century southern United States evangelical Protestants used a wide range of terror activities, including lynching, murder, attempted murder, rape, beating, tar-and-feathering, whipping, and destruction of property, to suppress competition from black Christians (who saw Christ as the saviour of the black oppressed), Mormons, Native Americans, foreign-born immigrants, Jews, and Catholics. Mormonism Early Mormon history is marred by many instances of violent persecution, which has helped shape the faith's views toward violence. The first significant violent persecution occurred in Missouri. Mormons tended to vote as a bloc there, wielding \\"considerable political and economic influence,\\" often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities. These differences culminated in the Missouri Mormon War and the eventual issuing of an executive order (since called the extermination order within the LDS community) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs, which declared that \\"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\\" Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The extermination order was not formally rescinded until 1976. In Nauvoo, Illinois, persecutions were often based on the alleged tendency of Mormons to \\"dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they landed.\\" The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the Nauvoo Legion (the Mormon militia) continued to grow. Other issues of contention included plural marriage, freedom of speech, the anti-slavery views expressed by Smith during his 1844 presidential campaign, and Smith's teachings on the deification of man. After the destruction of the press of the Nauvoo Expositor, Smith was arrested and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The persecution in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846. Even after Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in Utah Territory convinced U.S. President James Buchanan that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States; critics pointed to the Mountain Meadows massacre and plural marriage as signs of the rebellion. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the American standing army in 1857 to Utah in what is known as the Utah War. The Mountain Meadows massacre of September 11, 1857 was widely blamed on the church's teachings of blood atonement and other anti-United States rhetoric by LDS Church leaders during the Utah War. The widely publicized massacre was a mass killing of Arkansan emigrants by a Mormon militia led by prominent Mormon leader John D. Lee, who was later executed for his role in the killings. After escalating rumors that some of the emigrants had participated in early Mormon persecution, the militia conducted a siege, and when the emigrants surrendered, the militia killed men, women, and children in cold blood, adopted some of the surviving children, and attempted a cover-up. Though widely connected with the blood atonement doctrine by the United States press and general public, there is no direct evidence that the massacre was related to \\"saving\\" the emigrants by the shedding of their blood (as they had not entered into Mormon covenants); rather, most commentators view it as an act of intended retribution. Young was accused of either directing the massacre, or with complicity after the fact. However, when Brigham Young was interviewed on the matter and asked if he believed in blood atonement, he replied, \\"I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime.\\" He said \\"we believe that execution should be done by the shedding of blood instead of by hanging,\\" but only \\"according to the laws of the land\\". An example used by some to illustrate the alleged practice blood atonement is the 1866 murder of the former slave Thomas Coleman (or Colburn), who was in good standing as a member of the LDS Church. As Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn has documented, Coleman was apparently secretly courting a white Mormon woman. The two were discovered together behind the old Arsenal (on what is now Capitol Hill in Salt Lake) on December 11 and the group hit Coleman with a large rock. Using his own bowie knife, his attackers slit his throat so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, as well as slicing open his right breast, in what some believe was a mimicry of penalties illustrated in the temple ritual. Not all of Coleman's wounds correlated with the temple ritual, however, since he was also castrated. A pre-penciled placard was then pinned to his corpse stating, \\"NOTICE TO ALL NIGGERS - TAKE WARNING - LEAVE WHITE WOMEN ALONE.\\" A grave was dug and Coleman's body was buried less than three hours after its discovery. Less than twelve hours after that, Judge Elias Smith, first cousin of Joseph Smith, appointed George Stringham (a Mormon ruffian and vigilante with ties to Porter Rockwell, Jason Luce, and William Hickman) as the foreman of the Coroner's Jury; they briefly met and summarily dismissed the case as a crime that was committed either by a person or by persons unknown to the jury, ending all official inquiry into the murder.Quinn, Extensions of Power, p. 256 and Daily Union Vedette, 15 December 1866. It has been suggested that the ritualistic elements involved in the execution of Coleman's murder may have been in response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, ‚ÄúI am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.‚Äù Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, \\"Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.\\" Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, ‚Äúfor their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.‚Äù Young also declares that he is ‚Äúneither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man‚Äù but that if he had to choose, he would ‚Äúbe against the pro-slavery side of the question.‚Äù With regard to Coleman's murder, LDS apologists point out that the practice of \\"blood atonement\\" is said to apply to endowed Mormons who apostatized. Coleman was a member in good standing and was not endowed, suggesting that his death may have actually been the result of racism. One of the examples cited by critics of the church is a set of murders in Springville, Utah of individuals who, according to historical documents and court records, were \\"very questionable characters.\\" Judge Elias Smith stated in regard to the case: \\"We have carefully examined all the evidence furnished by a remarkably accurate stenographic reporter, and can only conclude that evidence before the court goes to show' that Durfee, Potter and two of the Parrishes got into a row about matters best, if not only, known to themselves, and for that Potter and two Parrishes were killed.\\"Records published in the Deseret News, April 6th, 1859 20th century Branford Clarke illustration in The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy 1925 by Bishop Alma Whitepublished by the Pillar of Fire Church in Zarephath, NJ The Good Citizen Nov 1926 Published by Pillar of Fire Church At the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one- sixth of the population of the United States was Roman Catholic. Anti- Catholicism was widespread in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.Dumenil (1991) With the rise of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the 1920s, anti-Catholic rhetoric intensified. The Catholic Church of the Little Flower was first built in 1925 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a largely Protestant area. Two weeks after it opened, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of the church. Canada Australia Sectarianism in Australia is a historical legacy from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Catholic- Orthodox Crusades Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading Seljuq Turks from Anatolia, one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to \\"further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other.\\" Map showing Constantinople and its walls during the Byzantine era The Massacre of the Latins occurred in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, in 1182. It was a large-scale massacre of the \\"Latin\\" (Roman Catholic) merchants and their families, who at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at over 60,000 at the time, was wiped out or forced to flee. The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the Turks. The Siege of Constantinople (also called the Fourth Crusade) occurred in 1204; it destroyed parts of the capital of the Byzantine Empire as it was confiscated by Western European and Venetian Crusaders. After the fall, the Crusaders inflicted a savage sacking on the city for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared.  Yugoslav wars  The Yugoslav wars are sometimes labelled as religious sectarian conflicts, which is disputed in academia. They were primarily interethnic wars between several states which seceded from Yugoslavia prior to the wars. Croats and Slovenes have traditionally been Catholic, Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians Eastern Orthodox, and Bosniaks and most Albanians Sunni Muslim. Although the conflict did not start or was caused by religious differences, religious affiliations served as a marker of group identity to some degree during it, despite relatively low rates of religious practice and belief among these various groups after decades of communist rule in formally secular and irreligious Yugoslavia.

This gave him the idea of building some sort of structure from these. He gathered up five truckloads of these discarded pallets and began building a tower structure in his backyard. The bee hive cone-shaped tower of some 2000 wooden pallets had a base of and ultimately rose to over twenty feet in height when finished. Van Meter's Tower of Pallets sat on the gravesite of a child buried in 1869.Richard Simon, \\"L.A.'s Pallet Pile\\", The Washington Post, March 30, 1988, c.04: \\"Van Meter, who says he is a descendant of John Quincy Adams, has been interested in history since he began picking up coins and artifacts as a child. A lifelong bachelor who has held odd jobs, he is a founder of the American Independent Party and was a supporter of former Alabama governor George Wallace's 1972 presidential campaign. Van Meter loves to talk politics. His first love appears to be collecting historical memorabilia, but his most unusual item is the tower. Constructed by Van Meter in 1951, the 22-foot-tall tower is made up of about 2,000 wooden pallets that were tossed out by a brewery. The pallets are placed in a 22-foot-wide circle and stacked on top of each other in bricklike fashion. Beneath the structure is the grave of a child buried in 1869.\\" It took Van Meter several weeks to build the wooden tower of pallets. The top had an opening that was thirteen feet across. The \\"room\\" inside contained outdoor patio furniture. In 1953, Los Angeles county building inspectors were baffled as to how to classify Van Meter's innovation. They ultimately decided it was a wooden \\"fence\\". No further regulatory action was taken for over twenty years and the building department left him alone, along with his \\"folk art\\" innovation, until 1977. In that year the city fire department declared his creation \\"an illegally stacked lumber pile.\\" He was instructed to tear it down. Van Meter, using some imagination, convinced the Cultural Heritage Commission and the city of Los Angeles to designate his creation a Historic Cultural Monument.\\"Tower Under Legal Siege\\", Daily News of Los Angeles, April 7, 1996: \\"Daniel Van Meter pieced together his backyard tower from discarded wooden pallets back in 1951, and he has spent 45 years tending the ersatz shrine while fighting off city fire marshals and land-hungry developers. Largely waging the struggle alone, Van Meter got some help in 1978 when the city's Cultural Heritage Board deemed the \\"Tower of Wooden Pallets\\" in Sherman Oaks a historical monument.\\" It was declared then as HCM Monument No. 184 in 1978.\\"Does It Stack Up as Art?\\" Los Angeles Times Jan 26, 2005 This designation protected Van Meter's pile of pallets until he died or moved. Later, then-commissioner Robert W.

He received early musical lessons from the parish organist but left his home at the age of sixteen to enroll in the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm. He was appointed organist in the Stockholm parish of Maria Magdalena in 1777 and moved to Jakob parish in 1792. In addition to his professional life as a musician, he took a clerk's position in Krigskollegium (the War Office), where in 1805 he reached the position of krigsr√•d (\\"War Councillor\\"). He retired from his position in Krigskollegium in 1824, but stayed as organist in Jakob until his death eleven years later.Lindberg (1922), column 945 His own compositions include a large number of songs, among them many poems by Anna Maria Lenngren, who was his sister-in- law, that he had set to music. These were published in several parts of Skalde-stycken satte i musik (1794‚Äì1823). He also composed a number of chorales, a cantata, fourteen sonatas, and an opera, Frigga (1787).Lindberg (1922), column 945; LIBRIS entry for Skalde-stycken satte i musik In 1788, √Öhlstr√∂m established Musikaliska Tryckeriet, the first larger-scale musical printing press in Sweden, and received a 20-year exclusive royal privilege for the engraving and printing of sheet music; anyone encroaching on his monopoly was to be fined 100 riksdaler. He introduced a new method of printing the sheets with types made from pewter with a small portion of lead. The method was cheaper than the copperplates previously used for the printing of music in Sweden, but was criticized for producing dark and dirty prints.Bystr√∂m, p. 46 The production of his press included compositions by Johan Wikmanson; Traditioner af swenska folk-dansar, folk dances collected and written down by √Öhlstr√∂m together with the folklore scholar Arvid August Afzelius; and fifteen parts of Musikaliskt tidsf√∂rdrif, a collection of pieces popular at the time, mostly for piano or song accompanied by piano.Lindberg (1922), column 945; LIBRIS entries for: Traditioner af swenska folk-dansar, Musikaliskt tidsf√∂rdrif √Öhlstr√∂m also published the first edition of Carl Michael Bellman's song cycle Fredman's Epistles (1790) in collaboration with Bellman himself and the poet Johan Henrik Kellgren, who wrote an introduction and edited the song texts. √Öhlstr√∂m made arrangements of the songs for piano. It was followed in 1791 by Fredman's Songs, a collection of songs by Bellman not included among the Epistles. The relative influence of Kellgren and √Öhlstr√∂m over the final edition of both collections of songs, compared to that of the author, is a complex and partly unresolvable issue.For a recent treatment and a summary of earlier research, see the 1990 critical edition of the Epistles by Gunnar Hillbom (text) & James Massengale (music), in particular Hillbom's introduction, \\"Fredmans epistlar 1790 och 1990\\", in vol. 2, pp. 111-152 (which covers √Öhlstr√∂m's and Kellgren's collaboration with Bellman on the first edition and its prehistory). The corresponding work on the Fredman's Songs is the 1992 edition by Hillbom and Massengale.

The van Meters first owned a ranch in the 2100 block of West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles with his brothers. There they raised goats, chickens, turkeys and rabbits.(Site of) The Tower of Wooden Pallets Van Meter later lived in Sherman Oaks, California near the Sepulveda Dam Recreational Area. He purchased property there in 1947 and by 1988 was the only house left on the block. The area had been fully developed into condominium complexes, a fire station, a private school and office buildings. Van Meter and his brothers had turned the property into a type of junkyard. On the property among a collection of small farm animals was historical memorabilia, including a dozen scrapped cars, a gas pump registering gas at 24.9 cents a gallon, a 1938 city bus, and old wooden wagons. He was once called to a murder trial as a witness because he found what was left of the victim while going through a trash bin in search of cardboard boxes. He always claimed that 'if it weren't for eccentric people like him gathering junk, there wouldn't be any need for museums.'Los Angeles Times; Feb 19, 1988, p. 3 Van Meter's \\"Tower of Wooden Pallets\\"  Tower of Pallets  Van Meter is noted for his pile of discarded wooden pallets from a beer company. In 1951 when the local beer company had a labor dispute they wished to get rid of thousands of broken-down used wooden pallets. Van Meter said he would take a \\"few\\" off their hands if they would deliver them to his property. Five truckloads of the pallets showed up. He decided he had to do something with them, so contrived a wooden pallet tower structure. The 3 foot by 3 foot 6-inch-thick pallets soon became a structure over 20-feet high. It was 22 feet at the base and built in a circle. It took him just a few weeks to construct on his property and was over the grave site of an unknown three-year-old Native American child. The Tower of Wooden Pallets was designated a historic- cultural monument, which had the same rights and recognition as the Hollywood Sign, the Watts Towers, and the cruise ship Catalina. Van Meter enjoyed his special \\"dwelling\\" as a hangout to get away from the frenzy of urban society and claimed his tower of some 2,000 rejected broken-down wooden beer pallets surrounded a \\"Tree of Heaven.\\"Chicago Tribune, Feb 2, 2005, p. 23.

It is one of several Watsonia species known as wild watsonia. It is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, but it is well known as an ornamental plant grown in gardens for its showy spikes of flowers and an invasive species in areas where it has escaped cultivation. It is a perennial herb growing from a fibrous-coated corm and growing to a maximum height well over one meter when in flower, sometimes reaching two meters. Each corm produces three or four erect, lance-shaped leaves that measure up to 60 centimeters long by 6 wide. They have thickened midribs and margins. The inflorescence is an open spike of 8 to 25 flowers which may be any most any shade of orange to reddish or purplish. The flower is up to 8 centimeters long with a long, tubular throat and spreading tepals. The flowers sometimes yield capsule fruits which contain seed, but the plant often reproduces via bulbils (strictly speaking, cormlets) that form in clusters in the axils of bracts at nodes along the peduncle. The bulbils can sprout if dropped into the soil, sometimes forming dense colonies, as can sections of corm that are chopped and dispersed by plowing or by non-intensive feeding by root-eating animals. The plant is accordingly ecologically valuable as feed to local mole-rats (Cryptomys and Georychus species) and to Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) Like some other Watsonia, this species can take hold in the wild as a weedy introduced species in appropriate climates. It can be found along the southern coast of Australia, in New Zealand, and on the North Coast of California.Weeds of AustraliaJepson Manual Treatment The plant forms dense colonies that crowd other plant species from the land where mole-rats, porcupines and similar herbivores do not occur.California IPC References Category:Iridaceae Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces Category:Taxa named by Philip Miller ","title":"Watsonia meriana"},{"id":"29887993","text":"Das Taublatt is a triannual German-language periodical based in Bochum and the official publication of Gesellschaft f√ºr fleischfressende Pflanzen im deutschsprachigen Raum, a carnivorous plant society based in Germany.Rice, B. 2010.

After the conquest of Mexico, cocoa as a commodity travelled by boat from the port of Nueva Espa√±a to the Spanish coast. The first such voyage to Europe occurred at an unknown date in the 1520s. However it was only in the 17th century that regular trade began from the port of Veracruz, opening a maritime trade route that would supply the new demand from Spain, and later from other European countries.William H. Prescott (1860), History of the Conquest of Mexico, Boughton Press. In contrast to other new culinary ingredients brought from The Americas, the acceptance and growth in popularity of chocolate in Spain was rapid, reaching its peak at the end of the 16th century.Domingo, Xavier (1992), El Sabor de Espa√±a, Barcelona, Tusquets, p. 202. Although chocolate was not immediately adopted by other European societies, it eventually made its way to becoming a high commodity. Once the Europeans realised the societal value of chocolate, they started to incorporate it more into their diet. From the early stages, the cocoa was sweetened with sugar cane, which the Spanish were the first to popularise in Europe. In pre-Columbus America chocolate was flavoured with peppers and was a mixture of both bitter and spicy flavours. This made it an acquired taste and limited its appeal to the Spanish conquistadors, who were soon encouraged to sweeten it with sugar brought from the Iberian Peninsula in addition to heating it. Over a 100-year period since its first appearance in the ports of Andalusia, chocolate became popular as a drink in Spain, where it was served to the Spanish monarchy. However, for a time the formula was unknown in the rest of Europe. Later, chocolate spread from Spain to the rest of Europe, with the first countries to adopt it being Italy and France. The great popularity of the drink in Spanish society from that time until the 19th century is attested to in various reports written by travellers who visited the Iberian peninsula. It was said that \\"chocolate is to the Spanish what tea is to the English\\".Graciela Ascarrunz De Gilman; Marian Zwerling Sugano (1984), Horizontes culturales y literarios, p. 63. In this way chocolate was converted into a national symbol.√Ångel Muro (1890), El Practic√≥n, Madrid The unusual fondness for this drink meant that coffee remained relatively unpopular in Spain compared to other European countries.Carrie Evangeline Farnham (1921), American travellers in Spain: The Spanish inns, 1776‚Äì1867, Columbia University Press. In Spain, chocolate was exclusively considered a refreshing drink, and it was rarely used in other ways‚Äîthough there are older Spanish dishes that use cocoa. After the Spanish Civil War the custom declined in favour of coffee consumption.Rosario Garc√≠a Cruz (2000),Spanish companies in international markets, ESIC Editorial, p. 186. In modern Spain, traces of the history of the drink can be seen in the chocolate companies, the chocolate shops and museums. The Spanish also mixed their sugared chocolate drink with milk, just as coffee is mixed with milk. Other ways the Spanish served chocolate was in its natural candy (dulce) drop or ‚Äúcluster‚Äù form which is naturally occurring due to its high cocoa butter content.  Pre-Columbian era  Mayan writing referring to cocoa The Mesoamerican origin of the cacao tree (to which Linnaeus gave the scientific name Theobroma cacao in 1753) is disputed by modern botanical historiansKenneth F. Kiple (2000), ¬´Cacao¬ª, The Cambridge World History of food, Cambridge University Press, Volume I, section III.e. since there are different hypotheses about the region from which it comes. Thus, some theories point to the Amazon region;Louis Grivetti, Howard-Yana Shapiro (2009),Chocolate: History, Culture, and Heritage, Willey. however, it is estimated that the plant also grew in the wild in other parts of Americas, including the plains of the Orinoco Basin. It is very likely that the Olmecs knew the cacao plant, in 1000 BC and transmit its use and cultivation to the Mayans,Bogin, B. (1997),The evolution of human nutrition. The Anthropology of Medicine: From Culture to Method,Romanucci-Ross, L., Moerman, D. E. & Tancredi, L. R eds., Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT, pp. 98-142. who were the first to describe cocoa in their hieroglyphics. There is some link between the blood of human sacrifice and the intake of cocoa, and samples found in Mayan tombs strongly imply that the drink was common in the noble classes. The role played in religious ceremonies was explained by Diego de Landa, in his book List of Yucatan things.  As currency  The chronicles of the Spanish conquistadors contain numerous mentions of its use by the Aztecs as a form of currency, which used the Aztec vigesimal system the use of which was widespread. There were specific names, such as the countles consisting of four cocoa beans, the xiquipil consisting of twenty countles and the \\"burden,\\" which included three xiquipiles. In his Historia general y natural de las Indias (1535, expanded in 1851 from his previously unpublished papers), Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s noted: Cocoa was also valued in other contexts such as religious rituals, marital rituals or as medicine (alone or mixed with other plants) as well as being a nutritious food. The widely held belief that it was \\"a gift from the gods\\" gave it appeal in pre-Columbian societies as a symbol of economic well-being. Its use as a currency was mostly in the payment of taxes to the powerful.  The age of discovery  Cacao beans, which the Spanish thought similar in appearance to almonds.Ren√© F. Millon (1955), When Money Grew on Trees. A Study of Cacao in Ancient Mesoamerica, Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Columbia University. The discovery of new foods or preparation methods went through several stages of understanding.Claude L√©vi-Strauss (1964), Le Cru et le cuit, Par√≠s. Firstly cocoa was understood as a food and later as a pleasant taste. The latter was only possible through adapting the food to flavours previously known. It is in these first encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with cocoa that we can see that the preparation stage was adapted, it was sweetened and flavoured with other spices such as cinnamon and served warm. After that they had a better understanding of the value of chocolate.Rafael Montal Montesa (1999), El chocolate ¬´Las semillas de oro¬ª, Government of Arag√≥n Those three simple changes distinguished the chocolate consumed by the Spanish colonisers from the chocolate consumed by the natives. The same pattern occurs in other foods enjoyed at the time by the natives and Spanish.John Germov, Lauren Williams (1999), A sociology of Food and Nutrition, Oxford University Press. although none of those had an acceptance and a global demand in proportion similar to that of chocolate.  Columbus' first encounter  The navigator Christopher Columbus, with the economic backing of the Catholic Monarchs, first reached the shores of the New World on 12 October 1492, initially believing that he had reached India. This voyage was carried out to expand markets by establishing new trade routes and therefore rival the Portuguese Empire, which was already well established in Asia. Following the success of that first voyage to the New World, others were organised with the intention of exploring and creating new trade routes.Sophie D. Coe, Michael D. Coe (1996), The true History of Chocolate, Thames & Hudson. On his fourth voyage, Columbus, in 1502, met an unexpected storm and was forced to temporarily land on 15 August on the Bay Islands. In their first explorations of the area, Columbus' group came upon a boat of Mayan origin travelling from the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Spaniards were surprised by the large size of the vessel. Columbus detained the vessel and examined the cargo, which contained cocoa beans that he called almonds in his diary. However, he did not attach importance to these, and after this original inspection he let the boat proceed with its cargo.Alfred M. Tozzer (1941), ¬´Landa's Relaci√≥n de las Cosas de Yucat√°n¬ª, Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, 18, Harvard University, Cambridge Mass. In the later period from 1517 to 1519, the Spanish conquistadors Bernal D√≠az del Castillo (who referred to the use of cocoa by Aztecs in his book Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a) and Hern√°n Cort√©s both tried the drink and found it to have both bitter and spicy tastes due to the use of achiote. On occasions cornmeal and hallucinogenic mushrooms were also added to the drink.Xavier Castro (2001), ¬´Chocolate y Ayuno¬ª, in Ayunos y Yantares, Madrid, chapter 3. Thereafter the Spaniards knew that cocoa beans were considered legal tender by the locals. Fray Toribio de Benavente (nicknamed Motolin√≠a) mentioned the existence of cocoa in his works such as Memorias or Libro de Cosas de la Nueva Espa√±a o de los naturales de ella.  Encounters in New Spain  After the conquest of Mexico, the Aztec emperor, Montezuma, offered Hern√°n Cort√©s and his companions fifty jars of foaming chocolate. According to the account of Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, the great emperor had a stockpile of several thousand 'charges' (tens of thousands of cocoa \\"kernels\\").Francisco Cervantes de Salazar (1936), Cr√≥nicas de Nueva Espa√±a, M√©xico, 2 Vols., Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a y Etnograf√≠a, Vol 2:107 The Italian Girolamo Benzoni in his book La Historia del Mondo Nuovo (1565) wrote that \\"...chocolate seemed more like a drink for pigs than a drink to be consumed by humans,\\" noting that he had never tasted it despite residing there for over a year.Girolamo Benzoni (1565), La Historia del Mondo Nuovo, Venice. Jos√© de Acosta also disparaged the drink, comparing the frothy foam capping chocolate to feces. Despite these caveats, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s characterised it as an interesting ingredient, while showing some reluctance to describe how some Indians, after drinking it, had stained their lips as if they had ingested human blood. The perceptions of the Spaniards were changing, in part, due to their increasing reliance on native ingredients. The tortillas made with cornmeal or (tamales), heated without the use of fat did not appear to satisfy the tastes of the conquerors used to pork and culinary techniques based on frying in fat, or sauteed with liberal use of olive oil or bacon. Foods popular in Spain at the time such as cheese were unknown to the inhabitants of the New World. As the Spanish settlers began to run out the stocks they brought with them, they had to find substitute foods. They therefore began to plant vegetables, such as chickpeas, cereals such as wheat and fruits like oranges or pears. Additionally they introduced the cultivation of olives, grapes and sugar cane. The latter ingredient became important. From the end of the 16th century onwards, sugar cane began to be added to the cocoa paste, which led to greater acceptance of cocoa among the Spanish settlers. During this settling in period, around the 1520s, the Spaniards had to get used to new foods and flavours while they attempted to adapt old world cultivation methods to the new climate. Equally, however, the new ingredients brought by the Spanish settlers such as wheat and chickpeas struggled to find acceptance among the native populations who preferred their own homegrown dishes.Benjam√≠n Hern√°ndez Bl√°zquez (2007), El viaje de los garbanzos, Madrid. Those Spaniards from humble economic backgrounds often married richer Aztecs, often as concubines. Thus, they tended to eat food influenced by Aztec gastronomy. This hastened the spread of cocoa among both cultures. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo mentioned that in a banquet held at the Plaza Grande in Mexico (built on the ruins of the Aztec capital) to celebrate peace between Carlos I of Spain and Francis I of France chocolate was served in golden tablets. The wide acceptance of cocoa by the Spanish conquistadors, especially the women, was also described by the Jesuit Jos√© de Acosta in his book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (published in 1590).Jos√© de Acosta (1590), Historia natural y moral, Madrid. Spanish acceptance of chocolate came about due to modifications made to the drink. For example, sugar was added, mirroring the native Mexican and Mayan practice of adding honey to cacao beverages. New World spices were replaced with similar Old World spices, in part for the sake of familiarity, but also out of practicality. The Madrid physician Colmenero de Ledesma recommended substituting the rose of Alexandria for mecaxochitl flower blossoms and black pepper for Mexican chilies, when necessary. Cacao beverages containing maize, such as atole, gradually phased out due to the fact that maize-less chocolate lasted longer, making it more suitable for cross-Atlantic trips. While these changes sought only to approximate the existing flavors of chocolate, in turn internalizing Mesoamerican tastes in the Spanish, they were significant enough to break down their initial aversion to cocoa. As a result, after the initial aversion to cocoa had disappeared, supplies were sent to Spain. The second major transformation of chocolate at the hands of the Spanish was in the serving method: the cocoa was heated until it became a liquid. This was in contrast to the natives of the New World, who generally drank it cold or at room temperature.Stephen T. Beckett (2008), The Science of Chocolate, RSC Publishing, 2nd ed., p.6. The third change was the addition of spices from the Old World like cinnamon, ground black pepper or aniseed.  Naming the new product  The grinding stone, or cocoa grinding stone, widely used in Spain until the 19th century. The Aztec language, Nahuatl, was difficult for the Spanish troops stationed in Mexico to pronounce. The common ending tl sounded like te. Hern√°n Cort√©s' difficulties with the language was evident in the letters he sent, where he writes \\"Temistitan\\" instead of Tenochtitlan and the tribal god Huitzilopochtli as \\"Huichilobos.\\" Coexistence between the two cultures led to the Spanish language borrowing certain Mesoamerican phrases or words such as coyote or maiz. Many dictionaries suggest that the word chocolate comes from the Nahuatl chocolatl, based on an evolution from -tl to -te; however, there are problems with this hypothesis. Firstly, Coe argues that the word chocolatl does not appear in Aztec cultural writings of the time. Similarly, the word is not found in the work of Alonso de Molina, a lexicographer of the time, who wrote a book about the grammar of the Aztec language in 1555. It is also absent from Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's encyclopedia and from the Huehuetlatolli (\\"The words of the ancients\\"), a guide to moral conduct.Lyle Campbell, Terrence Kaufman (1976), ¬´A linguistic look at the Olmec¬ª, American Antiquity, vol. 41, n¬∫ 1, pp. 80-86. In all these works, the word cacahuatl (cocoa water) is used. In his periodic letters, Hern√°n Cort√©s refers to 'cocoa.' At an indeterminate time in the 16th century, the Spanish of New Spain began to use the word chocolatl. The Royal Family's physician Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba already knew this name in the 1570s, describing chocolatl as a drink consisting of cocoa beans and pochotl, a type of tree seed, both ground to powder.Joseph del Olmo (1680), Relaci√≥n hist√≥rica del Auto General de Fe que se celebr√≥ en Madrid este a√±o de 1680, Madrid Jos√© de Acosta and his contemporaries also used the name chocolatl in Nueva Espa√±a and the Yucat√°n making the word a neologism. But others have suggested that the word chocolatl came from xocoatl, where xoco means bitter and atl means water.Karen Dakin and S√∏ren Wichmann (2000), ¬´Cacao and Chocolat¬ª, Ancient Mesoamerica, 11:1:55-75, Another possible explanation comes from the colonial habit of making hot cocoa, with many Mayan dictionaries of the time explaining that \\"the drink called chocolate\\" comes from chacau haa (literally 'hot water') which is phonetically close to chocolatl.Santamar√≠a (1959), Diccionario de mejicanismos  First deliveries to Spain  In 1520 the caravels began delivering Spanish cacao to Spain and the pirates with a letter of marque from England, perhaps due to ignorance of the new ingredient, burned and discarded the contents of the Spanish ships which they seized. No one knows for certain when cocoa first arrived in Spain, however it was considered a valuable material in the mid-16th century. The value which the product had can be seen in the strength of the Spanish galleons which carried the first cacao seeds to Spanish ports to prevent their theft.Mar√≠a del Carmen Sim√≥n Palmer (1997), La Cocina del Palacio, Madrid, Castalia, p. 61. There is no evidence that Hern√°n Cort√©s himself brought any cacao back to Spain on his return trip, as when he met Carlos I, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor in 1528, cacao was not listed among the gifts brought back from the New World. The first deliveries to Spain were made by small galleys, which took advantage of the \\"Chocolate wind\\", as the favourable North wind in the Gulf of Mexico was known. The first documentary evidence of chocolate in Spain comes from a delegation of Dominican friars led by Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas, who travelled to the Iberian Peninsula in 1544 to visit Prince Philip, future Emperor Philip II.Augustine Estrada Monroy (1979),El mundo kekch√≠ de Vera-Paz,, Guatemala, Ed Army, p. 195. During the meeting, gifts of sweetgum, corn, and cocoa are documented. It also refers to a chocolate milkshake that was served, this being the first documented case of the presence of chocolate in Spain. The Dominican friars' familiarity with this type of food may have facilitated the transmission of cocoa from the monasteries of Mesoamerica to Spain. Studies show that, prior to the reception, Father Aguilar would be the first in Spain to prepare jars of chocolate for the Abbot of the Piedra Monastery, Don Antonio de Alvaro.Luis Montreal Tejada (1990), Apolog√≠a del chocolate, Ed. Nestl√©. Other authors refer to the Benedictine monks as the first importers of chocolate in 1532. The first deliveries were brought by the Maria del Mar galley through the port of Cadiz and were delivered to the Convent of the Third Franciscans of Seville. A quote from the Benedictines of the time was: \\"Do not drink the cocoa, anyone but friar, sir or brave soldier.\\" In 1585, an embassy of Japan, visiting the Emperor Philip II in Alicante, was impressed by the offer of chocolate made by the nearby convent of the Poor Clares of Veronica. From the beginning, Spanish priests were the chocolate experts who spread their recipe among congregations. In 1601, the confessor of the court in the city of Cordoba, Serven Serrietz, inserted small amounts of chocolate in vegetables. He attempted to plant cocoa in the Iberian Peninsula but the result was a complete failure, leading to the realisation that cultivation was best in latitudes between 20 degrees north and 20 degrees south. The expansion and the need to seek a favorable climate for growing new food meant that cocoa trees flourished in Fernando Poo (in Spanish Guinea) and from there spread across the African continent. At that time preparation of sweets and confectionery was largely in the hands of pharmacists who used chocolate in various secret recipes and pharmaceutical applications. The nutritional use of chocolate was debated in those early times, and possible medicinal uses of cocoa were investigated from the beginning: an example can be found in the Badianus Codex, written in 1552.Teresa L. Dillinger et al. (2000), Food of the Gods: Cure for Humanity? A Cultural History of the Medicinal and Ritual Use of Chocolate, American Society for Nutritional Sciences. Chocolate and confectionery was served in Madrid in the 17th century, and locals in those establishments asked for the \\"drink that came from the Indies.'Manuel M. Mart√≠nez Llopis (1989), Historia de la Gastronom√≠a de Espa√±a, Alianza Editorial, p. 256. Reference to the public availability of chocolate is made by several visitors in the 18th century.George Borrow (1983), La Biblia en Espa√±a, Alianza Editorial, 2nd ed. In 1680 cocoa was served in combination with melted ice to the nobles present at the auto-da-f√©s. The writer Marcos Antonio Orellana makes reference to its popularity at the time in a brief rhyme:Gregorio Mayans (1733), Manual de fabricacion industrial de chocolate, Valencia, 11 page booklet with verses dedicated to chocolate. \\"Pocillo¬ª chocolate with its \\"grinder\\" (a wooden stick). A common way to make chocolate in Spain during the eighteenth century. The popularity of the drink among noble women was such that, not content with drinking it several times a day, they requested drinking it in church as well. This whim upset the bishops, who published a circular in 1861 banning chocolate consumption in churches during long sermons.Pegerto Saavedra (1992), A vida coit√° en Galicia de 1550‚Äì1650, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, p. 111. Chocolatadas, held at the end of religious services, became popular .  The golden age of chocolate  By the early seventeenth century drinking chocolate began to be popular in Spain, and was first accepted by the upper classes. It gradually expanded in two directions: geographic and social. Other foods from The Americas were not so accepted in Spanish society of the time as cocoa. The remaining foodstuffs were relegated to botanical study situations, or incorporated in some new culinary preparations on exceptional occasions and with general reluctance. However, chocolate was part of a number of seventeenth century palace rituals offered to visitors, as part of the \\"entertainment\\". This ritual was that the ladies of the Court offered their female visitors a dose of cocoa along with various sweets (cakes, sweetened bread, muffins and brioches) and a vase of snow. The chocolate was served to visitors who rested on cushions, surrounded by tapestries and the heat of braziers heat. Chocolatadas, the social custom of drinking chocolate in the community, had made their first appearance in Spain. During this century, two factors led to the spread of cocoa. The marriage of Spanish noblewomen to French royalty and the Jesuits providing chocolate recipes in various countries, such as Italy.Casati, E. y G. Ortona (1990), Il Cioccolato, Bolo√±a. Demand for cocoa significantly increased in the mid-16th century and the product flowed into Spanish seaports from where it spread to the rest of Europe.Canga Arg√ºelles, Jos√© (1833), ¬´Cacao¬ª, Diccionario de Hacienda, tomo I, p. 61. Acceptance by the Spanish ruling classes New food and drink in this era was usually consumed first by the upper classes, before gradually making their way to the lower classes through imitation. Initially, the austere rulers of the House of Habsburg were not fond of chocolate Hern√°n Cort√©s mentioned chocolate to Charles I in his letters from The Americas (the so-called Relationship Letters) and after that, he persuaded the emperor to try it for the first time in the city of Toledo. At the beginning of the 17th century, drinking chocolate was already fully accepted in the royal court, and its consumption was habitual in royal morning receptions. Soon after, chocolate was served in a similar way in all Spanish houses in large cities. The English traveller Ellis Veryard, who travelled through Spain in 1701, wrote about the high reputation that chocolate enjoyed in Spain in his book An Account of Divers Choice Remarks,Veryard, Ellis (1701), S. Smith and B. Walford, London, p. 273. and described how chocolate was made, painstakingly grinding cocoa in portable stone mills and mixing it with cinnamon, vanilla and a small amount of annatto. In 1644, Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma published one of the first Spanish chocolate recipes which was standard in Spain and Europe at the end of the 16th century.Colmenero de Ledesma, Antonio (1644), Chocolata Inda Opusculum, Nuremberg, Wolfgang Enderi. Colmenero self-translated his work to English and it spread through Europe. Spanish doctors who were followers of the theory of the four bodily humours (among them Colmenero) argued that chocolate had a \\"cold and dry\\" temperament and produced melancholy. One of the ingredients used in the Colmenero recipe is mecaxochitl (Piper amalgo), a relative of black pepper, and he indicated that, in the absence of this ingredient, Paeonia broteri (a type of rose) could be used. Spread from Spain to the rest of Europe Goya painting showing various chocolate cups and mugs The way the chocolate was brought to Spanish ports shows that, during the 17th century, it was one of the most precious commodities brought from overseas.Mart√≠nez Garc√≠a, Consolaci√≥n (2000), Drogas importadas desde Nueva Espa√±a (1689-1720): estudio estad√≠stico, Seville, Universidad de Sevilla, Chapter: Productos alimenticios. In 1691 an attempt was made to restrict distribution and it soon met with the opposition of the majority of Andalusian merchants. Chocolate was brought to France by the Jesuits and after being promoted by queens of Spanish origin: Anne of Austria (daughter of Philip III of Spain and wife of Louis XIII of France) and Maria Theresa of Spain (daughter of Philip IV of Spain), who moved to France in 1660 to marry Louis XIV of France (the Sun King). As a result, in the 17th century, chocolate became fashionable in Paris. Voltaire quotes this drink in his works in the 18th century.Voltaire, Monsieur le docteur Ralph (1759), Candide.

Deployable structures are also used on spacecraft for deploying solar panels and solar sails. Space- based deployable structures can be categorized into three primary classes: the first is the articulated structure class wherein rigid members contain sliding contact joints or are folded at hinge points and pivot to deploy, often locking into place. The second class consists of on-orbit assembly where a device is fabricated and/or mechanically joined in space to form the structure. The final class is high strain structures (often composed of High strain composites) wherein the device is dramatically flexed from one configuration to another during deployment.

Koivuniemi began studies in wood processing engineering at Helsinki University of Technology in 1981. On 9 September 2009 Finnish TV company YLE broadcast a documentary ‚ÄúKoivuniemen herra‚Äù [a pun, meaning both ‚Äúlord of Koivuniemi‚Äù and ‚ÄúCorporal punishment‚Äù] revealing that Koivuniemi was the leader of a secretive religious group called ‚ÄúMaanantaipiiri‚Äù (‚ÄòMonday circle‚Äô). In December 2010 the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat also included a feature article revealing the activities of the group.Anu Nousiainen, ‚ÄúValitut‚Äù [The chosen], Helsingin Sanomat, Kuukausiliite, No. 464, 12.2010, pp. 46-58.  Maanantaipiiri and Maitobaari  The expos√©s on YLE and in the Helsingin Sanomat were based on interviews with ex-members of the group, as well as tens of hours of tape recordings of Koivuniemi‚Äôs ‚Äúteachings‚Äù that had originally been made available to the inner circle of members. The group first started as a ‚ÄúBible reading study group‚Äù in Koivuniemi‚Äôs own room in the student village of Helsinki University of Technology. The name ‚ÄúMaanantaipiiri‚Äù (‚ÄòMonday circle‚Äô) came about on account that they met each Monday, in the evening. Later, as the group grew, it - together with one of its sub-groups, Maitobaari - rented a space at the Lutheran parish centre in Olari, Espoo, though they were later expelled from the building, parish employees calling them an \\"unhealthy circle\\".Jaakko Lyytinen, \\"Lahkon vankina\\" (\\"Prisoner of the cult\\"), Helsingin Sanomat, 12.12.2010, D5. The majority of those attending the group were university students. Over the years, while Koivuniemi remained at the university carrying out post-graduate studies and research at the nearby VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland the ‚Äòcircle‚Äô grew into a secret religious group, with different hierarchical sections involved in different aspects: Maanantaipiiri, Maitobaari (Milk bar), Puutarha (Garden) and Torni (Tower). The Maitobaari was at first an open, though unregistered, religious group for young people; though the premise behind it was to recruit young people for the higher parts of the organisation. Since the founding of the organisation, its members have grown to over 50. There have been marriages within the group members, the total number of children amongst members is in the tens. The raising of children within the group has been given special attention. The oldest of the children have reached university age. The youngest children are home-schooled. The families live in close proximity to each other in Espoo and Kirkkonummi. On directions from Koivuniemi, the women in the group take a submissive role (they are forbidden to speak in meetings) and dress in a feminine way (originally with make up, though his policy later changed and make-up was discouraged) and with long hair. The men dress soberly and mostly grow a beard. Koivuniemi also introduced a \\"weight-losing\\" programme among the members, which would follow the Body mass index; a number of women later reported that the strictly controlled weight-control programme by the group led some of them, even pregnant women, to anorexia. Koivuniemi believes in a close reading of the Bible. In the aftermath of the stories published in the press, it was revealed that the Lutheran Church was appalled at the \\"spiritual counselling\\" offered by the elders of the group, which included the young members having to give detailed descriptions of their private life.  Koivuniemi Publishing House  The article in Helsingin Sanomat also revealed the workings of the Koivuniemi Publishing House founded by Tapani Koivuniemi in 1999. As the members of the cult were highly educated people, mostly from Helsinki University of Technology, the expertise was available to found a company dealing with various aspects of publishing and IT technology. The company web site gives the appearance of a normal publishing company ‚Äì though there is no postal address for any offices - and indeed, listed among their clients are British Airways, the Finnish taxation authority, the City of Espoo, and Kela (The Finnish social security authority). The employees in fact work from their own homes. The article also depicted the working conditions of the employees: long hours with relatively low pay compared to other similar companies. According to one employee, ‚ÄúIn Tapani‚Äôs opinion 300 hours [per month ‚Äì i.e. 75 per week] would be good.‚Äù Footnotes  External links  * Koivuniemi Publishing (in English) * YLE TV programme information (in Finnish) Category:1960 births Category:Christian new religious movements Category:Living people Category:Finnish religious leaders ","title":"Tapani Koivuniemi"},{"id":"29888271","text":"One chamber of the pool The Struthion Pool, effectually translated from the Greek as 'Sparrow Pool'Cf. (Aramaic: ◊ê◊©◊ï◊ï◊ó ◊¶◊§◊®◊ê) is a large cuboid cistern beneath the Convent of the Sisters of Zion in the Old City of Jerusalem, built by Herod the Great in the first century BCE. Construction Hellenistic precursor and Herodian pool Lying at the foot of the rock scarp that once bore the Antonia Fortress, the pool is located at the northwestern corner of Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Measuring 52 by 14 metres, the pool is oriented from northwest to southeast, with its depth increasing from 4.5 metres in the north to 6 metres in the south. The pool's long eastern and western walls are not horizontal but also drop steadily to the south. Once open-aired, the pool was accessible along both long walls by a series of rock-cut steps covered by waterproof mortar composed of chalk and ashes. The pool was apparently built by Herod the Great during his construction of the Antonia and the renovation of the Temple Mount in the late first century BCE. The only pool known to stand in close association with the site of the Antonia, there is little doubt that it was constructed no later than the fashioning of the rock scarp above it, as the orientation of the pool conditioned a slight directional change in the rock podium's northeastern corner. It is therefore identified with the Struthius or Struthion ('sparrow') pool mentioned by Josephus in his description of Titus' siege of the Antonia during the Great Revolt (70 CE): The discovery of Seleucid and Hasmonean coins in the debris of the pool, as well as the similarity between local mortar and mortar used in other Hasmonean cisterns and baths in Jerusalem, may suggest a pre-Herodian origin to the pool. The Struthion is also accessible by a rock-cut passage that leads south for 34 meters before reaching the western wall of the Temple Mount enclosure. Blocked by the Herodian construction, this was an earlier aqueduct that once fed one of the cisterns underneath the Temple Mount enclosure itself. The aqueduct has been attributed to the Hasmoneans, though an earlier Ptolemaic association cannot be ruled out. With a floor 3 meters above the top of the pool, this passage would have remained dry at the time the pool was in use and may have been used as a secret means of access to the pool from the fortress or Temple Mount. Another passage exists north of the pool, though its relation to the pool or the southern passage is unknown. Late Roman vaults and pavement Once open-aired, the pool was later covered by two longitudinal barrel vaults that spring from the side walls and connect on a wall running along the center of the pool pierced by a series of arches. This division is the source of another name given to the Struthion, the Twin Pools. The two vaults were built to support a large flagstone pavement that covered the area above the pool. This pavement features shallow channels that carried runoff water into the pool as well as masonry manholes. Opinions differ as to the dating and origin of the pavement. Originally thought to be contemporary with the construction of the pool and thus to belong to the Antonia Fortress, reexamination of archaeological data by Father Pierre Benoit has prompted a revision of its dating. The vaults and pavement are rather thought to be contemporary with the nearby Ecce homo arch, originally a triumphal arch constructed by Emperor Hadrian, and thus assigned to the 2nd century CE. This reasoning seems to be supported by Josephus' account of the siege of the Antonia, although whether Josephus had meant a ramp had been built in, over or opposite the middle of the pool remains unclear. Discovery and excavations View of an arch connecting the two chambers of the pool The pool had remained in use down to modern times, and was identified as the Struthion by British engineer Sir Charles Warren during his exploration of Jerusalem between 1867 and 1870. His discovery of a tunnel running along the Western Wall to the vicinity of the pool prompted the Convent of the Sisters of Zion to seal off a part of the pool. An east-west wall now divides the Struthion pool into two parts, preventing access between them; one side is visible from the Western Wall tunnels, the other area is accessible from the Convent. As a result of 1971 extensions to the original Western Wall Tunnel, the Hasmonean water system became linked to the end of the Western Wall Tunnel. Running under Arab housing, the two were later opened as a tourist attraction. The attraction has a linear route, starting at the Western Wall Plaza, passing through the modern tunnels, then the ancient water system, and ending at the Struthion Pool. As the Sisters of Zion were not willing to allow tourists to exit into the Convent via the pool, tourists had to return through the narrow tunnels to their starting point, creating logistical issues. Digging an alternative exit from the tunnel was proposed, but initially rejected on the grounds that any exit would be seen as an attempt by the Jewish authorities to stake a claim to ownership of the nearby land‚Äîpart of the Muslim Quarter of the city. In 1996 Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the opening of an exit into the Via Dolorosa, underneath the Ummariya madrasah. Over the subsequent few weeks, 80 people were killed as a result of riots against the creation of the exit.

POWER8 is a family of superscalar symmetric multiprocessors based on the Power ISA, announced in August 2013 at the Hot Chips conference. The designs are available for licensing under the OpenPOWER Foundation, which is the first time for such availability of IBM's highest-end processors.You won't find this in your phone: A 4GHz 12-core Power8 for badass boxes Systems based on POWER8 became available from IBM in June 2014. Systems and POWER8 processor designs made by other OpenPOWER members was available in early 2015. Design POWER8 is designed to be a massively multithreaded chip, with each of its cores capable of handling eight hardware threads simultaneously, for a total of 96 threads executed simultaneously on a 12-core chip. The processor makes use of very large amounts of on- and off-chip eDRAM caches, and on-chip memory controllers enable very high bandwidth to memory and system I/O. For most workloads, the chip is said to perform two to three times as fast as its predecessor, the POWER7. POWER8 chips comes in 6- or 12-core variants; each version is fabricated in a 22 nm silicon on insulator (SOI) process using 15 metal layers. The 12-core version consists of 4.2 billion transistors and is 650 mm2 large while the 6-core version is only 362 mm2 large. However the 6- and 12-core variants can have all or just some cores active, so POWER8 processors come with 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 cores activated. CAPI Where previous POWER processors use the GX++ bus for external communication, POWER8 removes this from the design and replaces it with the CAPI port (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) that is layered on top of PCI Express 3.0. The CAPI port is used to connect auxiliary specialized processors such as GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs. Units attached to the CAPI bus can use the same memory address space as the CPU, thereby reducing the computing path length. At the 2013 ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference, IBM and Nvidia announced an engineering partnership to closely couple POWER8 with Nvidia GPUs in future HPC systems, with the first of them announced as the Power Systems S824L. On October 14, 2016, IBM announced the formation of OpenCAPI, a new organization to spread adoption of CAPI to other platforms. Initial members are Google, AMD, Xilinx, Micron and Mellanox. OCC POWER8 also contains a so-called on-chip controller (OCC), which is a power and thermal management microcontroller based on a PowerPC 405 processor. It has two general-purpose offload engines (GPEs) and 512 KB of embedded static RAM (SRAM) (1 KB = 1024 bytes), together with the possibility to access the main memory directly, while running an open-source firmware. OCC manages POWER8's operating frequency, voltage, memory bandwidth, and thermal control for both the processor and memory; it can regulate voltages through 1,764 integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) on the fly. Also, the OCC can be programmed to overclock the POWER8 processor, or to lower its power consumption by reducing the operating frequency (which is similar to the configurable TDP found in some of the Intel and AMD processors). Memory Buffer chip POWER8 splits the memory controller functions by moving some of them away from the processor and closer to the memory. The scheduling logic, the memory energy management, and the RAS decision point are moved to a so called Memory Buffer chip (a.k.a. Centaur).Intro to POWER8 Processor, p.22 Offloading certain memory processes to the Memory Buffer chip enables memory access optimizations, saving bandwidth and allowing for faster processor to memory communication.IBM Power System S822 Technical Overview and Introduction (REDP-5102-00) It also contains caching structures for an additional 16 MB of L4 cache per chip (up to 128 MB per processor) (1 MB = 1024 KB). Depending on the system architecture the Memory Buffer chips are placed either on the memory modules (Custom DIMM/CDIMM, for example in S824 and E880 models), or on the memory riser card holding standard DIMMs (for example in S822LC models).IBM Power System S822LC Technical Overview and Introduction (REDP-5283-00) The Memory Buffer chip is connected to the processor using a high-speed multi-lane serial link. The memory channel connecting each buffer chip is capable of writing 2 bytes and reading 1 byte at a time. It runs at 8 GB/s in the early Entry models, later increased in the high-end and the HPC models to 9.6 GB/s with a 40-ns latency,IBM Power Systems E870 and E880 Technical Overview and Introduction (REDP-5137-00)Implementing an IBM InfoSphere BigInsights Cluster using Linux on Power (SG24-8248-00) for a sustained bandwidth of 24 GB/s and 28.8 GB/s per channel respectively. Each processor has two memory controllers with four memory channels each, and the maximum processor to memory buffer bandwidth is 230.4 GB/s per processor. Depending on the model only one controller might be enabled, or only two channels per controller could be in use. For increased availability the link provides \\"on-the-fly\\" lane isolation and repair. Each Memory Buffer chip has four interfaces allowing to use either DDR3 or DDR4 memory at 1600 MHz with no change to the processor link interface. The resulting 32 memory channels per processor allow peak access rate of 409.6 GB/s between the Memory Buffer chips and the DRAM banks. Initially support was limited to 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB DIMMs, allowing up to 1 TB to be addressed by the processor. Later support for 128 GB and 256 GB DIMMs was announced,IBM Hardware Announcement ZG14-0279, IBM Power Systems I/O enhancements (RPQ 8A2232) allowing up to 4 TB per processor. Specifications The POWER8 core has 64 KB L1 data cache contained in the load-store unit and 32 KB L1 instruction cache contained in the instruction fetch unit, along with a tightly integrated 512 KB L2 cache. In a single cycle each core can fetch up to eight instructions, decode and dispatch up to eight instructions, issue and execute up to ten instructions and commit up to eight instructions. Each POWER8 core consist of primarily the following six execution units: * Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU) * Instruction Sequencing Unit (ISU) * Load‚Äìstore unit * Fixed-point unit (FXU) * Vector and Scalar Unit (VSU) * Decimal floating-point unit (DFU) Each core has sixteen execution pipelines: * Two fixed-point pipelines * Two load-store pipelines * Two load pipelines * Four double-precision floating-point pipelines, which can also act as eight single-precision pipelines * Two fully symmetric vector pipelines with support for VMX and VSX AltiVec instructions. * One cryptographic pipeline (AES, Galois Counter Mode, SHA-2) * One branch execution pipeline * One condition register logical pipeline * One decimal floating-point pipeline It has a larger issue queue with 4√ó16 entries, improved branch predictors and can handle twice as many cache misses. Each core is eight-way hardware multithreaded and can be dynamically and automatically partitioned to have either one, two, four or all eight threads active. POWER8 also added support for hardware transactional memory.Harold W. Cain, Maged M. Michael, Brad Frey, Cathy May, Derek Williams, and Hung Le. \\"Robust Architectural Support for Transactional Memory in the Power Architecture.\\" In ISCA '13 Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture, pp. 225-236, ACM, 2013. IBM estimates that each core is 1.6 times as fast as the POWER7 in single-threaded operations. A POWER8 processor is a 6- or 12-chiplet design with variants of either 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 activated chiplets, in which one chiplet consists of one processing core, 512 KB of SRAM L2 cache on a 64-byte wide bus (which is twice as wide as on its predecessor), and 8 MB of L3 eDRAM cache per chiplet shareable among all chiplets. Thus, a six-chiplet processor would have 48 MB of L3 eDRAM cache, while a 12-chiplet processor would have a total of 96 MB of L3 eDRAM cache. The chip can also utilize an up to 128 MB of off-chip eDRAM L4 cache using Centaur companion chips. The on-chip memory controllers can handle 1 TB of RAM and 230 GB/s sustained memory bandwidth. The on-board PCI Express controllers can handle 48 GB/s of I/O to other parts of the system. The cores are designed to operate at clock rates between 2.5 and 5 GHz. The six-core chips are mounted in pairs on dual-chip modules (DCM) in IBM's scale out servers. In most configurations not all cores are active, resulting in a variety of configurations where the actual core count differs. The 12-core version is used in the high-end E880 and E880C models. IBM's single-chip POWER8 module is called Turismo and the dual-chip variant is called Murano.Power8 Iron To Take On Four-Socket Xeons, nextplatform.com, 2015-05-11 PowerCore's modified version is called CP1. POWER8 with NVLink This is a revised version of the original 12-core POWER8 from IBM, and used to be called POWER8+. The main new feature is that it has support for Nvidia's bus technology NVLink, connecting up to four NVLink devices directly to the chip. IBM removed the A Bus and PCI interfaces for SMP connections to other POWER8 sockets and replaced them with NVLink interfaces. Connection to a second CPU socket are now provided via the X Bus. Besides that and a slight size increase to 659 mm2, the differences seem minimal compared to previous POWER8 processors.OpenPOWER and the Roadmap Ahead ‚Äì Brad McCredieIBM Debuts Power8 Chip with NVLink and 3 New SystemsWhitepaper - NVIDIA Tesla P100 - The Most Advanced Datacenter Accelerator Ever Built Featuring Pascal GP100, the World‚Äôs Fastest GPUIBM Power Systems S822LC for High Performance Computing Technical Overview and Introduction Licensees On 19 January 2014, the Suzhou PowerCore Technology Company announced that they will join the OpenPOWER Foundation and license the POWER8 core to design custom-made processors for use in big data and cloud computing applications.

The album is perhaps best known for featuring the song \\"Ken!\\", a song about Ken Barlow, a character on television soap Coronation Street played by William Roache. Critical reception Adam Kennedy of the BBC wrote: \\"As a television personality, Harry Hill is a rare breed, entertaining the masses with unrestrained wackiness while sneaking more mischievous references below early evening watershed radars. His debut full-length musical foray pulls a comparable trick, obscuring occasionally caustic wit beneath surface silliness. Despite distancing Funny Times from his best-known Technicolor vehicle TV Burp, Hill himself admits the album envelops similar themes. That‚Äôs inevitable, given the former doctor‚Äôs devotion to dissecting the slowly decaying corpse of popular culture-slash-television. But certain targets warrant further ridicule beyond 30-second TV gags, selected here with deadly accuracy. The Disappointment Song demonstrates that knack pithily, ripping into Sarah Jessica Parker and co‚Äôs big screen excursions with barely-concealed zeal. Nobody is safe, either, from gardeners-turned-tedious chatshow hosts to family members.\\" \\"Expectedly random guests ‚Äì ABC‚Äôs Martin Fry, William ‚ÄòKen Barlow‚Äô Roache, Bruce Forsyth ‚Äì garnish moments between Hill‚Äôs politely narked highs. And trusty newsreader John Craven announces the genuine peak: Never Be Holly Willoughby Symphony is a geeky timewaster‚Äôs letter to the eponymous presenter, offering to take her out to a ludicrous array of family-friendly UK attractions. Essentially Eminem‚Äôs Stan lectured in British etiquette, it pauses only to insult her \\"tiny\\" husband. Hill‚Äôs eye for the ridiculous is tempered by completing rhymes that many musical comedians would only dare allude to. Nothing is left to the imagination in Phone Up Yer Mum certainly, Hill advising us \\"Be a good son and phone up yer mum, ‚ÄòCos one day she‚Äôll be dead\\", before trading off subtle nuances of such conversations with commendable attention to detail. Repeated spins will, naturally, send you barmier than Hill, particularly closing Brucie ballad I‚Äôm Not Anyone and flagship scally-dissing number I Wanna Baby.

Background Arent Bj√∏rnsen Solem was born in Kl√¶bu, S√∏ndre Trondhjems Amt, Norway. He was born to farmer Bj√∏rn Olsen Solem (1742‚Äì1797) and his wife Magnhild Olsdatter (c. 1742‚Äì??). Although little is known about Solem's early life, it is known that he traveled to Trondheim where he worked as a carpenter. He later made success as a merchant and property investor in Trondheim, before he established a flax weavery in Moholt. Career He became a successful entrepreneur and trusted follower of Hans Nielsen Hauge, leader of the Haugean Movement. He married Randi Nideng (n√©e Lauvaas) in the beginning of the 19th century, with whom he maintained a hospitable home. Solem made success as a merchant and property investor in both Tr√∏ndelag and Christiania (now Oslo). After advice from Hans Nielsen Hauge, Solem bought the fishing and trade centre S√∏r-Gj√¶slingan in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag.After Hauge's death in 1824, Solem's connection with the Haugean movement was weakened. In 1825, Solem moved to Christiania, where he bought the farms Sandaker and Storo and started a mill-and-saw enterprise at Bj√∏lsen. Solem and his wife lived at the Sandaker farm. The farm became a centre for Grundtvigianism. Solem also extended the mill at Bakke which Hans Nielsen Hauge had earlier built in 1815. In 1840, Solem went home with his family to Trondheim, where he continued with his mercantile business. He established during this time a shipyard in Hommelvik. Marriage and death Solem married Randi Andersdatter Nideng (1775‚Äì1859) at some point after 1800, although the exact year is disputed. His and her entry in Norsk biografisk leksikon, both written by Andreas Aarflot, state that the marriage occurred on 9 July 1805. Historian Sverre R√∏vik considers this less likely, as they both met in the Haugean network many years before. Solem died at his farm in Strinda in 1857 as a wealthy and respected businessman, two years before his wife. His son, Fredrik, committed suicide in 1861 after the revealing of a fraud in Trondheim.

In the Dutch Revolt, it was the only quarter that did not secede from the Habsburg Monarchy to become part of the Seven United Netherlands, but remained under Spanish rule during the Eighty Years' War. Geography Within the Low Countries, the counts, later dukes at Geldern started from the 11th century onwards to collect several territories down the Meuse river, which were physically separated from the later acquired lands along the Lower Rhine. These original lands of upper Guelders were separated by the Dukes of Cleves, a long-time foe of Guelders. The northern territories were administrated within three quarters: # Zutphen County, # Veluwe Quarter, # Nijmegen Quarter with the Land of Meuse and Waal and the Betuwe. These lower quarters today form the Dutch province of Gelderland. The most important cities in Upper Guelders were Geldern, Venlo and Roermond. Together with the Duchy of Cleves, the region originally was part of the South Guelderish language area, part of the Low Franconian dialect group. History In 1471 Duke Arnold of Guelders, stuck in the conflict with his only surviving son Adolf of Egmond, gained the support of the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold, but in turn had to give his duchy in pawn. Charles seized Guelders upon Duke Arnold's death in 1473, and despite the protests raised by the ducal House of Egmond incorporated it into the Burgundian Netherlands, the later dowry of his daughter Mary the Rich to her husband Archduke Maximilian I of Austria from the House of Habsburg. In 1492 Duke Arnold's grandson Charles of Egmond, backed by the local nobility as well as by King Charles VIII of France, managed to regain the rule over Guelders against the Habsburg claims. However, as he left no heirs, he bequested the duchy to Duke William of Cleves in 1538, who, despite his efforts to marry his sister Anne to King Henry VIII of England, could not prevail against the Habsburg Emperor Charles V. In 1543 William officially renounced Guelders in favour of Charles, who attached the duchy to the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands. Upon Charles' abdication in 1556, he decreed, that these territories would be inherited by his son King Philip II of Spain. After Philip's stern Catholic measures had sparked the Dutch Revolt, the three lower quarters of Guelders joined the Protestant states in the 1579 Union of Utrecht, while during most part of the Eighty Years' War, the capital Geldern with Upper Guelders remained in the hands of the Spanish. This was finally confirmed in the 1648 Peace of M√ºnster. The upper territory was therefore also called \\"Spanish Guelders\\". Following the War of the Spanish Succession, by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Upper Guelders was further divided into: *Prussian Upper Guelders: most part, including the capital Geldern, held by the Kingdom of Prussia. The Electors of Brandenburg (from 1618: Brandenburg-Prussia) had already acquired the neighbouring Duchy of Cleves by the 1614 Treaty of Xanten ending the War of the J√ºlich Succession. *States Upper Guelders: Venlo and surroundings became part of the Dutch Republic. *J√ºlich Upper Guelders: The town of Erkelenz passed to the Duchy of J√ºlich, held by the Elector of the Palatinate from the House of Wittelsbach. *Austrian Upper Guelders: The land around Roermond and some adjacent villages remained under Habsburg rule, then the remaining Austrian branch, the later House of Lorraine. It joined the United States of Belgium in 1790. According to the Final Act of the Vienna Congress in 1815, the western part of Prussian Upper Guelders and Austrian Upper Guelders also became part of the Dutch province of Limburg. The remaining territory was retained by Prussia: Geldern itself was incorporated into the Province of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, while Erkelenz fell to the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine. Both became part of the Prussian Rhine Province in 1822. Up to today, the demarcation line forms the Dutch-German border, though the Limburg territory east of the Meuse river, held by the King of the Netherlands, joined the German Confederation upon the 1839 Treaty of London.

It is not far from the B 185 federal road in the district of Harz in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.  History  It is supposed to have been built to guard the nearby smelting works by the Count and later Prince of Anhalt, whose family seat was located only about 3 km away in the Selke valley. From 1307 the counts of Stolberg were described as the Anhalt vassals of the Heinrichberg castle. The original protective function of the castle changed, however, under the Stolberg's occupation, for the fortress situated at the northeastern periphery of the comital estates was later used as a base for highwaymen on the Harz Road that ran past it. According to Cyriac Spangenberg's Mansfeld Chronicle, the castle was recaptured by the counts, Dietrich and Henry of Hohnstein, and their sons in 1344, and the highwaymen living there were executed. The Anhalt letter of enfeoffment (Lehnsbrief) for Heinrichsberg to the counts of Stolberg was renewed in 1377 and 1381. Thereafter, for decades, there was no written evidence of the castle, which became increasingly dilapidated and, by 1491 was referred to as an abandoned castle, that was a pledge held by the Frederick of Hoym. At that time the lords of Hoym also held the Anhalt fiefs of B√§renrode, Bolkendorf and half of the village of Dankerode. They pledged these estates to the counts of Stolberg, Prince Bernard VI of Anhalt-Bernburg giving his consent as overlord in 1452. In 1461 Henry, Count of Stolberg, paid a sum of 450 gold Rhenish guilders to Frederick the Elder, Frederick the Younger and Henry of Hoym for the purchase of two abandoned villages, Olvesfelde and Mu√üeberg, and half of the village of Dankerode. In 1514 the princes, Ernest and Wolfgang of Anhalt, renewed the enfeoffment of Stolberg and Heinrichsberg Castle together with its estates, the village of Breitenstein, the then already deserted village of Ammacht, the copse near Gr√§fen Pond (Gr√§fenteich), a field near G√ºntersberge and the field at Lingesbach, half the village of Dankerode and other rights. In the said letter of enfeoffment, the Stolberg claim to several estates in the Harz, in particular three abandoned settlements between G√ºntersberge and Harzgerode, whose vassals were the lords of Hoym at that time, are recorded and documented. Count Botho, however, was engaged in negotiations over their purchase with Lord (Ritter) Magnus of Hoym. The Stolberg prince had become financially strong enough to create a link between the towns of G√ºntersberge and Harzgerode, already in his possession by acquiring land, thereby extending Stolberg's sphere of influence in the northeast. Magnus of Hoym but died before the conclusion of the contract. He left his infant son, Frederick of Hoym, whose guardian concluded the inheritance agreement with Botho, Count of Stolberg in 1518. The purchase price for these fiefs that had belonged to the Hoym family since 1430 was 1550 guilders. After reaching the age of majority, Frederick of Hoym ratified the inheritance purchase in 1530 but raised the price of 900 gold guilders, because he said that the estates had been sold below their true value. The late-medieval deserted village of B√§renrode was made habitable again by the counts of Stolberg in the 16th century and the outwork there was turned into the administrative seat for an Amt. The castles of Erichsberg and Heinrichsberg, just a few kilometres away, which had fallen into insignificance as a result of their increasing decline, were now managed by the Amt of B√§renrode. Of the estates of the two castles, only the village of Breitenstein, which had originally belonged to Heinrichsberg Castle, and its extensive areas of forest subsequently had any great importance.

In 1981, under the artistic direction of Marc Masterson, the company moved to a new performance space on Bouquet Street in Oakland. The company again moved to a new performance space at the former Bingham United Methodist Church in the South Side in 1991, where in addition to its own season it acted as a host space for the earliest productions of the Pittsburgh New Works Festival. Marc Masterson became artistic director of Actors Theatre of Louisville in Kentucky, and Tracy Brigden became artistic director in 2001. In addition to its mainstage season, City Theatre offers educational outreach programs such as the Young Playwrights Festival, in which selected submitted plays by students in middle school and high school are given professional productions, and City Theatre Playmakers, which provides opportunities for Pittsburgh youth to write radio dramas that are fully produced and broadcast.http://www.citytheatrecompany.org/education/yp/ See also Theatre in Pittsburgh References City Theatre Company Records (City Theatre Company Records, 1973-1993, CTC.1991.01, Curtis Theatre Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh) Category:Theatres in Pittsburgh Category:Theatre companies in Pittsburgh Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1859 Category:Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks ","title":"City Theatre (Pittsburgh)"},{"id":"29889197","text":"≈ûeyh S√ºleyman Mosque (full name in Turkish: ≈ûeyh S√ºleyman Mescidi, where mescit is the Turkish word for a small mosque) is a mosque in Istanbul converted from a former Byzantine building which was part of the Eastern Orthodox Pantokrator Monastery.

This triple bond consists of a œÉ-bond and two œÄ-bonds. The HOMO of the carbyne ligand interacts with the LUMO of the metal to create the œÉ-bond. The two œÄ-bonds are formed when the two HOMO orbitals of the metal back-donate to the LUMO of the carbyne. They are also called metal alkylidynes‚Äîthe carbon is a carbyne ligand. Such compounds are useful in organic synthesis of alkynes and nitriles. They have been the focus on much fundamental research. Synthesis Transition metal carbyne complexes are most common for the early transition metals, especially niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium. They can also have low-valence metals as well as high-valence metals. Protonation of a Re(I) vinylidene complex to give the corresponding cationic Re(V) carbyne derivative. The first example of a metal carbyne complex was prepared by the Fischer school by treatment of Cr(CO)5(C(OMe)Ph) with boron trichloride: :Cr(CO)5(C(OMe)Ph) + BCl3 ‚Üí ClCr(CO)4(CPh) + CO + BCl2(OMe) Many high-valent carbyne complexes have since been prepared, often by dehydrohalogenation of carbene complexes. Alternatively, amino-substituted carbyne ligands sometimes form upon protonation of electron-rich isonitrile complexes. Similarly, O-protonation of Œº3-CO ligands in clusters gives hydroxycarbyne complexes. Vinyl ligands have been shown to rearrange into carbyne ligands. Addition of electrophiles to vinylidene ligands also affords carbyne complexes. Bridging alkylidyne ligands in cluster compounds Some metal carbynes dimerize to give dimetallacyclobutadienes. In these complexes, the carbyne ligand serves as a bridging ligand. Many cluster-bound carbyne complexes are known, typically with CO ligands. These compounds do not feature MC triple bonds; instead the carbyne carbon is tetrahedral. Some of the best known are the tricobalt derivatives, which are prepared by treating cobalt carbonyl with haloforms: :2 HCBr3 \\\\+ Co2(CO)8 ‚Üí 2 HCCo3(CO)9 \\\\+ 18 CO + 3 CoBr2 Structure Structure of PhCW(OBu-t)3. Monomeric metal carbyne complexes exhibit fairly linear M‚ÄìC‚ÄìR linkages according to X-ray crystallography. The M‚ÄìC distances are typically shorter than the M‚ÄìC bonds found in metal carbenes. The bond angle is generally between 170¬∞ and 180¬∞ Analogous to Fischer and Schrock carbenes; Fischer and Schrock carbynes are also known. Fischer carbynes usually have lower oxidation state metals and the ligands are œÄ-accepting/electron- withdrawing ligands. Schrock carbynes on the other hand typically have higher oxidation state metals and electron-donating/anionic ligands. In a Fischer carbyne the C-carbyne exhibits electrophilic behavior while Schrock carbynes display nucleophilic reactivity on the carbyne carbon Carbyne complexes have also been characterized by many methods including infrared Spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy. Bond lengths, bond angles and structures can be inferred from these and other analytical techniques. The first Fischer carbyne was isolated in 1973. Two years later in 1975, the first Schrock carbyne was reported. Metal carbyne complexes also exhibit a large trans effect, where the ligand opposite the carbyne is typically labile. Reactions and applications :Synthesis of a carbyne complex starting from tungsten tetrachloride. Metal alkylidyne complexes have mainly been used for specialized reactions in the laboratory, the main used being alkyne metathesis. Triply-bridging carbynes are sometimes prepared by the condensation of terminal carbyne complexes with other metals. Transition metal carbyne complexes usually react with Lewis acids at the C-carbyne. This reaction generally causes them to become transition metal carbene complexes. Depending on the charge of the carbyne complex depends on how well the complex will react with a nucleophile. A cationic carbyne complex will react with a nucleophile right at the C-carbyne, while a nucleophile will not react with the C-carbyne of a transition metal carbyne complex but instead it would react with the metal. This is due to the LUMO of the complexes caused by the electron orbitals of the metal and C-carbyne. Also, the higher the energy of the d-orbitals belonging to an electron-rich metal center the higher the energy of the metal‚Äìcarbon œÄ-bonds. This improves the conditions for coupling. Some carbyne complexes react with electrophiles at C-carbyne followed by association of the anion. The net reaction gives a transition metal carbene complex: :LnM‚â°CR + HX ‚Üí Ln(X)M=CHR These complexes can also undergo photochemical reactions. In some carbyne complexes, coupling of the carbyne ligand to a carbonyl is observed. Protonation of the carbyne carbon and conversion of the carbyne ligand into a œÄ-allyl.  Main group analogue  A sulfur-based main group analog of a carbyne complex has been prepared by Seppalt and coworkers. The compound, trifluoro(2,2,2-trifluoroethylidyne)-Œª6-sulfurane, F3C‚ÄìC‚â°SF3, prepared by dehydrofluorination of F3C‚ÄìCH=SF4 or F3C‚ÄìCH2‚ÄìSF5, is an unstable gas that readily undergoes dimerization to form trans-(CF3)(SF3)C=C(CF3)(SF3) at above ‚Äì50 ¬∞C.

Early career Collins served as a master on ships, joining the Sweepstakes in this position for a voyage to the south seas with Sir John Narborough between 1669 and 1671. The Admiralty appointed him as master of the Speedwell in 1676. John Wood commanded that ship, and intended to reach Japan by the then supposed North-East passage. Wood had served with Collins aboard the Sweepstake during Narborough's expedition, and held Collins in high regard. The Speedwell was wrecked off Novaya Zemlya, but the crew was rescued and returned aboard their consort ship, Prosperous. Collins's journal of the voyage brought him to the attention of King Charles II. Collins continued his naval career, serving as master of on an expedition to Tangier with Admiral Narborough in 1677. From the Charles Galley he transferred first to , then and in turn, serving as master aboard each. After good service, he was gazetted as captain, and appointed to command the 18-gun . He again kept a journal, in which he recorded his encounters with the Algerine pirates and drew maps which showed his hydrographic skill. Surveying career Collins then undertook another Mediterranean tour as master of the Leopard; this voyage ran through the whole of 1680 and into the first few months of the year following. Henry Fitzroy, Charles II's natural son and later Duke of Grafton, accompanied Collins during that voyage. Earlier, Collins had gained the king's attention with the quality of his Arctic journal keeping. With this access, Collins began to lobby in 1680 for support for his proposals to undertake an improved survey of the country's coasts. Prior to this time nautical charts were often defective, and there was no centralised system for collecting and disseminating the better maps made by experienced seamen. In the Spring of 1681, Collins gained the king's preferment to survey the country's coasts. For the survey, the Admiralty supplied Collins with the 8-gun yacht for the first two years and then the yacht until 1686. His surveying was carried out under the supervision of Trinity House, who also supported the project with financial contributions. Samuel Pepys insisted that Collins be made a younger brother of Trinity House. Collins eventually spent seven years on the survey, at first on the Merlin and Monmouth, later aboard the Martin and Younge Spragge. As well as his own observations, he likely included existing charts and seamen's sketches and notes, and published charts as they were completed. Collins began gathering engraved copper plates with which to eventually print his charts with while he was engaged on the survey, and continued gathering more plates in the years following. In 1693, he finally published his results in a folio volume of two parts, Great Britain's Coasting Pilot, containing sailing directions, tide tables, coastal views and about forty-nine charts. The charts were not completely accurate, but with all their shortcomings they were an enormous advance on anything before them, and entitle Collins to rank not only with the earliest, but with the best of English hydrographers. The work covered England and Scotland, and though Collins proposed a further study to cover Ireland, the plan came to nothing. Collins recorded that he had spent ¬£40 on instruments, and charged ¬£80 for the 120 manuscript maps he delivered. With his claim for expenses set at ¬£200 per annum, and his wages of ¬£394 10s., he claimed a total of ¬£1914 10s. for his work, which was eventually paid in arrears. The cost was more than three times the original estimate. His cousin, Freeman Collins, printed the Coasting Pilot, which Richard Mount sold. Mount's subsequent firm then went on to publish twenty-one further editions of the pilot throughout the nineteenth century. The Sudbrook Press published the book as a reduced facsimile in 1964, followed by Early English Books first in microfilm and then online. Later life His reputation as a hydrographer established, Collins was allowed to style himself hydrographer in ordinary to the king from 1683, and in 1693 he became one of the elder brethren of Trinity House. In 1684 Collins surveyed encroachments onto the River Thames by riparian bank owners within the City of London. After the survey, Collins served as master of under Admiral George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth. Admiral Legge allowed William of Orange to make a successful landing at Torbay. Collins then served as commander of the yacht continuously until the end of 1693. Collins became master of the yacht HMY Fubbs in 1694, and died while in command of her on or about 25 March 1694. He had married Elinor Hocker in 1679 at St Margaret's, Westminster; they had ten children together. His widow received ¬£500 from the Treasurer of the Navy in 1695. Collins's publications bear various ways of spelling his first name, but Greenvile is the most dominant. However he mostly spelled out his own name as Greenvill. Notes References  *Frances E.

Among the violent acts included are war, human sacrifice, animal sacrifice, murder, rape, genocide, and criminal punishment. The texts have a history of interpretation within the Abrahamic religions and Western culture that includes justification and opposition to acts of violence. In the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Terms , meaning 'violence, wrongdoing', is the Hebrew Bible's primary term for violence and is first used in : \\"the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.\\" It occurs sixty times in the Hebrew Bible, is almost always used to identify physical violence (; ), and is used to describe human, not divine, violence. \\"Sometimes the word refers to extreme wickedness (; ) where physical violence may or may not be [involved].\\"= Hamas may also refer to verbal, or even ethical violence. \\"The term Hamas sometimes appears as a cry to God in the face of injustice (Jer. 6:7).\\" Exodus 23:1 and Deut. 19:16 characterize a false witness as (a ‚Äúviolent witness‚Äù). The notion that a false witness threatens life and well-being appears in fuller form in the Psalter.\\" In the Torah the terms (rob) and (oppress) are frequently used in combination to describe the human violence of taking/robbing/plundering as oppression of the poor which may or may not include physical, verbal or other types of harm. They are also used both separately and in combination throughout the remainder of the Hebrew Bible describing robbing the poor (Isaiah 3:14, 10:2; Jeremiah 22:3; Micah 2:2, 3:2; Malachi 1:3), withholding the wages of a hired person (cf. Deuteronomy 24:14), political oppression (Hosea 12:7), charging oppressive interest (Ezekiel 22:12), and oppressing the outsider in their midst (Ezekiel 22:7) as acts of violence. The Hebrew verb ·∏•ƒÅram connotes [complete annihilation] (New Revised Standard Version, ‚Äúutterly destroy‚Äù; Deut. 7:2); the noun that derives from it () is sometimes translated as \\"the ban\\" and denotes the separation, exclusion and dedication of persons or objects to God which may be specially set apart for destruction (Deuteronomy 7:26; Leviticus 27:28-29). Historian Susan Niditch says \\"the root h-r-m links together several biblical non-war and war usages of the term ... under the heading of sacrifice.\\" Early use of the term indicates the Israelites were not allowed to touch, possess, or redeem these \\"devoted things\\". However, later use of the term, such as in Numbers 18:14-17 and Deuteronomy 7, indicates items and first born children set aside as were to be redeemed by the Priests. Hebrew scholar Baruch A. Levine notes Deut.7:1-11 as an evolution of Hebrew ideology in Exodus 33:5-16, with its addition of the ban (see also Exodus 20:19,20). Levine concludes this is one of several indications, including extra-biblical evidence, that was a later addition to Hebrew thought. Levine says this is indicative that Israel was still, as late as Deuteronomy, making ideological adjustments to having imported the foreign practice of from its source in the surrounding Near Eastern nations.\\" Over half the occurrences of the verb and noun for the root ·∏•-r-m are concerned with the destruction of nations in war, but other terms associated with what Old Testament scholar Eric Siebert describes as \\"divine violence\\" may or may not include war. Siebert says divine violence is \\"violence God is said to have perpetrated, caused, or sanctioned.\\" Specifically, this includes (1) violence God commits without using human agents (e.g., sending down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah); (2) violence God commissions, typically unbeknownst to those being commissioned (e.g., using Babylon to punish Judah for their sins); and (3) violence God commands directly (e.g., ordering Israelites to wipe out Canaanites).\\" For example, concerning those who worship idols, Deuteronomy 7:16 uses akal (\\"consume\\") when saying \\"You must destroy (consume) all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you‚Ä¶\\". Deuteronomy 7:24, on the other hand, uses abad when saying \\"you shall make their name perish from under heaven‚Ä¶\\" while Deuteronomy 20:10-18 says \\"‚Ä¶you shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy (ha-harem taharimem) them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has commanded you‚Ä¶\\". \\"Amos 1:3‚Äì2:3 uses akal to indict Israel‚Äôs neighbors for various acts of cruelty during war (e.g., the Ammonites ‚Äúripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory‚Äù; 1:13) and uses those war crimes of surrounding peoples to draw a parallel with Israel's mistreatment of the poor, thus elevating economic injustice to the level of war crimes.\\" (2:6‚Äì8). Other terms are: ·π£amat (put an end to, exterminate...annihilate); shamad (destroy, exterminate); nakah (to strike fatally, kill, in manslaughter, murder...as retaliation ...in warfare, conquest...combat...attack, rout); aqar (pluck up, often in the violent sense); qatsah (to cut off, in a destructive sense); shabat (with zeker can refer to one's \\"memory\\" being \\"blotted out\\" but in another idiom it means to \\"be blotted out...from...[the] earth\\" to \\"be exterminated, be destroyed, perish\\"); and kalah (kalah in Qal can mean \\"be finished, be destroyed). Biblical narrative Book of Genesis Noah's Ark and the Deluge. When Adam and Eve disobey God, he curses them and banishes them from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). In Genesis 4:1-18 Cain, the first born man, murders his brother Abel. God curses Cain for this, and also grants him protection from danger. In the Genesis flood narrative (Genesis 6-9), God sees that \\"wickedness of man was great\\" and decides to exterminate mankind and all animals, saving only Noah and those he brought with him on the Ark. After the Flood, God promises to never again destroy all life by a flood. Pieter Schoubroeck - The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, c.1600 In Genesis 18-19 God resolves to destroy the cities Sodom and Gomorrah, \\"because their sin is very grievous\\". God promises Abraham that he will spare Sodom if as few as 10 righteous people can be found there. The cities are destroyed, but angels save Abraham's nephew Lot and most of his family from the destruction. God tests Abraham by demanding that he sacrifice Isaac, his son (Genesis 22). As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants. Isaac's son Jacob conspires to gain his elder brother Esau's birthright, but the brothers ultimately reconcile (Genesis 25-33). In Genesis 32:22-32, Jacob meets and wrestles with someone, a man, angel or God, who blesses him and gives him the name Israel. Joseph (Genesis 37-50), Jacob's favorite son, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. Joseph prospers after hardship, with God's guidance, and saves his family from starvation. Book of Exodus and Book of Leviticus Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce (1877) A new pharaoh (Exodus 1) sees that the Israelites in Egypt have become many and fears they might aid Egypt's enemies. The Egyptians make the Israelites \\"serve with rigour\\" and their lives become \\"bitter with hard service\\". Pharaoh orders two Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to kill the newborn sons of Hebrew women, but they disobey him. Pharaoh then orders his people to drown these children. Moses, a Hebrew raised by Pharaoh's daughter, one day encounters an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. He slays the Egyptian and flees Egypt. God hears the plight of the Israelites and sends Moses back to Egypt to bring them out of that land to Canaan. At one point during the journey back, God intends to kill Moses, but he is saved by his wife Zipporah (Exodus 2-4). Moses asks Pharaoh to release the Israelites, but Pharaoh responds by demanding more work from them. Moses repeats his request several times as the Plagues of Egypt afflict the Egyptians, but God makes Pharaoh refuse until the tenth plague, when God kills all firstborn people and cattle in Egypt, apart from those of the Israelites, who are protected. The Israelites are allowed to leave, but God again changes Pharaoh's mind, and an army is sent after them. God saves them from the army by drowning it in the Red Sea. At Mount Sinai, God gives the Israelites the Ten Commandments and the Covenant Code (Exodus 20-23). These laws include thou shalt not kill, eye for an eye and laws about slavery and other things. Capital punishment is prescribed for some crimes. Animal sacrifice in the form of burnt offerings is mentioned, and it is prescribed that an ox that kills a person is to be stoned. The Code states that \\"And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\\" and \\"Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.\\" The Israelites promise to follow these laws (Exodus 24:3). The Israelites break their promise by worshiping the Golden Calf. God is angered by this and intends to \\"consume them\\", but Moses persuades him not to do so. Moses is also angered, and he breaks two stone tablets with God's writing. On Moses' command, the Levites kill about three thousand people (Exodus 32). God has Moses make new stone tablets, and gives Moses the Ritual Decalogue, which states in part \\"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim\\" (Exodus 34). The Book of Leviticus sets out detailed rules for animal sacrifice. The Holiness code, Leviticus 17-26, sets out a list of prohibitions, and the punishments for breaking them. Punishments include execution, sometimes by stoning or burning. Book of Numbers The Sabbath-breaker Stoned James Tissot c.1900 The Women of Midian Led Captive by the Hebrews James Tissot c.1900 God orders Moses to count \\"all that are able to go forth to war in Israel\\" (Numbers 1). God hears the people \\"speaking evil\\" and punishes them with fire. Moses prays, and the fire abates. God is again angered and sends \\"a great plague\\" (Numbers 11). God hears Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses, and punishes Miriam with leprosy. Moses asks God to heal her which he does (Numbers 12). The Israelites reach the border of Canaan, but due to reports from spies they refuse to enter, and wish to return to Egypt. God is angered, and tells Moses \\"I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.\\" Moses persuades him not to, but God declares that the Israelites will now wander the wilderness for forty years before they can enter Canaan. They are attacked by Amalekites and Canaanites (Numbers 13-14). In Numbers 15, a man is found working on the Sabbath. God orders him to be killed and he is stoned. Korah and a group of men rebel against Moses and Aaron. God destroys them (Numbers 16). The Isralites \\"murmur\\" about this, and God punishes them with a plague (Numbers 16). At Hormah, a Canaanite king fights the Israelites, and the Israelites promise God that if he gives them victory over this people, they will destroy their cities. He does and they do. The Israelites speak against God and Moses, and God sends venomous snakes that kill many of them. Moses prays for the people, and God helps them (Numbers 21). The Israelites conquer the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and they \\"smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining; and they possessed his land.\\" (Numbers 21). When the diviner Balaam beats his donkey, it speaks. Balaam later prophesies on the future of the Israelite's enemies (Numbers 22-24). Some Israelites commit harlotry with women in Moab, and sacrifice to their gods. God is angered, orders executions and sends a plague, but \\"the main guilt is Midian's and on Midian fell the vengeance\\" (Numbers 25 and 31). God orders Moses to \\"Harass the Midianites, and smite them\\", and to again count \\"all that are able to go forth to war in Israel\\" (Numbers 25-26). The Isralites war against Midian, and \\"slew every male\\". They take captive the women and children, and take all cattle, flocks and goods as loot, and burn all cities and camps. When they return to Moses, he is angered, and commands \\"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves\\" (Numbers 31). God tells Moses \\"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places. And ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.\\" and \\"But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell. And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you\\" (Numbers 33). Book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy begins with a review of previous stories, including a battle between the Israelites and the Amorites (Deuteronomy 1:41-44), and the destruction of Rephaim by the Ammonites with Yahweh's help (2:21), along with similar other displacements. Deuteronomy 2:31-37 records the complete extermination of the people ruled by Sihon king of Heshbon. Similar treatment, at Yahweh's command, was given to the people under Og king of Bashan. Moses also recounts how God destroyed the followers of Baal-Peor, and threatens to destroy the Israelites if they return to idolatry. Similar threats of destruction for disobedience, or idolatry more specifically, can be found in Deuteronomy 6, 8, 11. On the other hand, God promises that if his people obey him he will give them victory in fighting their enemies in Deuteronomy 6, 11. Deuteronomy provides legislation to protect perpetrators of unintentional homicide from revenge killings (4, 19). The Ten Commandments prohibit murder (5:17). Deuteronomy 7 orders the complete annihilation of the indigenous inhabitants of Canaan, and God promises in exchange for obedience to bring diseases on the enemies of Israel. Chapter 9 records an incident in which Yahweh was angry and intended to destroy the Israelites, but was dissuaded by Moses. Deuteronomy 12 records Yahweh's displeasure at the practice of burning sons and daughters as offerings to deities. Deuteronomy 13 insists that those who advocate the worship of other deities must be killed, and that a town that worships other deities must be entirely exterminated, including its livestock. Deuteronomy 14 forbids self- mutilation. Deuteronomy 17 punishes anyone who worships any deity or feature of the natural world with stoning to death, and likewise imposes the death penalty on anyone who disobeys the judicial decision of a priest. Deuteronomy 19 imposes the death penalty for premeditated murder, establishes cities of refuge, and also imposes the lex talionis: \\"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\\" limiting vengeance (verse 21, NRSV). Deuteronomy 20 regulates warfare, allowing for various exemptions from military service, and mandating that a city which Israel fights (outside of Canaan) should have all of its males slaughtered, with women taken as spoils of war. The Canaanites, on the other hand, are to be completely exterminated (20) exempting only the fruit trees. Deuteronomy 21 commands the use of sacrifices to atone for blood in cases where a murderer cannot be identified, and mandates a month-long period of mourning before an Israelite warrior can have sexual relations with a female captive. It also mandates the stoning to death of rebellious children. Deuteronomy 22 orders the killing of women who cannot prove that they were virgins on their wedding night, and of both the man and woman when a man sleeps with another man's wife. It also mandates the death penalty for a man who has sexual relations with a betrothed virgin, and of the virgin if she does not cry out for help when raped. Deuteronomy 24 imposes the death penalty for the kidnapping of a fellow Israelite, and forbids putting parents to death for crimes committed by their children, and vice versa. Deuteronomy 25 allows for judges to have people punished in legal disputes by flogging, but limits the number of strikes to forty. \\"If men get into a fight with one another, and the wife of one intervenes to rescue her husband from the grip of his opponent by reaching out and seizing his genitals, you shall cut off her hand; show no pity\\" (25:11-12).https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+25&version;=NIV This chapter also urges the extermination of the Amalekites (verses 17-19). Deuteronomy 28 contains blessing and curses: blessing, including the defeat of Israel's enemies, if Israel obeys; and curses if Israel disobeys. These curses include disease, famine, defeat and death in warfare, insanity, abuse and robbery, enslavement, and cannibalism due to extreme hunger. Similar threats appear in the following chapter (29) and in Deuteronomy 32. Book of Joshua The Taking of Jericho (Jean Fouquet, c.1452‚Äì1460) God commands Joshua to take possession of Canaan (Joshua 1). The Jericho-woman Rahab aids two Israelite spies, and she and her family are promised to be spared in the coming conquest. The Israelites enter Canaan, carrying with them the Ark of the Covenant. Joshua conquers the city of Jericho. The city is burned, and apart from Rahab's family, every person, ox, sheep and donkey is killed (Joshua 6). Joshua attempts to capture the city of Ai, but fails (Joshua 7). A second attempt, advised by God, succeeds. The city is set on fire and all the inhabitants are killed (Joshua 8). Several kings ally together to fight the Israelites. The people of Gibeon, learning of the city's destruction, tricks the Israelites into a peace-treaty. When Joshua learns of the trickery, he curses the Gibeonites (Joshua 9). When the king of Jerusalem hears of the treaty, he and several other kings attack Gibeon, who then call on Joshua for help. God attacks Joshua's enemies with hailstones, the Israelites are victorious, and the enemy kings are captured. Joshua goes on to conquer more cities but never completes the conquest (Joshua 10). More kings gather to fight the Israelites. The Israelites defeat and kill them all. Joshua 11 commands the hamstringing of horses. Joshua finishes most of the conquest of Canaan, with the exception of Gibeon and possibly some Canaanites and Amelakites: \\"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses.\\" \\"And the land had rest from war\\" (Joshua 11). The tribe of Manasseh is given cities with Canaanites they can't drive out, but Joshua tells them that they will be able to (Joshua 17). In Joshua 20, God tells Joshua to assign Cities of Refuge, so that \\"the manslayer that killeth any person through error and unawares may flee thither; and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.\\" Book of Judges Jephthah's Daughter, c. 1896-1902, by James Jacques Joseph Tissot (French, 1836-1902) or follower, gouache on board, 11 5/16 x 7 in. (28.9 x 17.8 cm), at the Jewish Museum, New York The Book of Judges contains a number of violent incidents. There is a graphic description of the assassination of the Moabite King Eglon, who defecates while rolls of his fat suck in the blade used to kill him (Judges 3:22). Later on, Jael hammers a tent peg into an enemy commander's head while he slept after fleeing from a battle (Judges 4:21). During a time of conflict with Ammon, Jephthah makes a vow to God that he will sacrifice whatever comes first out of the house and ends up sacrificing his own daughter (Judges 11). Towards the end of the book, an unnamed Levite's concubine is raped, and dies shortly afterwards. The Levite dismembers her, and has parts of her body distributed across Israel to inform people about what happened (Judges 19:29). This triggers a civil war between the Benjamites and the Israelites that kills thousands of people. Books of Samuel In the Books of Samuel, The Israelites war with the Philistines and are defeated at the Battle of Aphek. The Philistines capture the Ark of the Covenant, but God makes his displeasure known, and they later return it. The ark arrives at Beth-shemesh, where God slays fifty thousand men for gazing upon it (1 Samuel 6). Samuel urges Israel's people to \\"put away the foreign gods\\" and serve only God, which they do. The Philistines attack and are defeated at Mizpah. Saul is made king of Israel and wars with many enemies. Samuel commands Saul \\"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass\\" (1 Samuel 15:3). Saul does not fully obey, which angers God and Samuel. Samuel kills the captured Agag, king of the Amalekites. David raises the head of Goliath. Josephine Pollard (1899) David, anointed king in secret (1 Samuel 16), comes into Saul's service and \\"loved him greatly\\". The Philistines attack Israel, David slays their champion Goliath, and they flee. David becomes popular, which makes Saul fear him and plot his death. David and Saul's daughter Michal wish to marry, and Saul asks for a dowry of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines. David delivers two hundred, and becomes the king's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18). Saul again wishes David dead, but they are reconciled by Saul's son Jonathan. War comes again, David is victorious. Saul again wants to kill David, and he flees with help from his wife. Saul searches for him and slays the inhabitants of the city Nob for aiding David (1 Samuel 22). David defeats the Philistines at Keilah, then flees the city pursued by Saul (1 Samuel 22). David and Saul reconcile. David seeks refuge with Achish, king of Gath, and claims he is raiding Judah but is actually raiding and killing in other places (1 Samuel 27). The Philistines begins a war against Saul. David's wives Ahinoam and Abigail are taken in a raid on Ziklag, but he rescue them (1 Samuel 30). The men of Israel flee before the Philistines, and three of Saul's sons are slain. Saul asks his armour-bearer to kill him, but is refused, so he takes his own life. The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead (1 Samuel 31). A man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son Ish- bosheth (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband Palti. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called Uzzah carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6). David defeats and plunder several enemies, and \\"executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.\\" (2 Samuel 8). The children of Ammon mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10). In order to make Bathsheba his wife, David successfully plots the death of her husband. This displeases God, and David is told that \\"the sword shall never depart from thy house.\\" God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to Solomon. David conquers and plunders the city Rabbah (2 Samuel 11-12). David's son Amnon rapes his half-sister Tamar. Absalom, her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the Battle of the Wood of Ephraim, and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). Sheba son of Bichri revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20). In 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including \\"the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul\\", though he spares Sauls grandson Mephibosheth. More wars take place. 2 Samuel 23 names and praises several of David's warriors. The Prophets and Psalms Characters like Phinehas (Num. 25), Elijah (1 kg. 18:39‚Äì40; 2 kg. 1), and Elisha (2 kg. 2:23‚Äì25; 9) killed, ordered killing, participated in killing and foretold killing in the name of God. Elijah called down fire from Heaven to consume the sacrifice, then followed this display of God's power by catching and personally killing all the prophets of Baal; he twice called the fire down from heaven to consume the Captain and the fifty men with him sent by the King (2 Kings 1:10); Elisha called bears from the woods to maul the 42 \\"youths\\" who mocked him, and visited leprosy on Gehazi his deceitful servant, (2 Kings 5:27); Amos pronounces judgment on the nations including Israel offering a vision of Divine judgment that includes a swarm of locusts and divine fire; Ezekiel said, \\"The word of the Lord came to me\\" repeatedly pronouncing violent judgment against the nations and Israel, and a feminist interpretation of the book of Nahum speaks of the \\"rape\\" of Ninevah, the book's \\"fascination with war, and the glee with which it calls for revenge.\\" As a response to the violence of the wicked, numerous psalms call on God to bring vengeance on one's personal enemies, for example Ps. 109 calls for vengeance on the entire family as \\"payment\\" to the Psalmist's accusers beginning with his children , including his wife and all his ancestors . Psalm 137 speaks against Babylon and expresses a desire to dash \\"their infants against the rocks\\". In the New Testament A 19th century rendition of the Cleansing of the Temple. Gospels In the Gospel of Matthew, Herod the Great is described as ordering the execution of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem. There are sayings of Jesus where he states that he comes to bring fire or a sword. The cleansing of the Temple is considered to be a violent action by Jesus.War, A Catholic Dictionary: Containing some Account of the Doctrine, Discipline, Rites, Ceremonies, Councils, and Religious Orders of the Catholic Church, W. E Addis, T. Arnold, Revised T. B Scannell and P. E Hallett, 15th Edition, Virtue & Co, 1953, Nihil Obstat: Reginaldus Philips, Imprimatur: E. Morrogh Bernard, 2 October 1950, \\"In the Name of God : Violence and Destruction in the World's Religions\\", M. Jordan, 2006, p. 40 There are also sayings of Jesus that oppose violence, such as Turning the other cheek and the passage about Jesus and the woman taken in adultery. The earliest detailed accounts of the killing of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels, with other implicit references in the New Testament epistles. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus predicts his death in three separate episodes.St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith by Michael Keene 2002 pages 24‚Äì25 All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, initial trial at the Sandhedrin and final trial at Pilate's court, where Jesus is flogged, forced to carry his cross through Jerusalem, and then crucified. The metaphor of sacrifice is used in reference to His death, both in the Gospels and other books of the New Testament. In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.Powell, Mark A. Introducing the New Testament. Baker Academic, 2009. Christ on the Cross. 19th century painting by Gustave Dor√© Apocalypse The Book of Revelation is full of imagery of war, genocide, and destruction. It describes the Apocalypse, the last judgment of all the nations and people by God, which includes plagues, war, and economic collapse. Some other books of the Gospels also use apocalyptic language and forms. Scholars define this as language that \\"views the future as a time when divine saving and judging activity will deliver God's people out of the present evil order into a new order...This transformation will be cataclysmic and cosmic.\\" Whenever Jesus calls people to a new vision in light of God's impending kingdom, judgment, or a future resurrection, he is using apocalyptic speech. For example, Jesus uses apocalyptic speech in Matthew 10:15 when he says \\"it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,\\" and in Mark 14:62, where he alludes to the book of Daniel with himself in the future \\"sitting at the right hand of God.\\" Bailey and Vander Broek go on to say, \\"In the material about John the Baptizer there also appear apocalyptic images: 'the wrath to come' (Luke 3:7); 'the axe ... lying at the root of the tree' (Luke 3:9); the Coming One with 'winnowing fork ... in His hand' (Luke 3:17); and chaff burning with 'unquenchable fire' (Luke 3:17).\\" Charles B. Strozier, psychoanalyst historian says: \\"The most troubling dimension of 'endism' is its relation to violence. ... fundamentalists generally believe... transformation can only be accomplished violently, and that the move from our time into the next requires mass death and destruction when '...this earth will be purged in the fires of God's anger, that Jesus will return, and that a new heaven and a new earth will be reborn'\\". The Book of Revelation has been used to justify violence and has served as an inspiration of revolutionary movements. Theological reflections and responses Texts of violence have produced a wide variety of theological responses. Various views As part of the many reflections on religious violence inspired by the Abrahamic religions that followed 9/11, John J. Collins wrote a short book called \\"Does the Bible Justify Violence?\\". In the book he reviews the passages in the Bible describing violence done by God, commanded or promised by God, and done by people, as well as how these texts have been used by religious people and governments throughout history. For example, he discusses The Exodus and the conquest of the Canaanites in the subsequent Book of Joshua, as two sides of the same coin; the Exodus story has inspired hope for millennia as well as civil rights movements; at the same time people identifying with the liberated Israel supported by God have cited the conquest to justify actions ranging from genocide of indigenous peoples to Apartheid. Collins concludes that the Bible speaks in many voices and answers his question as follows: \\"....historically people have appealed to the Bible precisely because of its presumed divine authority, which gives an aura of certitude to any position it can be shown to support -- in the phrase of Hannah Arendt, 'God-like certainty that stops all discussion.' And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation.\\" Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes: \\"It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded. Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations.\\" Regina Schwartz is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote: \\"The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the \\"Old Testament,\\" vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the \\"New Testament,\\" vast numbers are colonized (converted). The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude). Near the end of her book, she wrote: \\"My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity. It would be a Bible embracing multiplicity instead of monotheism.\\" Stephen Geller notes that both the Deuteronomist and the Priestly authors working in the Axial Age were re-evaluating and reformulating their traditions, like their neighbors were, using the literary means available to them. The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity‚Äîthe one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so. Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the Day of Atonement when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness. In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of Nadab and Abihu when God refused their \\"strange offering\\" and consumed them with fire. One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek: \\"Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies‚Äô straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us out to where we can never return.\\" Evan Fales, Professor of Philosophy, calls the doctrine of substitutionary atonement that some Christians use to understand the crucifixion of Jesus, \\"psychologically pernicious\\" and \\"morally indefensible\\". Fales founds his argument on John Locke‚Äôs statement that revelation must conform to our understanding. Philosopher and Professor Alvin Plantinga says this rests upon seeing God as a kind of specially talented human being. Historian Philip Jenkins (quoting Phyllis Trible) says the Bible is filled with \\"texts of terror\\" but he also asserts these texts are not to be taken literally. Jenkins says eighth century BCE historians added them to embellish their ancestral history and get readers' attention. Old Testament scholar Ellen Davis is concerned by what she calls a \\"shallow reading\\" of Scripture, particularly of 'Old Testament' texts concerning violence, which she defines as a \\"reading of what we think we already know instead of an attempt to dig deeper for new insights and revelations.\\" She says these difficult texts typically have internal correctives that support an educative reading. The problem of evil Discussions of bible and violence often lead to discussions of the theodicy - the question of how evil can persist in the world if God is all-powerful, all- knowing, and good. Philosopher Eleonore Stump says the larger context of God permitting suffering for good purposes in a world where evil is real allows for such events as the killing of those intending evil and God to still be seen as good. Jon Levenson resolves the problem of evil by describing God's power not as static, but as unfolding in time: \\"the operative dichotomy, thus, is not that between limitation and omnipotence, but that which lies between omnipotence as a static attribute and omnipotence as a dramatic enactment: the absolute power of God realizing itself achievement and relationship. What the biblical theology of dramatic omnipotence shares with the theology of a limited God is a frank recognition of God's setbacks, in contrast to the classic theodicies with their exaggerated commitment to divine impassibility and their tendency to describe imperfection solely to human free will, the recalcitrance of matter, or the like.\\" Genesis and violence at creation Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal impression from the eighth century BC identified by several sources as a possible depiction of the slaying of Tiamat from the En√ªma Eli≈° In 1895 Hermann Gunkel observed that most Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) creation stories contain a theogony depicting a god doing combat with other gods thus including violence in the founding of their cultures. For example, in the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Elish, the first step of creation has Marduk fighting and killing Tiamat, a chaos monster, to establish order. Kenneth A. Mathews says, \\"It has been typical of scholarship since Gunkel's Sch√∂pfung und Chaos (1895) to interpret Genesis 1's subjugation of 'the deep' and division of the 'waters' as a remnant of the battle motif between Marduk and watery Tiamat, which was taken up by the Hebrew author and demythologized, [but] most contemporary scholars now see the association of the Hebrew teh√¥m ('deep,' 1:2) with Tiamat as superficial.\\" \\"The fact [the Genesis creation account] was likely part of the last stages of the creation of the Pentateuch may indicate that the portrait of God in Gen. 1:1‚Äì2:4a was normative for those who gave the Old Testament canon its present shape. Hence, it seems that the account of God creating without violence in Gen. 1:1‚Äì2:4a ‚Äúnow serves as the overture to the entire Bible, dramatically relativizing the other cosmologies.\\" Canaanite creation stories like the Enuma Elish use very physical terms such as \\"tore open,\\" \\"slit,\\" \\"threw down,\\" \\"smashed,\\" and \\"severed\\" whereas in the Hebrew Bible, Leviathan is not so much defeated as domesticated. Theologian Christopher Hays says Hebrew stories use a term for dividing (b√¢dal; separate, make distinct) that is an abstract concept more reminiscent of a Mesopotamian tradition using non-violence at creation. Most modern scholars agree that \\"Gen. 1:1‚Äì2:4a narrates a story of God creating without violence or combat. In [the Genesis] account, the elements do not represent rival deities, and the story declares the creation ‚Äúgood‚Äù (Gen. 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is more, in Gen. 1:1‚Äì2:4a the elements participate in the process of ordering at God's invitation (Gen. 1:9, 11, 20).‚Äù Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann says \\"God's characteristic action is to \\"speak\\"... God \\"calls the world into being\\"... \\"The way of God with his world is the way of language.\\" These stories in Genesis are not the only stories about creation in the Bible. In Proverbs 8, for example one reads of personified Wisdom being present and participant in creation. There is also what is called the \\"agon\\" (meaning struggle or combat) model of creation in and in which God has victory in battle over the monsters of the sea. Historian theologian Christopher Hays says, there is similarity to the Canaanite myths in these Hebrew verses. However, he also says the differences are more pronounced than the similarities. Hays says Enuma Elish and Memphite theology are focused on a certain locale, where Genesis one does not mention a location (Isaiah 66:1); as has been noted, there is no theogeny in Genesis; and in the Canaanite stories the creators are glorified by being identified with other known deities whereas in Genesis, YHWH is glorified by the denial of other deities. The intent of Genesis 1:1-2n concerning \\"creation from nothing\\" is disputed. Jon Levenson, writing Jewish biblical theology, asserts the creation stories in Genesis are not ex nihilo, but rather a generation of order out of chaos, similar to other ANE creation myths; the order allows life to flourish and holds back chaos which brings violence and destruction, which has never been obliterated and is always breaking back in. He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible referred to God's actions at creation as a statement of faith in a God who could protect and maintain them, or who could also step back and allow chaos to rush back in, as God did with the Flood. He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible also held up God's actions at creation as a challenge for God to act, and a challenge for themselves to work in covenant with God in the ongoing work of generating and maintaining order. In this, the Bible story is dissimilar to the both the Memphite story and the Babylonian in that the Hebrew Bible says the divine gift of working with God in creation is limited to humankind, meaning, for the Hebrews, humans alone are part of God's being. This sense of honoring or empowering humankind is not in any of the Mesopotamian or Canaanite myths. Warfare from Genesis through Joshua Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel Warfare represents a special category of biblical violence and is a topic the Bible addresses, directly and indirectly, in four ways: there are verses that support pacifism, and verses that support non-resistance; 4th century theologian Augustine found the basis of just war in the Bible, and preventive war which is sometimes called crusade has also been supported using Bible texts. Susan Niditch explores the range of war ideologies in ancient Near Eastern culture saying, \\"...To understand attitudes toward war in the Hebrew Bible is thus to gain a handle on war in general...\\" In the Hebrew Bible warfare includes the Amalekites, Canaanites, Moabites, and the record in Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and both books of Kings. In the Bible God commands the Israelites to conquer the Promised Land, placing city after city \\"under the ban\\" -which meant every man, woman and child was supposed to be slaughtered at the point of the sword.. For example, in Deuteronomy 20:16-18 God orders the Israelites to \\"not leave alive anything that breathes‚Ä¶ completely destroy them ‚Ä¶\\",Ruttenberg, Danya, Jewish Choices, Jewish Voices: War and National Security Danya Ruttenberg (Ed.) page 54 (citing Reuven Kimelman, \\"The Ethics of National Power: Government and War from the Sources of Judaism\\", in Perspectives, Feb 1987, pp 10-11) thus leading many scholars to characterize these as commands to commit genocide.Grenke, Arthur, God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries, pp 17-30 Other examples include the story of the Amalekites (Numbers 13,14),A. G. Hunter \\"Denominating Amalek: Racist stereotyping in the Bible and the Justification of Discrimination\\", in Sanctified aggression: legacies of biblical and post biblical vocabularies of violence, Jonneke Bekkenkamp, Yvonne Sherwood (Eds.). 2003, Continuum Internatio Publishing Group, pp 92-108 the story of the Midianites (Numbers 25,26), and the battle of Jericho (Joshua 1-6). Starting in Joshua 9, after the conquest of Ai, the battles are described as defending against attacks from Canaanite kings. Hans Van Wees says the conquest campaigns are largely fictional. In the archaeological community, the Battle of Jericho has been thoroughly studied, and the consensus of modern scholars is the battles described in the Book of Joshua are not realistic, are not supported by the archeological record, and are not consistent with other texts in the Bible; for example, the Book of Joshua (chapter 10) describes the extermination of the Canaanite tribes, yet at a later time Judges 1:1-2:5 suggests that the extermination was not complete.Ehrlich, pp 117-119 Historian Paul Copan and philosopher Matthew Flannagan say the violent texts of ·∏•erem warfare are \\"hagiographic hyperbole\\", a kind of historical writing found in the Book of Joshua and other Near Eastern works of the same era and are not intended to be literal, contain hyperbole, formulaic language, and literary expressions for rhetorical effect‚Äîlike when sports teams use the language of ‚Äútotally slaughtering‚Äù their opponents. John Gammie concurs, saying the Bible verses about \\"utterly destroying\\" the enemy are more about pure religious devotion than an actual record of killing people. Gammie references Deuteronomy 7:2-5 in which Moses presents ·∏•erem as a precondition for Israel to occupy the land with two stipulations: one is a statement against intermarriage (vv. 3‚Äì4), and the other concerns the destruction of the sacred objects of the residents of Canaan (v. 5) but neither involves killing. C. L. Crouch compares the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah to Assyria, saying their similarities in cosmology and ideology gave them similar ethical outlooks on war. Both Crouch and Lauren Monroe, professor of Near Eastern studies at Cornell, agree this means the ·∏•erem type of total war was not strictly an Israelite practice but was a common approach to war for many Near Eastern people of the Bronze and Iron Ages. For example, the Mesha Stele says that King Mesha of Moab fought in the name of his god Chemosh and that he subjected his enemies to ·∏•erem. The Book of Judges and violence against women The Levite finds his concubine lying on the doorstep, James Tissot Deborah the Judge, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico Violence against women appears throughout the Old Testament. Many have attributed this to a patriarchal society, while some scholars say the problem stems from the larger context of a male dominated culture. Women are treated in differing ways in the Bible. For example, the Book of Judges includes the judge Deborah, who was honored, as well as two of the most egregious examples in the Bible of violence against women: Jephthah‚Äôs daughter (Judg. 11:29‚Äì40) and the Levite‚Äôs concubine (Judg. 19). Scholar author Phyllis Trible looks at these instances from the perspective of the victim making their pathos palpable, underlying their human reality, and the tragedy of their stories. Some feminist critiques of Judges say the Bible gives tacit approval to violence against women by not speaking out against these acts. O'Connor says women in the Old Testament generally serve as points of reference for the larger story, yet Judges abounds with stories where women play the main role. O'Connor explains the significance of this, saying: \\"The period between the death of Joshua and the anointing of Saul...was a period of uncertainty and danger... lack of human leadership is viewed as disastrous, for when \\"every one does what is right in their own eyes, the results are awful\\" and that is illustrated by the violent acts against women recorded in Judges. Beginning with the larger context and tracing the decline of Israel by following the deteriorating status of women and the violence done to them, which progresses from the promise of life in the land to chaos and violence, the effects of the absence of authority such as a king (Judges 21:25) is reflected in the violence against women that occurs when government fails and social upheaval occurs. Non-violence and Shalom The term for peace in the Hebrew Bible is SH-L-M.Abraham Even-Shoshan, A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible: Hebrew and Aramaic Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms (Kiryat Sepher Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1986 edition) It is used to describe prophetic vision of ideal conditions, and theologians have built on passages referencing it to advocate for various forms of social justice. The violence of Hell The concept of hell as a place of punishment in the afterlife arose in Second Temple Judaism and was further developed in the Christian tradition; Judaism subsequently moved away from this notion. There are Hebrew Bible verses indicating early Jewish thought did contain some belief in an afterlife. For example, Isaiah 26:14 which is part of proto-Isaiah (chapters 1‚Äì39), speaks of \\"the dead who live no more\\" as being \\"punished and destroyed\\". And Daniel 12:2‚Äì3, which is generally believed to date to the second century BCE, asserts \\"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt.\\" More evidence comes from Maccabees, written in the second century BCE, and by the first century CE, friction between the Sadducees and the Pharisees over this issue is documented by both the New Testament writers and Josephus giving evidence of its presence in Jewish thought. The word Sheol appears 65 times in the Hebrew Bible and the term \\"Tartaros\\" appears frequently in Jewish apocalyptic literature where it refers to a place where the wicked are punished. In the New Testament there are three words translated Hell: the Greek word hades, which is a general equivalent of the Hebrew Sheol, is used to identify the temporary place of the unsaved after death but is not used in relationship to the lake of fire or eternal punishment; gehenna is uniformly translated Hell and refers to eternal punishment; and one occurrence of tartaros appears in 2 Peter 2:4 and is considered equivalent to gehenna. All the references to gehenna (except James 3:6) are spoken by Jesus himself. A literal interpretation involves violence. Jesus also taught punishment in Hell would be by degrees (an idea Dante later developed) with one servant receiving a lighter beating than others, hypocrites receiving more condemnation than others, and so on. According to a statement by the publisher of \\"Four Views on Hell\\", Zondervan, \\"probably the most disturbing concept in Christian tradition is the prospect that one day vast numbers of people will be consigned to Hell.\\" C.S. Lewis argued that people choose Hell rather than repent and submit to God. Miroslav Wolf argues that the doctrine of final judgment provides a necessary restraint on human violence. Tim Keller says it is right to be angry when someone brings injustice or violence to those we love and therefore a loving God can be filled with wrath because of love, not in spite of it. Oliver O'Donovan argues that without the judgment of God we would never see the love in redemption. Marcionism and supersessionism As the early Christian Church began to distinguish itself from Judaism, the \\"Old Testament\\" and a portrayal of God in it as violent and unforgiving were sometimes contrasted rhetorically with certain teachings of Jesus to portray an image of God as more loving and forgiving, which was framed as a new image. Marcion of Sinope, in the early second century, developed an early Christian dualist belief system that understood the god of the Old Testament and creator of the material universe, who he called the Demiurge, as an altogether different being than the God about whom Jesus spoke. Marcion considered Jesus' universal God of compassion and love, who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy, incompatible with Old Testament depictions of divinely ordained violence. Accordingly, he did not regard the Hebrew scriptures as part of his scriptural canon.Metzger, Bruce. Canon of the NT ; The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 characterized Marcion as \\"perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known.\\"; Harnack's Origin of the New Testament: \\"Marcion, on the contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that ‚Äúfollows the Testament of the Creator-God,‚Äù and directs the full force of his attack against this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the Pauline Epistles by the original Apostles and the writers of the Gospels. He would necessarily have dealt with the two Testaments of the Catholic Church if the Church had already possessed a New Testament. His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side with the Old Testament, had ipso facto placed the latter under the shelter of the former. In fact Marcion‚Äôs position towards the Catholic Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any ‚Äúlitera scripta Novi Testamenti.‚Äù\\" Marcion's teaching was repudiated by Tertullian in five treatises titled \\"Against Marcion\\" and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the Church. Supersessionist Christians have continued to focus on violence in the Hebrew Bible while ignoring or giving little attention to violence in the New Testament. Sociological reflections and responses Jo≈æe Kra≈°ovec described the ancient near eastern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god. From this foundation arose notions of flourishing of the nation as a whole, as well as collective punishment of the ancient Israelites and their enemies. He cites the following examples of collective punishment (of descendants) in the Bible: ::Ex 20:5 - \\"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.\\" ::Deut 5:9-10 ::Exodus 34:6-7: \\"And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, \\"The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.\\" ::Deuteronomy 7:9-10 - \\"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.\\" ::Jeremiah 32:18 - \\" You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty\\" Scholar Nur Masalha writes that the \\"genocide\\" of the extermination commandments has been \\"kept before subsequent generations\\" and served as inspirational examples of divine support for slaughtering enemies.Masalha, Nur, The Bible and Zionism: invented traditions, archaeology and post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel, Volume 1, Zed Books, 2007, pp 273-276: :\\"Prior revisits the old ground [in his book The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique] ‚Ä¶ First, the biblical narrative, with its 'divine promise' was inherently linked with the mandate to ethnically cleanse or exterminate the indigenous people ‚Ä¶ third, in the narrative of the Book of Deuteronomy the divine command to commit 'genocide' is explicit. Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua. These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers‚Ä¶. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such genocidal massacres never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy‚Ä¶. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, ‚Ä¶ Prior ‚Ä¶ found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic. Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies‚Ä¶. Today, both Christian Zionists in the West and Israeli messianics continue to refer to the Hebrew Scriptures for archetypal conflicts, which guide their attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine: the Palestinian Muslims and Christians.\\" Masalha refers to: Prior, Michael P., The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique, Sheffield Academic Press, 1997. Arthur Grenke quotes historian, author and scholar David Stannard: \\"Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16‚Äì17). ... According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the ... destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas. It was this view that also led to the destruction of European Jewry. Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.Grenke, Arthur, God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries, New Academia Publishing, LLC, 2005, pp 17‚Äì18: \\"Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament.

Chalk and Jonassohn say the Old Testament contains cases they would consider genocide (if they were factual) because of women and children being killed even though it was war and casualties in war are excluded from the definition of genocide. They also say: \\"The evidence for genocide in antiquity is circumstantial, inferential, and ambiguous, and it comes to us exclusively from the perpetrators.\\" Historian and author William T. Cavanaugh says every society throughout history has contained both hawks and doves. Cavanaugh and John Gammie say laws like those in Deuteronomy probably reflect Israel's internal struggle over such differing views of how to wage war. Arie Versluis says, \\"...indigenous populations have also appealed to the command (in Deut.7) in order to expel their colonizers. This is shown by the example of Te Kooti...in the nineteenth century who viewed the Maori as the Israelites and the colonizers as the Canaanites.\\" Scholar Leonard B. Glick states that Jewish fundamentalists in Israel, such as Shlomo Aviner, consider the Palestinians to be like biblical Canaanites, and that some fundamentalist leaders suggest that they \\"must be prepared to destroy\\" the Palestinians if the Palestinians do not leave the land.Glick, Leonard B., \\"Religion and Genocide\\", in The Widening circle of genocide, Alan L. Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46::\\"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness. The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people. As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way‚Ä¶. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God. Here, for example, is Shlomo Aviner, a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim ‚Ä¶ movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites. There is only one catch. The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'. Others have identified the Palestinians as 'Canaanites' who are engaged in a 'suicidal' struggle opposing God's own intentions; hence the Jewish people must be prepared to destroy them if they persist in pursuing their collective 'death-wish'.\\" Several scholars draw similar conclusions.Whitelam, Keith W., The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history, Routledge, 1996, especially pp 71‚Äì121. Cited by Ehrlich, pp 117 \\"Keith Whitelam (1996) has published a book [The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history] in which he has implied that the modern European imperialist Zionist Jewish movement has drawn inspiration from the biblical conquest tradition ‚Ä¶ Parallels are thus drawn in Whitelam's thought between the genocidal Israelites presumably of Joshua's day and the racist Zionists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and also between the ancient Canaanites and the modern Palestinians ‚Ä¶ the interpretations attributed to [Whitelam] of the place of the book of Joshua and its ‚Ä¶ genocidal account of Israel's emergence in the land that it claims as its own pose a challenge to Judaism‚Ä¶. It thus behooves us to ask ‚Ä¶ how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?‚Ä¶.\\"Boustan, Ra'anan S., Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity, Brill, 2010, page 4-5 :\\"Later readers of the Bible dramatically transformed this divine directive [Deut 20:15-18] through hermeneutic alignment of the Canaanites with the current detested 'other'. Thus the Canaanites have been identified with ‚Ä¶ Palestinians (by militant Zionists), and scores of other 'enemies' of Israel. In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan. The violent legacy of the Bible is a product of both its own violent narrative and the hermeneutics of violence applied to it\\". Ren√© Girard, historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science says that, \\"desire is mimetic (i.e. all of our desires are borrowed from other people), that all conflict originates in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), that the scapegoat mechanism is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human culture, and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry, and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.\\" Philosopher, sociologist, theologian and author Jacques Ellul says: \\"I believe that the biblical teaching is clear. It always contests political power. It incites to \\"counterpower,\\" to \\"positive\\" criticism, to an irreducible dialogue (like that between king and prophet in Israel), to antistatism, to a decentralizing of the relation, to an extreme relativizing of everything political, to an anti- ideology, to a questioning of all that claims either power or dominion (in other words, of all things political)...Throughout the Old Testament we see God choosing what is weak and humble to represent him (the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.).

Life Colfe was the fourth son of Amandus, Almantius, or Aymon Colfe and his wife, Catherine Bradfield, and uncle of Abraham Colfe. He was born in Canterbury in or before 1560. His father and mother, who were zealous Protestants, had a considerable estate at Guisnes, which they lost on the reconquest of Calais by the French in 1558. They came over to England, lived in a house outside the West-gate of Canterbury, afterwards occupied by their third son Joseph, Mayor of Canterbury, and were both buried in Westgate Church. Isaac was entered as a commoner of Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1576, and proceeded B. A. on 17 Feb. 1580, and M. A. on 4 July 1582.

He also served as a Union Army officer during the American Civil War. Biography He was born on July 19, 1830 in Ellisburgh, New York. The corruption scandal was brought forth after George W. Swepson and Littlefield defrauded the state by $4 million, after the North Carolina Legislature of granted $27.8 million in Railroad bonds. Along with Swepson, Littlefield was indicted for the fraud but was never convicted. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 Littlefield organized a company of infantry, which became Company F of the 14th Illinois Infantry, and was elected as its Captain. After serving in the west at Shiloh and Corinth, Littlefield was made Lieutenant Colonel of the new 14th Illinois Cavalry. In 1863 he was sent to the South, briefly commanded the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, a colored unit, and was ordered to recruit black troops. Littlefield raised the 4th South Carolina Infantry(African Descent); whose Colonel he became. When the United States Colored Troops were organized his regiment became the 21st USCT Infantry. On November 26, 1864 Littlefield was given a brevet promotion to Brigadier General of Volunteers. He served as brigade and district commander and was mustered out on April 25, 1866. He died on March 7, 1899.  Further cases  According to a court record filed on March 29, 1886, on March 18, 1872, John H. Miller sued Littlefield in Duval County, Florida over a debt of fifty thousand dollars. His lust for profiteering was exhibited in his Civil War service, having charge of recruitment of black troops in the Department of the South, he sought to have freedmen pressed into service and appropriated the enlistment bounty many of these 'recruits' were due. Allegedly he used these misappropriations to fund these financial schemes. There were also related findings with the Pensacola, Florida Railroad lines, as well as suits involving Calvin Littlefield, who filed to have the bonds given over to him.

Life William Stewart was great-grandson of one of the illegitimate sons of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan. He was educated like his namesake William Stewart (1479‚Äì1545), the future bishop of Aberdeen, at the University of St Andrews. Destined for the church, he later became a courtier. In 1527 he held a pension from James V of Scotland, and the last payment (of ¬£40) was recorded in the accounts of 1541. He died before 1560. Works Stewart wrote a number of advice poems for the young James V of Scotland, and a verse translation of Hector Boece's Latin History of Scotland. He was the poet mentioned twice in David Lindsay of the Mount's Complaynt of the Papingo. Stewart was also mentioned by John Rolland in his prologue to the Seven Sages.Turnbull, vol. 1, (1858), pp. ix-xiii. There were two students with this name at St Andrews University at the same time, giving rise to possible confusions of identity; in the Buik of Chronicles, Stewart said he was a student there for 14 years. Although it has usually been assumed the poet and minor courtier Stewart wrote both the translation and the court poems, the critic Matthew McDiarmid attributed the translation to the other William Stewart, the bishop.MacDonald (1996), p. 182 fn. 11, citing Jack, RDS, ed., History of Scottish Literature, vol. 1 (1988), p. 36. Court poetry Some of Stewart's surviving poems describe life in the Stewart court, and play on the frustration felt by courtiers hoping for royal favour and reward. This stanza is from First Lerges, (largesse) referring to New Year gifts expected from the Scottish exchequer;MacDonald (1996), 196. > The thesaur and compttrollar, > Thay bade me cum I wait nocht quhair, > And thay suld gar I wait nocht quhay, > Gif me I wat nocht quhat full fair, > For lerges of this new yeirday, >    > The Treasurer and Comptroller > They call me come: I know not where, > And they would do: I know not why/who, > Give me I know not what, full fair, > For largesse of this New Year's Day.See the whole poem here (Bannatyne > Manuscript): Craigie, W. A., ed., Maitland Folio Manuscript, vol. 1, STS > (1919), 248-9. Translation of Boece A metrical version of the Latin history of Scotland Hector Boece was commissioned by James V or his mother Margaret Tudor. The work had been published in Latin at Paris in 1527. James V requested John Bellenden to translate it into Scots prose and Stewart into Scots verse. Bellenden's version appeared in 1536, but Stewart's, which was begun in 1531, remained in manuscript until 1858, when it was published in the Rolls Series; it was edited by William Barclay Turnbull from a unique manuscript which, after being in the possession of Hew Craufurd of Cloverhill, Bishop John Moore, and George I, went to Cambridge University Library.

An oxaziridine is an organic molecule that features a three-membered heterocycle containing oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. In their largest application, oxaziridines are intermediates in the industrial production of hydrazine. Oxaziridine derivatives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of oxidations, including alpha hydroxylation of enolates, epoxidation and aziridination of olefins, and other heteroatom transfer reactions. Oxaziridines also serve as precursors to amides and participate in [3+2] cycloadditions with various heterocumulenes to form substituted five-membered heterocycles. Chiral oxaziridine derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to prochiral enolates as well as other substrates. Some oxaziridines also have the property of a high barrier to inversion of the nitrogen, allowing for the possibility of chirality at the nitrogen center. History Oxaziridine derivatives were first reported in the mid-1950s by Emmons and subsequently by Krimm and Horner and J√ºrgens. Whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as nucleophiles due to their high electronegativity, oxaziridines allow for electrophilic transfer of both heteroatoms. This unusual reactivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak N-O bond. Nucleophiles tend to attack at the aziridine nitrogen when the nitrogen substituent is small (R1= H), and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen substituent has greater steric bulk. The unusual electronics of the oxaziridine system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including, but not limited to: Œ±-hydroxylation of enolates, epoxidation of alkenes, selective oxidation of sulfides and selenides, amination of N-nucleophiles and N-acylamidation. The peroxide process for the industrial production of hydrazine through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ketones was developed in the early 1970s.. .. Chiral camphorsulfonyloxaziridines proved useful in the syntheses of complex products, such as taxol which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent. Both the Holton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total synthesis feature asymmetric Œ±-hydroxylation with camphorsulfonyloxaziridine. :A display of selected reactions that demonstrates the wide breadth of oxaziridine reactivity. Synthesis N-H, N-alkyl, N-aryloxaziridines The two main approaches to synthesis of N-H, N-alkyl, and N-aryloxaziridines are oxidation of imines with peracids (A) and amination of carbonyls (B). General oxaziridine synthesis Additionally, oxidation of chiral imines and oxidation of imines with chiral peracids may yield enantiopure oxaziridines. Some oxaziridines have the unique property of configurationally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 100 to 130 kJ/mol. Enantiopure oxaziridines where stereochemistry is entirely due to configurationally stable nitrogen are reported. N-sulfonyloxaziridines In the late 1970s and early 1980s Franklin A. Davis synthesized the first N-sulfonyloxaziridines, which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents, and are the most predominantly used class of oxaziridines today. While originally synthesized with mCPBA and the phase transfer catalyst benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, an improved synthesis using oxone as the oxidant is now most prevalent. Many N-sulfonyloxaziridines are used today, each with slightly different properties and reactivity. These reagents are summarized in the table below. Table of various N-sulfonyloxaziridine reagents Perfluorinated oxaziridines With highly electron withdrawing perfluoroalkyl substituents, oxaziridines exhibit reactivity more similar to that of dioxiranes than typical oxaziridines. Notably, perfluoroalkyloxaziridines hydroxylate certain C-H bonds with high selectivity. Perfluorinated oxaziridines may be synthesized by subjecting a perfluorinated imine to perfluoromethyl fluorocarbonyl peroxide and a metal fluoride to act as an HF scavenger. Synthesis of perfluorinated oxaziridines Reactions Hydrazine production Oxaziridines are intermediates in the peroxide process for the production of hydrazine. Many millions of kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is oxidized in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone to give the oxaziridine:Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq \\"Hydrazine\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . :Me(Et)C=O + NH3 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí Me(Et)CONH + H2O In subsequent steps the oxaziridine is converted to the hydrazone, which is the immediate in the way to hydrazine: :Me(Et)CONH + NH3 ‚Üí Me(Et)C=NNH2 \\\\+ H2O Oxygen transfer Œ±-Hydroxylation of enolates Œ±-Hydroxyketones, or acyloins, are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural products. Œ±-Hydroxyketones have been synthesized in many ways, including reduction of Œ±-diketones, substitution of a hydroxyl for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an enolate. Oxodiperoxymolybdenum(pyridine)-(hexamethylphosphoric triamide) (MoOPH) and N-sulfonyloxaziridines are the most common electrophilic sources of oxygen implemented in this process. One advantage of using N-sulfonyloxaziridines is that higher chiral induction is almost invariably observed relative to MoOPH and other oxidants. High yield (77‚Äì91%) and dr (95:5 ‚Äì 99:1) are reported for Œ±-hydroxylation with the Evans' chiral auxiliary with N-sulfonyloxaziridine as the electrophile. Chiral induction has been demonstrated with many other chiral ketones and ketones with chiral auxiliaries, including SAMP and RAMP. Evans aldol with oxaziridine Extensive work has been reported on asymmetric hydroxylation of prochiral enolates with camphorsulfonyloxaziridine derivatives, achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess. The commonly accepted proposed transition state that justifies this stereochemical outcome involves an open transition state where the steric bulk of R1 determines the face of approach. Asymmetric oxaziridine hydroxylation The selectivity of some hydroxylations may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the oxaziridine ring as oxaziridines 3b and 3c in the table above. In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal oxyanion is stabilized by chelation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton. Asymmetric oxaziridine hydroxylation with closed transition state Œ±-Hydroxylation with oxaziridines has been widely implemented in total synthesis. It is a key step in both the Holton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total synthesis. Additionally, Forsyth implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the C3-C14 (substituted 1,7-Dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-3-ene) System of okadaic acid. Alpha hydroxylation highlighted in the synthesis of okadaic acid Epoxidation of alkenes Epoxidation of alkenes is a common reaction because epoxides can be derivatized in a number of useful ways. Classically, laboratory epoxidation is carried out with mCPBA or other peracids. Oxaziridines have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides. (‚àí)-Chaetominine was synthesized via oxaziridine epoxidation as a late stage transformation as seen below. Oxaziridine epoxidation in total synthesis Another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric epoxidation. A number of asymmetric epoxidations exist: the Sharpless epoxidation, the Jacobsen-Katsuki epoxidation, and the Juli√°- Colonna epoxidation. These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity. The Sharpless epoxidation is specific to allylic alcohols, the Jacobsen epoxidation requires cis-disubstituted aryl alkenes, and the Juli√° epoxidation requires Œ±-Œ≤ unsaturated ketones. Chiral oxaziridines act stereospecifically on many unfunctionalized alkenes. It has even possible to effect stereospecific epoxidation catalytically in the oxaziridine chiral unit. Further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of enantiometic excess become practical for large scale synthesis. Lusinichi et al. have investigated asymmetric epoxidation with a chiral oxaziridinium salt using oxone as the stoichiometric oxidant seen below. Catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of trans-stillbene Hydroxylation of unactivated hydrocarbons Perfluorinated oxaziridines are known to hydroxylate unactivated hydrocarbons with remarkable regio- and diastereospecificity. This is a highly coveted transformation, and similar reactivity and specificity is seldom rivaled, especially considering the nonmetallic nature of the oxidant. Perfluorinated oxaziridines show high selectivity toward tertiary hydrogens. Hydroxylation of primary carbons and dihydroxylation of a compound with two oxidizable sites have never been observed. Retention of stereochemistry is very high, often 95 - 98%. (retenton of stereochemistry may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt). Hydroxylation of unactivated alkanes by perfluorinated oxaziridines Nitrogen transfer Oxaziridines with unsubstituted or acylated nitrogens are capable of nitrogen atom transfer, although this reactivity has received considerably less attention. Amination of N-nucleophiles Amination of nucleophiles with N-unsubstituted oxaziridines is quite versatile in the breadth of possible nucleophiles and corresponding products. Hydrazines may be derived from the amination of secondary or tertiary amines, hydroxylamine and thiohydroxamines may be formed from their corresponding alcohols and thiols, sulfimides may be formed from thioethers and Œ±-aminoketones may be formed by attack of corresponding enolates. Selected amination reactions with oxaziridine N-acylamidation The transfer of acylated amines is more difficult than that of unsubstituted amines, although, unlike amine transfer by oxaziridines, there are no alternative methods that directly transfer acylated amines. Acylamine transfer has primarily been performed using amines and hydrazines as nucleophiles. Very few transfers of acylated nitrogens to carbon nucleophiles have been successfully performed, although some do exist in the literature. Select acyl transfer reactions of oxaziridine Rearrangements Oxaziridines have been found to undergo rearrangement reactions via a radical mechanism when irradiated with UV light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as CuI. spirocylic oxaziridines undergo ring expansions to the corresponding lactam. The migrating substituent is determined by a stereoelectronic effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product. In light of this effect, it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearrangement. This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed selectivities in the rearrangements below. In the rearrangement on the left the thermodynamically unfavorable product is observed exclusively, while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored. Evidence for selectivity based on nitrogen lone pair orientation. Aub√© takes advantage of this rearrangement as the key step in his synthesis of (+)-yohimbine, a natural medicine classified by the NIH as possibly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the sexual problems caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Synthesis of (+)-Yohimbine It is also notable that oxaziridines will thermally rearrange to nitrones. Cis-trans selectivity of the resulting nitrone is poor, however, yields are good to excellent. It is thought that some oxaziridines racemize over time through a nitrone intermediate. Conversion of an oxaziridine to a nitrone. Cycloadditions with heterocumulenes Oxaziridines undergo cycloaddition reactions with heterocumulenes to afford a number of unique five membered heterocycles, as shown in the figure below. This reactivity is due to the strained three membered ring and weak N-O bond.

History  The Sachs Covered Bridge was built around 1854 at a cost of $1,544. On July 1, 1863, the bridge was crossed by the two brigades of the I Corps of the Union Army heading towards Gettysburg. The III Corps also crossed the bridge heading to the Black Horse Tavern. Four days later, the majority of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia retreated over the bridge after the Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg. The bridge was designated Pennsylvania's \\"most historic bridge\\" in 1938 by the predecessor of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the Department of Highways.Loski, p. 6. After a plan in 1960 to replace the bridge, the Cumberland Township officials voted to close the bridge to vehicular traffic, while leaving it open to pedestrians, on May 9, 1968. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1980. On June 19, 1996, a flash flood knocked the bridge from one of its abutments and it incurred substantial damage; an iron bridge on the Marsh Creek was also heavily damaged and another destroyed. A $500,000 restoration on the bridge was already in progress before the flood; an additional $100,000 was raised to repair the damage incurred. The bridge was rededicated on July 21, 1997.Loski, p. 7.  Waterworks  The Gettysburg Waterworks is the Marsh Creek site of freshwater for Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Originally constructed in 1894, the works were rebuilt by the Pennsylvania Department of Health for the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, when the site had a pumping station, a filter plant, and 4 drilled wells (1 nearly dry). The reservoir is supplied by a drainage area that is upstream of the Sachs Covered Bridge.  Design  The Sachs Covered Bridge is a Town truss covered bridge. The truss design was developed by Ithiel Town of Connecticut and consists of wooden beams \\"cris-crossed\\" to form a lattice. The bridge was one of few remaining Town truss bridges in Pennsylvania. The bridge is long and wide.

S100 proteins are a diverse calcium- binding family that regulate fundamental cellular and extracellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell migration, and the antimicrobial host defense as antimicrobial peptides. Koebnerisin (S100A15) was first identified upregulated in inflammation-prone psoriatic skin, suggesting involvement in the lesional phenotype of the disease, Koebner phenomenon. Today, the protein is of further interest because of its role in antimicrobial defence, innate immunity, epidermal cell maturation and epithelial tumorigenesis.  Function   Epithelial homeostasis and antimicrobial host defense  Skin: In normal epidermis, koebnerisin (S100A15) is expressed by epidermal basal and differentiated keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Langerhans cells. Within the pilosebaceous unit, S100A15 is found in the inner and external root sheath and the basal layer of the sebaceous gland. In the dermis, koebnerisin (S100A15) is produced by dendritic cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, as well as fibroblasts to control tissue regeneration. Breast: Koebnerisin (S100A15) is expressed by alveolar and small duct luminal cells and by epithelial-derived myoepithelial cells around acini and by surrounding blood vessels. Koebnerisin (S100A15) functions as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) reducing survival of E. coli and was strongly regulated by several bacterial components, such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Thus, koebnerisin participates in the antimicrobial host defence of the skin and in the digestive tract of breast-feeding newborns.  Epithelial carcinogenesis  Breast cancer: Koebnerisin (S100A15) is overexpressed in ER/PR negative tumors suggesting a regulation with tumor progression. The secreted koebnerisin (S100A15) acts as a chemoattractant, enhances inflammation and thus could drive breast carcinogenesis.  Inflammation  Koebnerisin (S100A15) is overexpressed in inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and eczema. It is regulated through Th1 and Th17 but not Th2 proinflammatory cytokines. When released into the extracellar space, koebnerisin (S100A15) induces inflammation. It acts as a chemoattractant for myeloid leukocytes through a pertussis toxin sensitive Gi protein coupled receptor. Koebnerisin (S100A15) amplifies inflammation with related psoriasin (S100A7) that is co-regulated and proinflammatory through RAGE.  Genomic organization and mRNA splice variants  Koebnerisin (S100A15) maps to the S100 gene cluster within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC, chromosome 1q21) and reveals an unusual genomic organization compared to other S100 members. The two alternative mRNA-isoforms of koebnerisin share the same coding region, but show differences in composition and length of adjacent untranslated regions (S100A15-short (S): 0.5 kb vs. hS100A15-long (L): 4.4 kb). Both splice variants are differently regulated in inflammatory skin diseases suggesting usage of alternate promoters.  Protein  The amino acid sequence reveals a conserved C-terminal and a variant N-terminal EF-hand typical for S100 proteins (101 amino acids, 11.305 Da, calculated pI of 7.57 kDa). Compared to most S100 proteins, koebnerisin (S100A15) is basic.  Evolution   Primate  Koebnerisin (S100A15) has lately evolved by gene duplications within the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC, chromosome 1q21) during primate evolution forming a novel S100 subfamily together with Psoriasin (S100A7). Therefore, koebnerisin is almost identical to psoriasin in sequence (>90%). Despite their high homology, koebnerisin (S100A15) and psoriasin (S100A7) are distinct in tissue distribution, regulation, structure and function and, thus exemplary for the diversity within the S100 family. Their different properties are compelling reasons to discriminate S100A15 (koebnerisin) and S100A7 (psoriasin) in epithelial homeostasis, inflammation and cancer.  Rodent  Koebnerisin (S100A15) and psoriasin (S100A7) share a common protein in mice encoded by the S100a7a15 (alias: mS100A7, mS100A15, mS100a7a) gene. It can be used to study the significance of the corresponding human proteins for epidermal maturation, inflammation and epithelial carcinogenesis.

Location and description Razor is part of the Julian Alps in Slovenia, and is bordered by the Luknja and Vr≈°iƒç passes to the east and west, and the Krnica and Trenta valleys to the north and south. Together with its neighbouring mountain Prisojnik, it serves to connect Triglav and Jalovec. It is included in Triglav National Park and is administratively part of Kranjska Gora. The mountain is located in a limestone karst region, with the Kri≈æ Plateau (Kri≈°ki podi) below it being a typical example. The area has been heavily shaped by erosion, caused by glaciation, rivers, and precipitation; as a result, it has many caves, sinkholes, and limestone pavements. Climate Razor is snow-covered from November to early June. Ascent Razor was first ascended in 1842 by botanist Otto Sendtner. Since then, numerous mountaineers have ascended the mountain. The more challenging routes are located on the mountain's northern and western faces ( high respectively) and have via ferrata sections, while the southern and eastern () faces are considered non- technical ascents. The most common routes are from the west, south, and east. Although Razor can be ascended year-round, its ascent is easier between mid June to October.

The film's title was misleading as the airliner was a Bristol Britannia turboprop-engined, not \\"pure\\" jet-powered aircraft. George Raft's biographer Everett Aaker called Jet Over the Atlantic \\"a precursor of the disaster genre.\\"Aaker 2013, p. 169. Plot Wanted on a charge of murder, Brett Matton, a war veteran, has fled the country to Spain, where he has been living for two years and is engaged to wed Jean Gurney, a former showgirl. FBI Agent Stafford arrives in Spain to arrest Brett and bring him back to the U.S. On their commercial flight to New York, the passengers include Jean, who bought a ticket at the last minute, and Lord Leverett, a man deranged by his daughter's death. Leverett brings aboard a chemical poison hidden in his bag. The handcuffed Brett is given a few minutes by Stafford to explain to Jean about his past life. His story is that two men killed a bartender, knocked him out and placed the gun in his hand. Certain he would never get a fair trial, Brett ran away. A minister on board marries Brett to Jean with the agent's permission. Brett steals a pistol from a partner of Stafford's who is asleep. He tells Jean, to avoid going to jail, he intends to hijack the airliner to Canada, landing in Montreal, at an airport he knows. The poison leaks from Leverett's case, emitting toxic fumes, and causing a fire in the cabin, killing the pilots and navigator. Former combat pilot Brett is asked to fly the aircraft. He must make an emergency landing on water and without a radio, which Leverett has damaged. Brett ends up shooting Leverett, although a grateful Stafford still insists on being given the gun. Brett takes pity on the dying passengers and lands the jet. Authorities on the ground inform Stafford that another man is being charged with the bar murder and Brett will be cleared. Cast Production Aeronaves de M√©xico was featured in Jet Over the Atlantic. The film was the first production from Inter-Continent Films and Inter-Continent Releasing, two companies formed by Benedict Bogeaus and James R. Grainger. They announced a series of films, including Jet Over the Atlantic, The Gold Bug, Shoot Out!, Early Autumn and The Glass Wall.

Retrieved: October 23, 2014. Reception Jet Over the Atlantic was primarily a B film relegated to the bottom half of double bills. With television stars Ilona Massey and Guy Madison in featured roles, the film was one of a cycle of late-1950s films that had the feel of a television episode. Reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times merely called the film \\"a melodrama in which George Raft, Guy Madison and Virginia Mayo get caught aloft in a crippled plane... by some miscarriage of justice they all get down alive\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Jet Over the Atlantic; Also on double bill.\\" The New York Times, January 7, 1960. Later reviews focused on the inadequacies of the script, casting choices and low production values, dismissing the film as woefully inadequate as either a thriller or disaster film.

Crawford first went to sea aboard merchant vessels, trading with North America, before joining the navy during the American War of Independence. He saw action on shore on several occasions, distinguishing himself in the defence of Savannah and the siege of Charleston. Returning from North America with despatches, he was given a hired ship and acted in support of the British defences during the Great Siege of Gibraltar. During this conflict he was heavily engaged on numerous occasions with Spanish gunboats, and came to the attention of Roger Curtis, later to become a prominent naval officer. After a period of unemployment following the end of the American War of Independence, Curtis saw to it that Crawford was offered a position in the fleet during the Spanish Armament. When war was averted, Crawford went out to the East Indies for several years on personal business. While returning to Britain after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Crawford's ship was captured by the French. He was kept as a prisoner of war until 1797, when he was able to return to the navy and joined the flagship of his old patron, Sir Roger Curtis. After two years in this post, he was given his own ship, which he commanded until the end of the French Revolutionary Wars. Promoted to post-captain in 1802, he was again unemployed for a time, until being given command of various frigates, at first supporting the Spanish in the Peninsular War, but later being sent to the East Indies. Here Crawford took part in the Invasion of Java in 1811, before returning to Britain. He went on half-pay as the wars with France drew to a close, and died, still a post-captain, in 1828. Family and early life Crawford was born at Dundee on 20 July 1760, the son of James Crawford and his wife Helen, n√©e Coutts. Helen was a cousin of the owners of the large London banking firm Coutts. He initially went to sea aboard merchant ships, making several voyages to trade with the American colonies of Virginia and North and South Carolina, before joining the navy in April 1777. American War of Independence North America His first posting was as a midshipman aboard the sloop , then serving off the North American coast under the command of Lieutenant John Henry. Vigilant was armed with heavy cannon for supporting shore-based operations during the American War of Independence. Crawford served aboard Vigilant until late in 1777, when Henry was appointed to command the 20-gun , upon which Crawford moved with his captain to the new ship. He continued as midshipman until one of the ship's lieutenants was wounded during operations around Boston. Henry then appointed him acting lieutenant on 24 October 1778. Crawford took part in several important battles during the remainder of the war, commanding a battery of Foweys guns that had been landed to defend Savannah during its siege. The besieging forces were eventually repulsed and for his good service there, Crawford was mentioned in the despatches written by Captain Henry, and the commander of the land forces, General Augustine Pr√©vost. Fowey then moved to support the Siege of Charleston, which ended in the capitulation of the city to the British. Following this success, Captain Henry was again transferred, taking over command of the newly captured , with orders to take her back to Britain carrying despatches. Crawford again accompanied Henry, still with the rank of acting-lieutenant. Gibraltar Providence was placed out of commission shortly after her arrival in Britain, and Crawford reverted to his former rank of midshipman. He spent two months serving aboard the 100-gun , the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Darby, until April 1781 when Darby gave him command of an armed vessel, the 5-gun Repulse. Repulse had been fitted with Spanish-made 26 pounders, and was based at Gibraltar during the great siege. The siege was intensified about this time, with the Spanish making determined efforts to oust the British. On 7 August 1781 he played an important role in the defence of the brig-rigged , which had been becalmed in the entrance of the Bay of Gibraltar. The Spanish sent 14 gunboats from Algeciras to attack her, against which the senior British officer, Roger Curtis, dispatched Crawford's Repulse, and another armed vessel, the Vanguard, to defend her. Despite the superior Spanish numbers, the three British vessels were able to fight off the gunboats and Helena was towed into harbour. After thirteen months commanding Repulse, often closely engaged with Spanish gunboats, Crawford was appointed acting first lieutenant of the 32-gun . The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782, by John Singleton Copley. Depicting the September assault, which Crawford served throughout. All the previous assaults having failed to capture Gibraltar, a Franco-Spanish forced launched the biggest assault yet on the fortifications, on 13 September 1782. Anticipating the assault, and the danger to shipping, the British scuttled Brilliant, and Crawford went ashore to serve with the naval brigade encamped at Europa Point under Curtis. He served as Curtis's brigade major during the assault, which was eventually repulsed. With the attack decisively defeated, the sunken Brilliant was re-floated within a few days and Crawford resumed his post aboard her, serving under Curtis. He remained her until October 1782, when he was moved to the recently captured Spanish ship of the line San Miguel, which had run aground off Gibraltar and forced to surrender. The Spanish made several attempts to recapture or destroy her, sending flotillas against her on 12 November and 18 December. Both attempts failed, though several days later the San Miguel was blown from her anchorage and had to be run aground. She stayed in British hands for the remainder of the war. San Miguel was eventually sailed to Britain under the command of Sir Charles Knowles, and Crawford joined Roger Curtis aboard the Brilliant in March 1783. His lieutenant's commission was confirmed by the Admiralty on 10 August 1783, but with the conclusion of the American War of Independence and the drawdown of the navy, there was little service available. Crawford does not appear to have served at sea for some time after his commission. Spanish Armament and French Revolutionary Wars Crawford's former service with Curtis, now Sir Roger Curtis following his knighthood for his service at Gibraltar, brought dividends during the Spanish Armament. As the threat of war with Spain loomed, Curtis, by now captain of the fleet to Admiral Lord Howe recommended Crawford to Howe. Howe took Crawford aboard his flagship, the 100-gun . The crisis passed without breaking into open war, and Crawford took a period of absence from the navy, going out to the East Indies where he attended to his personal affairs. He took passage back to Britain aboard a merchant ship at some point after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, but the ship was captured by a French warship en route. He was held as a prisoner of war until being exchanged in March 1797, and allowed to return to Britain. Once there he was appointed lieutenant aboard the 98-gun , which was at this time the flagship of Crawford's old patron, now Rear- Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, with the Channel Fleet. He remained with Curtis until his promotion to commander on 14 February 1799, and his subsequent appointment to command the 14-gun brig in March that year. He spent the rest of the war commanding her, principally off the British coast, and was promoted to post-captain on 29 April 1802. Napoleonic Wars After a long period without a ship, Crawford was assigned to the 24-gun in 1808. He commanded her off the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, supporting Spanish patriots against the French forces, later moving to the 32-gun to carry out the same service. During operations off Vigo Crawford arranged for the capitulation of the French garrison of the fort there, which caused his senior officer to write approvingly of his \\"liberal attention and zealous services\\". Vigo was then besieged by a French army led by Marshal Michel Ney, causing Crawford to land a party of seamen and marines, and lead them against the French in defence of the city. The French were defeated at the Battle of Puente Sanpayo and forced back towards Lugo. Batavia, on the island of Java, target of the British force in mid-1811 Crawford commissioned the 38-gun in late 1810 and sailed for the East Indies in February 1811. He served at the reduction of Java between August and September 1811. In 1813 he took command of the 36-gun and on 6 February 1813 captured the 14-gun privateer Furet off Sicily. Modeste was put out of commission towards the end of the wars and Crawford went on half-pay. He does not appear to have served at sea again. Family and later life James Coutts Crawford, a naval officer like his father, and later a prominent citizen of New Zealand Crawford was twice married, his first wife was Anne Duncan, with whom he had a daughter, Mary. Mary married the naval officer Henry Duncan in 1823. Crawford's second wife, Jane Inglis, was the eldest daughter of Vice-Admiral John Inglis. The couple had a son together, James Coutts Crawford, better known as Coutts Crawford. Captain James Coutts Crawford died at Liverpool on 10 May 1828, at the age of 67. He had been travelling to London, but was taken ill and died after a few days.

Like the feature-length 3-D films of the 1950s when they were originally released, it was projected by the polarized light method and viewed through gray Polaroid filters in viewers which, according to the film's poster, were \\"scientifically designed by master craftsmen!\\" Most theaters, however, presented it \\"flat\\", in 2-D. Although it is widely believed to have been filmed in Stereovision, Bob Furmanek, who oversaw the 2016 restoration, says this is a myth. It was shot full-frame with the original NaturalVision cameras used on Bwana Devil. The center of the image was then extracted to create a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, in the manner of the then-current Superscope process. Unfortunately, it was poorly done, resulting in a large number of badly-framed shots; for example, the scene with the Flamenco dancers has a huge amount of headroom while their feet are cut off. Both September Storm and 3-D in general were roundly dismissed by influential critic Bosley Crowther in his New York Times review.New York Times review of September Storm, 29 October 1960 Plot American fashion model Anne Traymore, swimming off the isle of Majorca, loses a bracelet, which the handsome Manuel del Rio Montoya returns to her. She believes he owns a beautiful yacht called The Swan, but he merely works on it for the wealthy Rene LeClerc. A couple of fortune hunters, Balfour and Williams, claim they know where $3 million in gold doubloons can be found, but need a boat. They offer a share to Anne and Manuel, and the latter deceives LeClerc by claiming the boat needs three weeks of repairs. A raging storm causes the propeller to be clogged by seaweed. Balfour dives to clear it and is stung by a man-o-war. He is taken to an island to recover. Manuel professes his love for Anne, who rejects him, Balfour having caught her eye instead. An angry Manuel tries to leave and gets into a fight with Williams that nearly sinks the vessel. After the divers bring up the loot, Williams decides to strand the others and keep it all to himself. By now, LeClerc has become aware of the deception and intercepts them, but he is talked out of contacting the law by being offered a share of the money. The Coast Guard, alas, arrives to confiscate it all.

It is one of a series of continental blocks or terranes that were rifted off eastern Gondwana during the Ordovician (), long before the formation of Pangaea. Today these blocks form south-east Asia but the different timing of their journeys has given them distinct geologic histories. Shan‚ÄìThai was an archipelago on the Paleo-Tethys Ocean spread over several latitudes. It can therefore be subdivided into several portions with different palaeo-geographical histories. The internal \\"Thai\\" elements, bordering the Indochina block, are of Cathaysian type and characterised by palaeo-tropical warm-water facies. The external \\"Shan\\" part has Gondwanan cold-water facies whilst the central \\"Sibumasu\\" part is transitional between the other two. The internal parts of Shan‚ÄìThai merged with Laurasia when the Nan-Uttaradit suture closed. Oceanic basins separated the other elements of Shan‚ÄìThai until the Late Triassic‚ÄìEarly Jurassic Late Indochina Orogeny. The collision between India and Eurasia during the Oligocene and Miocene resulted in clockwise rotation of south-west Asia, severe deformation of south-east Asia, and the extrusion of Shan‚ÄìThai and Indochina blocks. These two blocks are still crisscrossed by the faults from this collision.

The film was shot at the Bavaria Film studios in Germany and was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.http://allmovie.com/work/captain- sindbad-8129 The screenplay was rewritten by Guy Endore, then rewritten again by co-producer Frank King a week before filming began in order to reduce production expenses; the film was reedited again prior to release.

He plans to capture his rival, Sindbad, who will soon return from a voyage to marry Princess Jana. The Princess convinces the magician Galgo to turn her into a Firebird, so that she may fly off to warn Sinbad of the trap set for him. She is able to do so just as Galgo is discovered by the guards, who take him to El Kerim. As Sindbad and his crew sail towards Baristan, the Princess/Firebird lands on the ship. Before she can deliver the message, however, El Kerim has his guards transformed into giant human falcons, which manage to sink Sinbad's ship using large rocks. Sindbad and some of his crew survive the attack and carefully make their way ashore. Galgo stretches out his arm over an enormous distance in order to steal El Kerim's magic ring. El Kerim, however, wakes up in time and burns Galgo's hand. Sindbad, posing as a petty thief, is arrested and must appear before the evil ruler. El Kerim is not fooled by the pretense and orders him to be executed. Sinbad breaks free and stabs him directly in the heart with a sword, but El Kerim cannot be killed. He orders Sindbad be put to death in the public arena the next day. Sindbad must now do battle with \\"The Thing\\", a fearsome giant invisible creature. Fortunately, The Thing knocks over a torch in his pursuit, starting a large fire, inciting a mass exodus of the large crowd, which allows Sindbad to escape from the arena during the confusion. Sindbad goes to Galgo and finally convinces the magician to reveal El Kerim's secret: the evil ruler had his vulnerable heart removed, and it is now kept safe in a distant bell tower, guarded by supernatural forces. In the meantime El Kerim insists that the Princess marry him, but when she finally refuses, he orders her to be executed with Sindbad when he is recaptured. Sindbad and his men must traverse a swamp of horror in order to reach the tower containing the evil heart. On the way, they encounter carnivorous vines, giant prehistoric crocodiles, volcanic lava pits, and killer whirlpools. Their numbers reduced, they finally arrive at the tower, where they dispatch a huge ogre with the multiple heads of a dragon. Sindbad, with the aid of a hook, begins climbing the tower's immense bell rope. When he reaches the top, he discovers El Kerim's beating heart is encased in crystal. The heart is protected by a giant hand, which chases Sindbad until he throws the hook at the crystal, dislodging the evil heart, giving El Kerim a heart attack. Seeking to protect his vulnerable heart, El Kerim rapidly flies with Galgo in his winged chariot to the tower. Sindbad is about to impale the heart when El Kerim arrives. A fierce sword fight between them begins. Galgo steals the heart and tosses it over the side of the tower and it explodes! As it falls to the ground, El Kerim dies, and falls from the tower's edge to his death. Later, the entire kingdom celebrates the marriage of Captain Sindbad and Princess Jana. Cast Production The film was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich with sets designed by the art directors Isabella Schlichting and Werner Schlichting. Outtakes of the film's \\"Dragon- Ogre\\" were used briefly in the film Natural Born Killers. Reception New York Times review, July 4, 1964 \\"Until about the last 20 minutes, it's strictly a broad mishmash of fantasy-comedy, spilling out over some lavishly gaudy sets of Old Arabia. As for plot, there's sinewy Sindbad (Guy Williams) trying to rescue a dead pan princess (Heidi Bruhl) from a wicked ruler (Pedro Armendariz), aided by a tippling, belching old magician\\". \\"Throw in a tired \\"Scheherazade\\"-type of score, as Mr. Williams braves anything from crocodiles to a 12-headed monster (our count, anyway), and you have the kind of harmless trash some kids may tolerate\\". \\"Yesterday, a cute little blonde in front of us took it all in stride, monsters included. She also perked up, leaning forward, for that final reel, when the picture slips from mediocrity into a wildly funny, eerie and casually beguiling adventure, not hard to take\\". \\"One set, a garishly tangled swamp, is nifty; so is the final one, for a palace skirmish. The King Brothers produced it, in Munich, of all places. M.G.M. sponsors\\".

It is based in the Longbridges boathouse on the Isis, which is co-owned by the college and shared with Hertford, St Hilda's, St Catz and Mansfield. The club was established in 2008, after Green and Templeton colleges merged to form Green Templeton College, Oxford. History Green Templeton Boat Club was established in 2008 after Green and Templeton Colleges merged. Before this, Templeton College had a close affiliation with Hertford College Boat Club, while Green College was associated with Osler House. The new club received a club room and racking space at Longbridges boathouse, which had previously been co-owned by Templeton College. Osler/Green's equipment and facilities went to Osler House, who have kept their positions in the men's and women's bumps-charts and continue to operate as an independent boat club. Since 2008, GTBC has grown rapidly. Its membership currently encompasses around a fifth of the 500 students at GTC. Facilities The College part- owns Longbridges Boathouse on the River Thames (locally referred to as The Isis). Longbridges provides a number of important services to GTBC members and supporters. It affords a great view of regattas and events held on the Isis, and GTBC crews regularly train in its state-of-the-art erg room, furnished with 12 brand new erg machines. Longbridges also houses a well-equipped clubroom, which is often used for training meets and other practical considerations, but also for GTBC's many exciting social events. Fleet GTBC currently owns a sizable fleet - four Eights, two Fours, Double and Single Sculls - which are kept in the large and small boats bays at Longbridges. Green Templeton Rowing Society The mission of The Society is to support the sport and fellowship of rowing at Green Templeton College, and to foster a well-financed, aptly equipped, and competitive boat club. Its primary purpose is to provide a focal point for all those who have rowed in, coxed, or coached crews for Green Templeton Boat Club, Osler-Green Boat Club or Templeton College Boat Club and all those who take an interest in rowing at The College.

The Ellipses) were a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock and roll/beat and later soul group from Belgrade, notable as one of the pioneers of the Serbian and former Yugoslav rock scene.  History   The beat years (1962-1967)  The band was formed in 1962 by Momƒçilo \\"Moma\\" Radovanoviƒá (guitar), Radomir Dmitroviƒá \\"ƒêura\\" (guitar) and Minja Tasiƒá (vocals), as a part of the Society for Culture and Arts Gradimir Mihajloviƒá. The first live appearance the band had was at the Belgrade club Euridika on June 21, 1963, performing cover versions of The Shadows. On Autumn of the same year, the drummer Vladimir \\"Furda\\" Furduj joined the band, bringing along Zoran Simjanoviƒá (keyboards), formerly of Siluete. At the time, beside Radovanoviƒá and Dmitroviƒá, the lineup also featured Bo≈æidar Kne≈æeviƒá (vocals), Kosta Ignjatoviƒá \\"Gule\\" (saxophone), and Bojan Hreljac (bass guitar). However, it did not last long and the new vocalist became Slobodan \\"Skaka\\" Skakiƒá, Ignjatoviƒá left the band and Dmitoviƒá was replaced by Simeun \\"Simica\\" Vukoviƒá (solo guitar). On the departure of Skakiƒá, the band decided to turn to polyphonic vocals with all the members doing vocals beside their instrumental duties. For a while, the band member was also the director Aleksandar Mandiƒá (backing vocals, tambourine). Elipse often performed live as a backing band for the, at the time, popular singers Ivanka Pavloviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá, Dragan Stojniƒá and Miki Jevremoviƒá. With the singer Miodrag Markoviƒá, the band recorded an extended play featuring the songs \\"Predaƒáu tugu zvezdama\\" (\\"I Will Hand My Grief to the Stars\\"), \\"Ne reci sad\\" (\\"Do Not Say Now\\"), \\"Ne, nemoj nikad plakati\\" (\\"No, Do Not You Ever Cry\\"), and \\"Zaboravi me\\" (\\"Forget Me\\"), released by PGP-RTB in 1965. At the time, the band had become increasingly popular, with the media propagating a rivalry with Siluete, resulting in a competition held at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, where the audience was to poll the winner. The competition, consisting of a musical performance, caricature drawing and poetry presentation, was won by Elipse with 146 votes advantage. Despite this fact, PGP-RTB did not find it as a token for good record sales, resulting in a split EP release with the popular Ni≈° rock and roll singer Perica Stojanƒçiƒá. The EP featured Elipse and the vocal group Korali as Stojanƒçiƒá's backing band, and on the B-side, Elipse recorded the instrumental tracks \\"Signal Evrovizije\\" (\\"Eurovision Signal\\") and \\"Pla≈æa\\" (\\"The Beach\\"). The success of the EP release resulted in their winning the 1966 Sajmi≈°te Guitar festival, their appearance at the Ponoƒána zvona (Midnight Bells) concert held in Belgrade in front of two thousand people, and the recording of a short television movie, made at the Belgrade Zoo. During the same year, the band released their second EP, featuring the songs \\"Pogledaj kroz prozor\\" (\\"Look Through The Window\\", a cover version of the song \\"Look Through Any Window\\" by The Hollies), \\"Reci da me voli≈°\\" (\\"Say That You Love Me\\", a cover version of The Beatles song \\"Tell Me What You See\\"), and the censored song \\"Maja\\" (\\"Maya\\"), originally entitled \\"Naga Maja\\" (\\"Naked Maja\\"). After the EP release, on April of the following year, both Siluete and Elipse had performed as the opening acts on The Searchers concerts in Belgrade and Zrenjanin. Soon after, due to the obligations at the architecture studies, guitarist Vukoviƒá left Elipse. The soul years (1967-1968)  After Vukoviƒá's departure, on the Spring of 1967, Edi Dekeng, a foreign student from Congo, joined the group as the new vocalist. On the arrival of Dekeng, a former member of Crni Panteri founded by the students from Congo, the band moved towards soul music, adding a brass section consisting of Nikola Zembiƒá (trumpet), Dragan Kuprijanov (saxophone) and Zoran Jurkiƒá (saxophone, flute). The new lineup had their first live appearance at the Belgrade Dom Sindikata, performing as an opening act for The Hollies, getting positive reactions from both the audience and the critics. During the same year, the new lineup also released an EP, featuring the songs \\"Za one ≈°to na licu nose bore\\" (\\"To the Ones Who Have Wrinkles on Their Faces\\"), written by Vlada Kaniƒá, and \\"Le Telephone\\" (\\"The Telephone\\"), a cover version of a song by the French soul singer Nino Ferrer, and performed as an opening act for the Italian singer Rita Pavone concert held at Ta≈°majdan. During 1967, Elipse appeared in the movies The Naughty Ones, directed by Kokan Rakonjac, and The Rats Woke Up, directed by ≈Ωivojin Pavloviƒá. On August 1968, Elipse and the band Mladi Levi from Ljubljana, as the representatives of Yugoslavia, performed at the Sofia Peace Festival. Since the two bands had similar musical directions, they decided to have a joint performance at a park situated in the city centrum. As soon as the performance had started, the audience started clapping their hands to the rhythm of the music, which provoked the police to stop the Elipse performance after ten minutes and brutally attack the audience. Despite the indecent, Elipse got the silver medal for the second best festival performance. By the end of the same year, due to the decision of the band members to focus more on their studies, Elise disbanded.  Post-breakup  In Autumn of 1967, Slobodan Skakiƒá (organ, vocals), with Radomir Dmitoviƒá (guitar), Nenad Nediƒá (bass guitar) and Milenko Ka≈°anin (drums), formed the band Nove Elipse (The New Ellipses). However, they did not achieve any success and in 1969, Skakiƒá moved to England. He had been a keyboard player and vocalist in a band called Ici-la until 1987, when he had an accident in which he injured his arm. He died in Dorset (UK) in January 2019. After the disbandment of Elipse in 1968, Furduj and Hreljac joined Korni Grupa. Dekeng went to Germany before moving to the United States where he works as a physician. The saxophonist Zoran Jurkiƒá moved to Denmark where he started working at a Porsche service. Zoran Simjanoviƒá started working as a composer, recording music for theatre and film. He wrote an autobiographical book called (How I Started (and Stopped) Being a Rocker), released by Narodna Knjiga in 2004. The promotion of the book also included a concert held on November 22, 2004, at the Belgrade Dom Sindikata, where both the Siluete and Elipse members appeared as performers. Guest appearances also featured Seka Kojadinoviƒá, Janez Bonƒçina, and the group Valjevski Deƒçaci. The Elipse material released on the EPs, along with the unreleased material, appeared on the compilation album Elipse za prijatelje (1963-1968) (Elipse for Friends), released by Simjanoviƒá through his own independent record label Simke Music in 1999.

At the time, members of orchestras were engaged part-time and normally had a separate full-time career, often in teaching. One of Page‚Äôs first decisions at Nashville was to change that by employing sixteen full-time core musicians. He also took the radical decision that all musicians would be employed on the basis of musical skill, regardless of ethnicity, sex or religion: the NSO thereby became the first US orchestra whose membership was multi-racial. In 1962, he took fourteen months leave from the Nashville orchestra to become conductor of Tokyo‚Äôs Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra; he was the first US citizen to hold such a position. On arrival at Tokyo Airport, he was kidnapped and held captive for over half an hour. In 1965, he secured a grant of half a million dollars from the Ford Foundation, as part of a huge grant to support symphony orchestras in the USA. McNeil Lowry, then VP of the Ford Foundation wrote: \\"Mr. Page's application in 1961 on behalf of the Nashville Symphony had a profound impact on the FF's 1965 decision to grant 85 million dollars to the Symphony Orchestras of the United States.‚Äù In 1968, he became Professor of Conducting at Drake University in Des Moines.ENJOY, March 1972 ‚Äì The Jackson Symphony: Death & Transfiguration Jacksonville He was the conductor and musical director of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra from 1971 to 1983.

Wine has been produced there since ancient times, but it was during the Middle Ages that the wine of Santorini became famous worldwide under the influence of the Republic of Venice. The Italian influence is still present in modern Santorini winemaking: the most famous Tuscan sweet wine is called Vin Santo just like Santorini's Vinsanto/Visanto (labeled such to differentiate it from the Tuscan wine). It is made in a passito style from grapes dried in the sun after harvest. Santorini also produces blended and ros√© wine made from white grapes such as Athiri, Aidini and Assyrtiko, and red grapes such as Mandelaria. History The island of Santorini is a remnant of an ancient volcano that erupted around 1640‚Äì1620 BC. In its early geological history, Santorini was the core of an ancient volcano that erupted in about 1640‚Äì1620 BC. A large part of the island became submerged, creating the modern day archipelago. Wine was made on the island in Greek and Roman times, but the region became particularly noteworthy in the Middle Ages when Crusaders captured control of the island from the Byzantine empire after Constantinople was sacked in 1203. One of the crusaders was a Venetian nobleman whose family maintained control of the island until 1336 when it became part of the Venetian maritime state Duchy of Naxos. Under the Venetian influence, with this extensive trade network and maritime control, Santorini wines were widely exported throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. The wine was particularly prized for its ability to withstand the month long sea voyages due, in part, to its sweetness and high alcohol levels. So highly valued was Santorini wines during this period that when the Ottoman Turks captured the region in 1579, they still permitted the uninterrupted trade of the wine even though the religious edicts of their Muslim faith generally forbids alcohol. One explanation for the Turks concession was that the poor soil and perilous topography of the island, with cliffs running right to the sea, made the cultivation of other cash crops difficult. When the Russian Orthodox Church adopted Santorini wine as the official Eucharistic wine of the church, the Ottomans allowed the island producers to trade freely with Russia even during the frequent wars between the two empires. The Thera Foundation The Turkish Rule: 1580‚Äì1820 University of Cincinnati. Accessed: 14 December 2010 During the early 19th Century a variety of wines were produced in Santorini, both red and white. The best red wine was called Santorin (or Santo, Vino di Baccho), representing a dry fine-tasting claret, with an approach to port. The most famous white wine was called Nykteri (Vino di Notte or night wine). There were two varieties of Nykteri, one named Kalliste, being stronger and richer; the other, called Elia, was somewhat weaker, but both are mentioned to be equal to the best French wines, particularly for table use. The ‚Äúking‚Äù of Santorini wines, however, was the Vino Santo, occurring in two varieties: dark-red and amber coloured. This wine was sweet, rich, very dry, and has a strong stimulating aroma. The quantity of wine exported was 45-50,000 barrels per year (from 36 to 40 thousand hectoliters). Climate and geography Santorini vines are kept unstaked and trained low to the ground in a basket shape that helps protect the grapes from the fierce winds and heat of the island. Located in the Aegean Sea, Santorini has a distinctly Mediterranean climate that is characterized by warm temperatures, low rainfall but high humidity during the growing season. The area is subjected to strong winds coming off the oceans which can damage the vines and grapes if they are not trained low to the ground for protection. The vineyard soils of the region are very poor, composed of volcanic ash and rocks. The calcareous subsoils are porous which helps to retain some of the humidity in the air and release it as moisture in the night for the vines to utilize. Grapes and wine Grapes drying out in the sun on Santorini The island of Santorini is most famously known for its indigenous white grape varieties Assyrtiko, Athiri and Aidani, though some wines made from international varieties and also from indigenous red grapes such as Mandilaria and Mavrotragano can be found. About 1,200 hectares of land are under vine, however, there is a constant struggle with Santorini's tourism industry that puts this small number at risk of decreasing even further. Assyrtiko is the island's flagship grape. It's a high acid grape full of citrus and mineral nuances. It can be enjoyed on its own or with grilled fish and meats. The grape is often referred to as a ‚Äúwhite grape in red‚Äôs clothing,‚Äù due to the full-bodied wines it produces with an average of 13.5% abv. Santorini is immune to phylloxera as its volcanic soils contain none of the clay that is necessary for parasite to survive. As a result, many of the roots found on the vines on Santorini are centuries old. The grape growers of Santorini use a unique bush-training system, known as koulara, to grow the grapes. As the vines grow, they are woven into baskets with the grapes facing toward the inside of the ring. The vine's leaves and vine provide protection for the grapes from harsh winds and sunlight. The koulara are often grown haphazardly on small plots of land and can be mistaken for wild bushes by unknowing passers-by. Grape varieties are frequently grown together and the growers are often unaware which grapes are which until harvest which takes place in mid-August. At the age of 75 a vine is generally woven into many layers and it may be unable to provide proper nutrients and high enough yields to keep in production. As a result, it is clipped at its roots and a new vine is connected to the rootstock. It is important to keep the roots healthy and in use as their old age has allowed them to grow deep into the calcareous soils, extracting any moisture that may be available. An assortment of Santorini wines Santorini classified wines: Santorini, Nykteri and Vinsanto (see below for Vinsanto information.) Santorini: This wine must contain 75% or more of the Assyrtiko grape variety with the remaining 25% made up from Athiri and/or Aidani. The wine is generally unoaked, but some wineries choose to make a small portion of oaked wine due to Assyrtiko's versatility. Either way has a great gaining potential due to the high acidity of the grapes. The wine is bone-dry with high acid toting flavors of lemon and stone fruits with a distinct taste of minerality. Nykteri: In Greek, the name means ‚Äúworking the night away‚Äù as it was traditionally harvested at night to avoid the hot temperatures and create a fine wine with little extraction from color and exposure to air. The grapes were to be picked before sunrise and pressed and drawn off within the first day. Today, many producers still choose to harvest the grapes at night, but some also harvest during the day. It is at least 75% Assyrtiko with the remaining composition allowed to derive from Athiri and Aidani. After vinification in steel or oak, Nykteri wines must be aged in oak for a minimum of three months. These wines are bone-dry and contain high acid and mineral components bringing forth flavors of citrus and stone fruits. Mezzo: Although this wine is not part of Greece's classification system, it is a wine commonly produced. This is a sweet wine made from the island's white or red grapes and is similar to Vinsanto, but literally means \\"less sweet.\\" The grapes are also sun dried, but before vinification dry grape must is added to the run-off juice from the raisoned grapes. Vinsanto Vinsanto is an ancient winemaking tradition of Santorini that dates back thousands of years and represents an important part of Santorini's history. In order for a wine to be labeled Vinsanto in Santorini the wine must be predominately made from the Assyrtiko grape‚Äîat least 51%, the remaining 49% is made up of Athiri and Aidani and some small amounts of locally grown white varieties. Vinsanto does not undergo any chaptalization and is made up only of the natural sugars and acids of the grapes. Vinsanto is made from late harvested grapes that have been dried in the sun for 12‚Äì14 days. They are then crushed and fermented and are then aged for a minimum of 24 months in oak barrels. Vinsanto must achieve a minimum of 9% abv. Vinsanto is known for its golden-orange to dark amber coloring with a complex bouquet of dried apricots, golden raisins and other dried fruits combined with sweet spice and an underlying minerality. Although it is classified as a dessert wine, the high acid of the Assyrtiko and other indigenous grapes grown on the island balance the sugar content to produce an extremely palatable drink that can be paired with a variety of foods. The winemaking style of vin santo can also be found throughout Italy and has historically been known as Italy's ‚ÄúHoly Wine‚Äù as it was used in the Catholic Eucharist due to its sweetness. Another throry relates its origins partially with Santorini. Santorini was used as a trading port through much of history, but produced very little goods themselves. Only with the Venetian domination the island focused on the cultivation of wine that would be exported from the island throughout the Mediterranean. Packages taken from the island were labeled ‚ÄúSanto‚Äù to denote their origin. Wine from the island was denoted ‚Äúvin‚Äù or ‚Äúvino‚Äù (the Italian word for \\"wine\\") to denote the packages contents; thus, the term ‚ÄúVinsanto‚Äù was born. In 2002, the EU determined that there was enough information to name Santorini, Greece as Vinsanto's place of origin thus granting the island exclusive rights to the use of the name Vinsanto on its sweet wines. Italy may still use vin santo or vino santo to denote its winemaking style.Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 [April 2002] (EC) No 1493/1999.

It was designed by architect Atlee B. Ayres in the Classical Revival style of architecture. Built between 1912 and 1914 by Gross Construction Company as the second court house of Cameron County, it served as such until 1914 when the 1979 courthouse was completed in the 900 block of East Harrison Street. Its relatively plain exterior belies the grandeur of the art glass dome above its central rotunda. On September 27, 1980, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Between 1994 and 2006, the building was completely renovated at a cost of over $17 million. It was rededicated on October 17, 2006. Sometimes called the Dancy Building in honor of County Judge Oscar Cromwell Dancy, who championed its construction in 1912, it now houses the Cameron County Court at Law No. 1 as well as county offices. The building also housed offices and a low-income clinic during the 1980s.

Life Collins had little education, but was religious at an early age. He appears to have officiated to a congregation at Wapping, and at one period he was imprisoned in Newgate Prison. He died on 4 October 1702, and his funeral sermon, by the Rev. John Piggott, was printed in the following year. Works His published material begins with An Orthodox Catechism (1680), an edited version of the 16th century Heidelberg Catechism. Collins revised the section on baptism, as well as making a number of stylistic changes; he also added the text of the Nicene Creed and Athanasian Creed. In the appendix Collins argues for the biblical duty of congregational singing. Over the next twenty-two years Collins produced eleven more works, mainly on issues of separation from the Church of England, and believer's baptism versus infant baptism. Other works come from his time in Newgate Prison during 1684. One of these was Counsel for the Living Occasioned from the Dead and was written on the death of two of his fellow prisoners; it contains pastoral instruction to those who were likewise experiencing persecution. The other, A Voice from Prison, was alternatively titled: Meditations on Revelation 3:11 Tending to the Establishment of God‚Äôs Little Flock, in An Hour of Temptation. A final work was The Temple Repair'd. It includes instruction on preparing and preaching sermons for those in the ministry. Besides some single sermons, he wrote the following works, some of which occasioned a good deal of controversy: * An Orthodox Catechism, being the sum of Christian Religion contained in the Law and Gospel, London, 1680, 12mo. * A Voice from the Prison, or Meditations on Revelations, London, 1684, 4to. * Believers' Baptism from Heaven, and of Divine Institution Infants' Baptism from Earth, and Human Invention, London, 1691, 8vo., revised and republished by John Bailey, London, 1803, 8vo. * The Antidote proved a Counterfeit, or Error detected, and Believers' Baptism vindicated, containing an answer to \\"An Antidote to prevent the Prevalency of Anabaptism,\\" London, 1693, 4to. * Three books, viz.
