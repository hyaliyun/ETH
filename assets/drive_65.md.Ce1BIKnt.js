Functioning  Since a real government did not exist in the Yerevan province of Armenia, the Armenian National Congress served as a government for the province. According to Richard Hovannisian, the Congress was \\"the most comprehensive Eastern Armenian gathering since the Russian conquest of Transcaucasia\\". The immediate objectives of the Congress were to devise a strategy for the war effort, provide relief for refugees, and provide local autonomy for various Armenian-run institutions throughout the Caucasus. The Congress also called for the militarization of the Caucasus front. The Armenian National Congress supported the policies of the Russian Provisional Government concerning the war, and also suggested redrawing provincial boundaries along ethnic lines.Hovannisian Republic, pp.17-18 The Congress was instrumental in the secularization of Armenian schools and the nationalization of secondary Armenian schools. The Congress met for 18 sessions before it dissolved on .Ter-Minassian pp.33-34 Legacy Before dissolving, the Congress created a National Assembly of 35 members to act as a legislative body for Armenians in the Russian Empire.Ter-Minassian p.34 It also created an executive body of 15 members called the Armenian National Council, headed by Avetis Aharonian.

Life and career Berger was born in London on 10 June 1834 of Italian parents but had British nationality as his father was a naturalized Briton. In 1848 travelled to Trieste from where his father had originated. He wrote an opera (Il lazzarone, ossia La fortuna vien dormendofrom Enciclopedia della Musica e dei Musicisti Utet (Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians UTET)) which was performed there when he was seventeen. He received much of his musical education in Germany where he was taught by Moscheles in a strictly classical tradition, a style of play from which Chopin was later to be the first to break free. He returned to England in 1855, and in 1864 he married one of the most renowned contraltos of the day, Annie Lascelles. Berger became a professor of music at the Royal Academy of Music and also taught at the Guildhall School. He composed many pieces of music over a long and industrious life. He became a great friend of Charles Dickens and frequently visited him at his house, Gads Hill Place. He was commissioned to write music for two plays by Wilkie Collins which were produced by Dickens and performed at his private theatrical parties. He composed many works including masses, overtures, operas, chamber music, choral work, piano compositions, song cycles and vocal settings, many to works by Longfellow. He wrote a piano primer, Musical Expressions in Four Languages and an autobiography, Reminiscences, Impressions, and Anecdotes. In 1871 Berger became of a member and director of the Philharmonic Society and he acted as its honorary secretary from 1884 until 1911, overseeing its move from St James' Hall to Queen's Hall. At the start of that period, Arthur Sullivan was appointed conductor to be followed by various others including Sir Alexander Mackenzie from 1892 to 1899. Mackenzie wrote of Berger \\"During my tenure of office [as conductor] the heat and burden of the day was borne by an honorary secretary (happily still living) of remarkable linguistic accomplishment, much musical experience, and an immense capacity for work ‚Äî Mr. Francesco Berger\\". During his time as secretary, Berger oversaw the introduction of many new works and on several occasions brought Tchaikovsky over to conduct his own works. Near the end of his tenure, the great violinist Kreisler took part in the first performance of Elgar's Violin Concerto in B minor which had been commissioned by the Society. Berger died in Palmer's Green, London on 26 April 1933 at the age of ninety eight. His wife had predeceased him, dying in 1907.

Maoist lawmaker Shakti Basnet accused Mr. Dixit of misusing granted fund to campaign against the ongoing peace process and using funds without accountability, triggering a debate on the support of foreign diplomatic missions for Nepali media. Dixit refuted the accusations, claiming that the Maoist lawmaker in question was misusing his parliamentary platform in order to damage his credibility through personal targeting. A team of police deployed by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) on April 22, 2016 took journalist Kanak Mani Dixit into custody. Around 20 police personnel including those in civvies held him from Patan Dhoka in Lalitpur district.

Berthe Hess (4 November 1925 - 6 April 1996) was a French-born painter recognized for having created the Bertisme technique, which involves the \\"sculpting\\" by brush of great quantities of oil paint on canvas. Early life I.J. Berthe Hess was born Berthe Isapow on 4 November 1925 in Belleville, Paris, France to Russian parents, Joseph and Chaja Isapow, who owned a leather factory and had four other children. On her father's side, she is related to Igor Stravinsky, the Russian composer.Tony Cornwall-Jones, Adam's Apple Magazine, November 1993 In 1933, when Berthe was eight years of age, they moved to the Porte des Lilas. During the second world war, their house was used by partisans and resistants, and Berthe was engaged in delivering messages to Resistance Leader, Jean Moulin. At the age of 24, she met a 21-year-old British citizen, Adolph Hess. They married immediately and in 1951, she gave birth to a daughter, the dancer and choreographer Mauricette Fortun√©e Hess, who later give birth to the singer, musician and graphic novel author, Sol Hess. Career Les Chevaux Demi-Sauvages, by I.J. Berthe Hess, 1964During her career, she both signed her work and authenticated it by a thumb print in the back of the canvas. Hess' Bertisme technique, named as such by the influential British art critic Peter Fuller, involved the \\"sculpting\\" by brush of great quantities of oil paint on canvas. As a result, the surface on most paintings by Hess are about two inches thick and took up to several years to dry. When seen up-close, the surface appears as a labyrinth of colour and light trapped in thick tunnels of paint and, when viewed from a certain distance, Hess' scenes progressively emerge from the canvas. The biggest paintings would take her a year to complete and seven years to dry.Tony Cornwall-Jones, Adam's Apple Magazine, November 1993: \\"...Many of the paintings are huge. Taking up to a year to complete, and up to seven years to dry, the weight of each one is enormous!\\" As Hess' production was greatly limited in terms of quantity by the time each painting took, her work is extremely rare. In addition the technique is so demanding and complex that it has been said to be impossible to forge,Richard Stone, Buying Antiques, 13 July 1973: \\"...The output of this artist is limited in quantity by the difficulty of its execution. It can never be copied, imitated or forged, and one square inch of surface could not be reproduced even by the artist herself. The technical problems of making adequate prints of this work are enormous, and as only a handful of her works will ever be sold their rarity value will be considerable.\\" and all attempts to do so seem to have failed.Tony Cornwall- Jones, Adam's Apple, November 1993: \\"...No one can say with certainty how the colour is applied: that is a secret that she keeps to herself. All those who have advanced theories have been hopelessly wrong, and it is not until you actually try to simulate the technique that you realize that all the normal tools and experience, and just about every means of fabrication and decoration available, together with a great deal of lateral thinking, are to no avail.(...) On one occasion, an artist who was rumored to be 'the most skilled and experienced of all forgers' told her that it was impossible to replicate. There is no apparent or even vaguely practical means of doing what she does.\\" Due to its use of colour and light, Bertisme has often been described as being \\"One Step Beyond Impressionism\\", and while Hess has been compared to artists such as Turner, Pissarro, Manet, Rubens, Utrillo, and also Pollock, it has however been admitted by all that her work is unique. In 1969, Peter Fuller, who was to write a book about Hess before his tragic accident declared Hess' art as \\"... a real contribution to the art of this century.\\"Peter Fuller, The City Press, April 1969: \\"...Each canvas is a triumph, a superb and highly original work. Taken together, they are more than that: they are a real contribution to the art of this century.\\" I.J. Berthe Hess died 6 April 1996 in Bazas, France.  The B.H. Corner Gallery  In 1967, the Hess family moved to London, England and opened the B.H. Corner Gallery, on Cathedral Place next to Paternoster Square and Saint Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. They used the gallery to promote the work of young contemporary artists, and in 1972 a part of it gave birth to a permanent exhibition of Hess' work.Callum Johnston, City Press, 16 November 1972: \\"The City is now the proud home of a permanent museum for one of the few completely unique painting techniques to come out of this century: Bertisme. More than thirty works are now permanently on show at the BH Corner Gallery in Cathedral Place.\\" The B.H. Corner Gallery was a very popular venue, which saw a procession of all kinds of visitors, including show-business stars, politicians, artists and writers, and was a frequent hangout for all stratas of the City's population.Tony Cornwall-Jones, Adam's Apple Magazine, November 1993 \\"Above all, it was an accessible gallery: city typists, show biz stars, art collectors, city bankers, postmen, policemen, writers, artists, sometimes singly, sometimes together, they all dropped in for a chat, for just an hour or a whole afternoon. (...) Her permanent exhibition had a procession of famous visitors, which included Prince Charles, Princess Anne and the French President, Giscard D'Estaing.\\" Adolph Hess ran the gallery until his death of multiple sclerosis in 1977 after which Berthe and her daughter Mauricette continued his work until 1987 when it had to close due to redevelopment of Paternoster Square.

It is a prostrate or low shrub with small, club-shaped leaves and mouse-scented flowers which vary in colour from golden-yellow and orange to dark red. Description Verticordia fastigiata is a low shrub which grows to a height of and a width of with a single, highly branched main stem. The leaves are club-shaped, almost circular in cross-section, long and have a blunt end. The flowers are mouse-scented, arranged corymb-like groups with each flower on a stalk long. They are lemon-yellow and red, golden-yellow and orange to bronze, or deep red. The floral cup is broadly top-shaped, about long, hairy and more or less smooth. The sepals are yellow to dark red, about long, with 4 lobes which have long-hairy ends. The petals are about long, broad egg-shaped with a finely toothed margin, shiny yellow to dark red. The style is long, straight or gently curved with a few short hairs. Flowering time is from January to July. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia fastigiata was first formally described in 1852 by Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow based on plant material collected by James Drummond and the description was published in Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg. The specific epithet (fastigiata) is derived from a Latin word meaning \\"having parallel, upright branches\\", referring to the habit of this species. Verticordia conferta, a species described by botanist George Bentham in 1871 from specimens collected from poorly drained areas near East Mount Barren, has been placed in synonymy with this species. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Micrantha along with V. minutiflora and V. vicinella. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sandy loam and clay over sandstone, sometimes in association with other species of verticordia, in low heath. It occurs in southern areas of the state between Ongerup and Cape Riche in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia fastigiata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This verticordia is usually propagated from cuttings which usually strike easily but are slow to establish when planted out and may take several years to flower. It performs well in Western Australia and on the east coast when grown in light soils in a sunny location. Established plants are moderately frost-tolerant and resistant to pest attacks.

Heritage and family history Herman was born to second-generation Italian American parents. Her grandparents are all from the province of Basilicata, also known as Lucania. These towns are part of the area's ancient history. Her father's family is from Avigliano, where the name Claps is a common one. Her mother's family (Becce), is from Tolve, which it is said Hannibal burned to the ground on his sweep through Italy. In the fields outside Tolve, are the remains of a 4th Century BCE Roman Villa. The customs of this part of Italy were kept alive during her childhood in America. Herman's maternal grandparents were farmers and cheesemakers The men in her paternal family were blacksmiths in Avigliano and became ironworkers in the U.S. This history is reflected in Herman's writing, where the subject of being a southern Italian woman raised in a Post- World War II New England industrial town, is addressed.

The 364 bed luxury hospital, part of Cleveland Clinic Foundation, USA, has been open to the public since May 2015. History Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is the result of a partnership agreement signed in 2006 between Mubadala Development Company and Cleveland Clinic. The hospital was officially inaugurated on December 3, 2015 by Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Construction of the project began with Mubadala Development Company appointing Aldar Properties in 2007 as the project's development manager, to oversee the design, construction and commissioning of the hospital. The building was designed by HDR, with Aedas serving as project architects and constructed by partners Six Construct (which owns 60% of the joint venture) and South Korean firm Samsung C&T; Corporation (40%), the same team which built the world's tallest tower Burj Khalifa. The hospital was initially scheduled to begin full-service operations to patients by the fourth quarter of 2013. Construction was delayed for another 18 months prior to opening its facility to the public in May 2015 due to logistic challenges faced by the massive size of the project. The building is currently the largest structural steel building in the UAE, weighing more than 30,000 tonnes. On 16 October 2019, an opera singer and recovering stroke patient who had previously received life-saving treatment at the hospital, performed a lunchtime performance for visitors and staff at CCAD. Facilities Inside the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a 23-acre facility with five clinical floors, three diagnostic and treatment levels and 13 floors of critical and acute inpatient units. The 409,234 square metre hospital currently has 364 patient beds, with the option to increase that level to 490, including 72 ICU beds, 4 post anesthesia care units (PACU) and 26 operating rooms. Having 340 doctors and 2,918 nurses and other workers, the hospital currently has more than 50 medical and surgical specialities and is designed to operate five different specialist centres of excellence covering digestive disease, eye, heart and vascular disorders, neurological treatment, and respiratory and critical care. There were more than 5,000 physicians from all around the world who had applied for the initial 175 doctor positions in the hospital. Those who were hired had to complete 40 interviews for the job - 20 in the US and another 20 in Abu Dhabi. Eighty percent of the successful applicants are US-trained, and the rest were trained in western Europe.

The Times, Monday, Feb 26, 1962; pg. ii; Issue 55325 British Titan Products was initially organised to replace titanium dioxide supplies that British paint manufacturers imported from Germany. This British industry was established as a joint venture in 1934 by two of the world's major mining and chemical businesses in conjunction with a major industrial consumer and a distribution business. Tioxide became a wholly owned Imperial Chemical Industries subsidiary in 1992. Within ICI, now renamed after its principal product Tioxide, the business retained a separate identity but it lost that identity when sold in 1999 to USA's Huntsman Corporation. In 2014 along with other Huntsman companies they together again formed the world's second largest producer of titanium dioxide. Second to DuPont. This business did not manufacture titanium metal. Lead Poisoning White lead has been used as a pigment since the 4th century BC, even used in cosmetics, providing a pure white pigment with good coverage. The dangers to those who contacted lead were known but not properly understood often, but not always, leading to lead poisoning.Gerald Markowitz, David Rosner. Deceit and Denial, the deadly politics of industrial pollution. University of California Press, New York 2003v Shortly before the First World War National Lead Company in US told its stockholders it now took special care of its workers. Only men were employed no women or children, free laundry was provided and respirators. Shower baths were provided and the workmen were encouraged to wash before eating. It became generally recognised \\"lead has no business in the human body\\". Zinc oxides began to be used for white paints. Many countries banned the use of lead paints inside buildings. By the early 1930s lithopone titanium and zinc oxides were being marketed as non-poisonous. Lead poisoning's great danger to children was not recognised until the 1940s when it was decided small quantities which might create chronic lead poisoning in mature adults would kill children.

In 1968 he co-founded the electronic music ensemble Gentle Fire along with Hugh Davies. Orton worked at the Department of Music at the University of York from 1967 to 1996. He established the University's Electronic Music Studio (EMS) in 1968, the first in a university in the North of England. The studio began as a ‚Äòclassical‚Äô tape studio, but later adopted the technologies of the voltage- controlled synthesizer and digital systems. He proposed the Project teaching system which is still the basis of teaching at York and which has been emulated by many University Music departments around the world. He established the Mediamix series of concerts, which combined performances of electro- acoustic compositions with film, dance and other performance media. He was a co-founder of the Composers Desktop Project, which placed affordable sound technologies on the individual composer's desk, and developed musical composition software, which formed part of the CDP system. In the early 1980s, with his colleague Dr. Ross Kirk from the Department of Electronics at York, he started work on the concept of Music Technology as an academic discipline. This led to the establishment of the world's first postgraduate course in Music Technology in 1986. In 1992 he began working on his algorithmic composition language, Tabula Vigilans, designed for real-time performance. On taking early retirement from the University of York in 1996, he was honoured by the University with a lifetime Emeritus Readership. During his lifetime, he wrote a considerable amount of music.

Etymology  Maimaiga is the Japanese word for \\"gypsy moth\\".  History  In 1908, shortly after classical efforts began to control gypsy moth populations, North American researchers studied cadavers of Japanese gypsy moths which had been killed by an entomophthoralean fungus. The fungus was released in the Boston area between 1910 and 1911. By 1912, they summarized their work, stating that extensive releases had never established this fungal pathogen, which they referred to as \\"gypsy fungus\\". In the early 1980s, another attempt was made to introduce Entomophaga maimaiga into the wild. They obtained the sample from the western coast of Honshu. The fungus was determined to belong to the genus Entomophaga in the fungal order Entomophthorales and was given the name maimaiga based on geographical distribution. In 1985 and 1986 were made small- scale releases of laboratory gypsy moth larvae injected with fungal cells. The locations were New York State and Shenandoah National Park respectively. At the time these releases were not considered to be successful. In 1989, cadavers of gypsy moths found hanging on tree trunks revealed large resting spores characteristic of entomophthoralean fungi. The fungus found appeared to be the same species as released in 1910, 1911, 1985 and 1986. The fungus spread across gypsy moth populations over the next several years.  Method of dispersion  The fungus spreads through aerial dispersion of actively ejected asexual spores from cadavers of gypsy moth larvae it has killed. It can also be spread unwittingly by humans. The fungus persists in the top layer of soil as resting spores. These have been shown to persist for at least 11 or 12 years, probably longer.  Effect on gypsy moths  The fungus causes high levels of infection among gypsy moths in both low and high density populations, leading to population crashes.  Effect on non-target Lepidoptera  Entomophaga maimaiga can only potentially affect lepidopteran larvae that are present in the spring, when gypsy moth larvae are present. 78 species which fit this criteria were tested. Only about one-third were able to be infected under optimal conditions. Infection was only consistently high among three species of tussock moths and one colony of a hawk moth. However, field studies showed that rates achieved in the laboratory are far higher than found in the field. Overall the pathogen is considered highly host specific.

Thomas Morris Early life Born at Carlisle, where he was baptised on 22 April 1732, he was one of four sons of Captain Thomas Morris, soldier author of the popular song Kitty Crowder, who died about 1752. Charles Morris the songwriter and poet was his brother. Morris entered Winchester College as a scholar in 1741. After time in tuition in London, joined the 17th Foot, which was his father's regiment, at Kinsale, in 1748. In 1753 he took leave and spent time in Paris, giving him a command of the French language. American service In 1757 Morris shipped with his regiment for the Americas. He was at Canajoharie in 1761, from where he wrote to his good friend Richard Montgomery. Morris spent time in Martinique, the 17th Regiment having taken part in the Invasion of Martinique (1762) under Robert Monckton, and served at the siege of Havana (1762). He was then under Colonel John Bradstreet in North America. For Bradstreet, who was marching along the southern shore of Lake Erie from Niagara to re-establish British control in Indiana, he undertook a chancy mission in 1764, just after the end of the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War in the North American theatre). When Morris was sent off on 26 August, without an escort of soldiers, Bradstreet had been misinformed by Delaware Indians and Shawnees about the attitude of Native Americans to the west. Miami chief Pacanne, who released Morris, sketch from 1778 Morris ascended the Maumee River, with the permission of the Miami Indians, carrying a message to the French at Fort de Chartres, and with a mission of pacification, directed to make peace with the Native American groups he met. He was supposed to summon these groups to a council at Detroit with the British.Dowd, p. 264. He was supposed also to cross the watershed with the Wabash River (at Kekionga, close to modern Fort Wayne), and make his way into Illinois down the Wabash. In fact Morris first met Pontiac at a village of Ottawa Indians. Morris wrote in a confident tone to Thomas Mante, then brigade-major with Bradstreet, of the results to be expected from Pontiac's co-operative attitude. But these were to be negated by the reactions of others of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, at Detroit. Morris's own observation of the prevalent drapeau blanc in the village reflected the continuing influence of the idea that French power would return from its defeat.Dowd, pp. 264‚Äì5. It was Bradstreet's diplomacy or lack of it at Detroit (see Pontiac's War), in Pontiac's absence, that would later be criticised by Thomas Gage.Jon William Parmenter, Pontiac's War: Forging New Links in the Anglo-Iroquois Covenant Chain, 1758‚Äì1766, Ethnohistory, Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 1997), at p. 633.

Pacanne asserted authority there, over the counsel of two Kickapoo chiefs who warned Morris away from Fort Ouiatenon (near modern West Lafayette). Morris, as he recorded in his Journal, had no choice but to return down the Maumee. He went on to Detroit to rejoin the British forces. A modern view does not take Morris's narrative at face value, arguing that Pacanne's intervention implemented an early decision by the Miami chiefs to spare Morris, while also allowing a demonstration of local feelings. On Morris's account, Bradstreet was at that point up the Sandusky River, and unaware of the threatening hostility of the Native Americans to the west. Bradstreet had reached Detroit shortly after sending Morris upriver, and returned to the Sandusky to await developments. Morris's news came through on 21 September, and revealed the Shawnee deceit; but then Bradstreet played a waiting game in September and into October, which failed, but because of bad weather. In 1765 Morris was commander at Fort Niagara. Later life Morris returned to England in 1767. Through the Friends to the Liberty of the Press, he and his brother Charles became associated with the radical publisher James Ridgway.Ralph A. Manogue, James Ridgway and America, Early American Literature Vol. 31, No. 3 (1996), at p. 267. Published by: University of North Carolina Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25057061 He was one of the original subscribers to the Royal Literary Fund, at whose annual meetings (1794‚Äì97) he recited his own verses. On April 16, 1792, as a fundraiser for the RLF, Morris played the title role in Shakespeare‚Äôs Richard III at the Haymarket Theatre in London ‚Äì the culmination of a life-long interest as theatre-goer, drama critic, actor, and playwright. The best record of his experience in the drama is his ‚ÄòLetter to a Friend on the Poetical Elocution of the Theatre and the Manner of Acting Tragedy‚Äô, published in his ‚ÄòMiscellanies‚Äô of 1791. Morris recruited several professional actresses, including well-known performers Sarah Francis and Maria Hunter, while the other actors were amateurs including two of his sons. He is stated in 1806 to have been living in retirement at Hampstead. He was living in Mary St, Fitzroy Sq, London at the time of his death on 10 Feb, 1808. Works Morris's published volumes were: * The Bee, a Collection of Songs, London, 1790. * Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, 1791. * A Life of the Rev. D. Williams, 1792. This was a biography of David Williams, founder of the Royal Literary Fund. * Quashy, or the Coal-black Maid. A tale relative to the Slave-trade, 1796. This abolitionist poem based on slave life on Martinique was republished in New York, in Time Piece. It suggested a moral equivalence between the African rulers and British merchants engaged in the Atlantic slave trade. In his notes Morris made some intentionally shocking comments on miscegenation. His Journal from the Miscellanies was printed in 1904 as Journal of Captain Thomas Morris, of His Majesty's XVII regiment of infantry; Detroit, 25 September 1764.Posted at archive.org. It covers his expedition from Cedar Point, Ohio to Detroit. Morris published it much later, in hope of a pension.Houghton Mifflin Chronology of US Literature: Works by Thomas Morris, on answers.com. Morris's recorded views on the Native Americans were positive. The original form of the Journal was published by Peckham in 1941.Dowd p. 276 note 31. Family In 1769 Morris married Sarah (Sally) Chubb, daughter of a merchant at Bridgwater, by whom he had six children. She was the sister of well-known amateur artist John Chubb. Thomas Morris was the nephew of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Morris (1703-1767), also of the 17th Regiment of Foot and who also served in North America (1757-1758?).

Dronpa gets switched off by strong illumination with 488 nm (blue) light and this can be reversed by weak 405 nm UV light. A single dronpa molecule can be switched on and off over 100 times. It has an excitation peak at 503 nm and an emission peak at 518 nm. History A tetrameric, reversibly switchable fluorescent protein was discovered in a cDNA screen of a stony coral (Pectiniidae). A monomeric variant of this protein was named \\"Dronpa\\" after \\"Dron\\" a ninja term for vanishing and pa for photoactivation. Structure and mechanism of photoswitching On-cis (green) and Off-trans (yellow) states of the chromophore. Nearby residues that move are also shown. Clockwise from the top: Arg66, Val157, Ser142, Cys-Tyr-Gly chromophore. Dronpa is 257 amino acids long and is a 28.8 kDa monomer. Dronpa is 76% similar in sequence to GFP and shares a similar structure with an 11 stranded Œ≤-barrel (a Œ≤-can) enclosing an Œ±-helix. The chromophore is formed autocatalytically from residues Cys62, Tyr63 and Gly64. The on state of the dronpa molecule has the chromophore in a cis conformation while the off state chromophore exists in the trans conformation. Several other residues in the vicinity of the chromophore also move during the on-off transition resulting a very different electrostatic environment. Applications Dronpa's fast dynamics and stability under repeated cycles of switching make it one of the more important switchable fluorescent proteins. It is used in super resolution microscopy techniques like PALM/STORM. It can also be used to track fast dynamics of proteins in cells. Oligomeric forms of Dronpa have been engineered as synthetic photosensory domains. When a dimeric or tetrameric form of Dronpa photoswitches, its oligomerization affinity changes. This was used to enable optical control over the activity of enzymes. Specifically, two Dronpa domains can be attached to locations on a protein so that their tetramerization or oligomerization blocks or cages protein function in the dark, but monomerization after illumination activates or uncages protein function. This method has been used to control a variety of proteins including serine/threonine kinases. References Proteins ","title":"Dronpa"},{"id":"38553259","text":"General Kock with his personal staff.

Wheels were constantly turned while he was alive, making the ash whirl about, and the person died by gradual suffocation as he inhaled the ash.Rollin, C.:\\"The ancient history of the Egyptians, Carthaginians, Assyrians ..., Volume 3, London 1735, p.396-98\\" The description can be found in Valerius Maximus and .For Maccabee description, see: George D'Oyly and Richard Mant: \\"The Holy Bible: With Notes, Explanatory and Practical...

Another half-brother, Ochus (later called Darius II) rebelled against him, and killed Sogdianus in this manner because he had promised Sogdianus he would not die by the sword, by poison or by hunger. At the instigation of his wife Parysatis, Darius II had his brother, Arsites, executed in the same manner for rebellion, along with Arsites' general Artyphius.

She opened the batting for Australia in the first Women's Test match, against England on 28 December 1934. A right-handed batsman, she scored 340 runs in international matches, at an average of 28.33. In 2011, she was inducted into the Cricket New South Wales Hall of Fame. Life and career Pritchard was born in Sydney on 23 December 1913. She made her debut in state cricket for New South Wales in 1931 at the age of 17. During England's 1934‚Äì35 tour of Australia and New Zealand, she faced the touring side in four matches. The first of these appearances was for New South Wales, for whom she top- scored in both innings, making 27 and 75 in a match that England won by seven wickets. In the following match, the first Women's Test match, Pritchard faced the first ball. She eventually hit her own wicket after scoring four runs. In the second innings, she improved, scoring 20 runs. She fared less well in the second Test, suffering a pair: being dismissed without scoring in both innings. In the third match, she batted in the middle order in the first innings, and returned to open the batting in the second, scoring five runs in each innings of the drawn match. During the 1936‚Äì37 season, she scored the first century in women's interstate cricket, retiring out after scoring 144 against Queensland. She was part of the Australian team which toured England in 1937. During that tour, she was Australia's most effective batsman, scoring 306 Test runs at an average of 51.00. She began the tour strongly, with scores of 74 not out against Kent, and 96 and 43 not out against the Midlands. She helped Australia to victory in the first Test match, hitting 87 runs in the first innings and 17 in the second. During her next match, against a team representing the \\"North of England\\", she scored the first century by an Australian woman in England, remaining 144 not out as Australia recorded a large victory. Pritchard top-scored for Australia in both innings of the second Test, making 67 and 41, but a century from Myrtle Maclagan helped England to win by 25 runs. She recorded a half-century and two low scores in tour matches before the third Test, in which she scored 28 runs in the first innings and 66 in the second in a drawn match. Her performances drew comparisons to Don Bradman, and she was nicknamed the \\"Girl Bradman\\". The outbreak of the Second World War ended her cricket career; in all she scored 340 Test runs at an average of 28.33, with a top-score of 87. Her contributions were recognised in 2011, when she was inducted into the Cricket New South Wales Hall of Fame. She died on 3 November 1967 in Sydney, aged 53.

The organization, Muslims in Britain, classify the Croydon Masjid as Deobandi. History The story of Croydon Mosque began from informal gatherings in the basement of 32 Derby Road, West Croydon in the mid-1960s. After 32 Derby Road received a compulsory purchase order to make way for the Handcroft Road Housing Redevelopment, the Croydon Mosque Association was formed in 1970, and began renting a vacant 'office area' at 45 Wellesley Road to meet and pray. A madrasah, the five times a day congregational salah, a wudhu area, regular \\"jalsah's,\\" the two madrasah mini-bus system, Wing Chun classes and a youth club began; over the 13 years while at the ground floor Wellesley Road site. On the suggestion from the local Kenyan community; a Qari, who was also a Hafiz and Alim was employed. The Muslim community were again asked to move, as now 45 Wellesley Road was to be redeveloped, and the mosque moved to its current premises at 525 London Road in 1978. However, redevelopment plans twice had to be put on hold due to lack of funds. The association was able to complete the work thanks to donations, including a gift of more than ¬£100,000 from Shah Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, after a plea from then Croydon North East MP Bernard Weatherill. Phase one of the mosque's renovation was concluded by the completion of its dome in 1988. Within a decade, phase two was also complete, with new offices and prayer space being built.http://english.irib.ir/radioislam/news/islam-in-europe/item/82081-uk- past-of-croydon-mosque-celebrated-as-new-era-begins In April 2012, phase three plans were unveiled for a \\"green\\" four-storey extension, to be used as a women and children's centre and an 18-metre minaret. The new building will also increase the mosque's capacity to 4,000, reflecting the growth of Croydon's Muslim community since the centre was built in the 1980s. Members of the mosque have donated around ¬£500,000 to fund the project. Community Originally established to serve a local Muslim community of predominately East African, Indian and Pakistani immigrants, the mosque now serves a diverse Muslim community from in and around the London Borough of Croydon. In recent years, this has included an increasing number of those of Somalian, Turkish, Afghan, Middle Eastern and Bosnian origin amongst others.

The building was completed in 1897 and today houses much of City Council, including the offices of the Mayor, Secretary, and Press Office. Background The Algeciras City Council was established in 1755 after a long legal battle for the emancipation of San Roque. The current Town Hall, designed by Amadeo Rodriguez, commenced on May 14, 1892, and was completed on August 15, 1897. Architecture The final work lacks the elegance with which it was conceived and appears heavy and robust, consisting of two bodies and displaying the coat of arms of the city. The facade is made of sandstone with elements of red brick buildings. Inside the two floors are articulated around two central courtyards. The plenary hall has interesting decor tiles made during the tenure of Mayor Emilio Morillas in the colours of the city, and several yellow and blue mosaics depicting typical places. There is also a mosaic commemorating the Algeciras Conference of 1906.

The Berliet T100 was a truck manufactured by Berliet in the 1950s. It was, at the time, the largest truck in the world. Design Three trucks were built with normal control (with the cab behind the front axle); the fourth was built with forward control (cab-over-engine design (and sleeping accommodation)). They had 29.6 litre Cummins V12 engines, providing and . The trucks were intended for off-road use, in the oil and mining industries, in particular petroleum exploration in the Sahara. Steering was powered by a separate small Panhard engine. The first two trucks were 6x6 flatbeds with gross weights of 103 tonnes; the third was built as a 6x4 dumper truck, for the uranium mine at Bessines-sur-Gartempe; the fourth was another flatbed truck with 102 tonne gross weight, or 190 tonnes as a tractor. It was experimentally fitted with a Turbomeca gas turbine in 1962, but fuel consumption was excessive, so the conventional diesel engine was fitted again. History The trucks were designed and built in secret, and with a tight deadline; the first was finished after nine months, at the factory in Courbevoie. It was unveiled, by surprise, at the 1957 Paris car show. However, it was too big to fit in the main exhibition hall, so Berliet built a special external pavilion to exhibit the huge new truck. It was then shown at various other car shows - Lyon, Avignon, Helsinki, Casablanca, Frankfurt, and Geneva. It went to work in the oil and gas fields of the Sahara; after Algerian independence it became property of the Algerian government, and was eventually preserved in Hassi- Messaoud. The second T100 was built in 1958 and two more in 1959. The second T100, having worked in Algeria, was later returned to the Berliet Foundation's museum in 1981. The trucks were stablemates of the Berliet GBO15, a 60-ton 6x6 truck which had been released in 1956. 45 were built, most exported to Algeria.

His genre was particularly painting working men such as fishermen, shepherds, crofters, pedlars, and farm labourers. However he also painted Scottish, French and Dutch country and coastal scenery. He usually signed his work in the right hand bottom corner.  Biography  Doing the Provinces by Robert McGregor. 1879 Robert McGregor (MacGregor) RSA was the son of a Scottish businessman who lived first in Bradford, Yorkshire, where Robert was born in 1847 but later moved with his family to Dunfermline and afterwards to Edinburgh when Robert was still young. Although he at the time had not had any art training he was employed at Nelson‚Äôs book publishers in Edinburgh as a book illustrator. He attended the RSA Life schools and simultaneously was taught by a French artist to paint and draw. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1873 and was elected a member there in 1889. He continued to exhibit at the RSA until 1914. McGregor travelled frequently to France in particular to Brittany and Normandy and to the Netherlands. In France he was influenced by the painters Jean- Fran√ßois Millet (1814‚Äì1875) and Jules Bastien-Lepage(1848‚Äì1889). In the Netherlands he was influenced by the painters Anton Mauve (1838‚Äì1888) and Jozef Isra√´ls (1824‚Äì1911), hence the changing styles of his work. James Lewis Caw (1864‚Äì1950), director of the Scottish National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, wrote of McGregor that he probably was the first Scottish genre painter to apply rigorous study of tone in his work and a pleasant if restricted colourist. Although he had learned much of some of his modern Dutchmen and his pictures were individual and have a sentiment of their own. Others praised him for the combination of tone with quiet colours and the more subtle light of the Dutch coast. McGregor died in Edinburgh in 1922.

It is one of the major centres of activity in the city, hosting numerous events and festivals throughout the year. Some of the city's most important buildings such as the Iglesia de la Palma and the Capilla de Europa stand on the square while neighbouring streets include Calle Ancha and Calle Convento. Geography The plaza is bounded by Camino Pablo Mayaho and Camino Ventura Moron. The Iglesia de la Palma is to the west, while the Capilla de Europa is to the southeast. Name The square has had various names over time which mirror the history of Spain. Its first name, as today, was Plaza Alta which can be seen on a map dated 1725. After the city's replanning in 1807, Manuel Godoy called it Plaza del Almirante but shortly afterwards it became Plaza del Rey, then in conjunction with the 1821 insurrection, Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, returning to its previous name in 1824. From 10 October 1830, to mark Isabel II's ascension to the throne it was changed to Plaza de la Reina. In 1873, with the proclamation of the republic, it again became Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, a name it kept until 1931 when it was renamed Plaza de la Rep√∫blica and in 1936, after the Civil War, Plaza del General√≠simo Franco. Finally during the transition, it finally returned to its original name, Plaza Alta, which in fact was what everyone had always called it.Historia de Algeciras (3 volumes) (2001). Diputaci√≥n de C√°diz, p.136. (Spanish language) History Aerial view The area the Plaza Alta occupies has existed since the city was remodeled in accordance with plans the Marquis of Verboom produced. There it is designated \\"Plaza Alta\\" (high square), in contrast to the market square \\"Plaza Baja\\" (low square).Since 1783, it has had a public fountain, Los Arcos, supplied with water from the city's aqueduct. The first systematic replanning of the area was undertaken in 1807 by General Casta√±os, Governor of the Campo de Gibraltar. In the original plans, the western end of the square was raised to provide a level area and the boundaries with the surrounding streets were marked off with chains attached to stone posts. There were eight entrances: four in the corners and another four on the sides. The square was surrounded by poplars and there were orange trees in tubs. There was to have been an obelisk in the center of the square but it was replaced by a column designed by Joaquin Dolz. A bust of Manuel Godoy was planned for the top but in fact it was never added. The square was redesigned in 1925 by Mayor Joaquin Bianchi when the obelisk was blown up and the area was paved over. Mart√≠nez Zotarelli, Jos√© (2005). Historias de la Plaza Alta (Algeciras). pp. 319. 84-609-4002-0 p.183. A little later, a street lamp was placed at the centre on a red brick structure which the people called la cocina econ√≥mica (the cheap kitchen) while the pillars, chains and benches were kept until the surrounding streets were widened for traffic in 1929. A year later in 1930, the square was once again remodeled by Mayor Emilio Morillas Salinas, taking on the appearance it has today. The plaza was considered to be a landmark the childhood of Paco de Luc√≠a. Architecture and fittings The symmetrical plaza contains a monumental fountain at the centre, circular benches and lamp posts all around, while a balustrade borders the surrounding streets, all decorated with Seville ceramics from the factories Cer√°mica Santa Ana and Cer√°mica Triana Casa Gonz√°le. Little has changed since the 1930 remodel, although a few benches have been added with ceramic decorations inspired by Cervantes' Don Quixote, a few palm trees have been planted and there are potted floral decorations.

An award, sometimes called a distinction, is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field. When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration. An award may be described by three aspects: 1) who is given 2) what 3) by whom, all varying according to purpose. The recipient is often a single person or else a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country. The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal (order), badge, ribbon or pin. It can also be a token object such as prize, trophy or plaque. The award may also be or be accompanied by a title, certificate or diploma, as well as an object of direct value such as money or a scholarship. Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient(s) a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way. An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority (see fount of honour), or else a private organisation or individual. The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards. For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize. Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests. The Stanley Cup is a modern example. In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient. Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory. There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools. A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations.

The expeditions demonstrated the ability of Berliet trucks to cross long stretches of desert and wilderness, and also supported geographical and scientific research. Expeditions The first expedition set out from Ouargla in November 1959, heading south into the Sahara for Djanet, past Adrar Bous and resupply in Agadez. It then visited the Arbre du T√©n√©r√© and the Termit Massif before continuing to Lake Chad and Fort Lamy (present-day N'Djamena). The return route followed a challenging passage from Lake Chad north via Agadem to the oasis of Bilma, the ruins of Djado as well as an excursion to the prehistoric rock art sites in the remote valley of Enneri Blaka, before returning to Djanet and Ouargla in January 1960. Crossing the Erg of Bilma north of Agadem was a particular challenge. The expedition covered 10,000 km in 50 days. A second expedition set off from Ouargla in October 1960, before taking a new, more easterly route via S√©guedine and south of the Djado Plateau towards Zouar in the Tibesti and Faya Largeau. This route sought to avoid the difficult dunes of the eastern Bilma Erg, making it more practical for conventional, RWD trucks. The expedition reached Fort Lamy in November 1960 and returned to Djanet in December, travelling via Adrar Bous on the edge of the A√Ør Mountains. On the way back, from near Zouar in north- western Chad, across the northern T√©n√©r√© to Adrar Bous and up to Mount Tiska, close to Djanet, 22 Berliet-branded 'balises' or marker posts were erected. Their positions feature on the current Michelin 741 map of North West Africa, and some still survive today in the T√©n√©r√©. As well as drivers and mechanics, the expeditions included scientists researching local biology, geology, archaeology and ethnography. The first expedition also included a substantial press corps. Research uncovered evidence of early human settlement dating back to around 3200 BCE, in areas that are now arid desert. Artefacts included stone tools and pottery. Vehicles A Berliet GBC truck, with a military cab instead of the civilian version used for the expedition. The core of the T√©n√©r√© expedition was a fleet of nine Berliet GBC8 6WD trucks nicknamed \\"Gazelle\\". The trucks had been designed for use in desert conditions such as the oilfields of Algeria and were first tested in 1957 in the dunes of Ermenonville, near Paris. The trucks had 7.9 litre, 125 hp engines. Four Series II Land Rovers accompanied the trucks, as well as a Bell helicopter. As well as helping with dune navigation, a Bell helicopter was able to shoot spectacular aerial footage of the vehicles in action as well as hitherto unseen corners of the Sahara. In 2015 the Fondation Berliet released a full- colour, 52-minute dvd In addition to most of the above vehicles, the second expedition used four Berliet GLM 10 M HC trucks - a more conventional rear- wheel-drive cargo truck. Each carried 11 tons of cargo.

This election was a part of national Italian general election of 2013 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. Lombardy obtained two more seats to the Senate, following the redistricting subsequent to the 2011 Census. For the first time in history, a senatorial election was paired with a regional election. The election was won by the centre-right coalition between The People of Freedom and the Northern League, differently as it happened at national level and hugely contributing to create that hung parliament which was the general result of the 2013 vote. All the two coalitions lost votes to the newly created Five Star Movement of comedian Beppe Grillo and, in a minor scale, to the Civic Choice of incumbent PM Mario Monti. Ten provinces gave a plurality to the centre-right coalition, while the provinces of Milan and Mantua preferred Bersani's alliance. Electoral law The electoral law for the Senate was established in 2005 by the Calderoli Law, and it is a form of semi-proportional representation. A party presents its own closed list and it can join other parties in alliances. The coalition which receives a plurality automatically wins at least 27 seats. Respecting this condition, seats are divided between coalitions, and subsequently to party lists, using the largest remainder method with a Hare quota.

Biography Yuzawa was born in Kamitsuga District, Tochigi in what is now part of the city of Kanuma as the son of a kannushi (Shinto priest)]. After his graduation in 1912 from Tokyo Imperial University he entered the Home Ministry. He served within the ministry within the field of public health, and oversaw the establishment of the Meiji Shrine Games, which were held annually from 1924-1943. In 1929, he was appointed Governor of Miyagi Prefecture. In 1931 he became Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1935, he was appointed Governor of Hy≈çgo Prefecture. In 1936, Yuzawa was appointed Vice Minister of the Home Ministry. In 1938, under the Hirota K≈çki administration, Yuzawa was dispatched to China, to assist in the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. While working closely with the Japanese Northern China Area Army, he established close connections with its chief-of-staff, General Akira Mut≈ç. In 1940, he was appointed chairman of the Dai-Nippon Sangy≈ç J≈çh≈çkokukai, a war-time umbrella organization encompassing all of the former labor unions, which were now under government control. On February 7, 1942, Yuzawa was appointed Home Minister in the T≈çj≈ç administration. T≈çj≈ç had originally insisted on holding the post concurrently with that of Prime Minister during the first months of World War II, fearing that the powerful security apparatus controlled by the Home Ministry could pose a threat to his administration should the war situation deteriorate. As Home Minister, Yuzawa organized government support for the Taisei Yokusankai, which won a landslide victory in the 1942 General Election, but had to contend with the increasing radicalization of the paramilitary youth wing of the party, the Yokusan Sonendan. Shillony. Page 32‚Äì33 He also oversaw the creation of Tokyo Metropolis by the merger of Tokyo City with Tokyo-fu in 1942. From April 1943 until the end of World War II, Yuzawa was appointed to a seat in the House of Peers. After the surrender of Japan, Yuzawa was (along with all other members of the wartime government), purged by orders of the American occupation authorities. He subsequently served as honorary chairman of the Central Social Insurance Medical Council.

The seat of the municipality is the town of Kranjska Gora. Geography The municipality is located in the Upper Sava Valley, a typical Alpine valley. Located at the far northwest of Slovenia where the borders of Slovenia, Austria, and Italy meet, the valley is embraced on the north and south by the peaks of the Karawanks and the Julian Alps. In the east its border runs just below the town of Jesenice, where the valley opens up towards the Radovljica Valley, extending in the west along the watershed between the Sava and Slizza rivers, just west of Rateƒçe. In the north the Wurzenpass at Podkoren leads to Arnoldstein in Carinthia, in the south the Vr≈°iƒç Pass connects it with Trenta in the Slovenian Littoral region. The Upper Sava Valley has an Alpine climate with its long, snow-abundant winters and shorter summers with moderate temperatures, easterly winds and sufficient rain to maintain the valley's greenery. The winter usually stays in the valley for between four and five months, and a blanket of snow usually covers the valley for just around four months. The lowest daytime temperature in January sometimes reaches , while on average it usually warms up during the day to just over freezing point. The average temperature in the hottest summer months is in the morning, rising up to around during the day. In winter, there are large differences between the sunny and shady slopes embracing the valley. The sunny slopes are accommodating to hikes and strolls, while the shady slopes retain a snow blanket. =Settlements= In addition to the municipal seat of Kranjska Gora, the municipality also includes the following settlements: * Belca * Dovje * Gozd Martuljek * Log * Mojstrana * Podkoren * Rateƒçe * Srednji Vrh * Zgornja Radovna Gallery File:Pogled iz slemena..SS.jpg|Mount Jalovec File:Gozd Martuljek, kerk foto3 2011-07-19 10.54.jpg|Church in Gozd Martuljek File:Kranjska Gora Mojstrana Vrata Triglav- Nordwand 2011-08-26 777.jpg|Northern wall of Mt.

The attack, organized by the forest brigand Veerappan, killed 22 people, making it the deadliest explosive attack in Karnataka during the 20th century. Background The sandalwood smuggler and criminal Veerappan killed a Bandari in Govindapadi village of Mettur on 8, April 1993, suspecting him to be a police informer and openly challenged the police force to track and arrest his gang. He also claimed he would raise a banner at Kolathur village on shandy day, written in Tamil language challenging \\"Rambo\\" Gopalakrishnan, the Tamil Nadu police officer, who also belongs to Veerappan's caste. Months prior to this Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had formed a joint Special Task Force, with one of their objectives being to track down Veerappan. Taking the open challenge, IPS officer K.Gopalakrishnan left Palar base of STF, near M.M.Hills, 100 km from Kollegal of Karnataka along with a team of 41 members which included police from two states, forest officials, forest watchers and informers. The team left in two vehicles, of which one was a bus carrying most of the team members, and a jeep carrying K.Goplakrashnan, the IPS officer, who stood on the footboard of the jeep watching the road ahead. The Veerappan gang had planted IED landmines on the road in more than 14 places to halt their approach. Incident As the bus was passing over the landmines, Simon Madaiah detonated the gelatin sticks just outside the town of Surakkamaduvu, resulting in an explosion that threw the bus hundreds of feet away and killing 22 people. Madaiah sustained minor injuries during the incident but escaped in the forest. Among the deceased were five police men of Tamil Nadu, 17 forest officials and informers, while 13 other members of the team including Karnataka police were injured. Members of the Veerappan gang then fired on the team from a vantage point in the forest, leaving the police to retaliate and prevent the gang from snatching arms and ammunition. Tamil Nadu IPS officer K.Gopalakrishnan, who was standing on the footboard of the jeep was thrown out during the blast, suffered severe injuries to his head and legs and underwent nine surgeries, returning for duty after 18 months and later retired as DIG in 2008. He saw several members of the gang including Madhaiayan, Gnanaprakasam, Simon and Bilavendran at the blast site and his witness was crucial in prosecuting those members responsible. Aftermath Police filed a case at M.M.Hills Police Station against 124 persons under TADA in connection with the blast and 50 were arrested by police. The accused included Veerappan, Muthulakshmi, Kolathur Mani, and Nakeeran reporter S.Sivasubramaniam. Muthulakshmi, wife of Veerappan as well as Kolathur Mani, a Tamil activist were acquitted. Seven members of Veerappan's gang were punished and awarded with life term sentences. A later appeal at the Supreme Court by the four members, would see these life sentences changed to the death penalty, a rare occurrence. The four convicts; Jnanaprakash (Veerappan's elder brother), Bilavendran, Simon and Meesekar Madaiah, filed against execution of their death penalties at Karnataka High Court.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future. Description There are two ways to play STA: skirmishes and conquests. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Conquests are a series of skirmishes linked in a league-style arrangement. In conquests, players begin with a group of recruit characters. Skirmish Tactics Apocalypse was released on BoardGameGeek as a free print and play game in February 2013. STA is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective. Players win skirmishes in STA by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives. The game board for STA - called the gamescape - is formed from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement. Each character in STA is represented by a token and has a corresponding character card. During conquest play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite status. Players control characters from one of the game's six factions. The Combine and Marauders are part of the core game; the other four factions can be integrated seamlessly: * Combine: The Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world. * Echo: Echo is a faction led by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers. * Erthen: Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter. * Marauders: The Marauders are a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare. * Order of the New Dawn: The Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement. * Soldiers of Light: The Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependence on technology.

In 1885, subscribers contributed ¬£4,250 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), to build the church on a site donated by the Bridgewater Trustees. The subscribers included the Earl of Ellesmere, Lord Lilford, Mrs Harrison of Chaddock Hall and Henry Yates. The church's foundation stone was laid by the Countess of Ellesmere on 14 February 1885. The church was built in 1886 as a chapel of ease to the parish church in Tyldesley. Mosley Common was made into a separate parish in 1894.

While his critics called him \\"the notorious hanging Judge Torrens\\", the legal profession as a whole praised his legal ability and integrity. Despite increasing complaints about his physical infirmity, he remained on the Bench into extreme old age. Through his daughter Henrietta he was the ancestor of the Barons O'Neill.Mosley (ed.) Burke's Peerage 107th Edition 2003 Vol.2, p.3010 Torrens family He was born in Derry, the third child of the Reverend Thomas Torrens and his wife Elizabeth Curry.Ball , F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 (John Murray London 1926) Vol.2 p.343 The Torrens family were of Swedish origin,Ball p,343 and were descended from a Swedish officer who came to Ireland in 1689 in the army of William III of England. They were a numerous family with a tendency to intermarry, so that the Torrens family tree can be difficult to untangle. The judge should not be confused with Robert Torrens, the economist, who was his first cousin. Sir Henry Torrens, the noted military adviser, was the judge's brother; their eldest brother, John, became Archdeacon of Dublin. Sir Henry Torrens, the judge's brother. Early life Both of Robert's parents died when their children were very young, and they were entrusted to the care of relatives. Little is known of Robert Torrens's schooldays. He graduated from the University of Dublin in 1795, entered Middle Temple the following year and was called to the Bar in 1798. He became King's Counsel in 1817 and Third Serjeant in 1822.Ball p.343 Later career In 1822 he was appointed under the Insurrection Act of 1807 to be the Commissioner for County Limerick,Ball p.343 with the aim of dealing with the serious problem of agrarian violence in that county. He is said to have discharged his duties with great diligence, moderation and humanity, and to have earned the gratitude of the Crown as a result; this, as much as his brother Henry's friendship with the Duke of Wellington, explains his appointment to the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1823.Ball p.262 As a judge he was well-regarded; even Daniel O'Connell, no friend to the Irish Bench in general, seems to have thought well of him, although on one occasion he gravely embarrassed the judge by suggesting that he had shown bias against a Catholic priest.Geoghegan, Patrick M. King Dan- the rise of Daniel O'Connell Gill and Macmillan Dublin 2008 pp. 75-6 He was the junior judge at the Doneraile conspiracy trials in 1829 where O'Connell secured the acquittal of most of the accused; both judges, Torrens and Richard Pennefather, have been highly praised for their impartial conduct of the trials.Geoghegan pp.6-7 In 1855-6 Torrens was one of several Irish judges who was threatened with removal from office by the House of Commons as being too old or inform to fulfill their duties properly.Ball p.294 The Irish Bar strongly opposed his removal from office, pleading that although he was eighty years of age, Torrens was an exceptionally conscientious and hard-working judge. Torrens protested strongly at the suggestion that he was unfit for office, but in any event, he died suddenly at his country house, Derrynoid Lodge, just after the spring assizes in 1856.Ball p.294 Family Like many of the Torrens clan he married a cousin, in his case, Anne Torrens.

Since classification of the minors began, seven of them have been labeled as class D loops and one played in an independent league. History=Americus Pallbearers= The Americus Pallbearers became a founding member of the original Georgia State League in 1906. The Pallbearers finished dead-last in the six-team league, with a record of 13‚Äì32, a full 22 games behind the first place Waycross Machinists. The league folded at the end of the season, and Americus was without a professional team in 1907. =Americus Muckalees= The Americus Muckalees were members of the Empire State League in 1913 and continued playing from 1914 to 1915 when the six-team circuit was renamed the Georgia State League. In 1913, the Muckalees ended in fourth place with a 45‚Äì54 record, games behind first place Valdosta Millionaires. Then, in 1914 the Americus team became the first champion team in Georgia State League history. But the resurgence of the league did not even last two years. The circuit started 1915 as the Georgia State League and was renamed the Florida‚ÄìAlabama‚ÄìGeorgia League (FLAG League), which operated in Florida, on June 15. The Americus Muckalees (11‚Äì18) then were forced to move to Florida and changed its name to Gainesville Sharks (18‚Äì24), ending fifth with a combined 29‚Äì42 record, 16 games out of the first place spot. =Americus Cardinals= The Americus Cardinals operated in the Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League from 1935 through 1938. During that span, Americus had affiliation agreements with the St. Louis Cardinals (1936), Brooklyn Dodgers (1937) and Washington Senators (1938). The team had records of 59‚Äì57 in 1935 (3rd place), 58‚Äì58 in 1936 (3rd), 50‚Äì71 in 1937 (6th), and 65‚Äì61 in 1938 (3rd), reaching the postseason in 1938, but lost in the first round of the playoffs. =Americus Pioneers= In 1939, the Cardinals changed its name to the Americus Pioneers and continued to operate in the Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League until 1942, first as a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate (1939‚Äì1940) and then with the Chicago Cubs (1942). This time the team suffered four losing seasons, going 63‚Äì76 in 1939 (7th place), 67‚Äì72 in 1940 (5th), 56‚Äì81 in 1941 (6th) and 49‚Äì77 in 1942 (7th). =Americus Phillies= After a long absence, in 1946 the franchise returned to the Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League as the Americus Phillies, playing there uninterrupted until the 1950 season as a Philadelphia Phillies affiliated team. In its first season, Americus won the title in the eight-team league after sporting an 87‚Äì37 record, having games of advantage over second place Moultrie Packers. The team won the first round of the playoffs, but lost the final series to Moultrie. Americus declined the next two years, ending with records of 65‚Äì74 in 1947 (6th place) and 50‚Äì89 in 1948 (8th). Then, they went 71‚Äì67 in 1948 (4th) and 70‚Äì67 in 1950 (4th). Both times they reached the postseason, losing in the first round and the league finals, respectively. =Americus Rebels= In 1951, the Phillies were replaced by the Americus Rebels, though the team lasted only one year in the GFL. Americus finished sixth with a 55‚Äì70 mark, games out of contention. =Americus-Cordele Orioles= The franchise returned to the league in 1954, this time as the Americus-Cordele Orioles affiliated team of the Baltimore Orioles.

In a racing career confined to racecourses in Yorkshire she ran nine times and won four races between August 1826 and October 1828. After winning three of her first four races she defeated the Derby winner Mameluke in a controversial race for the 1827 St Leger. She was retired from racing after four unsuccessful races in 1828 and became a broodmare. Background Matilda was a \\"small, fidgety, temperamental\\" bay mare owned and bred by Edward Petre (1794‚Äì1848), a free- spending sportsman and gambler, who was a younger son of Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. Matilda was the seventh foal of Lord Egremont's mare Juliana, a daughter of Platina, the winner of the 1795 Epsom Oaks. Platina was a sister of Chestnut Skim, the female-line ancestor of Frederick, Election and The Merry Monarch. Matilda was sired by Comus, a descendant of the Godolphin Arabian who finished third in the 1812 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful sire of winners. Like the rest of Petre's horses, Matilda was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire. Racing career=1826: two-year-old season= Matilda began her racing career on 9 August 1826 in a sweepstakes at York Racecourse in which she finished unplaced behind a colt named Popsy. Two days later she reappeared for a race over the same course and distance. Ridden by Sim Templeman, she recorded her first win \\"in a canter\\" by beating the colts Moonshine (subsequently the winner of the Champagne Stakes) and Reviewer. On 21 September, at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster Racecourse, Matilda started the 4/1 second favourite for a one mile sweepstakes for two-year-olds. Ridden by Bob Johnson, she led from the start and won by a length from Popsy, with the favourite Lunacy in third place. =1827: three-year-old season= Matilda beats Mameluke in the 1827 St Leger Matilda made her first appearance as a three-year-old at York on 10 August when she started 5/4 favourite for a ten furlong sweepstake. Ridden by Bill Scott, she led from the start, set a strong pace and \\"won easy\\" from Moonshine and Kit Cat. The Sporting Magazine praised the filly's speed, but criticised her lack of size, dubious stamina and difficult temperament. On 18 September, Matilda was sent to Doncaster to contest the St Leger Stakes over one and three quarter miles, in which she was ridden by Jem Robinson. She was third favourite in the betting at odds of 9/1 behind her stable companion Granby and the Derby winner Mameluke. The start of the race was chaotic and controversial: the official starter, Mr Lockwood, proved unable to control the jockeys and there were at least seven false starts before the race began. There were suspicions that Lockwood, and many of the jockeys had been bribed to delay the start for as long as possible in the hope of upsetting Mameluke and preventing the southern horse from winning. Matilda, however, was also disadvantaged: on several of the false starts she broke quickly and galloped a good distance before being recalled. When the race finally began Matilda led the field after 80 yards and maintained her advantage into the straight. A furlong from the finish she was headed by Mameluke, but rallied to win by a length. It was reported that Petre won bets totalling ¬£15,000 on the race, including a ¬£2,000 bet that he would win the St Leger before the \\"Catholic Question\\" was carried by parliament. Matilda was scheduled to run a match race over one mile against Mr Foljambe's black filly on the last day of the Doncaster meeting, but the race did not take place. =1828: four-year-old season= In August 1828, Matilda began her third season with a run in a division of the Great Subscription Purse at York. She was expected to run well, starting the 7/4 favourite, but seemed unable to cope with the soft ground and finished third of the four runners behind Lady Georgiana and Popsy. A year after her last appearance at the course, Matilda ran in the Constitution Stakes at Doncaster in September. She led for most of the way but was overtaken in the straight and beaten three lengths by Laurel. On 8 October Matilda ran in the Gold Cup at Richmond, North Yorkshire and finished second of the eight runners behind her stable companion Delphine. Nine days later, Matilda appeared at Northallerton where she was made 4/5 for the Northallerton Gold Cup. She bolted either before or during the race and finished last of the four runners behind Delphine. Stud career Matilda was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Petre. She later moved to the studs of the Duke of Cleveland in 1832, Lord Eglinton in 1841 and Lord William Powlett in 1844. She produced twelve live foals in sixteen years before her death in 1846. Her first foal, an unnamed filly sired by Whisker produced Nat, the winner of the Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1843. Matilda's daughter Eliza, sired by Physician, won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in 1838.

Frank Ammerlaan (born 1979 in Sassenheim) is a Dutch artist who lives and works in London.  Biography  Ammerlaan graduated as an independent artist from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam in 2007. In 2012 he graduated in fine art at the Royal College of Art in London with paintings, sculptures and photography. For his graduation show Ammerlaan won The Land Securities Studio Award. In 2012 he received the Royal Award for Painting, which is handed to the most promising young Dutch painter of that year. From 2012, Ammerlaan also makes video art. Ammerlaan experiments with unusual materials, like galvanised and passivated metals and pulverized meteorite. He exhibited in several museums and galleries in the Netherlands and abroad. Ammerlaan is one of the founders of the exhibition spaces Horse Move Project Space (2004) and De Service Garage (2007), both situated in Amsterdam. Currently De Service Garage is giving space to seven artists and is run by Benjamin Roth and Daniel Hofstede.  Work  Most characteristic for Ammerlaan's work are his monumental colorful paintings. His oeuvre includes works in which subtle stains of color appear on an otherwise black canvas. The surface seems to be calm from afar, but when you approach it subtly changes. Ammerlaan's work does not try to provoke emotions. The emphasis lies in showing barely perceptible changes. Another series of colorful paintings are embroidered with thin, shiny, sometimes fluorescent threads, which frame and structure the surface. The fragile threads change color with changing light and sometimes seem to fade into the background. The geometrical patterns of thread create a permeable fence, like a web or weave which you can seemingly get stuck in or hold onto. These works are illuminating and seductive though ultimately deny the viewer access. In the recent years Frank Ammerlaan has diversified his practice to include sculpture, photography and video. Painting, however, remains his most important medium. His series of small sensitive sculptures, made of different types of conductive metal, form repetitive geometric shapes originating from aerial and antenna structures. The sculptures suggest a biomimicry-related language ready to receive and transmit signals and information. In 2010 Ammerlaan developed a practice of painting with chemicals. Having done research for a number of years with chemists and scientists he physicalized the phenomenal aesthetics of organic color arrangements ‚Äì visible on a rainy urban day ‚Äì in the form of oil spills. The result is extremely detailed, holographic but toxic, and becomes noxious in our contemporary political context.

The group was founded somewhere between the years 2008 and 2010 by broad-based artist Nkululeko Mthembu and his brother Siyabonga Mthembu. TBMO began as a self-proclaimed art movement mainly of graphic and fine artists and since began incorporating instrumentalists for the live performance environment. In its current configuration The Brother Moves On performs mainly as a band. Members include Siyabonga Mthembu aka Mr. Gold (storyteller, lead vocalist, performance artist), their first cousin on their father's side Zelizwe Mthembu aka Makongela (vocalist, guitarist, flautist), Ayanda Zalekile (vocalist, bassist, multi-instrumentalist), Simphiwe Tshabalala (vocalist, drummer) and Molefi Kgware (saxophone). The band feature a variety of instrumentalists from bands in the Johannesburg live music scene namely Itai Hakim from poetry duo Children of the Wind, Malcolm Jiyane from the Malcolm Jiyane trio and Solethu Madasa from the Solethu Madasa quintet.  History = Naming = The name The Brother Moves On derives from a grammatical misconfiguration of The Brother Mouzone, in reference to a fictional character in the American television drama series The Wire. The name arose when both Mthembu brothers were watching the episode of The Wire entitled \\"The Brother Moves On\\", which is the entrance of the hitman Brother Mouzone. In their emerging stages, the movement interrogated the notion that members were each an impermanent part of the process. = Formation and beginning = Nkululeko, Siyabonga and Zelizwe Mthembu grew up together in Kempton Park Tembisa in the East Rand of Johannesburg, South Africa. Thus they started composing together from a young age. Upon graduating from Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape, S. Mthembu left his former band, Orangutang Bitch, and moved back to Johannesburg. At the same time his younger brother Nkululeko was enrolled at AFDA, The South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance. Disgruntled, Nkululeko withdrew from the franchise in pursuit of other inspired artistic endeavours and thus the beginning of the Brothers' idea of an art collective that fuses the disciplines. The Mthembu brothers then began rehearsing with musicians from the Music Academy of Gauteng as Zelizwe Mthembu was enrolled in the school after having left the Moses Molelekwa School of Music in Tembisa. The Music Academy is run by trumpeter and music educator Dr Johnny Mekoa. At this school the band would start relating to the idea of musicianship fusing with the visual art and performance. Visual artist and musician Malcolm Jiyane was pivotal in this relation as a senior and lecturer at the college. This period was the beginning of long-standing relations with Oscar Kgware (saxophone), Ayanda Zalekile (trombone and later bass guitar), Hlubi Vhakalise (saxophone and piano) and Malcolm Jiyane's (trombone and piano). The lack of transportation and funds to continue this relation would necessitate a shift for the idea. In early 2009, Nkululeko met Raytheon Moorvan at a local live music venue, The Bohemian, and invited him to a rehearsal. Later that week the band was booked for a performance at Mam' Busi Mhlongo's memorial and the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown Eastern Cape. This would herald the arrival of Simphiwe Tshabalala as the drummer of the band, and since then Siyabonga Mthembu, Zelizwe Mthembu, Simphiwe Tshabalala and Ayanda Zalekile have been the longest standing members of the outfit. = The Golden Wake (2009‚Äì2012) = The Golden Wake is the first musical offering from TBMO. The six-track unmastered EP was performed and recorded at the SABC media park for a live studio audience and tells a fictional tale of a young South African villager named Mr. Gold. The self-produced EP was re-released and mastered in 2015 with an additional three tracks and sees the movement from being a DIY band to being an art collective. In the time leading up to the recording of The Golden Wake EP, TBMO had many shifts in their line up. For this particular performance/recording the line-up included Nkululeko Mthembu, Siyabonga Mthembu, Zelizwe Mthembu, Raytheon Moorvan, Simphiwe Tshabalala, and long time childhood friend of Simphiwe, Tito Sibusiso Zwana on bass guitar. A performance artist/dancer, Kyle De Boer, also featured on a track entitled \\"The Black Diamond Butterfly\\" (which incidentally is the name of the character he plays for the piece). Featuring performance artists would become a staple of the band, with Mmakgosi Kgabi, Nhlanhla Kubeka and BJ Engelbrecht featuring in the recording of A Golden Wake.  Basic conceptual outline  The Golden Wake as a performed piece is a staging of a funeral for the character of Mr. Gold (played by Siyabonga Mthembu). Audience members are invited to the wake of this funeral and throughout the performance are introduced to other characters from Mr. Gold's life. The story of Mr. Gold begins with a dream that he has of his grandfather. In the dream he is told by his elder to journey to the city of Gold to \\"Mine his dreams\\". Much of the thematic of The Golden Wake deals with the idea of Gold as a representation of value and interrogates this global idea of value as a charade. = E.T.A. (2012) = ETA - Expected Time of Arrival - TBMO‚Äôs second EP - presents two radio singles as a preamble to the ETA tour and the recording of the debut album. ETA was produced by Paulo Chibanga, drummer of 340mlBongani Kona, \\"Audio: The Brother Moves On ‚ÄòETA‚Äô\\" (EP Stream), 29 October 2012. and director of the Azgo Festival (Maputo), and engineered by Gavan Eckhart. Track 1, \\"Good Times\\", personalises the miners' experience as a cathartic exercise in the wake of the Marikana miners' strike. Track 2, \\"Ya‚Äôkhalimbazo\\", is an ode to the self- defence unit (SDU) that used to police Caleni \\"Kalambazo\\" section in Tembisa between 1990 and 1993. = A New Myth (2013) = In 2013, the band started the recording of their first full-length album. Titles including Duffel Bags Full of Dough, Game-Changing E-Minor and Fuck What You Heard and Zen or Die were thrown around before the band settled on A New Myth.Minofu, Kevin, \\"Interview: The Brother Moves On\\", PLATFORM, 18 February 2014. A few weeks before the release of the album, Nkululeko Mthembu, one of the band's founding members died. The album was released on the morning prior to the death of South African elder and statesman Nelson Mandela, and the title would thus become prophetic in the country's need for \\"a new myth\\" with the death of the Mandela era of forgiveness and with the passing of the founder of the idea of a performance art space in Nkululeko Mthembu. The album was released on 5 December 2013 to critical acclaim. In a review for South African music website PLATFORM, Kevin Minofu said: \\"The Brother Moves On is the most important band in the country\\" and gave the album a score of 90 out of 100.Minofu, Kevin. \\"Album Review: The Brother Moves On - A New Myth\\", PLATFORM. The album also came at number 5 on PLATFORM's list of the best albums of 2013.\\"50 Best Albums of 2013\\", PLATFORM. A song on the album \\"Hossanna\\" was voted into the Top 100 songs in South Africa since the advent of recorded music by the Sunday Times. =The Goodman Gallery (2015/6)= The band began a relationship with the Goodman Gallery as part of the Working Title exhibition curated by Emma Laurence. This would see the band cement a growing relationship with the gallery having only exhibited as part of the Goethe Institutes Project Space in the Maboneng Precinct's experimentation space Art on Main. The exhibition at Art on Main entitled the Brother Breaks the Bullion would be followed by a performance at the Goodman Gallery as part of the prestigious Johannesburg Art Week entitled The Brother Burns the Bullion. These exhibitions would include visual artist and visionary Nolan Oswald Dennis. Both Oswald Dennis and The Brother Moves On would go on to be represented by the Gallery a first in the South African art and music scene. The Brother Moves On had their first solo exhibition at The Goodman in September 2016, a homage to Nkululeko Mthembu's collaborative spirit. Critical reception In 2012, The Guardian described the band as \\"powerful and captivating\\" after hearing an Okayafrica compilation featuring the band.

The mill was built in 1644 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 25834. History De Zwaan was built in 1644 to replace an older post mill which had fallen down a year earlier. Both the older post mill and the new tower mill belonged to the heerlijkheid Lienden which was under the ownership of the lords, and later counts, of Culemborg. Through nobility and private owners the mill came into the possession of the Van Harn family in 1879. The mill was restored in 1940, 1970, 1976 after a storm had caused heavy damage and in 1990. The windmill must have had a tailpole for winding as parts for the tail were delivered during construction. There is also a wear line on the brickwork where a roller once supported the tail construction. The current internal winding winches resemble those fitted in windmills in Noord-Holland and not those in the older tower mills of Zeddam and Zevenaar. The Van Harns still own the windmill but it is operated by a volunteer miller. Description De Zwaan is a four storey brick tower mill built on a small natural hill. The shape of the tower is regarded as a transition between the earlier thick walled cylindrical tower mills and the later thinner walled more conical shaped tower mills. The mill is winded internally by winches in the roofing felt covered cap which rests on a live curb with cast iron rollers. The four Common Sails have a span of and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft cast by De Prins van Oranje in 1869.

The mill was built in 1623 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 28086. It is the most southerly windmill in the Netherlands and the oldest of the province Limburg. History Construction of the towermill of Gronsveld was started in 1618 by order of Joest Maximilian van Bronckhorst, count of Gronsfelt and was finished in 1623. The cylindrical shaped mill was raised in 1766 with a tapering part which has given it its distinctive shape. The mound around the mill was raised at the same time. The windmill remained property of the Van Bronckhorst family and later, by marriage, the T√∂rring family until it was confiscated by the government in the French-Batavian period and publicly sold in 1805. The buyer was Van Gulpen who sold the mill on to miller Jacobus Jacobs who expanded the milling business with a farm. After his death Catharina Jacobs became the owner. In the 1860s she managed to have the newly planted trees along the nearby state road replaced by Acacias as she feared the trees, once they had fully grown, would block the wind coming towards the mill. The incident got national attention at the time and the typical roadside planting remains today. After Catharinas death the mill became property of her daughter Alphonsine Bemelmans in 1889. Alphonsine sold the mill and farm in 1919 to the woodtrader Dahmen who resold it to the baker Henri Jacobs. In 1924 Joseph Michael Thomma became the leaseholder. By that time the farm was generating most of the income and Thomma bought himself a small electric powered mill so the windmill fell into disrepair. The first initiatives to restore the mill were taken in 1941 by Stichting Het Limburgs Landschap (Foundation for the Limburgian landscape) and De Hollandsche Molen so it could be used for food supply during the war. However, because of material shortages nothing came of it and the mill caught fire from fighting during the liberation of Limburg in 1944. The mill was restored from a burned out shell in 1959 using stocks, brakeshaft and front tie beam from a mill in Horssen while other moving parts came from a dismantled mill in Maarheeze. In the early 1970s the mill was restored to working order and since that time has been in regular use. Description The torenmolen van Gronsveld is a five storey brick tower mill. The vertical walls up to the stone floor are thick and house a spiral staircase and a shaft for the sack hoist. The meal floor has two hearths built into the wall, either one of which could be used depending on the wind direction. The first floor served as a storage room and is supported by a vaulted roof over the entrance on the ground floor. A high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails. The mound is supported on the outside by a wall of chalk blocks. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch with the roofing felt covered cap resting of a dead curb of wooden blocks. The four common sails with Van Bussel leading edges and air brakes have a span of .

The mill may have been built before 1441, making it the oldest windmill in existence in the Netherlands. It is listed as Rijksmonument number 9290. History The first reference to a mill on this site dates from 1441 which most likely refers to the current mill as there is no knowledge of there being an earlier mill. The first definite mention of a brick windmill is from the financial year 1453/1454. It was erected by Willem van der Leck, Lord Van den Bergh and has since always been in the possession of the counts van Bergh and their successors with only a short period of private ownership in the twentieth century. The farmers in the Land van den Bergh were subjected to mill soke, meaning they were obliged to have their grain milled at this mill. In 1712 the House of Van den Bergh was succeeded by the House of Hohenzollern. Major reconstruction works took place in 1839 with the addition of two extra floors, an entranceway at the ground floor and an extra pair of millstones. The outside staircase was moved inside. The dead curb for winding the cap was replaced with a live curb of wooden rollers in 1871. Changes made in the 1940s were partly undone in 1990 and cast iron rollers were fitted. The mill was sold in 1904 to H. Gerretschen while the castle Huis Bergh became property of Jan Herman van Heek in 1912. Van Heek bought the windmill in 1929 to prevent it from being fully demolished and he had the beginning demolition work repaired. Van Heek transferred his possessions to the foundation Stichting Huis Bergh in 1946. Further restoration work on the mill was performed in 1963, 1974 and 1990. In 2005 the stocks were replaced. A horse mill was reconstructed near the windmill in 1974. This combination of mills used to be quite common as the horse mill was used when there was no wind. Description The Grafelijke korenmolen van Zeddam is a five storey brick tower mill. The parallel walls are up to thick at the base. A high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails. In the old situation the internal space at ground level was unused and the only entrance into the mill was at the current hoisting floor, only reachable by an outside staircase. In 1839 two extra floors were built into the mill body to house an extra millstone and a ground floor entrance and internal staircase built. The mill is winded by two sets of wooden gears in the cap engaging cogs on the curb. The gearing is powered by an endless rope running on a Y-wheel. The roofing felt covered cap rests on a live curb with flanged cast iron rollers. The four common sails have a span of . They are carried on a cast-iron windshaft cast by Enthoven & Co as number 0286 in 1861 though it was only fitted in the mill 1888 after the former wooden axle broke. As the cast iron shaft was to short it was partly encased in the remainder of the wooden shaft. The windshaft carries the brake wheel which drives the wallower at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel drives the two pairs of mill stones of diameter via two lantern pinion stone nuts.

The mill was built in the beginning of the sixteenth century and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 40427. History The first mention of a windmill on this site dates from 1408; however, this probably refers to an older post mill, which was later replaced by the current brick tower mill. Research on the brickwork of European tower mills by a historian points to a year of construction that cannot be earlier than about 1500. The mill was initially the property of Lord of the Duchy Kleef and continued to be owned by successive landlords, until it was sold into private ownership in 1866 to the then leaseholder Van Grinten. After his death, it was sold to mill worker Johannes Gerritsen. In the 1930s, the change was made from wind to motor power, and the sails, tailpole and internal gearings were removed. All milling stopped in 1955, after which the municipally of Zevenaar became the owner in 1966. They had the windmill restored in 1969.

In order to maintain government control in the privately owned company, it stipulated that the votings on major shareholder meeting resolutions require 4/5th (80%) agreement.¬ß 4, Abs.3 of the above referenced law. This part of the law was deemed to violate the \\"free movement of capital\\" principle of European company law by EU members. After a series of challenges by EU from 2007 to 2013, the German parliament finally amended the part in 2013 to EU court satisfaction. Law The full title of the law is \\"Gesetz √ºber die √úberf√ºhrung der Anteilsrechte an der Volkswagenwerk Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung in private Hand\\", usually abbreviated to \\"VW-Gesetz\\". It was enacted on 28 July 1960, when Volkswagenwerk GmbH was privatized. The state of Lower Saxony held a voting share of 20.2 percent, which gave it the ability to veto major decisions and prevent takeovers by other shareholders, regardless of the extent of the ownership. It also allowed the government of Lower Saxony to appoint two members to Volkswagen's board. Challenges and the EU court ruling In October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the VW law was illegal in EU because it was protectionist. At that time, Porsche held 30.9% of VW shares and there had been speculation that Porsche would be interested in taking over VW if the law did not stand in its way. The court also prevented the government appointing Volkswagen board members. In 2008, the German government then rewrote the Volkswagen law, attempting to sidestep the ECJ judgment; removing restrictions on share ownership but still requiring an 80% majority for important decisions, so Lower Saxony would still be able to block major business decisions and takeovers. European regulators took the German government to court again and requested a fine of ‚Ç¨31,114 per day backdated to when the law was declared illegal in 2007, plus larger ongoing fines from the date of a second court judgment. In March 2012, the German government insisted that it would defend the Volkswagen Law. In October 2013, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the redraft of the Volkswagen law ‚Äúcomplied in full‚Äù with EU rules, bringing \\"the matter to a close,‚Äù as Chantal Hughes, spokeswoman for EU Internal Markets Commissioner Michel Barnier said. Outcome During the above developments, Porsche, which traditionally had close relationships with Volkswagen, increased its holding of Volkswagen AG shares as follows (please see Porsche_SE#EU and the Volkswagen Law for details): October 2005: 18.53% Nov. 2006: 27.4% March 2007: 30.9% September 2008: 35.79% January 2009: 50.76% Porsche had many difficulties financing the large investment, and agreed in August 2009 to sell its automobile manufacturing business to Volkswagen AG, while retaining the majority ownership in Volkswagen. Porsche SE officially became the controlling owner of Volkswagen AG when Volkswagen Law was amended to abolish the 20% owner veto rights in 2013, with 50.76% ownership.

By 6 November much of the German force had deserted, while the rest surrendered. The battle resulted in victory for the Allies and breakdown of German resistance in northern Kamerun. Background Following the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany in the summer of 1914, British forces in neighboring Nigeria mounted an attack on the German forts at Garua in northern Kamerun. After failing to take the forts and suffering heavy casualties at the First Battle of Garua, British forces in the border regions adopted a defensive strategy. The German commander at Garua, Von Crailsheim gained confidence and mounted a raid across the border which was repulsed at the Battle of Gurin in April 1915.Wood et al. Vol. 6, p. 1702. Following the German defeat, Captain Adolf Schipper led the wounded German soldiers to the fort at Banjo to the south. The German raid stimulated retaliation from the British commander in the area, Hugh Cunliffe who went on to finally capture the forts at Garua at the Second Battle of Garua. In July, Cunliffe went on to win the Battle of Ngaundere further south. Due to heavy rains however, Cunliffe chose to take part in the Siege of Mora instead of making an advance southward to the German base at Jaunde (today Yaound√©).Germans in East and West Africa, 1915 pp. 1-10. Because of an improvement in weather conditions, Cunliffe resumed his push south in October. On 22 October, the town of Bamenda was occupied by Cunliffe's forces. British forces occupied the village Banjo on 24 October. On 3 November the column occupied the town of Tibati, approximately 90 kilometers southwest of Ngaundere.Ashburton Guardian, 23 Nov. 1915. The German fort on a hill near the town of Banjo was near to the border with Nigeria and was the last German stronghold in northern Kamerun that stood between Cunliffe and Jaunde. The fort was situated atop a mountain with steep slopes but a relatively flat summit. A number of boulders were located on the slopes of the mountain. In preparation for the battle, German forces built approximately 300 sangars between these boulders and constructed numerous entrenchments on the slopes of the hill.Dane 1919, p. 185.Strachan 2004. Under the command of Captain Adolf Schipper, the fort had prepared itself for a long siege like the ones seen at Mora and Garua. Before the battle took place, the garrison had even prepared the top of the mountain for agricultural cultivation.Dane 1919, p. 186. By October 1915 the fort was protected by 23 European officers and approximately 200 native Askaris. Battle While British forces had occupied the town of Banjo since late October, fighting did not start until an attempt was made to capture the fort. On the morning of 4 November, a British company under Captain Bowyer-Smijth launched an assault on the German defenses with the support of three artillery pieces that had been brought.O'Neill 1918, p. 60. Due to dense fog, the British force was able to surprise the German defenders. During the conflict that ensued, Bowyer-Smijth was killed in action near the summit along with others from his company, which retreated back down the mountain. That night five British companies attempted another assault on the hill. The Germans were able to hold off the attack through the bombardment of the oncoming infantry with dynamite. On 5 November, British forces remained positioned on the slopes of the hill approximately 100 meters from the summit. At this time the three British artillery pieces began to run out of ammunition. By that evening however, more had arrived which enabled another assault on the fort.O'Neill 1918, p. 61. On the night of 5 November, during a thunderstorm, the final attack was made. When Nigerian troops finally reached the summit, fighting at close quarters ensued that cost both sides heavy casualties. During the battle, much of the German garrison had deserted while those that remained surrendered by the morning of 6 November 1914.Burg 1998, p. 89. The German commander, Captain Adolf Schipper, was killed during the battleWalter 2001, pp. 39-42 along with approximately 27 other German soldiers. British losses included around 50 killed. Aftermath Following the battle, British forces were able to capture most of the German deserters. When the British occupied the fort at Banjo they found it to be a considerably strong position with sufficient ammunition and supplies for further resistance. On the summit the Germans had pigs, sheep and 226 cattle. The British victory at Banjo meant that German resistance in northern Kamerun was virtually over. The forces of Cunliffe in the north were now able to come into contact with those of Dobell, in the southwest. The capture of the German fort here allowed for a second assault on Jaunde and the German escape to the neutral Spanish colony of R√≠o Muni.Dane 1919, p. 187. NotesReferences *Burg, David F., and L.

She was of Wampanoag origin, and was raised speaking the Massachusett language, a language that is now extinct. History Born circa 1770, Dorcas Esop was the daughter of Sarah Tashama Esop, daughter of Benjamin Tashama. Dorcas's grandfather Benjamin was a teacher and a preacher and opened a school for Wampanoag children. Dorcas's mother Sarah was the daughter of a Wampanoag chief who had helped European settlers survive the cold winter on the island. Dorcas Honorable was born during the American Revolution, just ten years after an illness brought by Europeans killed 222 of 358 Wampanoags on Nantucket. Unlike her acquaintance Abram Quary, who was generally recognized as the second-to-last Wampanoag on Nantucket and the last male native to the island, Dorcas Honorable was known to have remained out of public knowledge during her lifetime, particularly after the death of her mother. Dorcas worked as a domestic and worshiped as a Baptist Christian. Dorcas Esop was married several times. In 1792, Dorcas Esop was married to Isaac Freeman, but by 1800 Dorcas had likely gone back to live with her mother Sarah because a census from 1800 shows that Sarah ran a household of two people. Dorcas would remarry in 1801 to Bill Williams, in 1808 to Henry Mooers, in 1817 to John Sip, and in 1820 with Thomas Honorable. It remains obscure whether Dorcas's husbands were indigenous or non-indigenous. It is also unclear why Dorcas was married so many times in a period of thirty years. Some historical records indicate that Dorcas's fourth husband John Sip was the victim of a violent assault in New Guinea, but his marriage to Dorcas is the last record of him in Nantucket's recorded history. Dorcas had her only known child with Thomas Honorable. Their child was a daughter named Emmeline. By 1830, it would appear that Dorcas and Thomas Honorable were living in Guinea, but they returned to Nantucket 1850, around the time that Dorcas was widowed. Dorcas lived the rest of her life in the household of Thaddeus Coffin on Nantucket. After Abram Quary's death in the late months of 1854, it was generally believed that the Native American race on Nantucket had gone extinct within 100 years of European arrival. But Dorcas died in the early months of 1855, and it was then that Europeans acknowledged her as the last indigenous Nantucketer. A Baptist congregational ceremony was held for Dorcas's death at her church.

He is the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies and Assistant Professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. He was an Associate in Research at the Korea Institute, Harvard University. and a Research Fellow at the National Asia Research Program. Lee has provided advice to the U.S. government and is an outspoken proponent of several policies aimed at changing the North Korean regime towards a path of denuclearization and improvement of human rights, while keeping the peace and stability in Northeast Asia. Lee has argued that this can be accomplished with a dual strategy of stern treatment of the North Korean government through unwavering economic sanctions aimed at weakening the leadership and security apparatus, while engaging the country's people through information campaigns that break their isolation from the outside world, humanitarian aid, and a global campaign of human rights. He has also stated that the U.S. and its military presence in Northeast Asia have brought decades of stability and prosperity to the region, and supports its continued stationing in the Korean peninsula. He also encourages the eventual unification of Korea under the South's direction, with the active support of the U.S. and China, and a resulting united country that is amicable to both powers.  Education  Lee majored in American and British literature at New College in Sarasota, Florida, graduating in 1991. He pursued his graduate studies at the Fletcher School, completing his Master of Arts in 1994, and his Ph.D. in 1998. John Curtis Perry became his doctoral advisor and developed a lifelong mentor- mentee relationship. In his dissertation \\"The antinomy of divine right and the right to resistance: tianming, dei gratia, and vox populi in Syngman Rhee's Korea, 1945-1960\\", Lee analyzed the interplay between Confucianism and democracy in defining political authority and statecraft during the early years of the Republic of Korea.  Career  Professors John Curtis Perry and Sung-Yoon Lee; Perry was Lee's doctoral advisor, and subsequently colleague at the Fletcher School, developing a lifelong relationship of friendship and mentorship. In this picture they are seen visiting, as part of an academic delegation, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, Korea, in 2015. Lee first joined the faculty of The Fletcher School as the Adjunct Assistant Professor of International Politics in 1998 and until 2005. Concurrently he was also the Visiting Assistant Professor of History at Tufts university starting in 2000 and until 2005. Between 2005 and 2006 he was the Kim Koo Research Associate at the Korea Institute, Harvard University. In 2007 he resumed his position at the Fletcher School, and in 2012 became the first holder of the newly created chair Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Assistant Professor of Korean Studies. He teaches International Relations of the United States and East Asia 1945 to Present, United States and East Asia, Politics of the Korean Peninsula: Foreign and Inter-Korean Relations, and North Korean State and Society. Lee has also been an adjunct Assistant Professor of Asian Studies at Bowdoin College in 2000, and the visiting Professor of Korean Studies at Sogang University in 2007, and at Seoul National University from 2012 to 2016. From 1999 until 2013 Lee was an Associate in Research at the Korea Institute, Harvard University. There he launched a new seminar series, the ‚ÄúKim Koo Forum on U.S.-Korea Relations‚Äù, in 2005. He is a former Research Fellow with the National Asia Research Program, a joint initiative by the National Bureau of Asian Research and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Lee has attended numerous conferences as a speaker, moderator and interpreter. He is also a frequent commentator on Korean affairs on radio, television and print. Lee has also testified in the United States Congress to provide expert advice on North Korea policy issues. Since 2013 Lee has been playing an active role in discussions of U.S. North Korea sanctions legislation, participating in Congressional hearings, advising the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as making a strong case for it on major U.S. media outlets. These efforts contributed towards a bill, passed in 2016, of unprecedented tough sanctions primarily aimed at restricting cash flows into the country in an effort to undermine its nuclear warhead and long- range missile development, and constrict Pyongyang's ability to pay (and retain the loyalty of) its party elites, security forces, and military. In 2018 Lee participated in the Warmbier v. DPRK trial in Washington D.C. as an expert witness for the prosecution. The judge ruled against the DPRK, in the torture, hostage taking, and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier.  Policy views on North Korea  Lee has advocated for a strategy of stern treatment of the North Korean government, while engaging the North Korean people. That includes economic pressure aimed at the elite, especially targeting its palace economy that depends on illicit activities including proliferation, smuggling, counterfeiting, and money laundering. It also means availing substantial humanitarian aid, provided it reaches the intended recipients, increasing efforts to disseminate more information from the outside world into North Korea, facilitating defections, and pressing for a global campaign of human rights. Lee has underscored that the only non-military way to force North Korea into a real negotiation on denuclearization and human rights is to exert sustained economic and propaganda pressure to \\"destroy the Kim regime‚Äôs instruments of self-preservation\\": A nuclear program, a loyal ruling class, and a submissive society. That is, by on one hand pushing more outside information into the North so its society can turn against the regime, and on the other hand by exerting sanctions that limit the cash used to prop the military and ruling apparatus, the regime would weaken to the point of near- collapse, forcing it to negotiate a transition, including a pragmatic way out for the Kim family. Lee has frequently urged policymakers not to fall for the \\"self-defeating\\" trap of short-term concessionary diplomacy, and instead take the long view of an unwavering strategy of pressure. Lee sustains that refraining from making concessions in exchange for North Korea halting its cyclical belligerence is the most effective way to deter future provocations. = Achieving denuclearization and regime change =Financial and trade sanctions Lee emphatically has asserted that \\"the only nonmilitary means of forestalling [North Korea's nuclear and missile developments] is for the U.S. to enforce both American and United Nations sanctions against the North Korean regime and its enablers, the foremost of which remains China.\\" Sanctions should be primarily imposed (as some have) by the U.N. Security Council, and therefore make them binding on the entire international community. However, these \\"so far did little damage to Pyongyang‚Äôs economy thanks to Beijing‚Äôs massive material support through the backdoor,\\" further, Beijing has demonstrated \\"a disingenuous pattern of diplomatic ambidexterity. China has made token gestures like signing on to UN Security Council resolutions while failing to enforce them fully\\" Sanctions are the means to reduce external inflows of cash that the regime needs to advance its nuclear and missile development, as well as to keep its ruling class and security apparatus loyal. These sanctions, if made strong and sustained in time, would lead to significantly weakening the regime to the point of near-collapse; by prompting \\"bankruptcy and the consequent destabilization\\" and the \\"specter of revolt or regime collapse\\", South Korea and the U.S. could negotiate from a position of strength a peaceful transition of the regime that would include real denuclearization and improvement of human rights, as well as a pragmatic \\"way out for the Kims.\\" Lee has concluded that a key point of leverage are American-led financial sanctions, since the regime deeply relies on dollars as its foreign currency, and the U.S. is uniquely positioned to use its control over the dollar-based international financial system as well as its economic might, to more effectively impose and enforce sanctions. Overall, Lee recommends: *Direct sanctions on North Korea's international trade and financial flows. **Block any trade of arms, luxury goods, and other goods or services that are a significant source of cash or material support to the regime. **Freeze the assets of Kim Jong Un or any of his top deputies, who are believed to have billions of dollars in European and Chinese banks. *Secondary sanctions: Impose sanctions on North Korea's partners, \\"thus presenting them with a strong economic disincentive: Either continue to do business with North Korea and be blocked out of the U.S. financial system or stop all business with North Korea and continue to have access to the U.S. financial system,\\" **Publicly identify and sanction all foreign companies, financial institutions, and governments assisting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. ***This crucially includes \\"levying hefty fines on the Chinese banks that, unwittingly or otherwise, launder money for Pyongyang and facilitate dollar transactions on behalf of North Korean entities.\\" As a reference point on strength and duration of sanctions, Lee remarks that it took several years for a combination of direct and secondary sanctions to bring Iran back to the bargaining table. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, sanctions on North Korea are not \\"maxed out\\"; rather, until the sanctions imposed by the U.S. in 2016, American sanctions against North Korea were much weaker than those applied to Iran, Syria, or Burma, Belarus, and Zimbabwe. The 2016 U.S. sanctions brought the enforcement against the North to a \\"normal\\" level. Avoiding concessionary diplomacy Lee argues that the North Korean regime has a well-established cycle of escalating tensions, followed by overtures to dialogue and deescalation. The latter bait counterparts that are always eager to resume peace talks, into prematurely softening their sanctions on the North and even sending funds and aid, just to see the North violate any agreements made, and restart the cycle. In this way, the North has extracted profitable concessions at every cycle. Furthermore, the idea of the North negotiating the surrender of their nuclear program is all but an illusion unless the regime comes to a point of near-collapse. Information campaign Lee has written that \\"applied in greater force and scale, propaganda may be a more powerful deterrent than force. Pyongyang rightfully fears the precedent of Seoul responding asymmetrically with information warfare. (...) Just imagine if Seoul and Washington vastly increased funding for radio broadcast and other information operations into North Korea, as they well should. In an Orwellian world, 'War is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.' In the surreal world of the DPRK, the past 62 years of de facto peace in Korea is war, a life of extreme servitude to the state is freedom, and national strength is preserved by keeping the people ignorant of the outside world.\\" Therefore, \\"informing and educating the North Korean people is not only the right thing to do\\" but also a way to \\"delegitimize Kim's rule in the eyes of his people\\" and create \\"great leverage vis-√†-vis Pyongyang.\\" = United States: Continued commitment to regional stability = Lee supports a continued commitment by the US, asserting that the \\"U.S. has always had in its diplomatic toolbox various useful implements like financial sanctions, measures to prevent illicit activities and weapons proliferation, freeze fuel oil delivery and unconditional aid, and human rights campaigns through the international media in concert with other civilized nations of the world, not to mention UN Resolutions\\". Lee has also proposed the U.S. \\"hold quiet consultations with Beijing to prepare jointly for a unified Korea under Seoul‚Äôs direction, a new polity that will be free, peaceful, capitalist, pro-U.S. and pro-China\\". Lee opposes the signing of a peace treaty between the U.S. and North Korea (frequently demanded by the latter) absent substantial changes in the regime. He has stated that \\"North Korea is not seeking peace, but rather a change in the military balance of power on the Korean peninsula\\", and that \\"real peace is won by resolve and sacrifice, while ephemeral peace is all too often concocted only by vowels and consonants\\". Lee maintains that the U.S. military presence in Korea has brought decades of geopolitical stability in the broader region and should remain in the peninsula regardless of the eventual signing of a peace treaty. = South Korea: Reconciliation through strength and pragmatism = Lee advocates for a stronger lead by South Korea, reinforcing programs for resettlement of refugees, and pressing on in the global campaign for human rights. Lee also supports a South Korean policy of exercising a \\"resolute mix of stoicism and principled apathy\\" when faced with North Korea's attempts at provocation and brinksmanship. Lee was a strong critic of the Sunshine Policy (in force between 1998 and 2008), calling it a failed policy, and the \\"under the table\\" financial aid \\"misguided, unprincipled, and criminal\\". He stated that the North Korean regime would not be appeased by blandishments, further, such concessions prop the regime and prolong its oppression of the people. Reconciliation should be sought from a position of strength. South Korea should remain pragmatic, recognizing that \\"peace in the region has been kept for the last 50 years by the commitment on the part of the United States to the defense of South Korea\\". Lee also has advocated for increased missile defense capabilities by the South.\\" Lee has stated that \\"amnesia or apathy\\" of the new Korean generations towards their history \\"can be reversed through sustained education and the public ritual of remembrance\\", so that \\"the lessons of the most traumatic past must be learned and continually relearned, not only to prevent such a tragedy from repeating itself, but also to honor, as one nation, those who made our freedom possible, and to remember that freedom is certainly never free\\". = Assessment of North Korea =Regime and human rights Lee characterizes the North Korean regime as \\"uniquely unique\\", for being the world's sole communist hereditary dynasty; the only literate, industrialized and urbanized peacetime economy to have suffered a famine; the most cultish totalitarian system; the most secretive, isolated country; and the largest military in terms of manpower and defense spending proportional to its population and national income. Lee has also called the regime a criminal enterprise, for activities including money laundering, human enslavement by having the world's largest prison and slave labor camps, and for nuclear extortion. Lee further asserts that North Korea is the most systematic violator of human rights, having committed nine out of the ten crimes against humanity as specified in article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Nuclear pursuit and denuclearization talks Talking about the logic for the regime's nuclear pursuit, he remarked that \\"a nuclear North Korea is unlike a nuclear China or Russia. During the Cold War, neither Beijing nor Moscow faced an existential threat in the form of an alternate Chinese or Russian state. Pyongyang, on the other hand, has had to live with a far more prosperous and legitimate Korean state across its southern border.\\" A nuclear capability by the North would undermine the U.S. commitment to defending the South, and \\"a nonnegotiable means of isolating and exercising dominance over Seoul\\" and as the key to ensure the long-term survival of the Kim regime. Therefore, lee has repeatedly called negotiations on denuclearization \\"nuclear blackmail\\" by the North and believes that \\"short of change in the Pyongyang regime, further fits of nuclear negotiations are all but an exercise in futility\\", in which the Kim regime treating negotiations (including the six-party talks) as \\"a perpetual multilateral forum for receiving economic and political aid\\". Post- collapse planning Lee anticipates that in case of collapse, \\"a power vacuum in Pyongyang will require the immediate dispatch of South Korean and U.S. troops. Next will come other regional powers -- Chinese peacekeeping forces securing the northern areas, followed by the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force transporting people and supplies along the Korean coastlines. In the short term, a multiparty international presence north of the 38th parallel under the nominal banner of the United Nations will enforce order and provide aid.\\" Lee also supports a US-South Korea joint \\"emergency response measures such as securing the North's stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, maintaining public safety, controlling borders, and providing humanitarian aid to displaced North Koreans\\", as well as long-term development similar to post- WWII reconstruction of Japan.

Houghton (1825-1896) was a Protestant clergyman who founded Houghton College in Houghton, New York. Houghton was born on July 19, 1825 to a family of English ancestry. Houghton married on January 10, 1847 to Harriet Wilson (born 1827) and they had two sons. Houghton was a farmer until middle- age when he became a clergyman. He had studied extensively while farming, and in 1876 he left farming to purchase a house in the village of Houghton and to focus exclusively on Christian ministry. In 1877 he led the effort to building a church meeting house in the village where he eventually ran a Sunday school.

It is used as a visual prosthesis to improve the vision of people with severe cases of retinitis pigmentosa. The Argus II version of the system was approved for marketing in the European Union in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a humanitarian device exemption. The Argus II system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device. Medical use The Argus II is specifically designed to treat people with retinitis pigmentosa. The device was approved with data from a single-arm clinical trial that enrolled thirty people with severe retinitis pigmentosa; the longest follow-up on a trial subject was 38.3 months. People in the trial received the implant in only one eye and tests were conducted with the device switched on, or switched off as a control. With the device switched on, about 23% of the subjects had improvements in their ability to see; all had been at 2.9 or higher on the LogMAR scale and improvements ranged from just under 2.9 to 1.6 LogMAR ‚Äì the equivalent of 20/1262 reading ability. 96% of the subjects were better able to identify a white square on a black computer screen; 57% were more able to determine the direction in which a white bar moved across a black computer screen. With the device switched on, about 60% were able to accurately walk to a door that was 20 feet away, as opposed to only 5% with the device switched off; 93% had no change in their perception of light. Side effects Among the thirty subjects in the clinical trial, there were nine serious adverse events recorded, including lower than normal intraocular pressure, erosion of the conjunctiva, reopening of the surgical wound, inflammation inside the eye, and retinal detachments. There is also a risk of bacterial infection from the implanted cables that connect the implant to the signal processor. Surgical procedure The implantation procedure takes several hours, with the person receiving the implant under general anaesthesia. The surgeon removes the vitreous humor and any membranes on the retina where the implant will be placed. The implant is attached to the surface of the retina with a tack. The cables connecting the implant to the processor are run through the pars plana, a region near where the iris and sclera touch.\\"IPG519: Interventional procedure overview of insertion of an epiretinal prosthesis for retinitis pigmentosa\\". National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Interventional Procedures Programme. Updated December 2014. Retrieved 4 September 2015. Device The Argus implant's primary external element is a digital camera mounted on eyeglass frames, which obtains images of the user's surroundings; signals from the camera are transmitted wirelessly to a computerised image processor. The processor is in turn connected by cables to the implant itself, which is surgically implanted on the surface of the person's retina and tacked into place. The implant consists of 60 electrodes, each 200 microns in diameter. The resolution of the 6 dot by 10 dot rectangular grid image (produced by the 6 by 10 array of 60 electrode, of which 55 are enabled ) in a persons vision is very low relative to normal visual acuity. This allows visual detection of edges of large areas of high contrast, such as door frames and sidewalks, to give the individual the capability to navigate in their environment more safely.

The first version of the prosthesis, the Argus I, was clinically tested on six people starting in 2002. The second version, the Argus II, was designed to be smaller and easier to implant, and was co- invented by Mark Humayun of the USC Eye Institute, who had been involved in the clinical testing of the Argus I.

They become separated as a result of the intrigues of Frank's childhood friend, Bertie. Bertie, who has become down and out, has met Frank again in London by coincidence and now lives together with him. Because Bertie is afraid of losing Frank's attention, he makes Frank believe that Eve is no longer true to him by hiding the letters Eve writes to Frank.

In the review, it was said that Louis Couperus was a typical sensitivist. The murder scene of the book was described as: One eye was a shapeless mass, half pulp and jelly; the other stared out of the oval socket, like a large dull melancholy opal. We presume that the account of the shapeless eye avoids the vagaries of impressionism and that of the opal eye the brutality of naturalism.

Then in the same year was renamed by the Mayor of Bad Godesberg, Heinrich Hopmann, Friesdorfer the village square in Joseph-Roth-Place. After violent public protests, the name of the place was, however, in 1956 abolished and renamed a street off the house of Roth into Joseph-Roth-Street. And again the residents protested against the name until the mid-1960s and threatened to boycott the election. But this time the protest was unsuccessful, and the street name remained.Godesberger Heimatbl√§tter: No. 30, P. 73 Bernd Wittschier wrote in his paper Theology, a supplement of the newspaper quotes for the Catholic priesthood in 1989Offerten Zeitung f√ºr die katholische Geistlichkeit,1989, vintage 19 No.11 for the first time about the \\"martyrs Roth\\".

A foundling of unknown paternity, she was adopted by the childless English nobleman Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland (1802‚Äì1859) and his wife, and eventually married into the Princely House of Liechtenstein.  Background  pointer dog Elia, painted by George Frederic Watts Signed flyleaf in a copy of her book Holland House, dated 1873 She was born in Paris (though some sources wrongly say she was born in Florence) on 21 December 1850 (though some sources wrongly say she was born in January 1851). Her mother's name was given as Frenchwoman Victoire Magny of Soissons, but the identity of her father was unspecified. She was baptised at the Church of St. Augustine as Marie Henriette Ad√©la√Øde. In April 1851, aged three months, she was found by a physician called Dr. S√©guin, who arranged for her to be adopted by the childless English aristocrat Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland (1802-1859), of Holland House in Kensington, near London, and his wife Lady Mary Augusta Coventry (1812-1889), a daughter of George Coventry, 8th Earl of Coventry. Lord and Lady Holland had no surviving children of their own, having suffered two stillbirths and one short-lived infant. Lady Holland was by then in her late thirties and Lord Holland insisted on adopting the girl. Her biological paternity remains a mystery; one rumour had it that she was her adoptive father's natural daughter born by his servant.  Life in London  Following the adoption, she was assigned to a nurse at Fontenay-aux- Roses and then a nanny, Madame Marque, before moving to her parents' residence, Holland House, London, in June 1853, at the age of 2 1/2. Marie grew up unaware of her background. Her adoptive father died in 1859, when she was nine (her adoptive mother survived her by 11 years, dying in 1889). As she approached her eighteenth birthday and marriageable age, her adoptive mother's legal advisor strongly recommended disclosing the information about the adoption to her. Lady Holland complied, but her own lack of full knowledge about the matter continued to pose problems. All people who knew the truth about the identity of her biological parents had died by then. Marie eventually became estranged from her adoptive mother. Her adoptive paternal aunt, Lady Lilford, wrote in 1867: \\"Marie is much grown and improved. She is a very nice and affectionate girl, and has been thoroughly well educated.\\"  Marriage and children  At the age of sixteen, Marie was courted by Archibald Primrose, later 5th Earl of Rosebery, but refused to marry him as she was unwilling to renounce Roman Catholicism. In the winter of 1871, which she spent with her adoptive mother in Naples, she was courted by Prince Louis of Liechtenstein, a first cousin of Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein. Their engagement was announced in the spring. The marriage ceremony took place in Kensington pro-cathedral, London, on 27 June 1872 and was performed by Henry Edward Manning, Cardinal-Archbishop of Westminster. Among the guests were the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Princely House of Liechtenstein initially refused to approve the marriage on the grounds of inequality of birth, but the princess was later accepted in Vienna. They had four daughters: * Princess Sophie Maria Josepha (Berlin, 29 March 1873 ‚Äì Graz, 2 March 1947), married in Graz on 31 July 1897 Franz √úrm√©nyi d'√úrm√©ny (√úrm√©ny, 14 January 1863 ‚Äì Baden bei Wien, 20 February 1934), childless * Princess Julie Margarethe Maria (Schloss Burgstall, 20 July 1874 ‚Äì Mayerling, 3 July 1950), unmarried and childless * Princess Henriette Maria Josefa (Schloss Burgstall, 6 July 1875 ‚Äì Pertlstein, 21 April 1958), a Benedictine nun under the name Sister Adelgundis * Princess Marie Johanna Franziska (Schloss Burgstall, 21 August 1877 ‚Äì Vienna, 11 January 1939), married in Vienna on 7 June 1902 Franz Peter Johann, Count of Meran, Baron of Brandhofen (Graz, 5 October 1868 ‚Äì Bad Aussee, 10 November 1949), and had six children  Writer  An illustration of Princess Marie on the cover of her book, Holland House Rumours about Marie's biological parentage continued to circulate throughout her marriage. Soon after the wedding the Marquis de Montaigu publicly denied the rumour that he was the princess's father and that her mother had died in childbirth. In 1874 Princess Marie published a book about Holland House and its art collection which sold well despite criticism from Abraham Hayward. Today her work is significant for the history of that great house. She also translated literature from German into English. George Frederic Watts painted portraits of Marie at least twice, one as a child standing with her pet Spanish pointer and another as a young woman.

The Supreme Court, in a 5/4 split, concluded that the Copyright Board made several errors in its analysis of the \\"fairness factors\\". Thus, it allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the Copyright Board for reconsideration.  Background and facts  Access Copyright represents authors and publishers of literary and artistic works. The entity administers the reproduction of such works by issuing licences and collecting and distributing royalties to affiliated copyright owners. When licensing or royalty agreements with users of the printed works cannot be reached, Access Copyright has the option to apply to the Copyright Board (the \\"Board\\") to certify a royalty in a form of a tariff.Alberta (Education) v Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 SCC 37 at para 2 [Access Copyright] Teachers in elementary and secondary schools across Canada frequently make photocopies of excerpts from textbooks and other published works that form Access Copyright's collection. Access Copyright wanted to revise the royalty scheme in the agreements as between the provinces and the Ontario School Boards (the \\"Coalition\\"). When the Coalition opposed the scheme, Access Canada applied to the Board for a proposed tariff.Access Copyright at para 4 Although the copies made at the teachers' initiative for student instruction fell under the allowable purpose of \\"research or private study\\", the Board concluded that they did not constitute fair dealing and were therefore subject to a royalty.Access Copyright at para 13 On judicial review, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Copyright Board's conclusion that the copies were not fair dealing.Access Copyright at para 10 The Coalition appealed the fair dealing issue to the Supreme Court maintaining that the Board's conclusion was not in accordance with the test in CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada, [2004] 1 SCR 339 and was therefore unreasonable.Access Copyright at para 11  Issue  The issue in the appeal was whether the photocopies made by the teachers of the excerpts in the textbooks was considered fair dealing.  Holding  The majority, McLachlin CJ and Abella, LeBel, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ, agreed with the Coalition and remanded the matter to the Board for reconsideration. The dissent, Deschamps, Fish, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ, held that there was no reviewable error made by the Board and that the appeal should not be allowed.  Analysis by the majority  The concept of fair dealing allows users to engage in some activities that might otherwise be considered copyright infringement. CCH articulated a two-step test for fair dealing. The first is to determine whether the dealing is for the allowable purpose of \\"research or private study\\", \\"criticism or review\\", or \\"news reporting\\" under the Copyright Act. The second step assesses whether the dealing is \\"fair\\". A number of fairness factors are used to help courts determine if the dealing is \\"fair\\": the purpose, character, and amount of the dealing; the existence of any alternatives to the dealing; the nature of the work; and the effect of the dealing on the work. The person invoking the doctrine of \\"fair dealing\\" bears onus to satisfy all aspects of the test.Access Copyright at para 12 There was no dispute that the photocopying was for the allowable purpose of \\"research\\" or \\"private study\\". Rather, the dispute centered on the Board's application of the six CCH factors in the second step of the test.Access Copyright at para 14 = Purpose of the dealing = Abella J, writing for the majority, said that the Board misapplied this factor. The Board concluded that the photocopies were not for the purpose of \\"research\\" or \\"private study\\" because they were not requested by the student and that the predominant purpose was that of the teacher, namely, \\"instruction\\" or \\"non-private study\\". Therefore, this factor militated in favour of finding an unfair dealing.Access Copyright at para 15 The majority held that \\"research\\" and \\"private study\\" are consistent with instructional purposes as long as the teachers (the copiers) did not disguise their distinct purposes or conflate it with the research or study purposes of the ultimate user. The teachers had no ulterior motive in providing photocopies to their students. Moreover, instruction cannot be completely segregated from \\"research\\" and \\"private study\\" because most students require the guidance of teachers to find the materials necessary for their research and private study. \\"The teacher/copier therefore shares a symbiotic purpose with the student/user who is engaging in research or private study. Instruction and research/private study are, in the school context, tautological\\".Access Copyright at para 23 Moreover, the word \\"private\\" in \\"private study\\" does not mean that users have to study copyrighted works in isolation. \\"Studying and learning are essentially personal endeavours, whether they are engaged in with others or in solitude\\".Access Copyright at para 27 = Amount of the dealing = The majority held that the Board misapplied this factor when it conducted a quantitative assessment based on aggregate use. A correct examination would look at the proportion between the excerpted work that was photocopied and the entire work.Access Copyright at para 29 Furthermore, the fact that multiple copies of the same excerpts were made should be considered under the factor \\"character of the dealing\\". Access Copyright at para 30 = Alternatives to the dealing = The Board found that schools had reasonable alternatives to photocopying textbooks. For example, they could buy original texts for each student or the school library.Access Copyright at para 31 However, in the majority's view, buying books for each student was not a realistic alternative because the teachers were copying only short excerpts. Furthermore, the schools had already purchased originals that were kept in the class or library, from which the teachers made copies. If the Board's approach was followed, \\"schools would be required to buy sufficient copies for every student of every text, magazine and newspaper in Access Copyright's repertoire that is relied on by a teacher.\\" The majority concluded that photocopying short excerpts is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of \\"research\\" and \\"private study\\" for the ultimate users, the students.Access Copyright at para 32 = Effect of the dealing on the work = This factor assesses whether the dealing adversely affects or competes with the original work. Access Copyright pointed out that textbook sales had shrunk over 30 percent in 20 years. However, Access Copyright did not bring forth any evidence that this decrease was caused by the photocopies made by the teachers.Access Copyright at para 35 Furthermore, considering the photocopies were only of short excerpts, the majority found it difficult to see how this activity would compete with the textbook market.Access Copyright at para 36  Analysis by the dissent  The dissenting judges held that the Board made no reviewable error and that deference should be given to the Board's application of the factors to the facts.Access Copyright at para 40 = Purpose of the dealing = Although the copied excerpts may assist students in their research and private studies, the predominant purpose for copying was to utilize the photocopied excerpts in the process of instructing and educating. Rothstein J, writing for the dissent, said that this was not an unreasonable conclusion.Access Copyright at para 43 = Meaning of \\"private study\\" = \\"Private study\\" means individual study, \\"study by oneself\\". For example, if a copy was made of materials that were tailored to the learning needs or interests of a single or small number of students, this would be considered \\"private study\\". Given that photocopied excerpts were distributed to all the students of a class the Board's conclusion that the predominant purpose of photocopying was for instruction or 'non-private' study\\" is reasonable on the facts of this case.Access Copyright at para 49 = Amount of dealing and character of dealing = The Board's analysis under the \\"amount of the dealing\\" factor remained focused on the proportion of the photocopied excerpt to the entire work. Contrary to what the majority held, the Board did not improperly consider the overall number of copies made.Access Copyright at para 51 While teachers usually made photocopies of short excerpts, they would return to copy other excerpts from the same books \\"thereby making the overall proportion of the copied pages unfair in relation to the entire work over a period of time\\".Access Copyright at para 52 Under the \\"character of the dealing\\" factor, the Board correctly focused its analysis on the fact that multiple copies of the same excerpt were made at one time for dissemination to the whole class. The Board considered different aspects of the dealing under the factors, \\"character of the dealing\\" and the \\"amount of the dealing\\" and were thus not \\"double counting\\" as the majority held.Access Copyright at para 53 The teachers were making multiple copies of various excerpts from the same book. Thus, buying more books to distribute to students or to place in the library is not an unreasonable or unrealistic. \\"Where numerous short excerpts of the work are taken, the fact that there are no non-copyrighted alternatives to the dealing does not automatically render the dealing fair.\\" The dissent was not persuaded that the Board's analysis under the \\"alternatives to the dealing\\" factor was unreasonable.Access Copyright at para 56 = Effect of the dealing on the work = The dissent agreed with the majority that the Board erred when it concluded, without supporting evidence by Counsel, that the photocopies competed with the original, thus making the dealing unfair. However, the dissent said that it was unreasonable to render the Board's overall assessment unreasonable when it made one error under this factor. As said in CCH, not one factor is determinative.Access Copyright at para 58 The Board's overall assessment was not unreasonable when viewed in light of the standard of reasonableness.Access Copyright at para 60 See also *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) ReferencesExternal links * Canadian copyright case law Supreme Court of Canada cases 2012 in Canadian case law Canadian federal legislation Education in Alberta Alberta litigation Textbook controversies ","title":"Alberta (Education) v Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)"},{"id":"38556215","text":"Denis Sokolov may refer to: * Denis Sokolov (ice hockey) (born 1977), Russian ice hockey defenceman * Denis Sokolov (sport shooter) (born 1983), Russian rifle shooter ","title":"Denis Sokolov"},{"id":"38556220","text":"Q Scorpii (Q Sco) is an orange giant star in the constellation Scorpius.

Born in Geneva, Covassi studied philosophy in Paris, where he became close friends with Paolo Fogagnolo, a former member of the Italian Red Brigades. In the 1990s Covassi settled on Ibiza. He was twice convicted of fraud and made a living smuggling drugs to Ibiza to supply the local party scene. In 2003, the police of Geneva recruited Covassi as an informant because of his knowledge about European cocaine smuggling networks. They soon passed him on to the Swiss internal intelligence service, DAP, who paid Covassi to infiltrate the Centre Islamique de Gen√®ve, an Islamic religious center in Geneva, in order to determine whether the center was a haven for Islamic fundamentalists. The operation was almost aborted because Covassi was again arrested for credit card fraud, but the DAP bailed him out. In the event, Covassi reported no actionable intelligence from the center, but converted to Islam during his stay. In 2005, the Swiss intelligence services directed Covassi to attempt infiltrating terrorist groups in Syria, but he had no success. Disappointed with his handlers, in 2006 he made his intelligence work public in a newspaper interview in which he alleged that the intelligence services illegally directed him to compromise the center's controversial leader Hani Ramadan. Soon later, he was assaulted in public and emigrated to Cairo. The resulting media attention led to an investigation by a Swiss parliamentary committee which eventually dismissed most of Covassi's allegations as not credible and found that Covassi's actions on behalf of the intelligence services had not been illegal. In 2009, Covassi was convicted for illegal trafficking of anabolic steroids. In November 2012, having returned to Geneva, he was again in the news in Switzerland because of anti-semitic statements he had made on the Internet. On 8 February 2013, he was found dead, apparently as a result of a drug overdose according to initial police reports.

(retrieved 27 October 2018) The GenFly project began as a requirement to replace old hydraulics training rigs at the Airframe Training Squadron, RAF Cosford, UK and at the Engineer Officer Training School, RAF Cranwell. The historical solution of using retired airframes was no longer practical, as modern fleets were reduced in size. Also, some of the tasks undertaken by initial trainees had been inherently hazardous in untrained hands, and a more benign environment was required. A system based on the AMST McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II training rig was rejected as too restrictive and not reflective of the full RAF airframe training syllabus. An invitation to tender to the GenFly specification was released in 1998 and the contract was awarded to Pennant Training Systems Limited in 1999. =Design= The GenFly training rig mechanically represents a skeletal airframe with its mechanical and hydraulic systems exposed. All system elements are lifelike dummies, wired back to a main computer system which models their behaviour. The computer system can detect whether the parts are connected up correctly and can simulate a range of fault conditions. The system is intended to train maintenance staff in how electrical and hydraulic faults can be manifested in complex aircraft systems and to enable fault diagnosis techniques to be practised in real time. The trainer incorporates primary flight control surfaces including as ailerons, rudder, elevators and flaps. These can be configured to operate in conventional or unconventional modes, permitting non- standard flying controls such as elevons to be simulated. The flying controls are connected to a control column in the cockpit, and can be configured for direct or Fly-By-Wire operation. Their positions can also be pre-set from the instructor's console. A simulated oleo-pneumatic tricycle undercarriage comprises three jacks which can be lowered and dummy oleos extended. In a simulated oleo collapse, the rig lowers onto unobtrusive fixed supports. The main wheel assemblies are removable and a realistic braking system permits training in main wheel removal and fitting. The cockpit incorporates a simulated Mk10 Martin Baker ejection seat and associated safety devices. A glass cockpit supports the services provided by the trainer and it is possible to 'fly' the trainer, principally to simulate flap blow back and to allow comparison between True Airspeed (TAS) and Indicated Airspeed (IAS). =Service= The RAF took delivery of four GenFly units to RAF Cosford, UK.DCAE, On Target Aviation, DCAE Cosford The training manuals were written to RAF aircraft maintenance documentation standards, in order to familiarise students with the format. All four rigs were assigned tail numbers from the RAF military aircraft register, to allow even greater realism in simulating aircraft documentation, while avoiding the possibility of confusion from fabricated tail numbers coinciding with those of real airframes. The tail numbers are; ZJ695, ZJ696, ZJ697 and ZJ698.UK Military Aircraft Serial Allocations - ZJ, UK Serials Resource Centre. (retrieved 27 October 2018) The device entered service in 2001. Later the Royal Australian Air Force installed at least one GenFly trainer at RAAF Wagga Wagga, and a Middle Eastern Air Force is said to have received a number of GenFly units in 2017. Basic Flying Control Rod Trainer (BFCRT) The BFCRT comprises a cockpit-style control column with a mechanical actuation system connected to a representative set of aircraft flight controls. It provides technical training on the setting and maintenance of flight controls at a more basic level than the GenFly, and is designed to provide initial training before progressing to the more advanced system. Integrated Avionics Maintenance Trainer (IAMT) The IAMT is a generic cockpit mock-up used for technician training in the testing, fault diagnostics and maintenance of modern flight systems.

A Republican, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and then San Francisco city assessor, \\"Tinney's integrity was so unquestioned that mayors from both parties -- Republican George Christopher and Democrat John Shelley -- appointed him to the city posts, and Democratic political leaders played key roles in his re-election campaigns.\\"Marianne Costantinou, Joseph E. Tinney - politician held in high regard (May 17, 2006), San Francisco Chronicle. Biography Tinney was the youngest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents. His father was a teamster and then a cable car gripman who worked the night shift. He grew up in Bernal Heights and the Outer Mission. Tinney was an excellent student who graduated from St. Ignatius High School as valedictorian in 1927. He graduated from college and law school at the University of San Francisco in six years. Tinney married in 1940 and moved to Merced Manor, but based his law practice in the Mission District and maintained close ties to the neighborhood. Tinney entered politics in the early 1940s as a member of the Republican County Central Committee and the Republican State Central Committee. Later he came a member of the San Francisco Planning Commission, serving for a time as its chair. On March 27, 1961, Mayor George Christopher (who was Tinney's neighbor in Merced Manor) appointed Tinney to fill a vacancy on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors created by the death of a supervisor.San Francisco Board of Supervisors - Tinney, Joseph E. Tinney was then elected twice to the Board of Supervisors, in 1962 and 1999. Although supervisors at the time were elected at-large rather than by district, Tinney was identified with the Mission District. He argued on behalf of the Latino community to have Mission Street closed off for Cinco de Mayo celebrations, noting that the street was closed for Saint Patrick's Day and Columbus Day celebrations. Considered a fiscal conservative, Tinney nevertheless argued in favor of pay raises for San Francisco Municipal Railway bus drivers in the 1960s. In 1966, Tinney left the Board of Supervisors to become assessor, replacing Russ Wolden, the assessor of 28 years who was convicted of bribery and conspiracy. Tinney reformed the assessor's office, collecting unpaid back taxes, and \\"although many homeowners and business saw their taxes go up, Mr. Tinney handily won re-election, time and time again, and was one of the biggest vote-getters in the city.\\" Tinney's popularity was such that he considered running for San Francisco mayor or state Senate. Tinney retired from public service and returned to private practice in civil litigation in the Mission District. His wife, the former Helen Elizabeth Frahm, died in 1999, and Tinney retired from law practice in 2000. Tinney died on May 13, 2006, at age 96, from complications from lymphoma. At the time of his death he lived in a home for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease in Petaluma. He was survived by a son, Joseph Tinney of Petaluma, a daughter, Marcella Tinney Frank of Windsor in Sonoma County, seven grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, 2010- . Article published September 04, 2012. Drysdale made use of this technique by diluting the oil paint with kerosene and applying it to the canvas board with cotton balls. Drysdale was prolific, having painted an estimated 10,000 works.  Early life and training  Drysdale was born in Marietta, Georgia, and initially pursued art as a sideline. As a young adult in New Orleans, he worked as a banker while taking art classes at night at the Southern Art Union. This gave Drysdale the opportunity to study with the leading artists of the time in New Orleans, including Paul E. Poincy.Who Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975 : 400 years of artists in America, Peter Hastings Falk, editor-in-chief. Sound View Press, 1999, . He studied with the Art Students League in New York City beginning in 1901. There he had associations with artists George Inness, Robert Henri, William Merritt Chase, and others.  Artistic career  The start of his professional life as an artist coincided with his move to New Orleans in 1903. At that time, he became heavily involved in the Artists' Association of New Orleans. He established his studio at 320 Exchange Place in the New Orleans French Quarter. Significant commissions included D.H. Holmes Department Store and Sushan Airport, as well as showings at Tulane University and the National Association of Newspaper Artists. In later life, Drysdale was partially supported by the Civil Works Administration. Today his art can be viewed at the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and The Historic New Orleans Collection.

The dish spread to the south of Chile and Argentina with the migration of many Chilote families to Patagonia during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.Chapalele y Milcaos, infaltables en el curanto Chef Norberto E. Petryk, Alimentaci√≥n Chile, 20 December 2012. Retrieved 17 February 2013. Preparation The most important ingredient is Chilotan potatoes, several different varieties of which are used to prepare milcao. Half the potatoes are cooked and mashed and the other half are grated, sometimes using the traditional Chilote tool of a volcanic pumice stone. One of two methods may then be employed. The most common method produces milcaos colados, strained milcaos, sometimes pronounced as the rhyming milcaos colaos with a silent ‚Äúd‚Äù, as is common in Chilean Spanish. Here, the grated potatoes are strained to extract most of the water by folding in a dish cloth or pressing in a sieve or against a hard surface. Alternatively, the grated potato can be folded directly into the mash, to produce milcaos rallados (‚Äúgrated milcaos‚Äù). In the straining method, the juice from the strained potatoes is saved and decanted to produce :es:chu√±o, a kind of potato starch. The chu√±o can then later be used to make milcao de chu√±o, milcaos made with a base of potato starch.Chilo√©, comidas tipicas Professorenlinea.cl. Retrieved 17 February 2013. The strained or grated potatoes are kneaded into the cooked potatoes and seasoning and lard are added to form a dough. This is then shaped and pressed by hand into flat, round pancakes. The pancakes can be cooked in the oven, fried or (traditionally) baked and eaten with the curanto. Variations Most milcaos are savory, with chicharrones (pieces of fried pork meat and fat) commonly added before cooking. However, there are a number of sweet or neutral variations. *Milcao al horno o frito (oven-baked or fried milcaos): The most common methods of preparing milcaos. They may contain chicharron, which is either mixed in with the dough or stuffed into the pancakes like a pie. They have a reddish-brown crust and a pale center. *Milcaos de curanto (curanto milcaos): The traditional Chilote method of steaming the pancakes in an upper layer of the curanto, spread with hazel and nalca branches. Cooked in this way, the milcaos gain a dark crust and retain an essence of the leaves in their flavor. This preparation method is less common because of the complexity of preparing a curanto.Photo of milcaos de curanto March 2012, retrieved 17 February 2013. *Milcados pelados (peeled milcaos) or Baemes: Milcaos that are boiled and eaten sweetened with honey or sugar. *Milcaos chu√±o (potato starch milcaos): Instead of using grated potatoes, dried potato starch from previous preparations is used to make the milcaos. They are fried and have a golden crust and a pale center. If they are boiled they can also be eaten sweetened, like the milcaos pelados.

History The original name of the site is not known. But it was a port administration complex of the Roman Empire built in the 4th century. However, according to Turkish archaeologist Semavi Eyice the main building may be the palace of Archelaus of Cappadocia who lived in the first century and was known to spend summers in Cilicia. A part of the buildings were repaired during the Byzantine era probably after the great earthquakes of the 6th century. Technical details Although the popular name Akkale means \\"White castle\\", the complex was not a castle, but a small, wealthy settlement. It consists of the ruins of the main building, which was once five stories in height, a large cistern, and numerous other constructions. The five-story building is traditionally called a palace (), for it may have been used both as the office and the lodging building of the governor. The corbels which are on all sides of the building indicate the existence of a now completely demolished balcony which circumscribed the building. The main staircase of the building was a spiral staircase. A small building is assumed to be the treasury office where documents may have been kept in the basement.

History=Origin of the name= The name Burcht is derived from the old Germanic word ‚Äúburgipja‚Äù which means ‚Äúbirch‚Äù, and probably refers to the type of vegetation that grows abundantly in the sandy ground of the area.Sint Martinus Church in Burcht. Built in the 15th-16th centuries, with renovations/restorations in the 19th and 20th centuries = Early history= While very little archaeological excavation has been done in the municipality of Zwijndrecht itself, numerous findings have been documented in the surrounding region, which is referred to as Het Waasland. These have indicated occupation in the area from as early as the end of the Neolithic Period (c. 2200-1800 BC) Verelst 1990, p. 64. Numerous indications of Roman occupation have also been uncovered in the Waasland area. In the early Middle Ages, Zwijndrecht-Burcht was sparsely populated, its landscape consisting mainly of wet woodland and small settlements separated by forests. This situation remained until the latter half of the 11th century, when an increase in population necessitated changes in land use: the forests between settlements were cleared and fields were formed into communal agricultural spaces, using a three-course crop rotation system.Verelst 1990, p. 67. These were referred to as ‚Äúkouters‚Äù or ploughshares. Raised paths through the wetlands evolved into dikes, and by the 14th century, polders were in use. = Feudal period= On 15 April 1281, the Count of Flanders Gwijde van Dampierre granted manorial rights to Nikolaas van Kets, making him Lord of Zwijndrecht and Burcht. The seat of the Lords of Zwijndrecht was a manor house called the Kraaienhof (the ruins of which were demolished in the mid-20th century), which was located in what is now the village of Burcht. The van Kets held the manorial rights until 1445, when Wouter van Kets sold them to Jan Vilain. They passed by inheritance to the van Montmorency family. Due to financial pressures, the heir Filips II de Montmorency, Count of Horne (1524-1568) was forced to sell the title, property and rights to a conglomeration of four cities, Brugge, Gent, Ieper and the Brugse Vrije, known as the ‚ÄúVier Leden‚Äù (four members). After rebelling against Spanish rule during the Eighty Years War, the Vier Leden were forced to forfeit the property to the Spanish crown in 1585, but it was later returned to them. The dikes and infrastructure were so badly damaged during the hostilities with Spain, that the Vier Leden were forced to loan money for repairs and restoration from Jan van Hove. When the Vier Leden defaulted on the loan, the property, rights and title defaulted to Jan van Hove, making him the new Lord of Zwijndrecht-Burcht. Van Hove held the property until 1621, when the Staten van Vlaanderen (formerly the Vier Leden) was able to pay its debts and reacquire it. After regaining the property, the Staten van Vlaanderen promptly auctioned it off to the highest bidder, an Italian businessman named Jacomo Antonio Carenna, who then became Lord of Zwijndrecht and Burcht. In 1666, he divided the property between his two sons, Jan Francisco Carenna (Zwijndrecht) and Ignacius Carenna (Burcht). Burcht and Zwijndrecht became separate villages and remained so until they were reunited as the municipality of Zwijndrecht in 1977. For the further history specifically of the village of Zwijndrecht, see the article on Zwijndrecht, Belgium. Ignacius Carenna loaned money for the restoration of Burcht from Louis Van Colen and Margareta Hellinckx (siblings) in 1694. When Carenna proved unable to repay the loan, the property reverted to Van Colen and Hellinckx, who became co-rulers of Burcht. By inheritance it passed from the Van Colen family to the De Neuf family in 1750. The last Lord of Burcht was Carolus Petrus Josephus de Neuf, who acquired the title in 1779. After the French Revolution, all feudal titles and rights were dissolved. Rectory, built in 1659 =Industrialization: the nineteenth and twentieth centuries= Geographically and historically, Burcht was originally part of the province of East Flanders, which fell under the jurisdiction of the Count of Flanders. However, in 1923, the village was transferred to the Province of Antwerp. Burcht was primarily agrarian, but by the middle of the nineteenth century, it had become the site of heavy industry. The fertile land in Borgerweert (part of Burcht) was filled in with dredged slurry from the river Scheldt to accommodate the building of factories. Among the industries established there at the time were a guano factory, a linoleum factory, a cement factory, a pot and pan factory, and a lard processing plant. It is currently the seat of the Ytong plant, which manufactures building blocks. The Lt. Thoumsin military base, which houses the 11th Battalion of Engineers of the Belgian army, is also located in Burcht. =World wars= During World War I, Burcht and its two forts were part of the Belgian defensive line. By 1914, the villages of Burcht and Zwijndrecht were full of Belgian soldiers, and orders were issued to reinforce the Fort of Zwijndrecht and the Fort of Kruibeke. A number of houses were blown up to clear the way to the forts. Local civilian residents were recruited for the reinforcement work, soldiers were quartered in private homes and factories, farmers were required to loan their horses and carts for military use, and food and goods were confiscated for the military. In spite of all efforts, Belgium fell to the Germans in October 1914 and Burcht, like all the German-occupied communities in Belgium, suffered greatly for the next four years from food shortages. By the end of the war, 80 young people from Zwijndrecht and Burcht had perished on the front. 82 civilian unemployed civilians from Burcht as well as 99 non- unemployed citizens had been deported to Germany as forced labor. In addition, 5 civilians were deported to Germany for political reasons. A total of 8 citizens from Burcht lost their lives as a result of these deportations. Fort of Kruibeke in Burcht, built in 1870 as part of the national redoubt of Belgium. By 1939, Zwindrecht and Burcht were once again preparing for war with Germany. On 18 May 1940, the Swastika flag had already been raised on the Antwerp Cathedral. Although retreating Belgian troops attempted to blow up the two tunnels leading to the left bank of the Scheldt to prevent the Germans from crossing easily, the explosives in the pedestrian tunnel failed to detonate completely, allowing the German troops to cross the river. During the resulting battle on the streets of Zwijndrecht, 16 German and 29 Belgian soldiers lost their lives, in addition to 32 civilians. Of the latter, 2 were from BurchtRaeymaekers 2004, p. 162. After years of Nazi occupation, the British army liberated Antwerp in September 1944. In an attempt to prevent the Allies from being able to use the Port of Antwerp, the Germans bombarded the harbor with V-1 and V-2 rockets. However, most of the rockets missed their intended target (the port) and fell instead in the surrounding areas, including Burcht. A total of 76 V-bombs fell on Zwijndrecht-Burcht between 25 October 1944 and 28 March 1945. In Burcht, 14 citizens were killed. 50 houses were destroyed completely, and more than 250 houses were badly damaged.Raeymaekers 2004, p. 177. Burcht remained a separate village with its own mayor and administration from the 17th century until the end of the 20th century. In 1977, during an administrative reorganization of the Flemish provinces, Burcht was once again merged with Zwijndrecht under the municipality of Zwijndrecht.

They are located within Old St. Michael's Cave. Description The caves are accessed from within the St. Michael's Cave auditorium. Cavers must descend a scree slope to access the entrance which is marked by a sign engraved into the rock with the inscription \\"To Leonora's Caves 1867\\". However, it is not clear when the caves were discovered. The caves are difficult to enter and for that reason is largely unspoilt. Leonora's Caves are a cave system within the popular show cave of St' Michael's Cave and it could be argued that they are an extension of St. Michael's Cave. Leonora's Caves were long believed to be a bottomless pit and it was here where the myth of an underwater cave passage communicating with North Africa emerged. It was said that through this passage, Gibraltar's Barbary macaques made their way to the Rock from Morocco. Leonora's is in fact not a bottomless pit, but is of substantial depth. Graffiti found on stalagmites and columns date back to 1801 and early reports mentioning \\"passages leading off St. Michaels Cave\\" suggest that the site was first explored in the 1700s by British troops; however, it was only until 1864 that Captain Frederick Brome explored this system extensively and realised its beauty. In 1867, he named this cave after his wife Leonora saying the site was \\"of unimaginable beauty\\". In 1914, the famous French prehistorian Abbe Breuil visited this cave in an attempt to research it properly and was the first to report seeing spiders, isopods, acaris, staphylindis and diptera. Bats were also reported to have been common in these caves although none are found now. In November 1959 George Palao, a Gibraltarian cave enthusiast and surveyor, head of the Gibraltar Cave Research Group also surveyed this cave producing some fine maps of the system. However, they did miss what is now called Lower Leonora's Cave discovered in 2012 by the Gibraltar Museum Caving Unit. Leonora's Caves just like St. Michael's Cave were used as a show cave in the 19th century. This passage by Lt. Col. G.J. Gilbard said: > \\"Ladies however need not be afraid of proceeding to the explorations of > Leonora's Cave, from where, candles only having been used to light up the > stalactites, pillar are undimmed by smoke, and the descent, although a > little difficult is not too arduous an undertaking\\". These trips for ladies would only be to the Main Chamber since attempting the Crawl and later the drop into the Bell Chamber in a long skirt or dress would have been quite dangerous. There are accounts of military personnel having visited the caves in their spare time in an attempt to finally find the passage to Africa and were \\"never seen again\\". Some believe though that they were simply trying to find a way of deserting, and being lost in a cave and \\"never seen again\\" would be a good excuse. In 2012 the Gibraltar Museum Caving Unit carried out a systematic exploration of these caves. It took a few visits to understand the system properly, but discovered two access points to chambers which had not been previously mapped, drawn or described. This part of the system is much harder to navigate involving vertical rope pitches and steep narrow descents. The team has covered over of new passages going deeper underground. Leonora's Cave has never been archaeologically examined completely. Some of the remains found at this site include an ox found in 1958. There is an abundance of breccia containing bone in some of the chambers.

Through marriage to Louis I, Duke of Anjou, she became Duchess of Anjou, Countess of Maine, Duchess of Touraine, titular Queen of Naples and Jerusalem and Countess of Provence. Biography Marie married Louis I, son of John II of France, in 1360. Throughout their marriage his official titles increased, though he would never actually rule the Kingdom of Naples. After his death in 1384, most of the towns in Provence revolted against her son, Louis II. Marie pawned her valuables and raised an army. She, her young son and the army went from town to town to gain support. In 1387 Louis II was formally recognized as Count in Aix-en-Provence. She then appealed to Charles VI of France to support her son in obtaining Naples. In 1390, Louis, supported by the pope and the French, set sail for Naples. Marie negotiated for a marriage between Louis and Yolande of Aragon, to prevent the Aragonese from obstructing him there. They finally wed in 1400.

The cave was converted into Ragged Staff Magazine in 1901. Description The cave was discovered in the 19th century during tunnelling work on the Rock of Gibraltar. It has less deposits than the higher caves like St. Michael's Cave. In 1901 the Admiralty decided to convert the cave so that it could be used as a magazine and they arranged for the approach to be lined with bricks because the ground was made up of red sand. The magazine took four years to complete. By the start of the First World War a complex of sixteen magazines was operational, served by two parallel spine tunnels directly linked to HM Dockyard, Gibraltar by a long access tunnel. In 1943 the magazine was nearly the site of a major explosion during Gibraltar's part in World War II. Jos√© Mart√≠n Mu√±oz a Spaniard working in Gibraltar created an explosion and fire at a fuel tank at Coaling Island on 30 June 1943. He was under suspicion and in August 1943 he was arrested as he attempted to place a bomb inside this fully loaded magazine. Mu√±oz was hanged in January 1944 in Gibraltar by Albert Pierrepoint. There is debate but no conclusion over the origin of the name \\"Ragged Staff\\" which is associated with the nearby Ragged Staff Gates. One of the possibilities is that it is from the symbols for Morvidus who was a legendary Earl of Warwick. He fought and killed a giant using an uprooted tree, hence the symbol of a ragged staff, but there is no consensus.

This meteorological pattern can lead to extreme high temperatures and intense rainfall during the summer months, with potential for flash flooding, damaging hail storms, and tornado formation. Some of these intense thunderstorms are formed from thermal lows. Thermal lows are also known as heat lows. Thermal lows can be semipermanent features around some parts of Europe, particularly in the summer season.

Severe thunderstorms also moved northwards across the UK on 1 July and again overnight 3‚Äì4 July. *2016, 6‚Äì7 June A Spanish plume event brought extensive thunderstorm activity across the UK and Ireland, resulting in the hospitalisation of a man and his children after being struck by lightning in Lisburn, Northern Ireland. Similar regional set-ups=Mexican Plume= A similar pattern, though on a larger scale, is the Mexican plume in the south west USA, where hot dry air from the Mexican highlands acts as a cap to convection until lifted over Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. =Eastern Baltic= In Finland and the Baltic states meteorologists have observed a situation conducive to severe summer storm development which occurs when a warm moist air mass flows into the region from the south or south east under the influence of an upper-level trough. These conditions have some similarities to the Spanish plume. The synoptic conditions see a low over southern Norway, bringing warm south and southwesterly flows of air up from the inner continental areas of Russia and Belarus.

Background Futa Jallon was one of the last independent states in Senegambia. In 1890 Bokar Biro took power in a coup after assassinating his brother, and began placing men loyal to him in positions of authority. A see-saw power struggle commenced, in which Bokar Biro more than once lost and regained power. The French decided to intervene, and sent a small force demanding a treaty with terms that favored their interests against the British. Bokar Biro pretended to sign the treaty, but when the document was examined in Saint Louis, it turned out that in place of his signature Bokar Biro had written \\"Bismillah\\", meaning \\"in the name of God\\". Battle At the end of the rainy season in late 1896 the French dispatched troops from Senegal, Guinea and the Sudan, converging on Futa Jallon. A French column captured Timbo on 3 November 1896. Bokar Biro was unable to enlist the support of the chiefs in resisting the French. On 13 November 1896 Bokar Biro fought a pitched battle on the plain of Por√©daka. He was opposed by a combined force of French troops and Fulbe led by his brother Umaru Bademba Barry. The French artillery destroyed his army. A poet who described the battle said that Bokar Biro kept his word. He did not flee from the French, but was killed by the blast of the cannon. Bokar Biro's son died with him. Results The French installed a resident at Timbo. They recognized the independence of Alfa Yaya, a chief who had supported them, and appointed Umaru Bademba as the almani. A few months later a protectorate treaty was signed and in June 1897 Ernest Noirot became administrator of the state. Noirot dedicated himself to eliminating the institution of slavery. At first the French kept the existing system of chiefs in place, although they removed any who were hostile. In 1904 the French restructured the administration, removing the power of the chiefs. In 1905 they arrested Alfa Yaya and sent him into exile.

He is the author or editor of more than 30 books and over 300 scientific papers, including at least 5+ geology textbooks. Stephen Jay Gould cited Prothero's research on the lack of response to climate change in mammals from the Eocene, Oligocene and Pleistocene epochs to support the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution. He called Prothero ‚Äúthe best punctuated equilibrium researcher on the West Coast‚Äù. Biography Prothero grew up in the Glendale, California area, the son of Clifford R. Prothero (1920-2004), a technical illustrator for Lockheed, and Shirley M. (McDonald) Prothero (born 1924), an artist and homemaker. He attended the University of California, Riverside where he studied paleontology under Dr. Michael O. Woodburne and Dr. Michael Murphy and earned Phi Beta Kappa during his junior year. He received his Ph.D. in geological sciences in 1982 from Columbia University, New York. In 1991 he appeared on the television game show Jeopardy!, and defeated Ben Stein on the show Win Ben Stein's Money in 1999. He was also featured in the Mr. Deity and the Flood episode of the video series Mr. Deity. Further, he debated the Young Earth creationist Duane Gish early in his career. For 27 years he was a member of the faculty at Occidental College, and he previously taught at California Institute of Technology, Knox College, Vassar College and Columbia University where he led many undergraduate paleontological and geological field trips. He is currently a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Prothero at TAM 9 Work=Evolution= Prothero was one of the earliest paleontologists to use the concept of palaeomagnetism in the study of Continental rocks. Palaeomagnetism uses the microscopic iron within sedimentary rock to read the alignment of the magnetic field and correlate that with the known history of the polarity reversals of the earth's magnetic field. The magnetic reversals are precisely dated and consistent worldwide which allows these rocks to be studied in climate science and evolution. In addition to his research in magnetostratigraphy, another area of Prothero's research is the evolution of hoofed mammals, especially rhinos, camels, peccaries, and horses. Prothero's work on documenting evolutionary history of fossil vertebrates was cited by Richard Dawkins in his book The Greatest Show on Earth: the Evidence of Evolution. Skeptic Society founder Michael Shermer called Prothero's 2007 book, Evolution: What the Fossils Say And Why It Matters, \\"the best book ever produced on the subject.\\" He has also been featured as a scientific consultant and was interviewed on several television documentaries, including the Are Rhinos Dinos? episode of TLC's Paleoworld, the History Channel's Prehistoric Monsters Revealed, the episodes of National Geographic's Prehistoric Predators covering the entelodon and hyaenodon, the series Walking with Prehistoric Beasts on BBC, and the amphicyon or Bear Dog episode of Monsters Resurrected. In October 2012, Prothero appeared in his capacity as a paleontologist on Conspiracy Road Trip, a BBC television documentary in which five individuals who self-identified as Creationists participated in a road trip along the western coast of the United States, meeting with various experts on the topic, exchanging views and questions with people holding differing views. Prothero and Michael Shermer at TAM 2013 =Cryptozoology= Prothero has frequently written about the topic of cryptozoology, a pseudoscience and subculture, which he categorizes along with Holocaust denial and UFO abductions claims as aspects of American culture that are \\"clearly baloney\\". Prothero's 2013 book with Daniel Loxton, Abominable Science: The Origin of Yeti, Nessie, and Other Cryptids discusses the subculture in depth. In a review by Adrienne Mayor of Stanford University, she describes the book as \\"An entertaining, educational, passionate, and valuable handbook for readers interested getting a scientific perspective on the field of cryptozoology. With marvelous artwork and deeply researched histories of the various creatures, this is an impressive and authoritative book.\\" = Anthropogenic global warming = Prothero looks at the evidence regarding global warming and the role humans have had on it. In his book Greenhouse of the Dinosaurs, Prothero states \\"geologists and paleoclimatologists know a lot about past greenhouse worlds, and the icehouse planet that has existed for the past 33 million years. We have a good understanding of how and why the Antarctic ice sheet first appeared at that time, and how the Arctic froze over about 3.5 million years ago, beginning the 24 glacial and interglacial episodes of the 'Ice Ages' that have occurred since then.\\" In his article in eSkeptic, Prothero details carbon dioxide increases, melting polar icecaps, melting glaciers and sea level rise as some of the more important areas that point to anthropogenic global warming. He also goes into details to outline climate change deniers arguments and rebuttals to those arguments and finally talks about why people deny climate change. =Skepticism= Prothero grew up in a Presbyterian household, but eventually became an atheist.https://modsynthesis.com/2014/02/12/interview- with-paleontologist-donald-prothero/ He became involved in the skeptical movement in the mid-1990s, when Michael Shermer invited him to join the editorial board of The Skeptics Society. His first appearance as a panelist at The Amazing Meeting was in 2010. As a result of Prothero's books about evolution in 2007 and climate change in 2009, he recognized that \\"those same people who were denying evolution are often the exact same people who deny climate [change].\\" This realization led him to research and author \\"Reality Check: How Science Deniers Threaten Our Future\\" in 2013 as he explained during an interview on the podcast Skepticality: In 2015, Prothero was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

Critical reception Prothero's 2005 work The Evolution of North American Rhinoceroses received critical attention in the Journal of Paleontology, where Professor David Froehlich lauded the book's comprehensive coverage of North American rhinoceros species, but noted that the work would be less likely to appeal to nonspecialists, for whom the \\"bulk of the book\\" is likely to be \\"more than most would like to know about North American rhinos.\\" However, Froehlich wrote that for those \\"who need this kind of detail, this book is virtually unmatched and indispensable,\\" noting that his \\"one real quibble\\" was the \\"lack of an overall discussion of rhinoceros evolution\\" that was geographically comprehensive, which Froehlich thought would \\"put these organisms in a global context for the nonspecialist.\\" A May 2009 Reports of the National Center for Science Education review of Prothero's Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters described Prothero as \\"equal to his task\\" of providing resources for evaluating the fossil record, and praised the book's breadth of coverage of its topic. Although the reviewer criticized Prothero's treatment of creationist claims for the book's \\"polemical tone\\" and \\"contempt\\" for religion-based opponents of the biological sciences, he also noted that Prothero \\"is well versed in the history of science and religion and makes it clear that he sees no necessary conflict between science and religion.\\" In a review of Prothero's 2011 book Catastrophes!: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and Other Earth-Shattering Disasters for the American Library Association, Prothero is described as \\"seiz[ing] teaching opportunities\\" to explain the methods involved with taking metrics of the types of disasters discussed. While the reviewer praised Prothero for his approach to these topics and \\"recommended\\" the work, Prothero's \\"presentation becomes more complex\\" as the book discusses ice ages and global warming according to the reviewer, who states that \\"with all scientists convinced that warming is occurring as a result of human action, [...] he disparages the denialists.\\" Awards and honors Prothero has received a number of honors for his research as well as his lectures and books. In 1991, he received the Charles Schuchert Award of the Paleontological Society for the outstanding paleontologist under the age of 40. His book Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters received the 2007 PSP award for excellence in earth science from the Association of American Publishers. In 2013 he received the Diamond Award for Distinguished Achievement in Science and Technology from the Glendale Unified School District. The National Association of Geoscience Teachers selected him for the 2013 James Shea Award. His lectures on topics like evolution, fossil mammals and climate change have been featured at the Skeptic Society Lecture Series and at The Amaz!ng Meeting as well as the Paleontological Society where he was named a Distinguished Speaker in 1993-1994. Prothero was awarded the 2015 Joseph T Gregory Service Award honoring his outstanding service to the welfare of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. In 2016 he was awarded the Friend of Darwin award from the National Center for Science Education, with NCSE's executive director Ann Reid saying \\"it would be hard to think of anyone who has contributed as much to the public understanding of the paleontological evidence for evolution and against creationism as Don Prothero.\\" He was also named a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry citing his ‚Äúdistinguished contributions to science and skepticism.‚Äù The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) awarded Tim Callahan and Prothero the Robert P. Balles Annual Prize in Critical Thinking for their book UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens. CSI stated This book \\"not only refute(s) false claims and misguided beliefs ... but more importantly they also arm readers with the tools they will need to fairly evaluate any extraordinary claim they come across\\". The $2,500 prize will be awarded at the CSICon conference in Las Vegas, October 2018.

It was created and co-written by Adam Resnick. It was produced by David Letterman's Worldwide Pants Incorporated company and played on the HBO network from November 9 to December 18, 1996. Premise Mark Wilson and Robert Joy star as the characters Earl and Emmett, respectively, who are two businessmen trying to get rich in 1950s Pittsburgh. The pair are co-owners of a small, struggling storage company called Paradise Storage. The show opens just as Earl's previous business deal, an investment in rock salts, falls apart. In order to recover his losses, Earl comes up with the idea to open the storage company. Earl is outspoken and always looking for quick ways to make a profit, while Emmett acts as his passive sidekick. Emmett was reluctant to join in on the business, but agreed because it was the only way for him to collect a debt Earl owed him. The show is shot in black and white in an attempt to emulate television from the 1950s, and especially the concept of the 1951-53 sitcom Amos 'n' Andy. Cast *Robert Joy as Emmett *Mark Wilson as Earl *Betsy Aidem as Irene *Ernie Grunwald as Claude *Duke Moosekian as Rudy *Stephen Mellor as multiple characters History The show was originally supposed to air on CBS with the title \\"Emmett and Earl\\". It was set in present day but with 1950s characteristics, and proved to be unnecessarily confusing for audiences. When CBS tested a pilot episode, the resulting numbers were disappointing, and CBS dropped the deal. The show's creator, Adam Resnick, then sent a version of the pilot to HBO's head of programming, Chris Albrecht. Albrecht reportedly loved the show and invited Resnick to produce 10 episodes in HBO's studios exactly the way it had been pitched: in black and white, with just one camera, and set in the 1950s. But despite initial positivity, the HBO version of The High Life faced challenges from very early on. For monetary reasons, the studio hired an entirely non-unionized cast and crew, for which Resnick received negative feedback. Additionally, both the camera crew and HBO's advertising department had trouble understanding Resnick's vision, and the result was an unusual show that some critics described as being nasty and mean-spirited, for which HBO did not know how to attract the right audience. Eventually, the show hired Peyton Reed, who directed the show's final two episodes and was the only crew member who seemed to understand Resnick's ideas. However, despite Reed's enthusiastic directing, the crew, advertising staff, and cast grew even less cohesive, which led HBO to cut the season from 10 episodes to 8, foreshadowing the show's ultimate cancellation after just 8 episodes. Resnick has expressed disappointment in how the show's fate played out. Not only did its producer, David Letterman support the show, but Resnick believes it could have targeted a specific, dedicated audience had it been advertised properly. He believes the show was prematurely cancelled just as it had started to improve with Reed's directing, and wishes they had been granted a second chance. The show was one of the first of its kind. Its frequently dark settings, with self-centered, unlikable characters was not commonplace in television before 1996. Shows that are popular today, such as It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, exhibit some of these same production and writing styles. Resnick also made the risky decision to cast Stephen Mellor as a different antagonist each week, a pattern that is visible in the first season NBC's popular 30 Rock sitcom. These unique attributes aside, the show failed to survive and today, there are very few traces of it available anywhere on the Internet.

The upper section is serene, with a gold background enveloping Jesus, the good thief (whose soul is being borne up to Heaven), and the bad thief (whose soul is being torn out by demons). The bottom part of the panel, however, is crammed full of figures and narratives. A swooning Mary is supported by attendants, including John. Mary Magdalene and a boy to quench Jesus' thirst with vinegar stand at the foot of the cross. To the right, soldiers gamble for the clothes of the condemned. Just above them rides Pontius Pilate. His banner is emblazoned with S.P.Q.R., standing for Rome, while above Jesus' head is the mocking I.N.R.I.. This clash of old and new in their respective standards reiterates the divided nature of the painting. Although Modena used a conservative style, his figures are highly expressive. His ability to create such lively, emotive figures made him the foremost painter in late fourteenth century Genoa. =Acquisition= The IMA acquired Crucifixion in 1924, courtesy of the James E.

A. Scott Kelso and H. Bunz. The model attempts to provide the framework for understanding coordinated behavior in living things. It accounts for experimental observations on human bimanual coordination that revealed fundamental features of self-organization: multistability, and phase transitions (switching). HKB is one of the most extensively tested quantitative models in the field of human movement behavior.Fuchs, A., & Jirsa, V.K. (Eds.) (2008) Coordination: Neural, Behavioral and Social Dynamics. Heidelberg: Springer. Phase Transitions ('Switches') The HKB model differs from other motor coordination models with the addition of phase transitions (‚Äòswitches‚Äô). Kelso initially observed this phenomenon while conducting an experiment looking at subjects‚Äô finger movements. Subjects oscillated their fingers rhythmically in the transverse plane (i.e., abduction-adduction) in one of two patterns, parallel or anti- parallel. In the parallel pattern, the finger muscles contract in an alternating fashion; in the anti-parallel pattern, the homologous finger muscles contract simultaneously. Kelso's study observed that when the subject begins in the parallel mode and increases the speed of movement, a spontaneous switch to symmetrical, anti-parallel movement occurs. This transition happens swiftly at a certain critical frequency. Surprisingly, after the switch has occurred and the movement rate decreases, Kelso's subjects remain in the symmetrical model (did not switch back). Kelso's study indicates that while humans are able to produce two patterns at low frequency values, only one‚Äîthe symmetrical, anti-parallel mode remains stable as frequency is scaled beyond a critical value. Prediction The HKB model states that dynamic instability causes switching to occur. HKB measures stability in the following ways: 1\\\\. Critical slowing down. If a perturbation is applied to a system that takes it away from its stationary state, the time for a system to return to the stationary state (local relaxation time) is a measure of the system's stability. The less stable the pattern, the longer it should take to return to the established pattern. HKB predicts critical slowing down.Sch√∂ner, G., Haken, H., & Kelso, J.A.S. (1986). A stochastic theory of phase transitions in human hand movement. Biological Cybernetics, 53, 247-257. As the parallel pattern loses stability as frequency is increased, the local relaxation time should increase as the system approaches the critical point. 2\\\\. Critical fluctuations. If switching patterns of behavior is due to loss of stability, direct measures of fluctuations of the order parameter should be detectable as the critical point approaches. Equation In the HKB model œï is the relative phase or phase relation between the fingers. The parameter k in the model has a correspondence to the cycle-to-cycle period of the finger movements, or, the inverse of the movement rate or oscillation frequency in the experiment. The equation: œïÀô=‚àísinœï‚àí2ksin2œï The equation predicts that for k > 0.25 relative phase values of 0 ¬±œÄ are both stable, a condition coined as bistability. An increase in movement rate, starting in parallel-phase, leads to a switch to anti-parallel phase at a critical frequency. Starting with a large k and decreasing k leads to a destabilization of the fixed point at œÄ which becomes unstable at the value kc=0.25. Uses The HKB model has had a profound effect on many conceptual, methodological, and practical models since its inception.

Kappa Theta Pi was founded on January 10, 2012 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and is the University of Michigan's first and only startup technology fraternity. The goals of the fraternity are to create bonds between students of Informatics, computer science, business, design, computer engineering, Information,https://www.si.umich.edu/content/bsi and any others who are interested in technology, to develop networks through facilitation of professional and social growth, and to expose members to career options in the technology field. History=Foundation= In December 2011, two students, Louise Vongphrachanh and Jing Guo, founded a professional fraternity aimed towards informatics students. As many of these students were often in multiple classes together, a fraternity was organized to foster both professional and social relationships. After gaining support and conducting interviews, a group of seven Informatics students became the founding class and first executive board. These seven individuals are: * Nisha Dwivedi * Jacqueline Fontaine * Jing Guo * Brian Mansfield * Denny Tsai * Julie Varghese * Louise Vongphrachanh Vongphrachanh and Guo signed the charter and became co- presidents of the fraternity. Later, the fraternity's focus was broadened to include all students interested in information technology. Although the fraternity is aimed towards information technology, Kappa Theta Pi has made continuous efforts to connect with students regardless of their technical and academic backgrounds. In Spring 2014, University of Michigan School of InformationUniversity of Michigan School of Information formally sponsored the fraternity. =Colors= The Colors of this professional fraternity are blue (#458FFF) and green (#19FF19). The hexidecimal color values represent the technical roots of the fraternity. =Purpose= According to Kappa Theta Pi's constitution, the purpose of the fraternity can be detailed in six statements: Kappa Theta Pi works to build an active community of students with a shared interest in technology; it sponsors events and activities aimed toward intellectual, social, and professional development; it provides academic and professional resources to members; it fosters relationships among the local community, and with corporations; it provides service and philanthropy to the local community; and it works to maintain lifelong cooperation and friendship among its members.Kappa Theta Pi Constitution Structure The executive board of Kappa Theta Pi currently consists of the President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Director of Marketing, Director of Engagement, Director of Technology, Director of Professional Development, and Director of Membership. The current president of the fraternity is Yoav Helfman. Elections for each executive board position occurs at the beginning of every calendar year. Each active member of the fraternity is required to complete community service hours as well as attend professional development events. There are seven committees dedicated to fostering the growth and development of the fraternity. Each member must be part of a committee to actively contribute to the fraternity as a whole. Philanthropy Currently, Kappa Theta Pi co-hosts the Computer Science Bootcamp & Tutoring Program at Pioneer High School with Michigan CSE Scholars. Fraternity members volunteer their time in order to tutor high school computer science students. The primary goal of the Computer Science Bootcamp program is to successfully get all students in the class to pass the AP Computer Science exam. Furthermore, the Computer Science & Tutoring Program aims to raise diversity and appreciation for the field of computer science. Members are required to complete 10 hours of service a semester, many of which are completed with Computer Science Bootcamp. Members are also required to participate in multiple professional development events each semester; ranging from resume critiques, company presentations, and mock interviews. Chapters There are currently six Kappa Theta Pi chapters, with the founding chapter at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and other chapters at the University of Pittsburgh, the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park and The College of New Jersey.

Career and education  Shane received a bachelor's from Williams College and a master's from Oxford University. He began his journalism career as a news clerk for The Washington Star (1979‚Äì1980), then as a local news reporter for the Greensboro (NC) News & Record (1980‚Äì1983). He became a reporter for The Baltimore Sun (1983‚Äì2004), he served for two years as their Moscow correspondent (1988‚Äì1991). Since 2004 he has been a national news reporter for The New York Times. Shane also made an appearance in the HBO series \\"The Wire\\" (Season 5, episode 2), playing himself. He is author of Objective Troy: A Terrorist, A President, and the Rise of the Drone, which won the 2016 Lionel Gelber Prize. This book tells the story of Anwar al-Awlaki, who won fame as an imam outside Washington after the 9/11 attacks but eventually joined Al Qaeda in Yemen and was killed by a drone strike in 2011 on the orders of the then President Obama. He was the first U.S. citizen hunted and killed by his own government since the Civil War. Before joining The New York Times, from 1983 to 2004 Shane was a reporter for The Baltimore Sun covering a range of subjects. He was The Baltimore Suns Moscow correspondent from 1988 until 1991. Shane witnessed and reported on a crucial time in Russia's modern history. His book Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union provided a brilliant insight into the root causes of the demise of the Soviet regime. One of the main protagonists in the book was a dissident and political prisoner Andrei Mironov. In 1995, he and Tom Bowman wrote series of six articles on the National Security Agency. This was the first major investigation of the NSA since James Bamford's 1982 book The Puzzle Palace. The Baltimore Sun is the home-delivery newspaper for many NSA employees working at its Ft. Meade, Maryland, headquarters. Apart from his role as a reporter of the news, Shane became part of the news himself for his contact with former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on January 25, 2013, after entering into a plea-bargain agreement in which he accepted conviction for violation of one count of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, in return for all other charges against him by the government being dropped. Kiriakou's attorneys had sought to depose Shane (named as \\"Journalist B\\" in the indictment) as part of his defense, but withdrew their subpoena to do so. The prosecution had contended that Kiriakou had been a source for Shane's 2008 report that named non-covert CIA employee Deuce Martinez as having been an interrogator of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the attacks of September 11, 2001, although Martinez did not participate in the extensive pre-questioning waterboarding of \\"KSM\\". Shane wrote about his relationship with Kiriakou in a rare, first-person account published by The New York Times of a reporter's role in a story involving national security and secrecy.

On the question of whether or not the programs were morally justified (in light of the trauma of family separation), Triay emphatically believes that, given the rise of a totalitarian Communist state in Cuba, the parents of the Operation Pedro Pan children were validated in sending their offspring out of the country and to the United States.

Some of what you read made the exiles look like a bunch of blind, maniacal, machete-wielding anti-Communist, anti-Castro fanatics. But it wasn't like that. They were fighting for democracy.

Carter seeks the art after it goes missing, hoping to fund his dream of building a music studio and improve his foundering existence, but he's thwarted by cops, local characters and, ultimately, fate along the way. Cast and Crew The cast includes Johnny Sneed, Jolyn Janis, Jessie Bernstein, Julie Mintz and numerous local cast and crew from Marfa. Van Dyke and Jennie Lyn Hamilton produced the film. Carolyn Pfeiffer executive produced the film. Iskra Valtcheva is the Cinematographer and Graham Reynolds is the Composer. The editor is named Hugo Friedman. Reception Far Marfa screened at numerous festivals across the US and Europe where it received unanimously positive, often rave reviews, and sold out a majority of its screenings. Louis Black in the Austin Chronicle called it \\"\\"a layered film - a human comedy and a metaphysical mystery as well as a consideration of art and romance. The landscape, texture, sensibility, and atmosphere of Marfa is what really makes this film so captivating and unique. All of this so sweetly comes together under the visionary and skilled hand of director, Cory Van Dyke. Highly recommended.\\".

It is a rebooted American Dream from a generation who had many of their opportunities squandered by the generation before.

Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University is an independent university based in Suzhou, China, resulting from a partnership between the University of Liverpool and Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University. In 2010-11, China was the third most popular destination for UK TNE students, after Malaysia and Singapore: and there are almost 36,000 UK TNE students in China.

New York University Shanghai (NYU Shanghai) is the third degree-granting campus established by New York University, after New York City and Abu Dhabi, in partnership with East China Normal University of Shanghai. However, such strategies have proven controversial. A 2007 report entitled 'British Universities in China: The Reality Beyond the Rhetoric - An Agora Discussion Paper' (a British think-tank for higher education), Edited by Anna Fazackerley, cautioned British universities that they must acquire a more thorough understanding of Chinese higher education policy if they were to succeed in building successful strategic alliances over the long-term.British Universities in China: The Reality Beyond the Rhetoric. An Agora Discussion Paper Edited by Anna Fazackerley, 2007 Whilst the University of Nottingham and the University of Liverpool campuses are independent legal entities, SII is an academic partnership institution between University of Surrey and Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE) in Dalian, China. Developed at a faculty level; the link with DUFE, which is based in Surrey University's Faculty of Management and Law, is one of the most long-established and successful of these faculty-based ventures. Organization The nature of Surrey International Institute (SII) is a joint venture agreement between Surrey and DUFE. Governance structure comprises a joint management committee (JMC) that oversees the operation run by its appointed executive group (EG). The vice-chancellor of University of Surrey leads Surrey's JMC team. A Surrey senior member of staff is appointed by the JMC as the chair of executive Group in charge of the operation of the joint venture. The current operational manager is Dr. Gary Rivers (associate dean) and is resident in SII to ensure teaching supervision, teaching activities and teaching quality. The dean of SII is Professor Zhao Yanzhi,A profile of Professor ZHAO Yanzhi The British Council, 2012 Professor of Finance, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, China. Yanzhi Zhao is professor of Finance at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE), Dalian, China. He has served as dean of Surrey International Institute and director of Global Institute of Management and Economics at DUFE. Prior to that, he studied at Dalian University of Technology of Mechanical Engineering and DUFE, completing a PhD in quantitative economics at DUFE. In a 2012, presentation for the British Council,A British Council presentation by Professor ZHAO Yanzhi The British Council, 2012 Surrey International Institute is not a legal entity, but is technically a joint venture between the two institutions, with a joint management structure comprising a joint management committee in Dalian, chaired by the chairman of DUFE and a joint executive group in Surrey, chaired three times annually by the pro-vice-chancellor (international relations) from Surrey. The pro-vice-chancellor is also a member of the Dalian joint management committee. The creation of the joint venture required the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Education. The parties recover their full teaching costs from student fees which vary according to location of study. However, those students who return to Surrey to complete their degrees will be paying the usual international tuition fee. Another key objective is to build up the partnership with DUFE so that in the long term both institutions will be undertaking a wide range of joint activities including joint research. Students registered on the BSc Management programme at SII (which is a four- year programme) follow a similar curriculum to students at Surrey in the UK. They are taught by lecturers based at SII as well as academics from the UK Surrey tourism team. Statistics The BSc and MSc in Tourism Management, Business Management, Information Management and Information Systems are accredited by AACSB. The Dual Degrees is awarded by both parties. SII achieved top level in the MoE audit review in China-Foreign Cooperation Running Schools in Year 2011. It was awarded the Best Joint Venture in Liaoning Province award by the Liaoning Education Board., SII has currently employs 62 full-time teachers, including seven University of Surrey staff. From those, there are 45 foreign teachers 45; 17 local teachers, and all have a background of studying abroad. There are 36 professional teachers; and 26 language teachers. 86% of professional teachers have doctoral teachers. They graduated from universities including University of Cambridge, University of London, London School of Economics, the University of Manchester, University of California, Berkeley, Pennsylvania State University, Washington State University and Sydney University and other international universities. In 2012, the UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) undertook its second review of higher education delivered in mainland China, carried out from 26 November to 7 December 2012 by a QAA team comprising four members of staff and five peer reviewers. The TNE China 2012 review was centred on a series of desk-based studies looking at institutional procedures for the management of academic quality and standards and the way they operated. It is envisaged that these studies will cover a large proportion of the UK higher education institutions' activity in mainland China.

It consists of a gravel runway. The airport was built by the Luftwaffe during World War II. It was rebuilt in 1958 by the Royal Norwegian Air Force to supply its radar station at Kautokeino. It is largely unused and is now owned by the Norwegian Directorate of Public Construction and Property and the Finnmark Estate. Local politicians have called for the airport to be upgraded to a regional airport, but this has been rejected by Avinor. History Junkers Ju 52 at Kautokeino during World War II Norwegian soldiers with the wreck of a German aircraft at Kautokeino Airport in spring 1945 The airfield was built by the Luftwaffe as an emergency landing field during the early 1940s. In addition to this, it stationed a detachment of reconnaissance aircraft. The Royal Norwegian Air Force established a radio station at Kautokeino in 1945. Transport to the new airport was among other means carried out using seaplanes which used the Altaelva river to land. The station was upgraded in 1955 and received a radar and was designated as a reporting post. Its first upgrade took place in 1958, the same year as renovations of the airfield were carried out. The main users of the airfield were Twin Otters from Bod√∏ Main Air Station. On occasion supplies would be dropped by parachute. Once only a jet fighter has landed here, even if the field is too short for them. In June 1970 an F5 landed and took off, then using a parachute and extra rockets. Enonteki√∂ Airport in Finland started marketing itself as Enonteki√∂‚ÄìKautokeino Saami Airport from 2008, although Finavia does not use the term any more. Enonteki√∂ is located from Kautokeino. Local politicians have proposed that Kautokeino Airport be rebuilt as a regional airport. In 2007 a unison municipal council supported an upgrade to the airport. They cited that Kautokeino would receive a hotel from 2008 and that it would be necessary to have an airport to support the village's tourism industry. A secondary argument is that an upgraded airport could be used for an air ambulance service. Finnmark County Council voted with a single decisive vote in 2010 to work towards making Kautokeino Finnmark's twelfth regional airport. Facility The airport is located north of the village center. It consists of a gravel runway aligned 01‚Äì19 (roughly north‚Äìsouth). There is no regular traffic on the airfield. The airport is located at an elevation of above mean sea level in a flat area. The airport is owned by the Norwegian Directorate of Public Construction and Property, which leases the land from the Finnmark Estate. Future Avinor, the agency responsible for running state-owned airports, conducted an analysis in 2012 of upgrading Kautokeino to a regional airport with a runway. Kautokeino's population of 2,935 make an estimated 10,000 annual flights from Alta Airport, located by road and 1 hour and 50 minutes from the village. Avinor studied two alternative services, one with three daily flights directly to Troms√∏ and one using the existing Dash 8 aircraft network. The latter would require a stop- over at S√∏rkjosen Airport before Troms√∏, allowing for two daily services, or directly with only one. Either way this gives an average 20 daily passengers per direction. Such a route would need subsidies of about 10 million Norwegian krone per year (NOK). Construction of an airport is estimated to cost NOK 530 million and have an annual operating cost of NOK 28 million. An economic analysis showed that the airport would have a negative net present value for society of NOK 1014 million, excluding operating subsidies for the airline. There is little time gain from the project as travelers to Oslo would have to fly via S√∏rkjosen to Troms√∏ and there change aircraft, instead of taking direct flights from Alta. Only passengers having Troms√∏ as travel target would have a gain from an airport. Avinor has recommended not upgrading the Kautokeino Airport. Accidents and incidents A Junkers Ju 52/3m transport aircraft of the Luftwaffe crashed at the airport in 1944, resulting in a write-off.

Biography=Career= William Dana Orcutt was an important book and typeface designer in Boston, an important printing and bookmaking center, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Orcutt graduated from Harvard University in 1892, and subsequently worked for John Wilson, proprietor of The University Press of Cambridge, Massachusetts (a forerunner of the Harvard University Press). Through his role at the University Press, Orcutt made contact with prominent authors such as Mary Baker Eddy, whose books he continued to publish throughout her career. Along with several other important designers and printers such as Daniel Berkeley Updike and Bruce Rogers, Orcutt helped found the Boston Society of Printers in 1905. Orcutt was elected the first president of the Society, an organization inspired by the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement. Includes William Dana Orcutt's initials as the book designer for the press In 1910, Orcutt left the University Press to join The Plimpton Press in Norwood, Massachusetts. During Orcutt's tenure at the press, he worked to change the nature of printing \\"from a contracting to a manufacturing business\\", believing that this \\"rais[ed] the quality of the so-called 'trade' volumes\\". The Plimpton Press centralized the three divisions of bookmaking - typesetting, printing, and binding. Based on his experience at The University Press and his reputation as a designer and printer, Orcutt was personally sought out by authors to print their works. For example, the Victorian nutritionist and dietician Horace Fletcher bequeathed Orcutt his library so that Orcutt would publish Fletcher's manuscripts. Orcutt also published several works of his own on writing, book making and book arts and remained active in professional societies related to printing and typography. A self-described \\"bookman,\\" Orcutt wrote, reviewed, and translated for a variety of publications based in the Boston area including The Atlantic Monthly, The Christian Science Monitor, and The Boston Globe. In an important review article first published in a special issue of the International Studio magazine and then republished in 1914 in a book-length collection, Orcutt surveyed the recent history of \\"The Art of the Book in America\\". He praised work by important designers and printers such as Updike, Rogers, and Theodore Low De Vinne. In Orcutt's account, American printing had reached a pinnacle of excellence during the 1860s but had fallen into decline--technically and artistically--until a revival of interest spurred by the work of William Morris in the 1890s. =Personal life= Orcutt was an Episcopalian.Ernest S. Frerichs. ed. (1988). The Bible and Bibles in America. Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press. p. 193. He lived in Boston and on Cape Cod, and his family was well known in the New England area.William Dana Orcutt (1950). Mary Baker Eddy and Her Books. Boston, MA: Christian Science Pub. Society. Publisher's note. Typefaces Typefaces designed by Orcutt include Humanistic, which was cast for the University Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts by the American Type Founders Company, French Round Face, and Suburban French. Title page of the 'Triumphs of Francesco Petrarch' set in Humanistic typeface The Humanistic typeface was probably Orcutt's most important creation. The typeface is based on a 15th-century manuscript of the Aeneid attributed to the notable Humanistic scribe Antonio Sinibaldi held at the Laurentian Library in Florence. Orcutt traveled to Italy to study typographic history and developed a friendship with Guido Biagi, Director of the Laurentian Library, who directed his interest to Renaissance Italian lettering. A special limited printing of a book on Petrarch, titled The triumphs of Francesco Petrarch, Florentine poet laureate, published in 1906, served as the occasion to commission and create this typeface. Charles Eliot Norton, Professor of Art History at Harvard and expert on Italian art and literature, reviewed designs of the typeface and later praised \\"the attractive freedom and unusual grace in its lines, derived immediately from the manuscript model but adapted to the necessary rigid requirements of print\\". The Triumphs was a painstaking work of historical reconstruction and fine typesetting, including ink prepared exactly according to the methods of 15th-century Italian scribes. Orcutt reflected on the process of creating this typeface in his 1926 work In quest of the perfect book. Orcutt's Humanistic was adapted by the British foundry Stephenson Blake as Bologna in 1946, which in turn became American Type Founders' Verona (with lining figures) in 1951. Books (partial list) Orcutt authored books in a variety of genres ranging from novels to historical fiction, biography, and writing advice.     * ReferencesExternal links  American typographers 1870 births 1953 deaths American printers American Episcopalians Harvard University alumni ","title":"William Dana Orcutt"},{"id":"38557898","text":"Ch.

The examples shown are an arum, a cypripedium and a blue-eyed grass. History The logo of the Canadian Wildflower Society created by Pamela Meacher NANPS was founded in 1985 by a small group of conservationists as the Canadian Wildflower Society.Wildflower Magazine, 1(1):5 (The name was later changed to the North American Native Plant Society to reflect a wider range of activities and broader membership.) In 1985, the Society began publishing their well-received native plant magazine, Wildflower, under the editorship of James L. Hodgins. In 1985 it also established a gardening Code of Ethics for its members. In 1986, it sponsored its first public annual native plant sale and filed a letters patent. In 1988, it sponsored its first native plant propagation workshop, and established wildflower gardens tour in Guelph and Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. By 1993, it purchased a 50-acre Carolinian woodlot known as Shining Tree Woods near Cultus, Ontario, to conserve the nationally rare native cucumber tree, Magnolia acuminata.Wildflower Magazine, 10(1):11 In 1994, the Canadian Wildflowe Society co-published (with the Federation of Ontario Naturalists) the first booklet on the native plants of Carolinian Canada with conservation and horticultural advice. The Canadian Wildflower Society changed its name to the North American Native Plant Society (NANPS) in 1998.Wildflower Magazine, 15(2):3 In 2003, it purchased a five-hectare (13-acre) parcel of Zinkan Island Cove, a provincially designated ANSI (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest) on the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario. In 2000 the North American Native Plant Society decided to stop supporting the publication of Wildflower magazine,Wildflower 16(1) Winter 2000 and replaced it with \\"The Blazing Star'. Wildflower was published independently, but eventually ceased publication in 2004. In 2005, NANPS began conducting regular seminars around Ontario, and formed partnerships with Toronto Botanical Garden and the City of Markham City of Markham Markham Environmental Stability Fund. Also, a NANPS member founded an e-newsletter, The Local Scoop. In 2010, NANPS celebrated its 25th anniversary by publishing a special edition of The Blazing Star. NANPS founder and Honorary President, James A French, published Silver Memories, a personal recollection of the first 25 years.Silver Memories Pub by Bulletins Plus, Lakefield ON In 2013 the Society campaigned for a native plant garden as part of the renewal of Ontario Place.

It studies the functioning of language in the media sphere, or modern mass communication presented by print, audiovisual, digital, and networked media. Media linguistics is being formed in the process of the differentiation of linguistics as a general theory of language, and is a sub-field of linguistics similar to other fields such as psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, developmental linguistics, legal linguistics, political linguistics, etc.  Object  The 1968 Ray-Ban advertisement uses a play on the English word \\"sport,\\" referring both to a person and the activity. Modern media linguistics examines not only the written language of media, but also media speech. Media linguistics includes media speech studies that examine (1) the speech behavior of mass communication participants and (2) specific areas, textures, and genres of media texts. Media linguistics analyses texts, as well as their production and reception. Thus, in principle, media linguistics seeks to explain the particular case of the functioning of language‚Äîin mass communication with its complex structure and changing properties‚Äîamid the overall trends of language and speech culture.Hult, F.M. (2010). Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. Language Problems and Language Planning, 34(2), 158-181. It studies language in relation to medium-specific aspects, such as the specific properties of media texts or platforms, and sometimes includes analysis of multimodality. Other purposes include analyzing patterns of language use within certain historical contexts, and establishing differences between \\"normal\\" language and media language. Media linguistics is closely related to contemporary media practices and intends to impact on them, in particular, by means of media education. Studying language use in the media can be used to help develop critical media literacy, for example in relation to stereotypes. Media linguistics includes the study of traditional mass media texts (typically, print or broadcast news) as well as social media and other digital media such as blog posts or SMS messages. Advertisements, amongst other multimodal media, are commonly analyzed in the context of media linguistics. The study of fictional film and television has recently emerged as an important area of media linguistics. In recent years, media linguistics has been influenced by \\"transnational and translocal\\" communication and the relationship between a country's culture and its use of language.  Importance  Media linguistics provides that media is used as a source of historical and current data or research. It is critical in examining regional language and regional dialect models of media involving the portrayal of society and culture. Media linguistics is crucial in understanding how the media broadcasts language ideologies and is able to strengthen representation of a less common, minority language or maintain representation of a dominant language. Sources of media language are used as learning material in second language courses given its ties to the language's culture and its surrounding context and its role in exposing students to native-speaker syntax and vocabulary.  Change Over Time  In the 18th century, the press was not always considered a trusted source. As taxes were lifted from newspapers and governments opened their meetings to the press, media, specifically newspapers, gained in credibility but still retained it's bias. In the early 21st century, linguists are studying how \\"computer-mediated communication (CMC)\\" differs from older forms of media communication. While the level of interactivity between readers and writers remains the same, CMC shows increasing evidence of media attempting to gain more and more of their reader's attention. The variables that have some of the strongest effect on how language changes over time are the number of speakers within a language and how connected they are to other speakers. This is especially evident within social media, which has the ability to connect many speakers of the same language. CMC also shows how people might form exclusive \\"groups\\" online, and form a sense of relatedness with these groups or other online users.  In different countries  * In English-speaking countries the terms media study and media discourse analysis are used, while interdisciplinary approaches such as Critical Discourse Analysis are often used to study news media. See, for example, Teun A. van Dijk's book News as Discourse. Some scholars have recently started using the term media linguistics, while others prefer the more narrow term media stylistics. * In Germany-speaking countries the term Medienlinguistik is used,:de:Medienlinguistik and the field is regarded as \\"one of the most dynamic fields of applied linguistics\\". * In Russia, active usage of the term –ú–µ–¥–∏–∞–ª–∏–Ω–≥–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ is associated with the publications of T.G.

She was said to be cruel, and was suspected of having poisoned Wang Yanhan's father and predecessor Wang Shenzhi (Prince Zhongyi).  Known life  Lady Cui was said to be of the prominent Cui clan of Boling.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 94. It is not known when she married Wang Yanhan, but it was before Wang Shenzhi's death (upon which Wang Yanhan took control of the Min realm), for she was suspected to have poisoned Wang Shenzhi while being Wang Yanhan's wife.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. She was said to be ugly, licentious, and jealous. However, she was also said to be a devout Buddhist who took, as her teacher in Buddhist doctrines, the monk Huileng (ÊÖßÁ®ú). (It was from her correspondence with Huileng, in which she referred to herself as \\"Lianshi,\\" that one might believe that her name was Lianshi, although the historical accounts did not otherwise state a definitive name for her.) While Wang Yanhan was ruling ‚Äî but it was not completely clear whether this referred before or after his claiming the title of King of Min ‚Äî he gathered many beautiful women to fill his palace. Lady Cui reacted by taking the most beautiful among the women and imprisoning them, binding them with chains and crafting wooden hands to slap them with. She also often bound her servant girls with ropes, and then whipping them until the ropes would be blood-stained. She also was known for piercing people's faces or arms with iron picks, such that within a single year, 34 people died from her torture. It was said that because of her cruelty, her dreams became haunted by images of her victims, such that she died in distress. (An alternative version of her death had it that she was struck by lightning.) It thus appeared that she predeceased Wang Yanhan, for he was killed by his adoptive brother Wang Yanbing, who captured him after a rebellion and then publicly declared that he and Lady Cui were in concert in poisoning Wang Shenzhi. (The succession table below assumes that she survived past Wang Yanhan's declaration of himself as King of Min, but that she died before his death; perhaps due to the shortness of his reign, he was not recorded to have given her (whether while alive or posthumously) a title as queen.)

Alexander Baumgarten established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as scientia cognitionis sensitivae, the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work Aesthetica (1750). This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of fine arts, beauty and taste only marginally referring to the aesthetics in design, crafts, urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‚Äò90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the aesthetics of nature, everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.  Grounding aesthetics in experience  Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to John Dewey‚Äôs (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature's intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.Dewey, John Art as Experience (New York: Perigee,1934) Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.Updating Dewey‚Äôs pragmatism, Richard Shusterman validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as soma- aesthetics also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992. Pragmatist Aesthetics: Living Beauty, Rethinking Art. Cambridge: Blackwell.  Social dimension of everyday aesthetics  The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by Katya Mandoki who in 1994 coined the word ProsaicsMandoki Katya, Prosaica; introducci√≥n a la est√©tica de lo cotidiano (M√©xico: Grijalbo, 1994) (drawing a distinction from Aristotle‚Äôs PoeticsPoetics (Aristotle) focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in face-to-face and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture (2007)Mandoki Katya, Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), Est√©tica cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I (M√©xico: Siglo XXI editores, 2006, Pr√°cticas est√©ticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II (M√©xico: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), La construcci√≥n est√©tica del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III (M√©xico: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), Est√©tica y comunicaci√≥n; de acci√≥n, pasi√≥n y seducci√≥n (Bogot√°: Norma, 2007), ‚ÄúQuotidian Aesthetics‚Äù New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art.

ISSN 1105-0462. \\"L'esth√©tique du quotidien\\" Diog√®ne 2011/1-2 (n¬∞ 233-234). consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.  Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics  An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.Kupfer Joseph H., Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983) He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study. Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.Katya Mandoki, \\"Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation,\\" in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.Katya Mandoki, La construcci√≥n est√©tica del estado y de la identidad nacional. (Mexico: Siglo veintiuno editores, 2007) Arnold Berleant has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions.Berleant, Arnold Sensibility and Sense; The aesthetic transformation of the human world ( Imprint Academic 2010) For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings.Berleant, Arnold. 1991. Art and Engagement. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades.Arnold Berleant The Aesthetics of Environment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992.

Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.Tuan,Yi‚ÄìFu. Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974) Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.Sartwell, Crispin The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995) Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesoresEyesore that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.Saito, Yuriko. 2008. Everyday Aesthetics. New York: Oxford University Press Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business. Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9. There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio P√©rez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives.P√©rez-Henao, Horacio. ‚ÄúEst√©tica cotidiana y ficci√≥n: el clima como elemento de significaci√≥n en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil‚Äù.

DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.19137/anclajes-2016-2012  Sports and food as art  Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.Best, David. 1988. ‚ÄúThe Aesthetic in Sport,‚Äù in Philosophic Inquiry in Sport, ed.

It was awarded with a badge and certificate, as well as a cash prize. The title of shock worker ('udarnik') had existed at least since the 1930s. See for instance, Lewis H. Siegelbaum, (1998), '\\"Dear Comrade, You Ask What We Need\\": Socialist Paternalism and Soviet Rural \\"Notables\\"' in Slavic Review, Vol. 57, No. 1 (Spring, 1998), pp. 107-132 However, its promotion was developed in the 1950s as part of a competition in honour of the XXI Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to encourage a communist attitude towards work and the creation of the material- technical basis for the development of communism and education towards a communist society. It was also awarded through the Young Communist League. According to Pravda, \\"the main feature of the competition for the title of Shock worker of Communist Labour - as stated in the Salutation of the CPSU Union Conference by participants of the foremost competition teams and Shock worker of Communist Labour - is that it is the organically combined struggle, based on the latest science and technology, to achieve the highest productivity and education of the New Man - the master of the country, which is constantly looking ahead, daring and thoughtful. Tying together the work, learning and life, this contest has an active influence on all aspects of life and human activities, and is an important factor in erasing significant differences between mental and physical labour.\\"Pravda, 28 May 1960, p. 1 The aims of the movement were as follows: # Fight for the new man # Education on the communist attitude toward work # Education on collectivist principles # Increase in professional skills # Combining work and study # Strengthening of labour discipline # Overcoming and improving poor working conditions # Acquisition of related professions # Improvement of product quality # Development of modern technology # Overcoming small proprietors, religion, and other remnants of the capitalist past # Improvement in morale and behaviour # Increased social activity among team members References See also  * Socialist emulation * Stakhanovites Economy of the Soviet Union ","title":"Shock worker of Communist Labour"},{"id":"38558217","text":"Padamudra () is a 1988 Indian Malayalam-language drama film written and directed by R.

Both were commonly used at the end of the nineteenth century to convey the importance of public buildings. The building features arched openings, a prominent cornice, swag and garland decorations, and a roofline balustrade. It is clad in Pompeian red brick. The original facade is dominated by a marble portico, which was removed and stored by previous owners. It was reassembled and conserved as part of the renovation, recapturing the library's original grandeur. The library rotunda is one of the most significant interior spaces in Erie and was meticulously restored as part of the renovation. Mahogany paneling and marble floors serve as a backdrop for a decorative paint scheme. Spectacular allegorical murals on each side of the coffered skylight refer to literature, art, science, and poetry. They were completed by Elmer Ellsworth Garnsey, who also completed murals in the New York Stock Exchange and the Library of Congress.General Services Administration page on the Erie Federal Courthouse and Post Office. Construction The building is a three story rectangular structure with the basement set partially below grade. The basement is clad in granite that rises to the level of the belt course of the first floor window sills. Above that, the first and second floors are clad with light brown Pompeiian brick and articulated with matching brick Corinthian pilasters containing terra cotta capitals. Windows are rectangular fixed light units on the first floor, and round-headed fixed light units on the second floor. The window frames are terra cotta and provide visual contrast with the brick on the facades. Above the second floor is the terra cotta Ionic order entablature, which contains an architrave, a floriated, bracketed frieze set on top of egg & dart moldings, and a decorative cornice embellished with lions' heads. Above the entablature is a terra cotta balustrade, set on a terra cotta plinth.General Services Administration page on the Erie Public Library building. The massing of the building is rectangular, roughly , oriented so that the short dimension faces South Park Row, to the north. The front (north) elevation contains a slight projecting center bay, at the entrance. Until recently (1991-92), a large projecting Ionic Order covered porch highlighted the main public entrance to the building; it was recently found to be structurally unsound, dismantled, and stored on site, pending funding for its eventual restoration. Directly above the main entrance is a terra cotta palladian window, with recessed circular niches and festooned garlands across the head. The east and west sides of the building contain projecting central sections; each is three bays in width. On the east side, the secondary entrance to the building is set in a rusticated granite entrance way with an arched door. The arched window on the second floor, directly above, is also flanked by coffered niches, set in the brick. On the west side, the large window at the stair landing has been infilled with glass block (presumably done as a retrofit at some point in an attempt to relieve the building's occupants of the late afternoon sun glare). =Interior= On the interior of the building, the primary public space is the Main Hall, positioned directly in the center, and designed so that each major room is directly connected. The Main Hall is open at the second floor level (which contains a balcony that connects all the public spaces on the second floor) and is capped with a square laylight above. On the west side, a large wooden stair with a landing provides the primary means of getting between floors. Flanking the Main Hall, in the northwest and northeast corners of the first floor (respectively) are the Fiction Room and Reference Room. These rooms are largely unaltered and contain plastered ceilings and walls, with decorative coffered areas in the ceilings to break up the mass and perceived size of the rooms. These rooms also contain original decorative wood bookshelves, set on wood bases, and capped with decorative wood cornice trim. Directly to the south of the Reference Room is the Small Reference Room, which contains a mezzanine and built-in wood shelves on both levels. To the south of the Main Hall is the Nonfiction Room, which was modified in the 1920s and contains metal shelves and a combination metal shelving/mezzanine structure, with integrated partitions for offices. The primary room on the second floor is the Plavcan Gallery, located in the center of the north side, connecting with the upper part of the Main Hall. The Plavcan Gallery is a large room that contains a vaulted, coffered ceiling with laylights set in the coffers. On the south side of the second floor, two of the offices contain laylights in the ceilings. The basement contains the Children's Library spaces and numerous stack areas; most of the original finishes have been replaced with modern, sound-absorbing, light materials.

This fungus colonizes plant debris in wet coniferous forest floor depressions and shallow pools, and fruits after the pools drain or dry in late summer to early fall in North America (Canada, USA) and Europe. The genus is characterized by smooth, yellowish brown basidiospores lacking a germ pore, and a naucorioid appearance, with brownish mycelium at the base of the stems. Phylogenetically, Stagnicola appeared rather isolated and proved to be closest to Mythicomyces and Mythicomyces was closest to the Psathyrellaceae. In 2019 the two genera were shown to be closely related and placed in a new family, Mythicomycetaceae sister to the Psathyrellaceae. Stagnicola perplexa is considered to be a rare fungus and is on list of rare mushrooms in the Pacific Northwest of the USA and in Europe. Etymology The name Stagnicola refers to colonizing (-cola) of its habitat, stagnant pools. Unfortunately, when the authors coined the name, they were unaware of a genus of snails with the same name, Stagnicola. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature is independent of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and therefore both the snail and mushroom generic names are valid and available.

He is best known as the head chef of restaurant Vue de monde, at Melbourne's Rialto Tower as well as many appearances as a guest judge on the popular cooking show MasterChef Australia. Bennett also owns and operates several other hospitality venues in Melbourne ‚Äì Vue Events at Rialto, The Lui Bar, Bistro Vue, Benny Burger and Caf√© Vue in two locations - and has written six books. He has appeared on a number of Australian food television shows and he is a brand ambassador for Miele and Audi and Nespresso. Biography Bennett was raised in Westmeadows, Victoria. He attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. Together with classmate Curtis Stone, Bennett realised a passion for cooking and he was subsequently introduced to the restaurant trade by his uncle Tom. Bennett completed his apprenticeship at the Grand Hyatt Melbourne before working overseas and then returning to Melbourne to open Vue de monde. Bennett was in a relationship with Australian actress Madeleine West from 2005 to 2018. The couple have six children. Career In 2003, he was awarded Gourmet Traveller Magazine's inaugural Best New Talent title. Bennett relocated the restaurant in 2005 to Melbourne's CBD. Bennett was invited to be the first Australian member of the associations Jeunes Restaurateurs D‚ÄôEurope and Le Grand Tables Du Monde. In 2007 Bennett was a guest chef at New York's Star Chefs Congress. Vue de monde was awarded Restaurant of the Year in The Age Good Food Guide, 2013 and 2014. Bennett's current projects include the complete redevelopment of the Burnham Beeches property while the Vietnamese/French-twist food establishment, \\"Jardin Tan\\" opened in July 2014 in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. Controversy In 2018, Bennett received considerable attention in the media over a series of unpaid bills including the alleged underpayment and overworking of his staff at the Vue-de- Monde restaurant. Further media attention was also given as to his refusal to pay a long outstanding debt over the installation of a $10,000 crayfish tank at his restaurant, although the matter was resolved in early 2018 with details of the settlement hidden within a confidentiality agreement.

The Act made new provisions for: * ensuring a method was available for allowing passengers to communicate with the train's guard, if the train was scheduled to travel more than 20 miles without stopping; * establishing a fine for passengers raising the alarm without due cause (warnings of this fact still routinely appear near train emergency alarms); * removing trees near railway lines that might fall and block the train; * a penalty for trespassing on the railway. Despite the legislation, it was not until 1899 that internal emergency wires came to be used on the majority of trains. The Act also made provision for the construction and working of a railway as a Light Railway, 'subject to such conditions and regulations as the Board of Trade may from time to time impose or make'. Section 28 of the Act laid down maximum permitted axle weights and specified that 'the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a rate of speed exceeding at any time twenty-five miles an hour'.

In India, the species has a peak echolocation frequency of 98 kHz, which helps distinguish it from other Hipposideros species. Range and habitat This species is found in several countries in Asia, including China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also found in India. Conservation As of 2016, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.

When he was twenty-two, Randall moved to Boston, Massachusetts to practice architecture with Asher Benjamin. Randall specialized in railroad buildings, designing many of the structures on the Vermont Central and Rutland & Burlington lines. In 1850, he moved to Syracuse, New York, practicing for another six years. In 1856, he moved west to Chicago, Illinois. There, he focused on designing public buildings such as county courthouses and churches. Major commissions in the Chicago area included University Hall at Northwestern University, Union Park Congregational Church, Eighth Presbyterian Church, and Plymouth Church. He also designed plans for the Theological Seminary of the Northwest and the original University of Saint Mary's of the Lake.

The heavily populated island of And√∏ya lies to the southwest. Bragd√∏ya has been owned by the municipality of Kristiansand since 1969 when they bought it with a government grant as a public open space.

History For centuries, Bragd√∏ya has been inhabited. \\"Siffuord Bragd√∏en\\" is mentioned in written sources as owner from 1610 and onwards. The first manor house in Kristiansand was built in Bragd√∏ya around 1770 for the family of Henrik Arnold Thaulow. Thaulow was the grandfather of Oscar Wergeland, Henrik Wergeland, and Camilla Collett, and his grandchildren spent time on the island during the summers. There are several older cottages on the island. In 1915, two large warehouses were built on the west side of Bragd√∏ya where mackerel was salted and packed for export. The business did not go particularly well, however, and in the interwar period the business was ended.

The lyrics were written by George Atkins and first published in 1819. The traditional tune, Holy Manna, is a pentatonic melody in Ionian mode originally published by William Moore in Columbian Harmony, a four-note shape-note tunebook, in 1829. Like most shape-note songs from that century, it is usually written in three parts. It is commonly sung as the opening song at shape-note singing events. Lyrics The lyrics, from Southern Harmony, are: Brethren, we have met to worship, And adore the Lord our God; Will you pray with all your power, While we try to preach the word? All is vain, unless the Spirit Of the Holy One come down; Brethren, pray, and holy manna Will be showered all around. Brethren, see poor sinners round you, Trembling on the brink of woe; Death is coming, hell is moving; Can you bear to let them go? See our fathers, see our mothers, And our children sinking down; Brethren, pray, and holy manna Will be showered all around. Sisters, will you join and help us? Moses' sisters aided him; Will you help the trembling mourners, Who are struggling hard with sin? Tell them all about the Savior, Tell him that he will be found; Sisters, pray, and holy manna Will be showered all around. Is there here a trembling jailer, Seeking grace and filled with fears? Is there here a weeping Mary, Pouring forth a flood of tears? Brethren, join your cries to help them; Sisters, let your prayers abound; Pray, O! pray, that holy manna May be scattered all around. Let us love our God supremely, Let us love each other too; Let us love and pray for sinners, Till our God makes all things new Then he'll call us home to heaven, At his table we'll sit down.

Secondly the bill proposes to provide for the establishment of closed material procedures (CMP) in relation to certain civil proceedings. Thirdly to prevent the making of court orders for the disclosure of what the government deems to be sensitive information. The Bill was published as a Justice and Security Green Paper on 3 October 2011.http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf It was presented to Parliament on 28 November 2012. It completed its House of Lords Committee stage on 7 February 2013. It had its second reading debate on 18 December 2012, and its third reading and report stage on 7 March 2013. Justice and Security Green Paper On 3 October 2011, Kenneth Clarke the then Justice Secretary at the Ministry of Justice representing the Government, published a Justice and Security Green Paper proposing to make secret procedures available in all types of civil proceedings. The proposal is that, even when the Government is itself involved in proceedings, it should have the power to decide for itself whether to invoke the secret procedure, with only a very limited review by the court. Most secret procedures to date, have been confined to a few specialist types of case, usually immigration, cases involving issues of national security, and control order proceedings involving terror suspects. If the new Green Paper proposals become law, this power will be used not only in cases involving national security, but also in any other case where the Government decides that the disclosure of sensitive material is likely to result in ‚Äòharm to the public interest‚Äô. The controversial Green Paper is now the Justice and Security Bill 2012-13, currently being sponsored through parliament and the Lords by the Rt Hon Lord Wallace of Tankerness, who is also the Government sponsor of the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012. =Closed material procedures= If you are before a court, whether in criminal or civil proceedings, you can see and challenge the other side‚Äôs evidence. In a civil case the judge will give detailed reasons for their decisions, and the whole process will be subject to scrutiny by the public and Press. Closed materials are never shown to the other party, or his lawyers, who are excluded from parts, if not all of the hearing. The Government considers there are some cases where the court can decide the case, without giving the other party any details of the case against him. Those pushing for this radical change to the British justice system are concerned about the dangers arising from the disclosure of sensitive material, also the dangers of non-disclosure of materials involving government accountability. =Public Interest Immunity= The British justice system has a set of rules called public-interest immunity (PII), which is a principle of English common law under which the English courts can grant a court order allowing one litigant to refrain from disclosing evidence to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the public interest. At the extreme, public interest immunity rules may mean that a case cannot be heard at all. This is an exception to the usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings. In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging. It is of note that fewer PII certificates have been issued in recent years. For example, MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining a PII certificate since the 1995 Tomlinson case, and have thus been subject to court scrutiny for investigations such as the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales. In the Crown Prosecution Service v Paul Burrell [2002] ‚Äì A Public Interest Immunity Certificate allowed the prosecution to apply to the judge for a ruling that disclosure of certain information would be harmful to the public interest and should not be made public.MPs criticise Queen over Burrell case ‚Äì The Guardian, Nov 2002 =Special advocates= A submission to Government ministers, from 57 of the 69 current special advocates, states CMP's \\"represent a departure from the foundational principle of natural justice, that all parties are entitled to see and challenge all evidence relied upon before the court, and to combat that evidence by calling evidence of their own\\". The submission states that \\"Government ministers should not be endowed with discretionary powers to extend unfairness and lack of transparency to any proceedings to which they are themselves party\\". Further warning, \\"it would leave Britain with more draconian rules than any other country in the world, more suited to despotic regimes such as Iran and North Korea\\". Barrister Martin Chamberlain, who's worked in secret courts since 2003, describes a system of justice worthy of Franz Kafka, describing Josef K‚Äôs fictional ordeal in The Trial, as closed material procedures in Britain in the 21st century. \\"As a special advocate, you are able to see and hear both the ‚Äòopen‚Äô and ‚Äòclosed‚Äô evidence. But often, the Government witness will refuse to answer particular questions in open court, and the issue will have to be pursued by the special advocate in a closed hearing. But, after seeing the closed material, I am prohibited from speaking to my client. So I will never know if he had an alibi or an innocent explanation and nor will the court\\". Opposition=Right of a fair trial = The right to a fair trial has been defined in numerous regional and international human rights instruments. It is one of the most extensive human rights and all international human rights instruments enshrine it in more than one article. The right to a fair trial is one of the most litigated human rights and substantial case law has been established on the interpretation of this human right. Despite variations in wording and placement of the various fair trial rights, international human rights instrument define the right to a fair trial in broadly the same terms. The aim of the right is to ensure the proper administration of justice. As a minimum the right to fair trial includes the following fair trial rights in civil and criminal proceedings: * the right to be heard by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal * the right to a public hearing * the right to be heard within a reasonable time * the right to counsel * the right to interpretation There are several concerns that the Bill makes no provision whatsoever for recording and reporting on the use of CMPs, nor for any notice to be provided for CMPs, nor is there any provision for closed judgments or materials to be reviewed, or opened when secrecy is no longer required. Also that defendants will not be allowed to be present, or know or challenge the case against them, and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. The governments commitment to open justice and transparency have not been addressed, in spite of the Joint Committee on Human Rights 24th Report (Ch 6) that identified democratic accountability and media freedom as ‚Äúthe missing issue in the Green Paper‚Äù. The bill establishes an unnecessary, unjustifiable regime of secrecy, with the potential to become widespread in cases already beset by secrecy, and in which CMPs would not result in fairer trials. The Bill denies the press and public to know about important matters of public interest. The scope of amendments to the Bill fall well below what the Joint Committee on Human Rights recommendedJoint Committee on Human Rights, (2012), 4th Report: Legislative ScrutinyPublic Bill Committee written evidence Dr Lawrence McNamara (J&S; 01) The Joint Committee on Human Rights also said \\"in all the evidence it had received, apart from that of the Government, the proposals indicate a ‚Äòradical departure‚Äô from ancient principles of ‚Äòopen justice and fairness‚Äô\\". The committee criticised Home Secretary Theresa May for refusing to allow even special advocates to have access to information so they could assess whether secret trials were necessary. Liberal Democrats The issue of CMPs is controversial within the Liberal Democrats, the junior party in the coalition government. A motion put forward by Jo Shaw, former parliamentary candidate for Holborn and St Pancras, to the party's 2012 autumn conference and passed \\"overwhelmingly\\" called upon its MPs to vote against Part 2 of the bill relating to CMPs. Regardless, only seven of the party's then fifty-six MPs voted against the bill's third reading on 4 March 2013, leading to an emergency motion being filed for the party's spring conference the following weekend. The motion was coupled with Shaw's resignation from the party, and was again passed \\"overwhelmingly\\". Along with Shaw, human rights lawyers Dinah Rose and Philippe Sands, and copyright reform activist Cory Doctorow publicly announced their resignations of their party memberships following the bill's vote.http://boingboing.net/2013/03/12/libdems-leave-over-support-for.html = European Convention on Human Rights = Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to a fair trial, an 'implied' right stemming from the 'equality of arms', that hearings should be adversarial and both parties should have access to the same evidence and witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 6 (especially the 'implied' rights) is not an absolute right and that measures restricting the rights of the defense so as to safeguard an important public interest are lawful if \\"strictly necessary\\". On 22 November 2012, by margins of over 100 votes, peers voted to remove ministers‚Äô exclusive right to apply for secret hearings, as a ‚Äòtilting of the balance away from the free individual towards the interest of the state‚Äô, and give judges the discretion in deciding on secret court hearings. Lord Wallace of Tankerness, representing the Government in rejecting the Lords concerns said that ‚Äúat present people assumed the Government settled controversial cases because there had been ‚Äòsome wrongdoing‚Äô whereas in fact it was often that relevant material could not be put before the court‚Äù. = Law Society of England and Wales = The Law Society has repeatedly stated opposition to the use of CMPs to ordinary civil proceedings. The Society contends the Government has failed to present a national security case for jeopardising these fundamental constitutional principles. The Society re-stated this position in a letter jointly signed with General Council of the Bar, to the Minister Without Portfolio, Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP: ‚ÄúClosed Material Procedures depart from an essential principle that all parties are entitled to see and challenge all of the evidence relied upon before the court, and to combat that evidence by evidence of their own. In addition, they undermine the principle that public justice should be dispensed in public, and will weaken fair trial guarantees of equality of arms, which are essential elements of the rule of law‚Äù.Letter reported in The Guardian (2012), Lawyers Challenge Clarke Justice Bill, London: Guardian News Media =International concerns= On 28 February 2013, a group of international organisations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and similar bodies from Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Egypt and Hungary, also expressed similar concerns about the controversial British 'Justice and Security legislation', warning in a joint statement: ‚ÄòIf the UK Parliament passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and within our own justice systems across the world.‚Äô See also * Defamation Bill 2012-13 * Royal Succession Bills and Acts: System of Bill and Act procedures through the UK House of Lords and House of Commons.

It has a frontage of on Fifth Avenue and on the side street. The Italian Renaissance Palazzo-style structure is sheathed entirely in limestone except for a large matching terra cotta cornice and an inner court, square, faced with off-white brick. Unlike nearby buildings, there are no penthouses. Balustrade stringcourses define the division of the base from the body, and the body from the top. Each window above the stringcourse is capped with a pediment or cornice. Panels of escutcheons and light-yellow marble decorate the structure horizontally at four-floor intervals. The lobby walls and ceiling, and hallway walls are made of tan Bottocino marble. The elevators have bronze grilles. Originally, the apartment interiors were decorated with neoclassical and Tudor-Jacobean Revival motifs. Apartments Although the original design called for 18 apartments, the building contained 15 units upon opening, as some of the upper floors were combined into larger units. Floors 5 and 9 have ceiling heights of 11.5 feet, while the remaining have 10.5 feet. The ground floor has roughly 13-foot ceilings. The simplex maisonette on street level is , the duplex maisonette on the side street being exactly the same size.

The upper 4 floors originally contained 3 apartments. The 9th and 10th floors each contain a single apartment roughly , with 2 more simplexes and a duplex on the last 2 floors. There are 2 main elevators for the tenants and 1 service elevator for the staff; also a service stair.http://www.beyondthegildedage.com/2012/09/998-fifth-avenue.html History The building was the first super-luxury apartment house on Fifth Avenue. The architect was given unlimited permission to create whatever was necessary to lure the very wealthy into the building. At the time of its construction, the upper class lived in mansions and townhouses on the Upper East Side. Grand apartments had been built before, but those were occupied by businessmen and the nouveau riche, not the upper crust of American society. During its construction, it was viewed as a remote and unpopular tower that invaded the city's best residential sections. When 998 Fifth Avenue was built, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was much smaller and attracted far fewer people. Among the amenities, the building had were wall safes, storage rooms in the basement and a large number of wood-burning fireplaces, as well as two- foot thick fireproof walls. Unlike the high-class apartment houses on the West Side, this building did not have a name. It was originally, like the vast majority of pre-war buildings, a rental. The rents were much higher compared to all the other buildings in the cityL the largest units were leased for roughly $25,000, while the smaller lower floor units for $10,000‚Äì12,000. Ultimately the building's broker, Douglas Elliman found over 100 prospects and 998 Fifth Avenue rented right away. In 1912, the magazine Architecture called it the most remarkable thing of its kind in America. The fact that so many wealthy people rented apartments signaled the shift from the private houses to luxury buildings. The \\"servant problem\\" (fewer people willing to go into service, especially for the low wages and long hours demanded by middle-class families) and the increasing time spent by the rich outside the city, the automobile and increasing taxes also favored this shift. In less than 20 years since the building's opening, over 90% of the wealthy people in New York lived in apartments. At the time of its opening in 1912, only 5% occupied apartments. The building cost roughly $3 million (including the land). 998 Fifth Avenue was converted to a cooperative in 1953 and is one of the most selective pre-war cooperatives in New York City.\\"998 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028 Building Review\\". CityRealty. Retrieved 2013-06-01. It is thought to be one of the four best apartment houses on the avenue (alongside 820, 834, and 960 Fifth Avenue) and 10 best in the city. The apartments are rarely advertised and sell, depending on square footage or view, for $20 to $40 million.

The name is widely believed to be a variant of Lo-huk: the Cantonese name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lopburi (also known as Lavapura and Louvo), which was a province of the Khmer Empire at the time. However, it has also been suggested that Polo or his sources in China were referring to other locations or conflating several different places as Lochac. Theories regarding Lopburi and the Khmer Empire  Marco Polo may also have used \\"Locach\\" to mean the Khmer Empire in general. One piece of evidence for this is the \\"golden towers\\" that Polo reported in Locach, which were more likely inspired by the golden spires of Angkor Wat, the capital of the Khmer Empire (than the Lopburi of his time). As Zhou Daguan, the ambassador sent by the Yuan court to Cambodia in 1296 commented: ‚ÄúThese [golden towers] are the monuments that have caused merchants from overseas to speak so often of ‚ÄòZhenla [Cambodia] the rich and noble‚Äô.‚Äù The imprisonment of a Mongol emissary by the Khmer ruler Jayavarman VIII in 1281 would have been ample justification for Polo's allegation of the inhumanity of its people. He said that Locach was \\"such a savage place that few people ever go there\\" and that \\"the king himself does not want anyone to go there or to spy out his treasure or the state of his realm\\". Polo also noted an abundance of elephants in Locach; in the Chinese annals, Locach was notable for sending elephants as tribute.Paul Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, p.554, note 2.

The Teisterbant club was the name of an artists' society in Haarlem that flourished between 1950 and 1973. In 1949 the Haarlem writer Godfried Bomans sent out a pamphlet inviting \\"art practitioners, art-lovers and those interested in art\\" to join his new society, which could hold its meetings in the basement of the restaurant \\"Brinkman\\" on the Grote Markt, Haarlem. The name was taken from the pseudonym of Willem Bilderdijk, a Haarlem writer who had believed he was descended from the Teisterbant family of the Duchy of the same name. The capital of medieval Teisterbant was Tiel. Bilderdijk died in the house next door to Brinkman and the facade has a commemorative gable stone to Bilderdijk. At the opening of the club, in March 1950, Bomans's Teisterbant had managed to attract 180 members, among them Lodewijk van Deyssel (who died that year), Mari Andriessen, Harry Mulisch and Anton Heyboer. The club organized literary evenings, film evenings, music evenings and chess competitions. The club was disbanded soon after Bomans died.

H., & Yetton, P. W. (1973). Leadership and decision making. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. Drawing upon literature from the areas of leadership, group decision-making, and procedural fairness, Vroom‚Äôs model predicts the effectiveness of decision-making procedures.Forsyth, D. R. (2009). Group dynamics. New York: Wadsworth. Specifically, Vroom‚Äôs model takes into account the situation and the importance of the decision to determine which of Vroom‚Äôs five decision-making methods will be most effective.Vroom, V. H. (2003). Educating managers for decision making and leadership. Management Decision, 41, 968-978. doi:10.1108/00251740310509490  Decision-making processes  Vroom identified five types of decision-making processes, each varying on degree of participation by the leader. #Decide: The leader makes the decision or solves the problem alone and announces his/her decision to the group. The leader may gather information from members of the group. #Consult (Individually): The leader approaches group members individually and presents them with the problem. The leader records the group member‚Äôs suggestions and makes a decision, deciding whether or not to use the information provided by group members. #Consult (Group): The leader holds a group meeting where he/she presents the problem to the group as a whole. All members are asked to contribute and make suggestions during the meeting. The leader makes his/her decision alone, choosing which information obtained from the group meeting to use or discard. #Facilitate: The leader holds a group meeting where he/she presents the problem to the group as a whole. This differs from consulting approach as the leader ensures that his/her opinions are not given any more weight than those of the group. The decision is made by group consensus, and not solely by the leader. #Delegate: The leader does not actively participate in the decision-making process. Instead, the leader provides resources (e.g., information about the problem) and encouragement.  Situational influence of decision-making  VroomVroom, V. H. (2000). Leadership and the decision- making process. Organizational Dynamics, 28, 82-94. doi:10.1016/S0090-2616(00)00003-6 identified seven situational factors that leaders should consider when choosing a decision-making process. #Decision significance: How will the decision affect the project‚Äôs success, or the organization as a whole? #Importance of commitment: Is it important that team members are committed to the final decision? #Leader‚Äôs expertise: How knowledgeable is the leader in regards to the problem(s) at hand? #Likelihood of commitment: If the leader makes the decision by himself/herself, how committed would the group members be to the decision? #Group support for objectives: To what degree do group members support the leader‚Äôs and organization‚Äôs objectives? #Group expertise: How knowledgeable are the group members in regards to the problem(s) at hand? #Team competence: How well can group members work together to solve the problem? Vroom created a number of matrices which allow leaders to take into consideration these seven situational influences in order to choose the most effective decision-making process.  Application  Vroom‚Äôs normative model of decision-making has been used in a wide array of organizational settings to help leaders select the best decision-making style and also to describe the behaviours of leaders and group members. Further, Vroom‚Äôs model has been applied to research in the areas of gender and leadership style,Eagly, A. H., & Johnson, B. T. (1990). Gender and leadership style: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 2, 233-256. and cultural influences and leadership style.Ayman, R., & Korabik, K. (2010). Leadership: Why gender and culture matter.

Analysis Clete Snell, a criminal justice professor at the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown, said that violence is expected in instances where illegal drugs are involved but that \\"What makes this case unusual is the status of the people involved. Everyone is asking why a kid who seemed to have a bright future would get involved in this sort of thing.\\" Snell said that many young people believe that the sale of illegal drugs is an easy method of generating income. Bruce Perry, a psychiatrist quoted in a Houston Chronicle article, said \\"Whether parents want to believe it or not, most successful dealers are upper-middle-class kids.\\" He added that many young people often grow out of drug dealing and that \\"Parents would rather not hear about some of the real stuff that happens to kids at that age. Usually they go on to become reasonable people.\\" Michael Brick of The Dallas Morning News said that the murder \\"reveals a quietly thriving corner of the drug trade, a casual open secret among educated young men and women in dorms, condos and nightclubs. Driven by heightened border security, advanced growing techniques and a national decriminalization movement, entrepreneurial young marijuana distributors are establishing their own domestic networks apart from the notorious cartels of Mexico and prison gangs of the American Southwest.

The name Dagshai, according to a popular local legend was derived from Daag-e-Shahi. During the Moghul times a Daag-e-Shahi (royal mark) was put on the forehead of the criminals and sent packing to the then Dagshai village. This can also be seen on a rock edict in the school premises. The closest railway station is Kumarhatti located some 2 kilometers from Dagshai. Trains from and to Kalka operate on this track between Kalka and Shimla. History The first batch of school had 78 boys and 11 girls. Here new students are admitted from classes 5th-12th grade on the basis of a written examination held all over India in Army schools. The school prepares the students of Class X for All India Secondary School Examination and those of Class-XII for the All India Senior Secondary School Examination. The principal of the School is Dr Sanjay Mishra. The school has constantly figured in the lists of best residential schools in India, owing to its discipline, low cost of education and the dedication of its students and teachers to be the best in educational as well as sports fields. The school is currently ranked 9th in the list of best boarding schools for its quality of education amongst others. A lot of students form this school have gone on to achieve great success in their lives and have also been known to serve their nation in the armed forces as officers such as Late Maj Udai Singh, SC, SM. The school has a history of producing great leaders for the Indian Defence Forces as they go through a strict Army routine and maintain good physical standard. The current and old students of this school are called dapsians. Dapsians are known to help each other even when out of school in all fields. Present day The Army Public School, Dagshai, occupies an estate covering 40 acres of the Dagshai hills, at an altitude of some 2100 metres above sea level. It is a member of the Indian Public Schools Conference (IPSC) and is actively involved in competitions organised by it such as sports and educational. The school honors its original purpose by continuing to offer a reduction in fees for the children of military families. About seventy percent of the boarders are the sons and daughters of military personnel and its pupils. Its annual Founder's Day i.e. 1 June is celebrated with much fanfare amongst its students as well an old dapsians. A significant number of school-leavers continue to join the armed forces but there has been a decline in this tradition recently with a lot of students going for the civil way of life rather than the armed one. Dapsians are divided into five houses called Tagore, Nehru, Patel, Subhash and Indira all named after Indian freedom fighters or prominent Indians. Indira house is for girls while Subhash house is for younger boys of 5th and 6th standard. The other three houses have students from 7th to 12th standard who compete with each other at activities such as Sports, cross country running, athletics and debating. These inter-house competitions are intense as each house wants to be the best and win the trophies meant for these competitions. But in case of inter-school competitions, students from each house combine to form the best team and represent their school as a whole. Trophies and other accolades won by the students are given to them on founders day i.e. 1 June each year. The founders day is a big affair in the school calendar as it is attended by some high ranking Indian Army officials as well as its alumni and students. Together with some other leading Indian schools, including the Delhi Public SChool, R.K.

Biography In 1857, he studied architecture and perspective at the Accademia of Fine Arts of Bologna, under Francesco Cocchi. For a few years, worked as a scenographer for a number of theaters, including the Teatro Apollo of Rome. In 1867, he became professor at the Royal Institute of Fine Arts of Bologna. He was also a Consigliere municipale and inspector of archeology (scavi) and monuments. In Bologna, he labored in scenography for the Teatro Comunale, and sent his pupils to study the art as it was practiced in Vienna and Monaco, specially Wagnerian works. He helped design theaters in Bologna and Sinigaglia. He helped design a new cemetery or Camposanto for Sinigaglia.

His submission for the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II in Rome, won only second prize. While he garnered the first prize for the monument to those Fallen during the Five Days of Milan, his design for the monument was not pursued.

Life and career  Torrance was brought up in Edinburgh, Scotland where he attended Leith Academy. He matriculated to the University of Aberdeen receiving a degree in psychology and went on to study journalism at Cardiff University‚Äôs School of Journalism. Torrance began his career as a reporter for the Edinburgh Evening News from 2000 to 2001. He soon moved into television to present and produce The Week in Politics for Grampian. Torrance stayed on as the Scottish Parliamentary reporter when the programme was taken over by Scottish Television (STV) and retitled Politics Now in 2004. Torrance briefly took a break from his television commitments to work as Parliamentary Aide to the Shadow Scottish Secretary David Mundell at the House of Commons. From 2007, he has regularly appeared on the BBC and BBC Radio Scotland reporting and commenting on the state of Scottish Politics within the larger context of the UK. Torrance later worked for the UK Parliament assisting in editing online and written content. In 2014, he returned to Edinburgh to report on that year's Scottish independence referendum.  Writings  In 2006, Torrance wrote his first work The Scottish Secretaries following the history of those men who served as chief minister in charge of the Scottish Office in the UK government from 1885 onward. The book has been followed by a number of unofficial political biographies and histories most notably on George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie, David Steel, Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher's relationship with Scotland during her political career. Torrance's work has largely focused on current and historical Scottish politics with an occasional divergence into non-political subject matters.

He was a member of bands led by Jiver Hutchinson, Johnny Dankworth, and Joe Harriott. Biography Frank Holder was born in 1925 in Georgetown, Guyana, and served in the Royal Air Force. He sang in forces groups at RAF Cranwell, including a band led by Geoff Head. Holder played with bands led by Andre Messeder and John Carioca in the late 1940s, appearing with the latter at Churchill's Club in London. He also performed at the Feldman Swing Club (100 Club) in London, owned by the Feldman brothers. Holder recalls, \\"At Feldman's, a black man would be accepted when you couldn't appear at clubs like the Mayfair or Embassy. Black guys like Coleridge Goode and Ray Ellington were welcome, and all that mattered to Robert and Monty Feldman was that you were a musician\\". He occasionally worked in those early days with Victor Feldman. Holder recorded early in his career for Parlophone, Decca, and London Records. He is perhaps best known for his work in the early 1950s with the Dankworth Seven led by John Dankworth, which often topped the Melody Maker Jazz Charts. Holder is also regarded as one of the leading black UK jazz musicians to emerge from the mid-1940s' swing dance band movement, having got his big break with a band led by Jiver Hutchinson after World War II. In the late 1940s Holder worked with trumpeter Kenny Baker. Highlights from Holder's Dankworth days include an appearance at the Royal Albert Hall on the same bill as Nat King Cole. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Holder toured, recorded, and performed with Ronnie Scott, Tubby Hayes, Don Rendell, Peter King, Dickie Hawdon, Eddie Harvey, Jack Fallon, Harry Beckett, Bill Le Sage, Shake Keane, Ronnie Ross, Coleridge Goode, Hank Shaw, Tony Kinsey, and songwriter Duncan Lamont. He was active in the postwar Latin music scene, including working with the Deniz Brothers. Holder was represented during the 1950s by theatre impresario Bernard Delfont and Harold Davison. In the middle of the decade, he was approached by British jazz record producer Denis Preston to record calypso music. Holder's records were issued by Pye. In the late 1950s, Kenny Graham and His Orchestra recorded with Holder for Decca. Other recordings from this period include sessions for Cab Kaye and a film soundtrack single release called \\"Nor the Moon by Night\\" with conductor and arranger Ron Goodwin for Parlophone. Goodwin was working closely with producer George Martin, who was also involved with Parlophone. In 1959, he contributed percussion to the Joe Harriott album Southern Horizons (1960). Holder worked with drummer Phil Seamen. In the mid-1960s, Holder recorded with Ethiopian musician Mulatu Astatke. Holder branched out into variety and cabaret performances, appearing in many countries and at London venues such as the London Palladium, Lyceum, and Paramount. He often gave his time to charity fund raising events. Later bills were shared with Bill Haley and his Comets, Guy Mitchell, and Johnnie Ray. In 1963, he appeared at the National Jazz and Blues Festival at Richmond. In 1964, he was comp√®re for the BBC One series Carnival, working with Ginger Johnson, Carmen Munroe, and Geoff Love with his Orchestra. In that year he also performed for Peter Sellers and Britt Ekland for their wedding party at the Tiberio Restaurant Mayfair. In 1966, Holder appeared with the BBC Radio Orchestra and in the following year recorded with John Dankworth featuring the actress singer Nadia Cattouse. In 1972, Holder was one of the winners of the Castlebar Song Contest for the folk ballad \\"Song for Jenny\\" composed by Sheila Roberts. In 1974, Holder was invited to sing with the Scottish Symphony Orchestra at a Royal Albert Hall Promenade Concert with soprano Margaret Gale and the BBC Chorus. In 1990 he appeared with the BBC Big Band at Fairfield Halls, Croydon. In 1991 he played congas and bongos on an album by Barbara Thompson's band Paraphernalia entitled Breathless. In 1996, he performed as a guest on guitarist Eduardo Niebla's album I Can Fly Now, playing both congas and bongos. He has been a member of the UK Latin jazz band Paz and was featured on the band's album Samba Samba (1997) with drummer Chris Dagley. In 2003 he was a guest on the album Cleo Laine and Laurie Holloway, Loesser Genius, with John Dankworth. Performances followed with Steve Waterman's album Our Delight: A Jazz Odyssey in 2006. Holder also worked with Mornington Lockett and Dave O'Higgins. O'Higgins appeared on Holder's album Ballads Blues at Bop. Pete Long featured Holder in his Gillespiana Be-Bop Orchestra, a band that paid tribute to the music of Dizzy Gillespie. In 2010, Holder did a double bill at Ronnie Scott's with vocalist Juliet Kelly. He has worked with arranger Nick Ingman and the Fraser-Myers Big Band and for Carlin Music for Paul Williams. In 2011, Holder performed at the gala jazz event \\"A Tribute to John Dankworth and the Big Band\\" at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The sax section included Tim Garland, Jamie Talbot, and Andy Panayi. In 2012, Holder teamed up with guitarist Shane Hill to record his final album Interpretations featuring Peter King on alto, Dick Pearce on Flugel, Val Manix bass and Noel Joyce kit - well received by the jazz media it brought Holder back into the limelight. Later in 2012 he was interviewed by Clemency Burton Hill and appeared as a result of this interview in a BBC Two Culture Show documentary called Swinging into the Blitz, a program exploring the history of black music in the UK beginning in the 1930s. Burton Hill cited Holder as a connection to the early swing musicians such as Ken Snakehips Johnson and Leslie\\" Jiver\\" Hutchinson. The documentary was commissioned by the BBC to contextualise the black music scene explored in the Stephen Poliakoff television drama Dancing on the Edge that portrayed a fictional successful black band leader called Louis Lester. Holder has appeared with Pat Smythe, Tony Lee, John Critchinson, David Newton, Neville Dickie, Jonathan Gee, Malcolm Edmonstone, Michael Garrick and Geoff Castle. In 2012, Holder performed with pianist Derek Paravicini in a show dedicated to the music of George Shearing. Former Blue Mink member and Watermill Jazz Club founder Ann Odell was music director and arranger for the show. Lady Shearing endorsed the show. Other guitarists Holder has appeared or recorded with include: Acoustic Alchemy founder member Simon James, Adam Salkeld, and Jim Mullen. Until the age of 92, Holder was still performing around London. In 2013, Holder was featured in the annual vocal summit of the London Jazz Festival with Joe Stilgoe and Theo Jackson. The event represented three generations of UK based jazz singers. Holder has also shared his approach to singing and voice preservation in an article for The Voice Council Magazine in the April 2014 edition. Holder has also often performed at The Stables in Wavendon with the Dankworth family for their Christmas music parties and working with Mark Nightingale and trumpeter Guy Barker. His band often includes Stan Robinson on tenor saxophone. A keen sportsman, Holder played cricket with Gary Sobers and Wes Hall for charity events. As a young man he was a boxer and sprinter. He was a cousin of actor Ram John Holder. Holder died in Carshalton, Surrey, England on 29 October 2017.

The song was written during a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania stop on an Almanac Singers' tour; both Seeger and Guthrie were members of the band at this time. The song speaks of the labor and environmental problems that the city was facing in 1941, when the song was written. In the time since, environmental legislation has reduced the pollution problem that plagued Pittsburgh; because of this, the song's mentions of pollution in Pittsburgh have been sometimes been replaced with verses extolling the city. Creation There are several stories behind the origin of the song. Several historians trace \\"Pittsburgh Town\\" to the Almanac Singers' 1941 national tour. According to the liner notes of Pete Seeger's American Industrial Ballads, originally released in 1956, on July 7, 1941, the group recorded fourteen songs for a small record label in New Jersey. The $250 that they were paid was used to purchase a 1932 Buick in which they traveled on their subsequent tour. While stopped in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the group decided to play for steel workers who were in the process of unionizing. They played two nights of concerts in a steel patch, spending the night there in a cockroach-infested hotel. During the second concert, Woody Guthrie impulsively started to improvise lyrics to the tune of the folk song \\"Crawdad Hole\\". The song's entire body came out of this jam session. Millard Lampell continued improving and created the second verse of the song from that point. The liner notes of Seeger's Songs of Struggle and Protest, 1930‚Äì50 tell a different story of the song's creation; they state that Guthrie wrote the song while airborne on a flight into Pittsburgh. While looking out the window at the smoky skies, he quickly jotted down the lyrics. Lyrics and themes The song's verses alternate between ones that speak of the environmental problems of Pittsburgh and ones that speak of its labor problems. The first verse refers to Pittsburgh as a \\"smoky ol' town\\", and the third complains that the speaker does nothing more than \\"cough and choke\\" because of the steel industry's output. The smoke was an ever-present part of life in Pittsburgh at the time of the song's writing; steel mills on the banks of the city's three rivers made the sky glow red and continually released smoke. Modern environmentalist reviewers of the song believe that the pollution-oriented verses show that the song was written to protest the environmental conditions in which workers were forced to live. The second and fourth verses focus on the labor disputes that the city was experiencing at the time. The second verse uses a pun on the name of Jones and Laughlin Steel to ask what the company stole from its workers (\\"What did Jones and Laughlin steal?\\"), while the fourth and final verse ends with the statement that all of the mill workers are \\"joining up with the CIO.\\" Recordings and adaptations The song has been covered by several artists and community groups. Pete Seeger Released a studio version on his 1956 album American Industrial Ballads and a live version of the song on his 1964 album Songs of Struggle and Protest, 1930‚Äì50. Both versions by Seeger feature him singing and playing the banjo without any additional accompaniment. In the live version, the crowd's clapping and singing along can be heard. Folk bands in the Pittsburgh area, such as the NewLanders, have both recorded and performed Seeger's version of the song. Composer Paul Hindemith's Pittsburgh Symphony, written in 1958 for the 200th anniversary of the city's founding, quotes the melody of Pittsburgh Town, named \\"Pittsburgh Is a Great Old Town\\" by the composer, in the final movement. Gunther Schuller described the use of the tune in the symphony in his review as \\"the ultimate in paucity of imagination and tastelessness.\\" quoting However, Stephen Luttmann felt that Schuller's criticism misses the point of why Hindemith decided to the motif. In 1959, Vivien Richman released an adaptation of the song on her album Vivien Richman Sings Folk Songs of West Pennsylvania; her version of the song includes several additional verses about the landscape and geography of the region. The song has also been covered by students at Pittsburgh Public Schools, using verses that are less political than the original Guthrie composition and closer to the Richman version than the Seeger version. The change in verses was partly because by the middle of the 1950s, enforcement of the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 cleaned up the air. Lyrics about the smokiness of the town were replaced with the line \\"Pittsburgh Town is a Great Old Town.\\" References=FootnotesBibliography=        External links American folk songs History of Pittsburgh Music of Pittsburgh Pete Seeger songs Protest songs Woody Guthrie songs ","title":"Pittsburgh Town"},{"id":"38559197","text":"In Mathematics, the Mashreghi‚ÄìRansford inequality is a bound on the growth rate of certain sequences.

During the War of 1812 she received a letter of marque. The Royal Navy captured her on 5 February 1814 and took her into service as HMS Grecian. She was sold in 1822. In 1823 she became a merchantman. In 1824 the Chilean Navy captured her, but she escaped, and thereafter may have served for a time as a Spanish privateer. After the end of the Peruvian War of Independence she apparently returned to more conventional pursuits and was probably lost in 1829 though she was still listed in 1830 as sailing between London and Lima. American service Thomas Kemp of Baltimore designed Grecian with several innovations. She was pierced for 20 guns, though she never carried that many, and her gunports were unique, designed perhaps to save weight. She had a long, curving stem, and a shallow, less convex bow. Grecians first captain was James Phillips, and under him she had made one voyage to France. She received letter of marque No. 944 in December 1813, under Captain Knapp. She had not captured anything before the boats of cut her out under the guns of a battery field pieces on East River, in Chesapeake Bay on 2 May 1814. The British cutting out party under Lieutenant West, first lieutenant of Jaseur, rowed up silently in the night, drove Knapp and the seven members of the crew on watch below deck, fastened the hatches, cut her cables, and sailed off. Royal Navy service The British commissioned her as HMS Grecian under the command of Lieutenant Henry Jewry. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Grecian was deployed on anti- smuggling duties in the Channel. On 14 March 1816 Grecian captured the smuggling vessel Betsey. Then a month later, on 18 April, Grecian was in company with the schooner when they captured the smuggling vessel Nancy. In May, Grecian captured three smuggling vessels. Then on 11 and 20 May she captured Active and Market Maid, of Hastings. The last day of May saw Grecian capture Po. On 30 July Grecian captured Ox, followed on 26 August with the capture of the Three Sisters. Lastly, on 6 December Grecian retrieved 84 kegs of contraband spirits from the sea. On 3 May 1818 Grecian captured the smuggling lugger Fly. On 18 August 1818 Lieutenant Nathaniel Martin was appointed captain of Grecian.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p. 169. Between 30 August 1819 and 20 January 1820, Grecian made several small captures. Grecian made further sundry small captures on 16 May 1820, 27 March 1821, 20 April, 6 May, and 2 August. Disposal She was paid off in 1821. The Admiralty put Grecian up for sale in April 1822 at Portsmouth. She was sold to Joshua Crystall for ¬£510 on 18 April 1822.

A Czech translation by Jitka Sloupova ran in Prague from 2016-2019 at Divadlo Na Jezerce and starred Milan K≈àa≈æko. The play focuses on a Jewish actor named Jon Davies, who is featured as Shylock in a production of Shakespeare‚Äôs The Merchant of Venice. Jon addresses his audience at a ‚Äútalk back‚Äù session, after the play is closed abruptly due to controversy over the play‚Äôs alleged antisemitism. Davies is portrayed both in and out of character, presenting and stripping down the layers between character and actor. Background In the comedy The Merchant of Venice, the character of Shylock lends a fellow merchant money.Lefkowitz, David. ‚ÄúSatirical ‚ÄòShylock‚Äô Opens Feb. 25 at PA‚Äôs Walnut‚Äù. Playbill Inc. 25 February 1998. Retrieved January 19, 2013. The merchant‚Äôs ships sink, yet despite this loss, Shylock demands his money back. His defiant nature supposedly stems from a desire to avenge the unfair treatment of his Jewish people by Christians. Shylock is ultimately humiliated by the Christian court, his daughter disobeys him and marries out of race, and he is swindled out of his bond and forced to convert. At the time it was written, in 16th-century Venice, Jewish citizens were locked in the ghetto at nighttime and were forced to wear identifying hats during the day.Woodend, Dorothy. ‚ÄúSympathy for Shylock‚Äù.

Retrieved January 19, 2013. =Plot= Actor Jon Davies asserts that Shakespeare intended the character of Shylock to be played as a villain in The Merchant of Venice based on the attitudes towards Jews during the era he was writing.

His portrayal of the character as a villain causes drastic upset amongst audience members, a professor going so far as to spit at Davies. The professor, who is herself Jewish, disagrees with his views and calls him a ‚Äútraitor to his race‚Äù after opening night, publishing a harsh review and organizing a boycott. Due to the uproar the play‚Äôs run gets cut short and a frustrated Davies is forced to confront his last audience.Barefoot, Darren. ‚ÄúShylock‚Äù. Geist: North of America. Metro Publisher. 2013. Retrieved January 19, 2013. He comes out in full costume, make-up, and prosthetics, and strips off the character layer by layer as he speaks, until he stands before the audience to be judged as himself. Davies, a well-educated thespian, clarifies that Shylock was met with antagonism not because of outrage at his portrayal, but because of his recognized status as villain of the play. Davies argues that art and theatre should be provocative and challenging, regardless of potentially offensive or uncomfortable subjects. Themes The play addresses questions surrounding the diverse nature of art, the role and duties of the artist and the theatre in regards to audience reaction and critical response. Jon decides to play Shylock not as a victim, but as a villain, causing conflict due to his own Jewish heritage and his layered portrayal of Shylock‚Äôs character. Questions of historical revisionism, cultural manipulation, and political correctness lead to accusations of racism and of Jon as a ‚Äúself- hating Jew‚Äù, forcing him to reassess his interpretation of the character as an actor, as well as his own persona.Kopfinger, Stephen. ‚ÄúShylock has his day on stage at Stahr‚Äù.

July 1893) was a seaman and lighthouse- keeper in South Australia who is remembered as a hero of the wreck of the steamship Admella. History Ben arrived in South Australia on 22 April 1837 with his two brothers John and Samuel, John's wife Olinda (n√©e Gover), his sister Thirza Elizabeth and her husband William Doddridge aboard the South Australian from Portsmouth. Their father John Germein sen. (c. 1786 - 23 April 1869) arrived in the Java in 1840. As soon as the Port was settled, Captain Quin was appointed pilot and the Germein brothers were his crew, all of whom were afterwards made pilots. Ben proved a remarkably clever pilot and was known for his ability to manoeuvre vessels under canvas. He was the first person to sail a ship under full sail the length of the Port River. He commanded the s.s. Corio between Port Elliot and Goolwa for River Murray Steam Navigation Company multiple times during 1857 until she foundered at the Murray mouth and the company disposed of her. Later he was chosen as master of the Government schooner Yatala, where he distinguished himself on several occasions, and became acquainted with every small corner of South Australia's coastline. Lighthouse keeper Afterwards Germein was chosen for the McDonnell harbormastership, being also in charge of the lighthouse on Cape Northumberland, in company with Captain John Dagwell, who afterward became harbormaster at Glenelg. =Wreck of the Admella= On Saturday, 6 August 1859, the ship Admella (see main article) struck a reef, the third of a series off Cape Northumberland and a mile off shore. Germein was alerted to the fact two days later when two of its sailors, John Leach and Robert Knapman, arrived at the lighthouse in a pitiful state. They had made their way to shore in an improvised raft in order to raise the alarm. Germein made his way to Donald Black's nearby farm, where he borrowed a horse and set off to ride the 16 km to Mount Gambier to summon assistance. He was, however, thrown from the horse and young Mr. Black completed the journey, and by 3.15pm had telegraphed the news to Adelaide and Portland, Victoria, and returned the same evening with a trooper. Many accounts have Germein riding the full distance alone on his own horse. Germein later was instrumental in rescuing three men from the wreck, in one of Admella's lifeboats they had patched up. A fourth, a passenger identified only as a \\"German pedlar\\", was drowned when the boat overturned in the breakers. =Wreck of the John Ormerod= The brig John Ormerod left Adelaide with a cargo of flour for Sydney on 21 October 1861 and was hit by a squall 20 miles south of Cape Northumberland and capsized in heavy seas. Captain Thomas J. Sevier ordered the mainmast cut away and the ship righted. In the process, the mate was swept into the sea and the steward, who was in the cabin, drowned. The captain ordered the men to lash themselves to the deck, but few obeyed and all were lost overboard except the captain and two men, Edward Lennon and Alexander Munro. Ben Germein observed the stricken vessel and intercepted her in the lighthouse's new five-oared lifeboat (which had been delivered the previous day), and with Dagwell and crew rescued the three men. The following day they again went out to the John Ormerod, anchored the drifting vessel and recovered the body of the steward. He was later reported as having lost several fingers in rescuing Captain Sevier, of which there was no mention in contemporary reports, though Captain Sevier did suffer a crushed thumb. There were also reports of the lifeboat being inadequate, a claim which was hotly refuted. Return to the sea Germein remained in charge of the light house, but relations with his subordinate became strained and he was transferred to the Troubridge lighthouse around the beginning of 1866. In October 1866 he resigned the lighthouse service and successfully applied for renewal of his pilot's licence. It would appear his love of variety had induced him to rejoin the pilot service, of which he was one of the smartest members in days of old, when the principal duties were to boxhaul sailing vessels about. When the pilot's duty changed from sail to steam, Ben Germein lost his sympathy with the service. He felt that \\"any dredge master or hopper skipper could navigate the river in a steamer, when it wanted a smart fellow to work up a big sailing craft\\" Last days In later years he joined the harbor pilot service, but wanderlust would take hold of him and he would disappear for days or weeks at a time. In March 1880 he took the cutter Albatross from Port Adelaide and spent six weeks cruising around Port Lincoln, the Sir Joseph Banks Group and the Althorpes until Captain Charles Ward Poynter (died 1916) Poynter was, by all accounts, a brave man and a strong swimmer, on at least four occasions saving boys from drowning. of The Semaphore intercepted him in the steamer Lubra and persuaded him to return home. In February 1891 he left a suicide note at his home but he was found unharmed at Shell Creek near St.Kilda. On 3 July 1893 he disappeared and his absence was reported to the police in August. After a number of search parties failed to find any trace, the water police found his badly decomposed body washed up among the mangroves near Bog Creek in a condition that indicated suicide. Family His brother Samuel Germein (c. 1818 ‚Äì 13 August 1886) was equally notable, being the first pilot contracted by George Fife Angas and David McLaren for the South Australian Company, and who discovered Port Germein and Port Pirie, both being named for him (Port Pirie being originally named Samuel's Creek). Sam was the first skipper of the Government cutter Water Witch. He was married to Mary Ann (c. 1828 - 28 September 1913). A sister, Thirza Elizabeth (c. 1809 ‚Äì 15 November 1881), married blacksmith William Doddridge (c. 1807 ‚Äì 17 July 1867), lived at Angaston. A sister Eliza married John Nathaniel Wills (c. 1813 ‚Äì 14 March 1873), of H.M. Customs. His brother John Germein (1847 ‚Äì 13 September 1928) married Alice Amy Hodge (1855 ‚Äì 11 August 1922). A daughter Pearl Alice Irene Germein married Claude Augustus Sprigg (1889 ‚Äì 23 May 1972) on 17 September 1913. Their youngest son was the renowned geologist Reg Sprigg. Benjamin married Elizabeth Coulam Heanes (c. 1832 ‚Äì 17 July 1888). Among their children was a son, also named Benjamin Germein (c. 1860 ‚Äì 31 May 1932), a customs officer, who married (1) Eliza Amy Boys (c. 1861 ‚Äì 13 August 1904) on 14 March 1889, (2) Margaret Blyth (c. 1862 ‚Äì 10 January 1913).

It was one of the most successful African-American newspapers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Founded in St. Paul, Minnesota, it was published in six separate editions in cities across the United States at the height of its popularity. In 1889 the newspaper changed its name to The Appeal to reflect its expanded geographic scope. History=Background and foundation= In 1885 there were less than 1500 African-American residents in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area. African-American newspapers were common at the time, but few of them lasted longer than a year, since they were started for cultural purposes more than commercial ones. There had been many previous African-American newspapers in St. Paul, including one printed in 1876 also named the Western Appeal. It had no affiliation with the paper established in 1885. The Western Appeal was first published on June 5, 1885, in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was started by Samuel E. Hardy and John T. Burgett with Frederick Douglass Parker, who also served as the newspaper's first editor. It was a weekly paper, with an edition each Friday containing news, editorials, advertisements, and a literary page. Subscription rates were affordable, only two dollars a year, but the paper was already struggling financially by the end of 1886. =Early years= In December 1886, Parker resigned as editor and a new management team took over. Prominent St. Paul businessmen Thomas H. Lyles and James Kidd Hilyard led the team and put their own money into the paper to save it. In February 1887, the team reorganized under the name Northwestern Printing Company. It provided job order printing services in addition to publishing the Western Appeal, which kept the paper afloat financially over the long term. Lyles and Hilyard initially convinced Parker to return to the Western Appeal as editor. But by January 1887, Parker had resigned again to take another position. Lyles and Hilyard then promoted associate editor John Quincy Adams to editor. Adams had been editor of a similar newspaper, the Bulletin, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had moved to St. Paul in 1886 at the request of Lyles and Hilyard to work at the Western Appeal. With his promotion, Adams became the driving force behind the newspaper. Adams was an influential writer and a staunch Republican, and like other editors of his day, he expressed his opinions through his paper's editorial page. The Western Appeal even received funding directly from the Republican Party, another common practice for newspapers of the time. =Expansion and name change= In January 1888, Adams opened a regional office for the paper in Chicago. His brother, Cyrus Field Adams, ran it. This brought the Western Appeal to even more readers. Other regional offices followed: Louisville in August 1888, St. Louis in April 1889, Dallas in August 1892, and Washington, D.C. in March 1901. Each Saturday, each of these offices published an edition of the newspaper. Each edition had the same national news, feature articles, and editorials, but carried its own local and social news. The word \\"Western\\" was dropped from the paper's name in 1889, to reflect its national reach. By this time, Adams owned The Appeal outright and supervised both its business and editorial sides. Like other papers of its time, The Appeal served as a community organizer. It was a place for African Americans to express their frustrations, find common ground, and call for action. After 1900, with the growth of African-American civil rights organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Urban League, the influence and importance of newspapers like The Appeal began to decline. =Later years= As the twentieth century progressed, The Appeal slowly got smaller and closed its regional offices. Its last regional office, Chicago, closed in 1913. The Appeal continued publication in St. Paul, and Adams remained its editor until his death on September 3, 1922. Adams's son, John Jr, took over The Appeal and hired a young graduate student, Roy Wilkins, as editor in April 1923. The newspaper struggled, however, and it was sold to a competitor, the Northwestern Bulletin, later that year. The two papers were merged and published as the Northwestern Bulletin-Appeal for several years, until that company went out of business in 1925.

It is the first spar to be located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Design The Aasta Hansteen platform is a truss spar type allowing condensate to be stored in the hull below sea level and offloaded to a shuttle tanker. The produced gas is exported to the shore with steel catenary risers (SCR). The production risers are also SCRs, with these being the first time SCRs have been used in the Norwegian Sea. The spar hull was designed by Technip, with the topsides being designed by CB&I;, with both being fabricated by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea before being transported to Norway for installation. Once on site it was partially submerged by filling ballast tanks to 177 m and anchored to the seabed, leaving only the top 21 m above the surface. The seabed moorings are primarily made of cut resistant polyester and steel chain. At a height of 198 m (of which 177 m will be submerged) and a diameter of 50 m it is the biggest spar platform hull ever built in terms of diameter and displacement. The spar The Aasta Hansteen spar exports the natural gas from the field through the Polarled pipeline to the Nyhamna processing plant on the Norwegian coast. The project cost approximately 37.5 billion NOK.  Transport and installation  The Aasta Hansteen spar was built on its side in the dry dock on barges. Once built it was floated off the barges and then floated onto the heavy transport ship Dockwise Vanguard and shipped to a fjord near Stord in Western Norway. The spar was upended in the fjord, after which the topsides were installed using the floatover technique. It was then towed vertically to the Aasta Hansteen gas field 300 km off Bod√∏ at the northwest coast of Norway. The spar will be moored north of the Arctic Circle using polyester moorings to the seabed 1200m below. The Aasta Hansteen began producing on 17 December 2018. Aasta Hansteen gas field Originally called the Luva gas field and later renamed after Aasta Hansteen, it was discovered in 1997 approximately 300 km off the coast of Norway. During start up of the platform, the production from the surrounding Luva, Haklang and Snefrid gas fields will be exported to the platform. Future fields already discovered are planned to be tied back to the Aasta Hansteen platform through SCRs. Future expansion of additional risers and topsides facility are built-in in the design of the platform.

Reverend Sergeant was a graduate of Yale, who became an ordained Puritan minister.Jones, p. 76. He helped establish a day school at what became Stockbridge, and laid the groundwork for a boarding school, before his early death.  Early life  John was born in 1710 to Jonathan and Mary Sergeant, in Newark, New Jersey. His father died while he was still young, and his mother married Colonel John Cooper, who raised him. Due to a farming accident, he was left unable to move his left hand, which consequently led him to seek a career in academia, as opposed to following in the footsteps of his father, and stepfather, as a farmer.Jones, p. 77. He enrolled at Yale in 1725, and graduated as valedictorian in 1729, and his valedictory speech has since been published. In September 1731, he was appointed as a tutor and was described as \\"one of the most successful holders of that office in the early history of the College\\", serving through 1735.Dexter, p. 395. He earned a second bachelor's degree from Yale, in theology, in 1732, while continuing to serve as a tutor.  Missionary life = Establishing the mission = In 1734, the Reverend Samuel Hopkins, having heard of Chief Konkapot's well-known good character and disposition towards Christianity, decided to meet with John Stoddard, an authority on the local Native Americans, on the subject of a possible mission to the so-called \\"River Indians\\" living near the Housatonic River. With encouragement from Stoddard, he informed the Reverend Stephen Williams, and, together, they asked the Reverend William Williams to write to the Commissioners for Indian Affairs in Boston. The commissioners recommended a trip to consult with the Native Americans there regarding the possibility of a missionary being installed to live among them. When they consented, Jonathan Belcher and the commissioners authorized the mission on August 16, 1734, granting a salary of 100 pounds per year for a minister. Hopkins already had John Sergeant in mind as the ideal candidate, as he had privately expressed that he would rather work among the natives than the English.Hopkins, pp. 15‚Äì19. In September 1734, Stephen Williams and Nehemiah Bull approached Sergeant at Yale with the proposal. Sergeant agreed, on the condition he could spend half the first year at Yale, to be able to see his students through their final year, and then devote himself entirely. On October 8, he set off for Nehemiah Bull's house, who accompanied him to the settlement, in order to introduce him. They arrived on October 12, and announced their desire for a meeting the following day. = Early years = John preached his first sermon to about 20 adults. Being that he was not yet ordained, Bull baptized the first native, an interpreter with an already advanced grasp of English and Christianity, afterward called Ebenezer, on October 18. On October 21, they began building a public house, to serve as both a church and school, and it opened November 5. From November 25 through the 30th, John was called away to Albany to visit with the Mohawks, and so Reverend Hopkins enlisted Timothy Woodbridge of Springfield to assist the minister, and oversee the mission in Sergeant's absence.Jones, p. 42-44. Sergeant left to return to Yale on December 9, bringing the young sons of Captain Konkapot and Lieutenant Umpachanee along with him, for their education. After finishing his work at New Haven, he returned to the mission on July 5, 1735. John was ordained at Deerfield, on August 31, 1735.Dexter, p. 395. Initially, there were two Native American settlements, separated by about eight miles, called Skatehook, to the south, where Lieutenant Umpachanee lived, and Wnahktukook, to the north, where Captain Konkapot lived. This created logistical issues, and John and schoolmaster Timothy Woodbridge had to make trips between the two locations, often swapping places. Governor Belcher therefore proposed to the General Assembly that a township be granted to the mission, so that the entire tribe could live together, and attend the same church and school. This involved swapping lands with those who had already settled the land in question. The township, which was to become Stockbridge, but was then simply called \\"Indian Town\\", was granted March 25, 1736 and settled in May. One of the stipulations of the grant was that four new English families would be allowed to settle there. Mission House in ca. 1908 postcard In January 1737, in order to live among his congregation, John Sergeant came to live with Timothy Woodbridge, who had recently married and built the first permanent house in the town. Sergeant began building his own home, which still stands, in April. On June 22, 1739, the town was officially named Stockbridge, after Stockbridge, Hampshire. In August, the General Court granted funds to build a church and a schoolhouse. John married Abigail Williams, half-sister of Ephraim Williams, the founder of Williams College, on August 16, 1739.Hopkins, p. 89.  Death and aftermath  In the summer of 1749, Sergeant fell ill with \\"a slow or nervous fever, attended with canker, and an inflammation in the throat\\".Dexter, p. 396. He died on July 27, 1749, at age 39, after four weeks of illness. The Stockbridge Native Americans displayed their affection for him by gathering for prayers, and, after his passing, mourning their loss.Hopkins, p. 161. He left behind his wife, Abigail, and 3 young children. The epitaph on his tombstone was said to be composed by one of the local Native Americans: > Where is that pleasing Form, I ask, thou canst not show; He's not within, > false stone, There's nought but Dust below; And where's that pious soul, > that Thinking conscious MIND? Wilt thou pretend, vain cypher, THAT'S with > thee enshrined? Alas, my Friend's not here with thee that I can find; Here's > not a Sergeant's body or a Sergeant's MIND. I'll seek him hence, for all's > alike Deception here. I'll go to Heav'n & I shall find my Sergeant > there.Jones, pp. 78‚Äì79. Stockbridge went without a resident minister for over two years, with the schoolmaster, Timothy Woodbridge, overseeing the mission. During this time, a feud for control of the town started, between the Woodbridge and the Williams factions. Sergeant was eventually succeeded by the Reverend Jonathan Edwards, who was endorsed by the Woodbridges.

He was the first garda officer to be murdered in the line of duty since 1996, and was afforded a full state funeral. On 4 March 2018 at Dundalk District Court, 27-year-old Aaron Brady from New Road, Crossmaglen, County Armagh, was charged with Donohoe's murder and pleaded not guilty. Brady's trial began at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin on 28 January 2020. After a 9-week hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial resumed on 6 May 2020. On 12 August 2020, 29-year-old Aaron Brady was found guilty of the capital murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and will be sentenced to the mandatory term for capital murder of 40 years imprisonment. Personal life Adrian Donohoe was born on 14 January 1972 in Kilnaleck, County Cavan to parents Peggy and Hugh Donohoe. He grew up on the family farm with his three brothers - Alan, Colm and Martin, and two sisters - Anne and Mary. He was a keen Gaelic footballer, and at he played midfield for his local club before going on to represent Cavan GAA at Under-21 level. He attended nearby primary and secondary schools, before joining the Garda S√≠och√°na in 1994. Two of his brothers also joined the force, and he met his future wife Caroline at the Garda S√≠och√°na College in Templemore, County Tipperary. Caroline Donohoe, from County Clare and who also had family members serving with the Garda√≠, was stationed with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in Dundalk Garda Station - the same building where her husband worked ‚Äì and the couple had two young children, a boy and a girl aged 6 and 7 respectively, at the time of his death. Donohoe was described as a \\"father figure\\" in his community, and played and coached for his local GAA club, St Patrick's GFC, on the Cooley Peninsula. He served his entire 19-year career in Dundalk, rising to the rank of detective. The Donohoes lived 4 km away from where the shooting occurred, and both their children attended Bellurgan National School, directly across the road from the incident. Shooting and robbery Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and his colleague Detective Garda Joe Ryan were on a routine two- person cash escort on the evening of Friday, 25 January 2013. Ryan was driving an unmarked police car (a silver Ford Mondeo), both detectives were wearing civilian clothing and carrying concealed police issue sidearms (9mm SIG Sauer P226). The Garda S√≠och√°na are primarily an unarmed police force, however certain units of the service are armed (such as detective units) and up to 25% of members are licensed to carry firearms. The pair were en route to meet local credit union officials at Omeath, Cooley and the Lordship Credit Union in Bellurgan, who would then travel in a three car convoy to a bank in Dundalk town to lodge takings in a nightsafe. This was regular practice, and the protocol had been recently upgraded from an unarmed, uniformed garda escort to an armed, plain-clothes detective escort following a robbery that happened at the credit union 18 months prior, when ‚Ç¨62,000 in cash and cheques was taken. There were no casualties in the previous crime. At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan entered the car park of the Lordship Credit Union premises and they parked, as did another car that was accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door and stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range in the back of the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about ‚Ç¨40,000, but only took a bag with ‚Ç¨4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than ‚Ç¨30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised. The emergency services pronounced Donohoe dead shortly after their arrival, despite the frantic efforts of his colleague Ryan to save his life. Garda Headquarters scrambled all available units in an attempt to catch the fleeing suspects, and alerted the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). However, it is understood they had escaped to Northern Ireland before the border was secured by police on both sides. The Republic of Ireland-United Kingdom border can be crossed by car in around 10 minutes from the Lordship Credit Union, and neither force is allowed to enter neighbouring territory. A Garda helicopter briefly entered UK airspace with permission during the search. A PSNI helicopter was also deployed during the search in the north. Investigation One hour after the fatal incident - at 10:30 pm on Friday, 25 January 2013 - a car matching the description of that used in the credit union hold-up was found burnt-out on Cumsons Road, Newtownhamilton, a remote forested laneway near the villages of Darkley and Keady, in south County Armagh in Northern Ireland. The PSNI carried out an extensive technical examination of the car and the surrounding area the following day. This area became a focus of the investigation. The vehicle, a \\"graphite navy blue\\" in colour 2008 Dublin registered automatic Volkswagen Passat, was linked by detectives to the murder and it was confirmed that it had been stolen from the Clogherhead area of County Louth earlier that week, between 11:30 pm on Tuesday, 22 January and 4:30 am on Wednesday, 23 January. Garda√≠ and the PSNI believe another getaway car was used to collect those involved in the crime after setting alight the original getaway car, and that there was more than five suspects involved in the overall perpetration of the crime. A full forensic examination was carried out at the scene over three days by the Garda Technical Bureau, assisted by the Divisional Scenes of Crime Unit. The Divisional Search Team was called in to search the vicinity of the scene. The hammer used by the raiders to break the window of one of the credit union cars was recovered at the crime scene. The post-mortem on the body of Donohoe took place at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda by the State Pathologist, Professor Marie Cassidy of the State Pathologist's Office, who also visited the scene. As is standard practice when a garda loses their life, the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) was notified, and their officials visited the scene. Then Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan (who retired in March 2014) attended a case conference at Dundalk Garda Station on the weekend after Donohoe's death, where an incident room was established for the duration of the investigation. Commissioner Callinan announced the allocation of 150 senior detectives to the case. National specialist units were assigned to the investigation, including the Special Detective Unit (SDU), National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI) and Organised Crime Unit (OCU). The force's armed intervention teams - Emergency Response Unit (ERU) and Regional Support Unit (RSU) - were placed on alert in the aftermath. In the early stages of the investigation, there were over 1,000 Garda officers attached to the investigation, making it one of the largest criminal investigations ever undertaken in the history of the state. Garda√≠ established that five males were involved in the shooting and robbery itself, and belong to a larger criminal gang operating in the border region. Those responsible were believed to have fled to Northern Ireland after the killing, and remained there for some weeks. The leader of the five-man gang and main suspect for the murder was identified as a young man from the Crossmaglen area of south Armagh. It is understood he was known to Detective Donohoe, providing a possible motive for his murder. However, Donohoe was originally not scheduled to take part in the credit union cash escort, making a late shift change with the officer who was originally scheduled to take part in the escort. In late February, over a month after Donohoe died, Garda√≠ held a press briefing at the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) Headquarters in Harcourt Street, Dublin City. There was a renewed appeal for information made, and two replica exhibits of evidence were shown to the media for the first time. A precision panel beating hammer with a black rubber handle, a red painted section and a soft rubber head was found at the scene, and police asked the public for help in tracing its origins. Similar mallets are used by panel beaters or mechanics repairing motorcycles. Also, a distinctive green \\"Cosatto\\" high-backed children's car booster seat carrying a \\"Little Monster\\" motif as well as a graphic of a monster was in the car when it was stolen. The child car seat - suitable for babies and young children - cost ‚Ç¨119 to buy, and may have been dumped, offered for sale or given as a gift as investigators believe was taken out of the stolen vehicle before it was used in the killing. In mid-April, Garda√≠ and the PSNI informed the public that the investigation teams were looking for information in relation to a white coloured Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) that was parked on the Shean Road, Forkhill, Armagh in Northern Ireland either side of 9.45 pm on 25 January 2013, the night Donohoe lost his life. The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle. The two police forces added that they wanted to speak to anyone who owned the truck, had recovered or serviced it, or anyone who saw any activity of this nature on the Shean Road on the night of 25 January. One year on from the murder of Detective Donohoe, the Garda Commissioner visited Dundalk Garda Station, and provided an update on the progress of the murder inquiry. Martin Callinan reiterated his commitment to bringing those responsible for the crime to justice, and revealed the international dimensions to the case, involving police forces and law enforcement agencies from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, United States and Australia, as well as Europol and Interpol. The Commissioner also praised the PSNI for their involvement in the investigation. By the 25 January 2014, the anniversary of Donohoe's death, over 4,000 investigative tasks had been undertaken, 4,000 \\"structured\\" lines of enquiry were pursued, 2,100 statements taken, in excess of 800 people interviewed, 400,000 hours of CCTV reviewed (the equivalent to 45 man-years), 1,200 exhibits of evidence gathered and more than 30 searches carried out under warrants during the 12 months of the investigation. Succeeding Garda Commissioner N√≥ir√≠n O'Sullivan reiterated her confidence in April 2014 that Adrian Donohoe's murderers would be brought to justice. The investigation into the murder is over 10 times the size of usual homicide investigations. Aftermath The death of Adrian Donohoe was strongly condemned by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins and the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. Cabinet ministers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland also spoke out against the crime. Minister for Justice Alan Shatter said that those responsible for the murder had planned it, knew that there would be police attending the credit union for an escort, and that the officers were ambushed. He warned that the perpetrators would each face the mandatory 40 years in prison for killing a garda, regardless of who fired the shot if they did not turn themselves in. Commissioner Martin Callinan vowed to hunt down and apprehend the killers. The PSNI, under Chief Constable Matt Baggott, pledged their full cooperation and support to bring to justice the murderers. There was widespread shock and outrage among the public on the island of Ireland following the shooting dead of Donohoe, and it was considered a \\"national tragedy\\". The last garda to be shot dead serving the state was Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in June 1996, by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in County Limerick. Jerry McCabe's widow Anne McCabe spoke of her sympathy for the Donohoe family, and retired Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan - who was shot but survived the same incident as Jerry McCabe - signed a book of condolence for the family, friends and colleagues of the fallen officer. Irish television programme Crimecall aired on RT√â in February, featuring Superintendent David Taylor from the Garda Press Office appealing to the public for their help in solving the case. A Facebook tribute to Donohoe amassed over 40,000 signatures within days of the killing. The Irish League of Credit Unions offered a reward of ‚Ç¨50,000 for information leading to arrests and prosecutions in the investigation. This reward was added to by Crimestoppers, who put forward a \\"substantial, five-figure sum\\" a month after the incident. On 18 May 2013, the family of Adrian Donohoe were presented with a special Garda remembrance medal in his honour. The medal was awarded to his widow, Caroline, during the annual Garda Memorial Day commemoration service held at Dublin Castle. The ceremony remembers all 87 members of the Garda√≠ who were killed in the line of duty. Donohoe was posthumously awarded a People of the Year Award for his bravery and fearlessness in September 2013, eight months after his unlawful death. The award was presented in Citywest, Dublin by GAA personality M√≠che√°l √ì Muircheartaigh, and was accepted by Caroline Donohoe. She spoke of Adrian as \\"the love of my life\\" and \\"the best father that any child could have\\", adding \\"I will miss him every minute of every day as long as I live\\". Funeral Detective Garda Donohoe was given a full state funeral on 30 January 2013. The funeral mass took place at St Joseph's Redemptorist Church in Dundalk, and he was buried at Lordship Cemetery. There was an estimated 5,000 people present at the funeral, which included 3,500 Garda√≠ (2,500 uniformed and 1,000 plain-clothes) and 1,500 members of the locality and further afield. More lined the route as the procession made its way to the graveyard. It was the largest funeral in Ireland for a number of years. Among those in attendance were President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, T√°naiste Eamon Gilmore, Minister for Justice Alan Shatter and several senior government ministers, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, Irish Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Sean McCann, Cardinal Se√°n Brady, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford and PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott. Fr Michael Cusack presided over the mass. Donohoe's colleague Joe Ryan, who was present when he was shot dead, was a pall-bearer at the funeral. Police inquiries In late February 2013, six pre-planned searches were carried out in the Dundalk area by Garda√≠ investigating the murder. Two men - a father and son in their 70s and 30s - were detained under terrorism legislation (Offences against the State Acts 1939‚Äì1998) and held at Drogheda Garda Station, where they could be detained for a period of 7 days without charge. A Garda spokesperson said that the arrests targeted criminal and subversive activity in the area, and were not directly related to the killing. They were released two days later, and a file was sent forward to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) pending possible charges. Both men were suspected of running a vehicle theft ring, supplying stolen cars to other criminals, and that the car used in Garda Donohoe's murder may have originated from this illegal operation. In the first week of April 2013, a number of planned raids were carried out by Garda√≠ in County Louth. Detectives seized mobile phones and laptop computers in a raid at a property in Hackballscross, Dundalk and seized firearms, explosives and illegal drugs during another raid at a premises in Kilsaran, Castlebellingham. No arrests were made, but the teams involved in the searches were investigating criminal elements operating in the border regions between County Louth and County Armagh, including the gang said to be responsible for Donohoe's murder. Significant forensic examinations took place following the searches in both locations. Also in April, heavily armed members from the PSNI Special Operations Branch (C4) raided four houses in south County Armagh and seized mobile phones and documentation, as well as taking away other material for forensic examination. Senior officers informed journalists that the searches had been intelligence led, and were focused on suspected criminals or associates of members of the gang believed to have been responsible for the murder of Donohoe. No-one was detained during the four searches, but officers said that the operation's primary objective was to gather evidence. Follow-up operations to the PSNI seizures were carried out a number of weeks later south of the border by Garda√≠. Several search warrants were executed by investigators in the Carlingford area of Louth. In early May 2013, numerous searches were undertaken by Garda√≠ in the town of Faughart, near Dundalk. Investigating detectives were backed-up by the Emergency Response Unit, Regional Support Unit, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Garda Stolen Motor Vehicle Investigation Unit, Divisional Search Team and the Divisional Scenes of Crime Unit. The Garda Press Office did not disclose any results of the searches, citing \\"operational reasons\\". Suspects Five main suspects were identified by Garda√≠ and the PSNI in the course of the investigation into the murder of Donohoe, all of whom suspected of being present during the fatal shooting of the 41-year-old father-of-two, and the subsequent theft of cash and cheques from the scene. All five suspects were classified as young males, from either side of the Louth-Armagh border, part of a larger criminal gang of around 15 to 20 people, with connections through their family and acquaintances to dissident republican paramilitary and terror organisations. A number of the suspects had previous criminal convictions, as well as being implicated in other criminal investigations. Police officers from the Republic and Northern Ireland established the identity of the suspect who fired the fatal shot, understood to be the leader of the five-man gang, as a male in his early 20s, and who grew up in Crossmaglen, County Armagh, with strong links to the Crossmaglen Rangers Gaelic Athletic Club. The gang also included a pair of brothers. None of the five main suspects have been arrested, and it is believed that Garda√≠ are preparing a \\"watertight\\" case to present to the Director of Public Prosecutions before any moves are made to apprehend those responsible. Such is the nature of the crime, that any suspect charged with murder or conspiracy to commit murder of a serving member of the Garda S√≠och√°na would be tried in the non-jury Special Criminal Court in Dublin, facing a sentence of 40 years imprisonment in the maximum security Portlaoise Prison. It emerged that a number of the suspects made prepared statements to police on both sides of the border, with their legal representatives present, in the weeks after the murder. They were then questioned under caution by the authorities. As the suspects live and travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, extraditions may have to be sought to bring those responsible to justice in the Republic of Ireland. An Extradition Agreement in place between the Irish and British governments means that extradition orders can only be made when the police force requesting the extradition has sufficient evidence to charge the suspect, and can only question them after they are charged in a court of law. In March 2013, the prime suspect in the unlawful killing of Donohoe fled to the United States, according to senior Garda sources. The man - in his 20s and from south Armagh - travelled from Northern Ireland to mainland Britain, before boarding a flight to New York City using a British passport. Police in Ireland, Britain and the United States were powerless to prevent the suspect travelling because there was no warrant for his arrest. However, it is known that the suspect therefore failed to show for a court sitting in Ireland for separate offences that took place before the incident in Bellurgan, County Louth. Once the suspect landed in the US, security services were made aware of his presence by the Garda√≠. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were furnished with the details of the suspect's identity, and the United States Marshals Service (USMS) was tasked with tracking the whereabouts of the suspect. Garda detectives also flew to the US, to help authorities trace the suspect's movements. The man was given a holiday visa by US officials upon entering the country. Another accomplice is understood to have fled to Boston in April, before reuniting with the prime suspect in New York. In September, the girlfriend of the prime suspect - who is also herself under investigation after she provided an alibi for her boyfriend when questioned as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder to the PSNI - travelled to New York. US authorities are monitoring their movements. In December 2013, two suspects in the murder investigation were questioned and forced to provide statements in New York to investigating Garda√≠ and American authorities. Senior detectives from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation travelled to the United States in late 2013, and in December they - accompanied by US law enforcement - brought two suspects in for questioning from a property in New York. Both suspects refused to answer questions, however under US law they were compelled to provide written witness statements about the incident before being released without charge. The suspects were Irish males in their early 20s, and had fled to the US following the murder of Donohoe. The authorities are said to be liaising about extraditing the suspects back to Ireland, but must wait until the Director of Public Prosecutions rules that charges will be brought. If the suspects fail to leave the US before their visas expire, they will be deported from the country back to Ireland or the UK. It has been reported that the suspects in the US are on Green Card visas. Two other male suspects in the murder case travelled to Australia, one in April 2013 (who then later fled to the US) and one in June 2013, in an attempt to avoid prosecution. The pair were suspected of involvement in the shooting and burglary, but they were not arrested and no warrant has been issued. A team of detectives from the Garda√≠ travelled to Sydney in January 2014, and one of the suspects was forced to provide a witness statement to the authorities. It was reported that when his visa expired, he would be deported if he failed to leave the country of his own accord. Police in Australia were said to be monitoring his movements. One of the suspects, a man in his early 20s, remained in County Down in Northern Ireland. He has been questioned by the PSNI about his involvement in the crime. He has since been prosecuted in connection with rape. In October 2016, the fianc√©e of one of the suspected killers was arrested by police in the US on immigration offences after Gardai sought an extradition request to have her brought back to Ireland to be charged before a court. She was deported to Ireland in January. =2017 US Arrest= On Thursday, 18 May 2017, a prime murder suspect was detained in New York by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for violating immigration rules and was deported back to Ireland. Unlike extradition proceedings, deportations are implemented relatively quickly. The arrest was made as a result of a targeted investigation involving Irish and US law enforcement. US police were tracking the movements of the suspect on behalf of Gardai. The US Embassy in Dublin confirmed that there had been close cooperation involving Gardai and US authorities on the matter for \\"some time\\". Senior Garda officers described the development as highly significant. The individual was arrested and brought before a judge in Ireland after he failed to turn up in court after he was convicted of charges in relation to a separate matter. It was reported that a former associate of the man, who is currently living in Ireland, had been assisting investigating detectives with their inquiries. =2018 Dublin, Dundalk arrests= On Sunday, 25 February 2018, the \\"chief suspect\\" in the murder case - a 27-year-old man - was arrested by the investigation team at 7.15pm outside Wheatfield Prison after completing a sentence for road traffic offences, and brought to Dundalk Garda Station, where he was questioned for a period of 7 days. This suspects' period of detention was extended after gardai made an application to the District court. On Monday, 26 February 2018, a second man in his 50s was arrested in Dundalk and was detained at Balbriggan Garda Station. He was later released and a file was prepared for the DPP. Aaron Brady On Sunday, 4 March 2018 at a special sitting of Dundalk District Court, 27-year-old Aaron Brady from New Road, Crossmaglen, County Armagh, was charged with the capital murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe in the course of his duty. Detective Inspector Pat Marry said that when the charge was put to Mr Brady he said: \\"I strongly deny any involvement in the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.\\" He was remanded in custody to appear before Cloverhill District Court on 9 March. There was a heavy Garda presence at the court where a large number of members of the public gathered and members of the US Department of Homeland Security were in attendance. =Involvement of US Homeland Security & ICE= Following the charging of Brady with murder, Acting Garda Commissioner D√≥nall √ì Cual√°in and senior investigating Garda√≠ met with Alysa D. Erichs, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and her team of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at Dundalk Garda Station. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York, HSI Attach√© London and HSI Boston worked jointly with the Garda S√≠och√°na in relation to the international investigation. The investigation revealed that Brady was living in New York, entered the United States under the Visa Waiver Program but failed to leave upon expiration of the waiver, making him amenable for arrest and deportation from the United States for immigration violations. In May 2017 HSI New York, with assistance from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in New York, were able to arrest Brady by citing an expired visa. He remained in ERO custody until he was removed from the United States, flown to Dublin, and arrested by Garda Detectives upon arrival. Alysa D. Erichs, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director of Homeland Security Investigations said in a statement: \\"The United States will not be a safe haven for cop killers. When it comes to cop killers, there are no boundaries between us. The Garda is remaining true to their promise to the Donohoe family and to the Irish people. It is an honor for HSI to have worked alongside our Garda partners to investigate, locate, arrest and deport Aaron Brady to Ireland.\\" According to media reports, the rest of the suspected gang members are currently in the US, Australia and Northern Ireland and thousands of lines of inquiry are being pursued. Gardai have vowed to pursue those involved \\"to the ends of the earth\\". =Brady found guilty of capital murder= On Monday, 10 August 2020, Brady was found guilty of robbing approximately ‚Ç¨7,000 in cash and cheques outside Lordship Credit Union in County Louth in 2013. His conviction of the capital murder of Detective Garda Donohoe followed two days later. He will be sentenced to the mandatory term for capital murder of 40 years' imprisonment. Should he receive the maximum remission possible for good behaviour while in prison, he will be released no earlier than August 2050. =Sentencing= On Wednesday, 14 October 2020 Brady was sentenced to life in prison, to serve at least 40 years. He was also sentenced to 14 years for robbery, to run concurrently.

It was published in 2006 by the Penguin Group. By drawing upon research on the human genome, the book attempts to piece together what Wade calls \\"two vanished periods\\": the five million years of human evolution from the development of bipedalism leading up to behavioural modernity around 50,000 years ago, and the 45,000 subsequent years of prehistory. Wade asserts that there is a clear continuity from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution can be attributed to the physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself. After humans migrated out of their ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation ‚Äì either because of geography or hostile tribalism ‚Äì also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages. The book received generally positive reviews, but some criticised the use of the term \\"race\\" and the implications of differences between them. In 2007, it won the Science in Society Journalism Award from the National Association of Science Writers. Summary Nicholas Wade divides Before the Dawn into twelve chapters, which are roughly in the chronological order of the human past. The first chapter, Genetics & Genesis, gives a general overview of the themes that are explored in the book. The central theme is that the human genome provides a record of the human past, including what Wade calls the \\"two vanished periods\\" of human evolution and prehistory.. Through information from the human genome, Wade proclaims, it is possible to determine when humans lost their body hair and began to wear clothes, to track their migration out of Africa, to discover if they interbred with Neanderthals, and even to reconstruct the evolution of language. =Origin of humans and language= A reconstruction of Homo habilis, the first human ancestor to use stone tools The second chapter, Metamorphosis, focuses on the evolutionary origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa.. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left the shrinking forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche gave rise to the human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle- walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which is more efficient over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago.. The adaptations of H. ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow sweating to cool the body and larger brain.. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin.. The close descendants of H. ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H. heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.. The human lineage that remained in Africa eventually evolved into anatomically modern humans with modern-sized brains by about 200,000 years ago, and became common about 100,000 years ago, but did not become behaviourally modern until about 50,000 years ago. Citing the paleoanthropologist Richard Klein, Wade posits that such a great change must have been because of a neurological change, and was therefore genetic. This \\"genetic revolution\\", as Wade calls it, facilitated the emergence of language and thus the ability to share thoughts and innovations. Wade discusses the evolutionary origins of language in chapter three, First Words. He references Noam Chomsky's theory of \\"universal grammar\\" ‚Äì which refers to both the hard-wiring of the brain that allows children to learn grammatical rules, and the underlying grammatical similarities of all human languages.. Wade cites a number of evolutionary psychologists for an explanation, including Robin Dunbar, who argues that language evolved because it was a more efficient way of establishing social bonds than grooming; Geoffrey Miller, who suggests that speech was a signal of intelligence and thus evolved through sexual selection; and Steven Pinker, who thinks that the ecological niche of humans required the sharing of knowledge.. Wade writes that the genetic basis of language is linked to the FOXP2 gene, as it shows signs of significant change in humans but not in chimpanzees, and that mutations of it cause severe speech disorders.. =Ancestral humans and migration out of Africa= Chapter four, Eden, discusses the ancestral population of modern humans in Africa. Through the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, Wade gives evidence to suggest that the ancestral population was no more than 5,000 to 10,000 individuals in an area corresponding to what is now Ethiopia. He supposes that the small population would have lived in close proximity, and likely spoke the same language.. By looking at the click languages of the genetically \\"ancient\\" Khoisan peoples, and the fact that clicks are more often lost than gained in languages, Wade suggests that clicks were present in this ancestral language. To understand the nature of the ancestral population, Donald Brown's theory of \\"universal people\\" is raised; that is, the shared behaviours of all modern human societies.. A small minority of this ancestral population, Wade continues in chapter five, Exodus, crossed the Gate of Grief and left Africa 50,000 years ago, following the coasts of India and the former continents of Sunda and Sahul.. As they moved into the interior of Eurasia, they clashed with H. erectus and Neanderthals, eventually pushing them into refuges and ultimately to their extinction.. The wide dispersal of humans across varying environments with different evolutionary pressures, Wade contends, began to give rise to regional differentiation. He gives examples of variation in two genes related to brain development: an allele of microcephalin that appeared about 37,000 years ago and is common in Europeans and East Asians, but rare in sub-Saharan Africans; and an allele of ASPM that appeared about 6,000 years ago and is common in Europeans, Middle Easterners and to a lesser extent East Asians, but is nearly non-existent in sub-Saharan Africans. Wade believes that the rapid spread of these alleles conferred some cognitive advantage, and one that was enough to be favoured by natural selection.. Wade continues to discuss the different human trajectories in chapter six, Stasis; he writes that while the humans across the Eurasian landmass were exposed to similarly harsh glacial conditions during the Upper Paleolithic, they gradually began to diverge between east and west.. It was during this period that the dog was domesticated by humans living in Siberia, who in turn crossed the Bering land bridge and populated the Americas.. Wade states that an adaptation in mitochondrial DNA for cold conditions possibly facilitated this migration. Furthermore, he theorises that the \\"mongoloid\\" skull and body type of East Asians and Native Americans were physical adaptations to the cold, and also partly the result of genetic drift, whereas light skin developed separately in East Asians and \\"caucasoid\\" Europeans to better enable them to synthesise vitamin D with sunlight.. =Social evolution, emergence of human races and division of languages= Indo-European shown here in its ancestral Eurasia, may have spread through agriculture. Chapter seven, Settlement, concerns sedentism ‚Äì the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently ‚Äì which began to rise in the Near East at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today.. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting.. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies ‚Äì such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos ‚Äì for evidence.. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.. Wade writes that along with the ongoing social evolution that occurred after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This is the subject of chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths.. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant.. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races ‚Äì Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans ‚Äì which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that racial differences may have an influence on sporting achievement.. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants ‚Äì such as Proto-Indo-European ‚Äì possibly spread through agriculture.. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.. =Understanding history and predicting the future= In chapter eleven, History, Wade demonstrates how genetics can be related to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives.. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by a large percentage of the male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.. Wade also discusses the origin of Jews; they descend from the Middle East through their Y chromosomes, but their mitochondrial DNA resembles that of their host countries. Citing Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, Wade argues that Ashkenazi Jews were historically forced into intellectually demanding occupations by their European hosts, and these selective pressures favoured genes that raised their intelligence. The consequence of this, however, was an increase in sphingolipid diseases.. The final chapter, Evolution, gives a summary of human evolution from its origins to the present, and declares that it is unlikely that it will ever cease. Wade speculates where evolution will lead humans in the future, suggesting further skeletal gracilisation, increases in intelligence, adaptations to the changing climate, and even the possibility of speciation.. Background and publication Author Nicholas Wade in 2005 Wade has written for The New York Times since 1981 as an editorial writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing of the human genome in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.. One of the principal themes of the book is the continual evolution of humans, especially since their migration out of Africa around 50,000 years ago.. In an interview with American Scientist in 2006, Wade recognised the resistance against this idea in the fields of anthropology and archaeology, but thought that as \\"genetic evidence [forces a] reevaluation of the view that evolution stopped in the distant past\\", it would ease over time. More controversial, though, is the idea that humans populations have diverged enough to be considered \\"races\\". When asked about the \\"idea of race and how it is often thought of as just a social construct\\", he replied: > Well, I think the subject of race has been so difficult and so polluted by > malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including > geneticists. ‚Ä¶ Most genetic variation is neutral ‚Äì it doesn't do anything > for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it ‚Äì so most previous > attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference > between races. I think this position is the one on which the social > scientists are basing their position. ‚Ä¶ If you look at the genes that do > make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, > you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of > interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. > This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family > dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments > on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, > and each group adapted to its environment in its own way. American Scientist responded by suggesting that the term \\"race\\" is associated with historical baggage, and asked if perhaps a different term should be used. Wade replied, saying: > I'm not sure how that will play out. The geneticists, if you read their > papers, have long been using code words. They sort of dropped the term > \\"race\\" about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see code words like > \\"population\\" or \\"population structure.\\" Now that they're able to define race > in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like \\"continental groups\\" or > \\"continent of origin,\\" which does, indeed, correspond to the everyday > conception of race. When I'm writing I prefer to use the word race because > that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but > it's not necessarily a malign word. In Before the Dawn, Wade suggests that genetic differences between human populations, or races, may be responsible for differences in sporting achievement. He avoids the more controversial discussion of why there are differences in IQ between them (aside from the high IQ of Ashkenazi Jews), however, saying that \\"[t]his dispute, whose merits lie beyond the scope of this book, has long made the study of race controversial\\". Reception Biologist E. O. Wilson gave the book an especially positive review, which appears on the cover. Before the Dawn received generally favourable reviews. E. O. Wilson, often known as the \\"father of sociobiology\\", proclaimed that it was \\"[b]y far the best book I have ever read on humanity's deep history.\\" James Watson, co-discoverer of the DNA double helix and Nobel Prize winner, commended the book for providing a \\"masterful overview on how changes in our respective DNA lineages let us begin to understand how human beings have evolved from ancestral hunter-gatherer forebears into effective members of today's advanced human societies.\\" Lionel Tiger, Professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University, stated that \\"Nicholas Wade has delivered an impeccable, fearless, responsible and absorbing account\\" and that the book is \\"[b]ound to be the gold standard in the field for a very long time.\\" Similarly, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen declared that Wade \\"is a robust and refreshing critic of scientific political correctness.\\" Another positive review came from John Derbyshire, a former columnist for the National Review, who declared that: > Stricter adherents of the [standard social science model] will be > scandalized by the inclusion of a chapter titled \\"Race,\\" which according to > them is a thing that does not exist, except in the diseased imaginations of > \\"racists.\\" Fiddlesticks, says Wade: Of course race exists. He proceeds to > give a calm, factual account of what we know, again carefully rooting it all > in the genetic evidence. Derbyshire concluded: > Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand genealogy of modern humanity, > rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and > hypothesis. Even for a reader to whom the material is already familiar ‚Äì one > who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade‚Äôs reports in the New York > Times ‚Äì it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative > value, for the elegant way Wade has put it all together as a single > compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science > journalists. Other positive reviews came from Publishers Weekly; Kirkus Reviews, who called the book \\"meaty, well-written\\"; and The New York Review of Books, who said that it was \\"on the whole, a fascinating account of recent scientific findings.\\" Craig Stanford, Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at the University of Southern California, gave the book a generally positive review in American Scientist, but offered critique by suggesting that \\"[i]f there is a flaw in this tightly written, insightful book, it is that Wade provides perhaps too many of the stock examples of human evolution. In my view, he spends too much time and space attempting to convince the reader that we did indeed evolve from apes (duh!) and that our own social behavior and cognition have roots in the deep human past.\\" Peter Dizikes of The New York Times also gave a mostly positive review, calling it a \\"timely and informative survey.\\" However, he criticised Wade's claim that \\"the development of lactose tolerance shows broadly that 'genes respond to cultural changes'\\", and posited the alternative view that it is \\"a case of genes responding to an environmental change produced by society ‚Äì the abundance of milk-producing cattle ‚Äì and not to any abstract cultural practice.\\" Dizikes also took issue with Wade's use of the word \\"race\\", saying that the \\"judgment that these regional genetic tendencies constitute 'races' has no deep scientific rationale, either. Such labels are generalizations situated atop a complicated intermingling of populations.\\" Contrastingly, social anthropologists Kenneth M. Weiss and Anne V. Buchanan of the journal Nature (of which Nicholas Wade was formerly deputy editor) gave the book a highly critical review, finding particular fault in the book's social and political implications: > Positions on genetic determinism often correlate with social politics, and > few of us are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that > his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that \\"to falter in > scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness\\". He seems to be > warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. But > we should never become casual about how comparable \\"slopular\\" science and > very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a > venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales > often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with > comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist that we > look starkly at life in the raw and not blink at what we see. In 2007, the book was given the Science in Society Journalism Award by the National Association of Science Writers. The judges found that Wade's writing was \\"skillful\\" in putting together the many findings about human origins in an \\"engaging\\" way.

Life and career Yang Yong-hi is a second-generation Korean resident who was born in Osaka, Japan on 11 November 1964. She belongs to the ethnic Korean minority community in Japan, many of them descendants of Koreans brought there during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea. Yang studied at the Korea University in Tokyo and New School University, where she gained a master's in media studies. She is fluent in three languages. Her famed documentary Dear Pyongyang picked up the Jury Special award at the World Cinema section for documentaries at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and the NETPAC Award at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival. She based it on her dual identity and the difficult relationship with her father. Yang's father was an influential member of the GAKR (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, or \\"Chongryon\\") -- a controversial organization in Tokyo that ostensibly helps North Koreans in Japan with travel or legal problems, or acts as a pipeline between North Korea and their families in the archipelago. She and her father had passionate political arguments over the years. Growing up as the daughter of a North Korean patriot was fraught with difficulties, but Yang points out that she \\"was lucky. As the youngest child and the only girl, I was spared the fate of my three older brothers, which was to be shipped back to Pyongyang in their late teens.\\" Her father's decision was motivated by the well-intentioned desire to spare his sons the social discrimination suffered by North Korean boys in Japan, but sending her brothers back to the fatherland tore the family apart. Lured by propaganda that portrayed North Korea as \\"a paradise,\\" her three brothers are among the estimated 90,000 people who were repatriated to North Korea under a project initiated by the pro-Pyongyang association of Korean residents in Japan from the late 1950s to early 1980s. Yang first visited North Korea as part of a high school field trip, and she returned there several times, and got to know her niece, named Sona. Her second documentary Sona, the Other Myself is a tribute to the times Yang spent with her family in North Korea, showing unused footage collected during her earlier visits to North Korea. In it Yang lingers over Sona's guileless infant-hood followed by a no-choice induction into the rigidly disciplinarian North Korean educational system, highlighting the innocence of her niece in the brief period before school changed her, and she could recite party line rhetoric and songs to celebrate the glory of \\"our father.\\" Yang went back and forth between Tokyo and Pyongyang with her camera, first to shoot Dear Pyongyang and then to concentrate on Sona, before she was officially banned from entering North Korea in 2006. That was the last time she saw her niece. Her first feature film, Our Homeland is based on her experience of a tearful reunion with her brother Seong-ho, who returned to Japan 25 years after leaving for North Korea, during a three-month visit to get medical treatment for a brain tumor. The film won the C.I.C.A.E. Panorama film award at the 2012 Berlin International Film Festival. Yang said she is still afraid for her brothers' safety after the release of her films over the past 15 years, but will continue to make films about her family.

Capriglione in 2017 sponsored legislation that would forbid lobbyists from running for office in Texas on the grounds that they pose either a \\"perception of conflict of interest\\" or an actual conflict. The San Antonio Express-News called for \\"transparency in government\\" and opposed Capriglione's bill on the grounds that one should not be banned from office based on occupation. Other opponents claimed that the bill would drive lobbyists underground and discourage them from registering with the Texas Ethics Commission.\\"Don't ban lobbyists from elected office\\" (opinion), San Antonio Express-News, April 8, 2017, p. A18. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Capriglione won his fourth legislative term. With 56,694 votes (68.3 percent), he defeated the Democrat Mica J.

Service under Wang Jian  It is not known when Song Guangsi was born or how he became an eunuch, but it is known that he was from Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian). It is not known how he came under service to Wang Jian. The first reference to him was that he was serving under Wang Jian's daughter, whom Wang created the Princess Puning (according to the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms () or Princess Puci (according to the Zizhi Tongjian) after Former Shu was founded,Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 46. but whom he had married, in 905, before the founding in the state, to Li Jichong () the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu), who was a nephew of Wang's ally Li Maozhen the Prince of Qi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. However, it was not clear whether Song had earlier served Wang and thereafter accompanied Wang's daughter to Qi, or whether he came under her service as a subject of Qi. The princess' marriage to Li Jichong was not a happy one. In 911, by which time Wang was the emperor of his new state of Former Shu, she had Song write a letter for her, on silk, to Wang, claiming that Li Jichong was arrogant and a drunkard, and asking to return to the Former Shu capital Chengdu. Wang sent emissaries to Qi, recalling the princess for what was claimed to be a temporary visit home. However, after she arrived in Chengdu, Wang kept her there and did not return her to Li Jichong, and he kept Song under his service in the palace. In anger, Li Maozhen cut off his alliance with Former Shu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. As of 918, Song was serving in Wang's palace as the director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). That year, when Wang fell ill, another eunuch, Tang Wenyi (), tried to seize control of the palace and take over the governance of the state. When this was discovered, a group of officials, led by Wang's adoptive son Wang Zongbi, whom Wang Jian had intended to entrust his son and heir Wang Zongyan to, forced their way into the palace and had Tang deposed. In the aftermath, Wang Jian, who had up to that point not put any eunuch in the powerful position of director of palace communications (Shumishi), decided to put Song in that position and entrust military matters to him, as, while he was entrusting Wang Zongbi and several other adoptive sons Wang Zongyao (), Wang Zongwan (), and Wang Zongkui (), with the responsibilities of assisting the young emperor, also feared that they or other generals, as senior generals, might not follow all of the new emperor's commands. Shortly after, Wang Jian died, and Wang Yan took the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270.  Service under Wang Yan  After Wang Yan took the throne, he entrusted much of the affairs of state to Wang Zongbi and Song Guangsi, who was put in command of the palace guards. Wang Zongbi was described to be corrupt, and Song described to be engaging in frequent flattery; the two were thus blamed by traditional historians for the decline of the Former Shu state. With the precedent of Song being involved in affairs of state, Wang Yan went on to commission a number of other eunuchs as generals and administrators, including Wang Tingshao (), Ouyang Huang (), Li Zhoulu (), Song Chengyun (), Tian Luchou (), and Song Guangsi's cousin Song Guangbao (). Later in 918, Song Guangsi offered to be relieved of the command of the palace guards and recommended that the command be transferred to Wang Zongbi; Wang Yan agreed. By 924, the governance of the Former Shu state was said to be in such disarray that the general Wang Zongchou (ÁéãÂÆóÂÑî, another adoptive son of Wang Jian's) was trying to persuade Wang Zongbi to depose Wang Yan and replace him with a more capable emperor. Wang Zongbi, however, hesitated, and Wang Zongchou, in fear of the news being leaked, died in distress. After Wang Zongchou's death, Wang Zongbi instead told Song Guangsi and fellow director of palace communications, Jing Runcheng (), \\"Wang Zongchou told me to kill people like you. Now that he is dead, you have nothing to worry.\\" Song and Jing, believing him, wept and thanked him. However, hearing of this episode, Wang Zongbi's son Wang Chengban (), commented, \\"Our household cannot escape disaster.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. In 925, Former Shu's northeastern neighbor Later Tang launched a major attack on Former Shu, seeking to destroy it. Wang Yan, however, did not initially consider this attack to be a major threat even after Wuxing Circuit (Ê≠¶Ëàà, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) had fallen, and Wang Zongbi and Song further assuaged him by stating that all he needed to do was to station the main Former Shu army at Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) to block the path of the Later Tang forces, Later Tang would not dare to advance deeply into Former Shu territory, as Former Shu still maintained sizable garrisons at Shannan (Â±±Âçó, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Sichuan) and Dongchuan (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) Circuits. However, instead, the Later Tang forces repeatedly defeated Former Shu forces, causing Wang Yan to panic and flee from Li back to Chengdu, leaving Wang Zongbi to defend Li. He also left Wang Zongbi instructions to execute three generals who had been losing battles against Later Tang, Wang Zongxun (), Wang Zongyan (ÁéãÂÆóÂÑº, note different character than Wang Yan's former name), and Wang Zongyu (). As soon as Wang Yan left for Chengdu, however, Wang Zongbi abandoned Li as well and rendezvoused with Wang Zongxun, Wang Zongyan, and Wang Zongyu, informing them that it was Song who wanted them dead. They thereafter jointly considered surrendering to the Later Tang army. Wang Zongbi thereafter took his army back to Chengdu, seized Wang Yan and the imperial household, and executed Song, Jing, Li, Ouyang, and the official Han Zhao (), blaming them for Wang Yan's decadent administration, before forcing Wang Yan to surrender to Later Tang.

The name comes from a combination of Newari words 'Ta', meaning snake and 'Daha', which means lake. Mythological origins The Taudaha Lake is believed to be a remnant pool of the huge lake that once existed where now the city of Kathmandu sits. According to mythology, a Buddhist mythical character Manjushree cut the hill in the valley's south, allowing the lake's water to drain off, thereby creating land that was duly occupied by people. Folklore suggests that that \\"cut\\" in the hill is the Chobar Gorge, a narrow passage from which the Bagmati River exits the Kathmandu Valley. After the water of the ancient lake drained away, a few small lakes and ponds were created beyond the hills. Taudaha is believed to be one of those ponds. When the lake was drained, countless nagas, mythological creatures that were half human and half serpent, were left homeless. This made the Naga King Karkotak livid. In order to allay his wrath, the locals living near Taudaha built an underwater palace, studded with precious stones and riches beyond imagination. The Serpent King was pleased and ruled his serpent subjects in their underwater kingdom. The king also promised to protect the humans living around the lake, on the condition that the tranquility of his water abode never be disrupted. It is due to this that even today locals do not swim or fish in the lake. Animals Around 40 species of birds have been recorded out of which 17 are residents, 2 are summer migrants and rest are winter migrants. Black kite, Black drongo, Cattle egret, Oriental magpie robin, Common myna, Jungle crow, Rose-ringed parakeet, White-throated kingfisher and Red-vented bulbul are some of the resident birds. Barn swallow and Indian cuckoo are summer visitors. Winter migrants include the Great cormorant, ruddy shelduck, Northern shoveler, Mallard duck, Gadwall, Eurasian coot, Northern pintail and common teal. There are many species of fishes in the lake. It is well known for large carps. Common carp, Silver carp, Grass carp, Bighead carp and colourful carps have been introduced in the lake. These non-native species have disrupt the ecosystem and are out-competing the native species. Native fish species include several barbs, catfishes and snakeheads. Mammals such as Golden jackal, Indian grey mongoose and several rodents are found around the lake. Checkered keelback and Oriental garden lizard are frequently sighted reptile species. Migratory bird heaven The lake, arguably the only clean water body remaining in the Kathmandu Valley, is a stop over for numerous migratory bird species. In the winter, hundreds of water birds can be seen in and around the lake. Taudaha lake is one of the important site for Bird watching.

It was the first English- language production of the play, starred future husband-and-wife team Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright, and was directed by Orson Welles. Olivier also co- produced the play, which was Welles's last work as a theatre director. Production In March 1960, Welles's play Chimes at Midnight had just closed after an unsuccessful run in Dublin, dashing his hopes of transferring to London. But the commercial failure of the play made that impossible, and Welles sought a new project. He was approached by his de facto British agent Wolf Mankowitz with an offer to direct Rhinoceros. In later years, he admitted to one biographer that he had been mainly motivated by the chance to work with Olivier, whom he had long admired, but that he thought \\"It's a terrible play. I hate it...But I wanted to do it because of Larry.\\"Barbara Leaming, Orson Welles (Viking Press, London, 1985) pp.455-6 He told another biographer \\"I didn't like the play. I agreed to it because I thought the gimmick was good enough so that you could invent an evening in the theatre about it. And it worked - it always seems to work everywhere no matter how it's done. But throughout rehearsals, every day, it seemed to me I liked Ionesco less as a playwright.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1998 [rev. 2nd ed.]) pp.427-8 In this production, the play was relocated from a busy Paris street to a London pub, with a highly elaborate set filled with swinging doors, trapdoors, television monitors, trick mirrors, and advanced special effects.Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1989) p.523 As well as directing the play, Welles also designed the set, costumes, lighting and sound effects. The production was troubled, with Olivier and Welles clashing in their interpretations of the play.'Rhinoceros', Wellesnet.com Welles described \\"The way [Olivier] got me in this was to take all of my directions like a perfect soldier, never argue with them, and always do them...and he took every actor aside and told them I was misdirecting them. Instead of making it hard for me to direct him, he made it almost impossible for me to direct the cast. He got them off in little groups and had quiet little rehearsals having nothing to do with me.\\" Olivier then repeated something he had done to John Gielgud who was directing him in a play several years earlier - he told Welles in front of the entire cast that the director should not return to future rehearsals, as he was upsetting them all so much - Welles recalled \\"He told me to stay home, and I did! I was so humiliated and sick about it that you can't imagine. I had to come for the dress rehearsal because I'd designed the sets, and I had to supervise that, and light it, and so on...[but] I never went back to the play. They changed the cast, and they had Maggie Smith in, and they had Alan Bates, and they moved to another theatre. But I didn't go to rehearsals. All those actors think very badly of me because they think that I simply wasn't interested - I was so humiliated, I didn't know how to come back!...He's the leader of the English stage, he's playing the leading role, and directing it all the time! What was I going to do? Yes, it was a black moment.\\"Barbara Leaming, Orson Welles (Viking Press, London, 1985) pp.456-7 After over thirty years of directing plays, it was Welles's last assignment as a theatre director, even though he was to live another 25 years. Welles's absence in the run-up to the play's dress rehearsal meant that several technical issues with lighting and sound effects were not resolved in time for the play's opening. Accordingly, at the opening night, Welles rigged up a microphone on the right- hand aisle of the dress circle, sat there, apologised to the audience for the experience of theatre never being complete, and then during the performance he proceeded to give lighting directions and instructions to the actors, i.e. \\"Louder, louder...Take down the music...Now lift the curtain...Now, now. Faster!...More rhino roars! More...That's it.\\"Frank Brady, Citizen Welles (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1989) pp.522-3 The play opened at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 28 April 1960, where it played until 7 June. On 8 June, it transferred to the Strand Theatre, until it finally closed on 30 July. Olivier and Plowright had fallen in love during the making of The Entertainer earlier that year, although Olivier was still married to Vivien Leigh, and the affair of the two actors first became public during the play's run, when Leigh announced her husband wanted a divorce, causing a minor scandal at the time.Barbara Leaming, Orson Welles (Viking Press, London, 1985) p.456 Cast *Bessie . . .

Based at Cold Bay in the Territory of Alaska, the project was active during the spring and summer of 1945. It was the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II. Origins of Project Hula The Russian Empire and Japan had previously fought the Russo-Japanese War, in 1904‚Äì1905, followed by Japan sending troops into Siberia, during the Russian Civil War in the Siberian Intervention of 1918‚Äì1920, with animosities continuing as the two countries remained rivals in Northeast Asia after the establishment of the Soviet Union. Japans increasingly aggressive political and military behavior in East Asia, during the 1930s, led to border clashes between Soviet forces and Japanese forces in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, in Manchuria, in 1937, at Kanchatzu Island, in the Amur River, and in 1939, in the Khalkhin Gol/Nomonhan Incident. But after 1939, the two countries turned their attention elsewhere ‚Äì Japan to focus on the Second Sino-Japanese War in China and the Soviet Union to the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Eventually, the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact was signed on 13 April 1941. The Soviet Union entered World War II when Germany invaded in June 1941, and in December 1941, Japan entered the war by attacking Allied forces and territories in the West Pacific and Southeast Asia. Although these events placed the countries on opposite sides in the war, neither had an interest in engaging in military operations against the other, both being fully occupied with the wars in which they already were involved. Thus, the countries maintained a scrupulous neutrality toward one another until almost the very end of World War II; other than inspecting cargos to ensure they did not include war materials and protesting the reflagging of American ships as Soviet ones, Japan did not deliberately interfere militarily with Lend-Lease convoys carrying war materiel from the United States, to the Soviet Union, in the North Pacific, and the Soviet Union turned down American requests to base American aircraft on Soviet territory for operations against Japan, and ignored Allied requests for any other actions which might provoke Japan. The Soviet Union's leader Josef Stalin, stating only that Soviet entry into the war against Japan, would not be possible until after the defeat of Germany. The Soviet Union suffered massive military, civilian and economic losses in the war. During a meeting with United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman in October 1944, Stalin finally offered to enter the war against Japan, but not until three months after the surrender of Germany, whenever that might be. He also made such an entry contingent upon the Allies providing substantial assistance to the Soviet Union, in building up its armed forces and military supplies in East Asia and the Pacific, in advance of any Soviet operations against Japan. After, the Soviet Union provided a list of equipment it required, which the United States codenamed MILEPOST, the United States began the work of meeting the Soviet requirements outside of and in addition to annual Lend-Lease allotments of aid to the Soviets. As part of MILEPOST, the Chief of the Soviet Main Naval Staff, Admiral V. A. Alafusov, and the deputy commander of the U.S. Military Mission in Moscow, Rear Admiral Clarence E. Olsen, agreed on 20 December 1944, to a list of a dozen types of ships and aircraft the United States would transfer to the Soviets. Among the ships were various types of escort vessels, landing craft, and minesweepers. Olsen, also recommended that a \\"program for training of personnel and for delivery of some of each type of ship should be set up at once\\" so that Soviet crews could receive instruction from American personnel in the operation of the ships and craft transferred to them. Choosing a location In early January 1945, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy, Admiral Nikolai Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, suggested that the United States establish the location for the transfer of ships and training of crews in the Territory of Alaskas Aleutian Islands, where the presence of only a very small civilian population would help to assure the security of the program, which was to be conducted in strict secrecy to avoid alerting the Japanese and perhaps provoking Japan into launching an attack against the Soviet Union. He suggested Dutch Harbor, on Unalaska Island, as a good choice; both the Soviet Navy and merchant marine frequently called there and at nearby Akutan, so Soviet personnel were most familiar with those waters. On 18 January 1945, the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, contacted the Commander of the North Pacific Force, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, to alert him that the United States planned to transfer approximately 250 ships and craft to the Soviet Union between April and December 1945, and that about 2,500 personnel would be present at any given time at the transfer site with a two-week cycle of personnel turnover; he also inquired as to whether Dutch Harbor could accommodate such a program. Fletcher, responded on 29 January 1945, rejecting Dutch Harbor, because of the lack of housing and training space there and because its harbor was too small to accommodate the expected numbers of ships and too exposed to heavy seas for safe training. He recommended Cold Bay, on the Alaska Peninsula, as a much better choice because of its protected harbor, shore facilities, and the complete absence of a civilian population, making security of the program much easier than at Dutch Harbor. Kodiak, on Kodiak Island, which had adequate shore facilities but a harbor inadequately protected from rough seas, was Fletchers second choice, and Dutch Harbor, only his third. King, duly informed the U.S. Military Mission in Moscow, of the choice of Cold Bay. During a meeting with King, at the Yalta Conference on 8 February 1945, Kuznetsov, stated that Dutch Harbor, was the Soviet Unions first choice and Kodiak, its second. King informed him that the United States had chosen Cold Bay. Kuznetsov, was not familiar with Cold Bay, but upon finding it on a map, immediately agreed to it as the training site. Planning Tacoma-class patrol frigate at Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 14 June 1944. Transferred at Cold Bay, on 16 August 1945, she became EK-13 in the Soviet Navy, and was returned to the United States in 1949.

King, officially established the transfer-and-training program as Project Hula, in mid-February 1945, and ordered Fletcher, to commence the rehabilitation of the United States Army facilities at Cold Bays Fort Randall, which had been closed in November 1944. He advised Fletcher, that an officer appointed to take charge of the training and his staff would arrive at Cold Bay, by 24 March 1945, and that the first 2,500 Soviet trainees would arrive by 1 April 1945, with 550 more to follow by 1 May, and another 2,000 by 1 June. An early issue to resolve was the matter of how to transport the Soviet Navy personnel to Cold Bay. At the Yalta Conference, in February 1945, Kuznetsov, initially proposed that Allied merchant ships returning to North America, after delivering cargoes in Europe, transport Soviet personnel to the United States East Coast, from which the Soviets could travel across the continental United States to the United States West Coast and then by ship to Cold Bay; however, a shortage of Allied shipping in the Pacific made this plan highly problematic. The day after the conference, the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Government Purchasing Commission, Admiral A. A. Yakimov, proposed that the United States transfer three Liberty ships or similar vessels to Soviet registry, and that these ships carry Soviet personnel to Cold Bay, presumably from ports in the Soviet Far East, but the Allied shipping shortage blocked this idea as well. On 24 February 1945, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, Vice Admiral Richard S. Edwards, informed Yakimov, that transferred motor torpedo boats and two disassembled self-propelled pontoon barges would be shipped aboard Soviet merchant ships from the U.S. West Coast directly to the Soviet Far East, without calling at Cold Bay, reducing the demand on shipping by Soviet personnel requiring transportation to Cold Bay. The Soviets finally decided to transport their personnel to Cold Bay, in their own merchant ships while the ships were making their regular voyages to carry Lend-Lease materials from the U.S. West Coast to the Soviet Far East, with each ship carrying about 600 men at a time. As the plan was finalized, the United States was to transfer 180 ships ‚Äì 30 Tacoma-class patrol frigates (U.S. Navy hull classification symbol PF), 24 Admirable-class minesweepers (AM), 36 auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS), 30 large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)), 56 submarine chasers (SC), and four floating workshops (YR) ‚Äì to the Soviet Union, by 1 November 1945, training about 15,000 Soviet Navy personnel to operate them. After their commissioning into the Soviet Navy, which would take place at Cold Bay, simultaneously with their transfer, the ships would steam in a series of convoys from Cold Bay, with a U.S. Navy escort, passing through Unimak Pass, (regarded as the safest pass in the Aleutian Islands) and then moving westward along the northern side of the Aleutian Islands, with smaller vessels which could not make the voyage nonstop ‚Äì the auxiliary motor minesweepers and submarine chasers ‚Äì pausing at Adak, to refuel and reprovision. Northwest of Attu, the U.S. Navy escort would turn the convoy over to a Soviet Navy escort, and each convoy would then steam north of the Commander Islands, to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, from which the transferred ships would disperse to their designated home ports. The Soviets planned for the first Soviet personnel to arrive at Cold Bay, aboard five merchant ships in late March or early April 1945, depending on ice conditions in the Soviet Far East. The first ship would carry a staff of 23 headed by a rear admiral, three substaffs (out of a planned five) of 11 to 17 personnel each, and 45 to 50 interpreters. Upon disembarking at Cold Bay, Soviet personnel were to come under the overall command of the American officer commanding the training-and- transfer program and were under orders to accede to American orders without question while at Cold Bay. Project Hula begins The U.S. Navy created Naval Detachment No. 3294, specifically for Project Hula; it was to be responsible for all training and transfer activities at Cold Bay. On 7 March 1945, it assigned Commander William S. Maxwell, then in Washington, D.C., to command the detachment. Before leaving Washington, Maxwell, recommended an increase in the number of Russian-language translators to be assigned to Cold Bay, and urged that the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships ensure that each ship to be transferred had all of its authorized equipment loaded and installed and no equipment not authorized for transfer aboard before arriving at Cold Bay. He then left for Cold Bay. Arriving at Cold Bay, on 19 March 1945, and newly promoted to captain, Maxwell, took command of the naval base there the following day. Under his command were 694 U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel, 47 United States Marines, and a U.S. Army contingent of 605; his personnel strength soon stabilized at around 1,500 as Army personnel transferred out and naval personnel replaced them. He found that an advance party under his second-in-command, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander John J. Hutson, had already established Detachment 3294s Antisubmarine Warfare Department. He also discovered that the naval facilities required more rehabilitation than he had been led to believe, so he moved his command into Fort Randall, which had been closed since November 1944, and set about readying its facilities to support Project Hula, including the establishment of housing, classrooms, movie theaters, a radio station, and a softball field; the selection of instructors for courses in radio and radar operation, engineering, gunnery, minesweeping, damage control, and landing craft operation; and the procurement of radios, radars, minesweeping gear, gyrocompasses, engines, movie projectors, and training films and other educational tools. The first Soviets to arrive at Cold Bay, were members of the Soviet Purchasing Commission, who disembarked at the base on 23 March 1945. Maxwell, believed that a great deal of classroom training would be necessary before the Soviet personnel began to train at sea, but the Soviet officers disagreed, preferring a greater emphasis on training at sea. They worked for a week on a training program that both sides could agree on, and achieved a successful compromise before the first trainees arrived. The first Soviet trainees reached Cold Bay, aboard five Soviet merchant ships, each carrying nearly 500 Soviet trainees, that arrived one per day each day from 10 to 14 April 1945, by which time 2,358 Soviet personnel of what were to become the Soviet Navys 16th Minesweeper Division, and 2nd Submarine Chaser Division, had disembarked, joining 1,350 American personnel. Rear Admiral Boris Dimitrievich Popov, arrived on 11 April, aboard the steamer Sevastopol and took command of Soviet personnel at Cold Bay, who the Soviet Navy designated the 5th Independent Detachment of Soviet Navy Ships. Training and transfers The first 220 Soviet officers and 1,895 enlisted men began training at Cold Bay, on 16 April 1945, divided by ship type and then further divided by individual ship assignment. Although the Soviet personnel took their training very seriously, an immediate challenge for the American instructors was the Soviets complete lack of familiarity with radar, sonar, and the ships propulsion plants, in addition to a lack of Russian-language training manuals. Personnel of the Soviet Purchasing Commission, and 5th Independent Detachment, remedied this by producing Russian-language manuals for use in Project Hula. Material issues also arose in relation to the ships themselves. The Bureau of Ships had not heeded Maxwells request to ensure that all ships to be transferred arrived properly equipped, and early in the program every ship arrived at Cold Bay, without all authorized equipment or with unauthorized equipment still installed. A great deal of required equipment had to be flown into Fort Randall Army Airfield daily, and some ships had to undergo on-the-spot revisions to their authorized equipment lists. A further difficulty was damage to the wooden-hulled ships ‚Äì the auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS) and submarine chasers ‚Äì in the rough seas in the training area. The closest repair facilities for these ships was nearly away at Dutch Harbor, and an auxiliary motor minesweeper and nine submarine chasers had to visit Dutch Harbor, for major repairs, delaying the submarine chaser program by eight days. Despite these difficulties, the first convoy of transferred ships ‚Äì three minesweepers and five auxiliary motor minesweepers ‚Äì departed Cold Bay, for the Soviet Union, on 28 May 1945; the second ‚Äì of three minesweepers and six submarine chasers ‚Äì departed on 30 May, with one of its submarine chasers dropping out at Adak, for repairs, and the third, made up of three minesweepers and seven submarine chasers, left on 7 June 1945. However, poor repair work and supply problems in Seattle, plagued the submarine chaser program, and Maxwell, was forced to arrange for submarine chasers assigned to duty in the U.S. Navys 13th Naval District to substitute for some of those originally scheduled for transfer in order to meet a deadline of having all ships transferred by 1 October 1945. Training 100 Soviet officers and 800 enlisted men for the transfer of 30 large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)) in two training cycles began on 7 May 1945, and proved to be the most successful of the Project Hula training programs. The first cycle lasted 15 days, and experience gained in it allowed the second cycle to be cut to nine days. The fourth convoy to depart Cold Bay, consisting of four LCI(L)s, two minesweepers, and six submarine chasers, which left on 11 June 1945, was the first to include LCI(L)s, and all Soviet LCI(L) crews departed for the Soviet Union, aboard their ships before the end of July 1945. The 30 Tacoma-class patrol frigates were the largest, most heavily armed, and most expensive ships scheduled for transfer in Project Hula. The first 572 officers and men of the Soviet Navys 10th Frigate Division, arrived at Cold Bay, on 12 June 1945, aboard the Soviet steamer Felix Dzerzhinski and began training to take over the patrol frigates on 14 June, the same day that the first nine patrol frigates ‚Äì , , , , , , , , and ‚Äì arrived at Cold Bay. Another 570 personnel of the 10th Frigate Division, arrived on 15 June 1945, aboard the Soviet steamer Chaikovskii. The first nine patrol frigates to arrive, plus , which arrived at Cold Bay, on 27 June 1945, made up the first group of 10 frigates transferred to the Soviets on 12 July 1945; they departed Cold Bay, in convoy on 15 July 1945. The four floating workshops (YR) slated for transfer all were taken under tow by Soviet merchant ships calling at Cold Bay, on their way from the U.S. West Coast to the Soviet Far East, during the summer of 1945. Relations between Soviet and American personnel at Cold Bay, remained amicable and cooperative throughout the life of the project. The best-performing Soviet trainees were retained at Cold Bay, to serve alongside the American instructors in training other Soviet personnel who arrived later. By 31 July 1945, Project Hula had transferred 100 of the planned 180 vessels to the Soviet Union. Soviet Union declares war As Stalin had promised, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan, on 8 August 1945, exactly three months after the capitulation of Germany, and began an offensive against Japanese forces in Northeast Asia the next day. Although an armistice halted combat between the other Allies and Japan on 15 August 1945, (14 August on the other side of the International Date Line in Cold Bay) and Japan formally surrendered to the Allies aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, Soviet offensive operations continued until 5 September 1945, by which time Soviet forces had overrun the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, in Manchuria, the northern half of Korea, the Japanese province of Karafuto, on the southern half of Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. The latter two lands were annexed by the Soviet Union. The USSR occupation of just the northern part of Korea, contributed to the origins of the Korean War just 5 years later. Despite the Soviet Unions now-overt participation in the war, Project Hula remained secret and subject to strict censorship. The Soviet entry into the war seemed if anything to make Soviet-American cooperation at Cold Bay, even better than before, and Maxwell and Popov, worked to accelerate training and transfers to get ships into Soviet hands as quickly as possible in support of the Soviet offensive. Previously trained Soviet personnel returned to Cold Bay, to serve as nucleus crews for newly transferred ships, and the training of their fellow crewmen was cut to the minimum necessary for the Soviet crews to take their vessels home. On 25 August 1945, Navy Detachment 3294, completed the final cycle of classroom training for Soviet personnel. At Cold Bay, on the day of Japans surrender, 2 September 1945, the Soviet Navy took control of the patrol frigates and . On 4 September 1945, the last four ships to be transferred in Project Hula ‚Äì the patrol frigates , , , and ‚Äì were commissioned into the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay. Project Hula concludes On 5 September 1945, a few hours after Soviet forces completed their occupation of the Kuril Islands, Maxwell received orders to cease transfers of ships other than those for which Soviet crews already were in training; this cancelled the transfer of two patrol frigates, five auxiliary motor minesweepers, and 24 submarine chasers. The stop-transfer order caught some of the ships scheduled for transfer, including the patrol frigates and , while they were at sea bound from the U.S. West Coast to Cold Bay. The other ships turned back, but Annapolis and Bangor pressed on to Cold Bay, took aboard American personnel requiring transportation to the continental United States, and steamed back to Seattle. At Cold Bay, Soviet and American personnel set about the business of shutting down Project Hula. The last four patrol frigates transferred remained at Cold Bay, for additional training and shakedown before departing for the Soviet Union, in the final Project Hula convoy on 17 September 1945. The remaining personnel of the Soviet Navys 5th Independent Detachment, ‚Äì Popov, his staff, and the partially trained crews of the 31 ships no longer scheduled for transfer ‚Äì departed Cold Bay, for the Soviet Union, aboard the Soviet steamer Carl Schurz on 27 September 1945. Maxwell, decommissioned the base at Cold Bay, on 30 September 1945. Training and transfer results Project Hula was \\"the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II.\\" During the 142 days between the commencement of training activities at Cold Bay on 16 April 1945, and the transfer of the last four ships there on 4 September 1945, U.S. Navy Detachment 3294, trained some 12,000 Soviet Navy personnel ‚Äì about 750 officers and 11,250 enlisted men ‚Äì and transferred 149 ships and craft ‚Äì 28 patrol frigates (PF), 24 minesweepers (AM), 30 large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)), 31 auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS), 32 submarine chasers (SC), and four floating workshops (YR) ‚Äì at Cold Bay. In Soviet service, the patrol frigates were redesignated storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort vessel\\") and received the designation \\"EK\\"; minesweepers and auxiliary motor minesweepers were redesignated ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and received the designation \\"T\\"; large infantry landing craft were redesignated desantiye suda (\\"landing ship\\") and received the designation \\"DS\\"; and submarine chasers were redesignated bolshiye okhotniki za podvodnimi lodkami (\\"large submarine hunter\\"), and received the designation \\"BO\\". None of the ships received names in Soviet service. Popov, reported to Maxwell, at Cold Bay, in late August 1945, that LCI(L)s transferred under Project Hula played an important role in the Soviet assault on the Kuril Islands, just ten days after arriving at Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky, and that other Project Hula ships had taken part in Soviet operations against the Japanese in northern Korea, and on southern Sakhalin Island. He did not mention losses. Five ships transferred in Project Hula, all former LCI(L)s ‚Äì DS-1 (ex-), DS-5 (ex-), DS-9 (ex-), DS-43 (ex-), and DS-47 (ex-) ‚Äì were lost in combat during the operations, all of them sunk by Japanese coastal artillery on 18 August 1945, during the Soviet landings on Shumshu. The transfer dates for ships under Project Hula follow. The U.S. Navy decommissioned each ship on the day of transfer and the Soviet Navy simultaneously commissioned it. Each ship is identified by its U.S. Navy name and designation, followed by its Soviet Navy designation.All information from . Russell's table on page 39 places the final transfer date of patrol frigates on 9 September 1945, but this contradicts the text on pages 34‚Äì35 placing it on 4 September 1945 and stating that transfers were ordered to halt as of 5 September 1945. Not included are the four floating workshops (YRs), which were transferred to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1945. ;17 May 1945 *Auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS): (T-522), (T-523), (T-525), (T-526) ;21 May 1945 *Minesweepers (AM): (T-272), (T-274), (T-275), (T-276), (T-277), (T-277), (T-278) ;22 May 1945 *Minesweepers: (T-271), (T-273), (T-279), (T-280), (T-281) *Auxiliary motor minesweeper (YMS): (T-524) ;26 May 1945 *Submarine chasers (SC): (BO-304), (probably BO-310), (BO-308), (BO-303), (BO-306), (BO-301) ;5 June 1945 *Submarine chasers (SC): (BO-307), (BO-311), (BO-318), (BO-316), (BO-313), (BO-305), (BO-312), (BO-317) ;6 June 1945 *Auxiliary motor minesweeper (YMS): (T-521) ;10 June 1945 *Large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)): (DS-38), (DS-45), (DS-34), (DS-35), (DS-39), (DS-31), (DS-36), (DS-40), (DS-41), (DS-42), (DS-43), (DS-44), (DS-32) * Submarine chasers (SC): (BO-319), (BO-309), (BO-314), (BO-320), (BO-315) ;14 June 1945 *Large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)): (DS-37), (DS-33) ;12 July 1945 *Patrol frigates (PF): (EK-1), (EK-2), (EK-3), (EK-6), (EK-5), (EK-8), (EK-10), (EK-9), (EK-4), (EK-7) ;19 July 1945 *Minesweepers (AM): (T-331), (T-332), (T-333), (T-334), (T-335), (T-336) *Auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS): (T-593), (T-592), (T-590), (T-594), (T-588), (T-595), (T-596), (T-589), (T-591), (T-597), (T-598), (T-599) *Submarine chaser (SC): (BO-302) ;29 July 1945 *Large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)): (DS-8), (DS-2), (DS-3), (DS-4), (DS-5), (DS-46), (probably DS-7), (DS-48), (DS-9), (DS-10), (DS-50), (DS-47), (DS-1), (DS-6), (DS-49) ;2 August * Auxiliary motor minesweeper (YMS): (T-527) ;16 August 1945 *Patrol frigates (PF): (EK-11), (EK-16), (EK-13), (EK-12), (EK-14), (EK-15) ;17 August 1945 *Minesweepers: (T-285), (T-283), (T-339), (T-338), (T-337), (T-284) *Auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS): (T-603), (T-604), (T-602), (T-601), (T-600), (T-605) *Submarine chasers (SC): (BO-321), (BO-322), (BO-325), (BO-324), (BO-323), (BO-326), (BO-332), (BO-327), (BO-328), (BO-331), (BO-329) ;26 August 1945 * Patrol frigates (PF): (EK-17), (EK-22), (EK-18), (EK-19), (EK-20), (EK-21) ;27 August 1945 * Auxiliary motor minesweepers (YMS): (T-608), (T-609), (T-606), (T-607), (T-610) ;2 September 1945 * Patrol frigates (PF): (EK-25), (EK-27) * Submarine chaser (SC): (BO-335) ;3 September 1945 * Auxiliary motor minesweeper (YMS): (T-611) ;4 September 1945 * Patrol frigates (PF): (EK-26), (EK-28), (EK-29), (EK-30) Aftermath Under U.S. law, all ships transferred to foreign countries under Lend-Lease had to be returned to U.S. custody after the conclusion of World War II, and in February 1946, the United States began negotiations with the Soviet Union, for the return of transferred ships. However, relations between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, deteriorated rapidly after the end of World War II, as the Cold War began, hindering the return of ships. Subtracting the five former LCI(L)s lost in combat and an auxiliary motor minesweeper that sank in 1945, 143 Project Hula ships were subject to return to the United States. On 7 March 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal, presented the United States Department of State with a list of 480 warships that the United States Department of the Navy wanted the Soviet Union to return, including all 28 patrol frigates transferred under Project Hula. In 1948, the Soviet Union finally agreed to return the patrol frigates, and it handed over 27 of them in October and November 1949; the 28th, EK-3, ex-USS Belfast (PF-35), had been driven aground and nearly sunk in a storm off Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on 17 November 1948, was beyond economical repair, and was never returned, instead being scrapped in the Soviet Union, in 1960. Negotiations over the Department of the Navys other major focus, the 25 surviving former LCI(L)s, dragged on longer, but in the end the Soviets returned 15 of them to the United States, in 1955. By 1957, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence reported that of the 149 Project Hula ships, only 18 of those still in Soviet custody ‚Äì nine minesweepers (AM), five submarine chasers (SC), and the four floating workshops (YR) ‚Äì remained serviceable. Ironically, the U.S. Navy actually did not want to take delivery of many of the Lend-Lease ships because they were no longer useful and would be expensive to take custody of and dispose of; as a result some ships underwent a merely administrative transfer to U.S. custody to meet the letter of the law and then were sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, or destroyed in Soviet waters under the direct observation of American naval authorities. The Soviet Union transferred two auxiliary motor minesweepers to the People's Republic of China, but all of the other 97 Project Hula ships remaining in Soviet hands after the return of the 15 LCI(L)s in 1955, were either sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, (81 ships) or (in the case of the other 16 ships) destroyed off its coast, presumably off Nakhodka.  Soviet lack of adequate naval capability Many people believed that Project Hula would have given the Soviet Union the ability to invade the Japanese home islands. However, many historians agreed it was still not enough for the Soviets to pose a serious threat to Tokyo. As of 20 December 1945, 3,741 American lend-lease ships were given to the Soviets, 36 of which were capable of mounting an invasion of Japan. This was clearly not enough to pose a large threat to Japanese forces in the mainland. Given how the Soviets conducted in their invasions of southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, with limited U.S. Navy ships and landing craft, it was likely that Soviets would not have succeeded in taking entire Japanese-occupied territories, including Hokkaido. For example, the Soviets, in their invasion of southern Sakhalin, on August 11, outnumbered the Japanese by a factor of three but they were unable to advance due to strong Japanese resistance. The Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands took place after Japan's capitulation on August 15, and despite this, the Japanese forces in these islands resisted quite fiercely (although some of them were unwilling to fight due to Japan's surrender on August 15). In the Battle of Shumshu, the Soviets had 8,821 troops unsupported by tanks and without larger warships. The well-established Japanese garrison had 8,500 troops and fielded around 77 tanks. The Battle of Shumshu lasted for five days in which the Soviets lost over 516 troops and five of the sixteen landing ships (most of these ships were ex-U.S. Navy) to Japanese coastal artillery while the Japanese lost over 256 troops. At the end, Soviet casualties totaled up to 1,567 while the Japanese suffered 1,018 casualties, making it the only battle in the 1945 Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War where Russian losses exceeded the Japanese. If the war had actually gone on, the death toll among the Soviets in their invasion of the Kuril Islands would have been far higher and the logistics supply would be severely strained due to lack of Soviet capability to supply its forces and equipment overseas. At the time of Japan's surrender, an estimated 50,000 Japanese soldiers were stationed in Hokkaido. During World War II, the Japanese had a naval base at Paramushiro, in the Kuril Islands, and several bases in Hokkaido. The Sea of Japan was patrolled by the Imperial Japanese Navy day and night. If there was any Soviet Navy presence on those waters, the Japanese would have been aware of it. Since Japan and the Soviet Union were neutral up until the Soviets' declaration of war on Japan, on August 8, 1945, the Port of Vladivostok, and other seaports in the Soviet Union, were constantly watched by Japanese observers based in their own held territories in Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. The Yalta Conference gave the Soviet Union the right to invade the southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, but not the Japanese home islands. According to Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar, detailed Soviet plans for the Far East invasions had been carefully drawn up, except that the landing for Hokkaido \\"existed in detail\\" only in Stalin's mind and that it was \\"unlikely that Stalin had interests in taking Manchuria and even taking on Hokkaido. Even if he wanted to grab as much territory in Asia as possible, he was too much focused on establishing a blockhead in Europe compared to Asia.\\" Two days before Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945, Commissar Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Meretskov, suggested that they should invade Hokkaido, but the majority of Soviet diplomats and officers, including Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Zhukov, opposed it on the grounds that they still didn't have enough landing craft and equipment needed for the invasion; thus, if they tried anyway, it would dangerously expose their troops to a fierce Japanese defense, and furthermore it would violate the Yalta agreement with the Western Allies, which forbade the Soviets from invading the Japanese home islands.

The series, which was launched on February 7, 2002, comprises 12 full games, 7 minigames, and 1 canceled game. The most recently released title was published in June 2018. The games all feature a simple click-button interface requiring the player to determine the correct combination of buttons to click to maximize visual reward and ultimately to achieve the good ending. Graphically spare and minimalist, GROW games employ a cute aesthetic and often include creatures and characters taken from On's other games like those in the Tontie Series. The games have received largely positive reviews with the main criticisms restricted to a formulaic quality of the main series and a lack of replay value. Positive reviews have emphasized the games' simple whimsy and innocent aesthetics and the creativity of the underlying concept. Although widely recognized as a puzzle game, a paper by the 2008 IGDA noted that \\"the Grow series is an example of a game that defined a new genre of games.\\"Lee, Michelle. 2008-2009 Casual Games White Paper - Ad Supported Web Games: Art History. 2008 IGDA. November 2008. Gameplay The player is presented with a number of buttons related to characteristics of the game world. Clicking a button will usually result in a change to the corresponding part of the game world. The puzzle is to determine the order in which to push the buttons to achieve the good ending. The number of buttons in each game varies between 5 and 12. The number of different combinations possible with each additional button, however, increases according to a factorial progression.Fronczak, Tom. Monday Mind Teasers: GROW Games. Destructoid. 10 August 2009. Thus, a game with 5 buttons will have 120 possible combinations (of which only one leads to the good ending) and a game with 12 buttons will have 479 million possible combinations. Components of the game world go through a leveling up process after each selection is made. Because previously engaged components of the game world remain on the screen, later button pushes will often allow new areas of the environment to interact with previous areas. These interactions may cause the environmental component to level up, level down, or remain the same. By keeping track of which buttons have which effects on the other parts of the game world, the player can home in on the good ending by maximizing the visual reward.Meer, Alec. Eight-Step Plan. Rock, Paper, Shotgun. 15 September 2007. Once all components have been maximized and the world is fully developed, the player wins.McDougall, Jaz. \\"'Cultivate surreal stories in the Grow series\\".

History The first game that was released in the GROW series was GROW ver.3 in February 2002. This was the third version of a single game that On had been developing (the first two versions were substantially identical to ver.3 except that they lacked music and a score) in 2001-2002.On. GROW ver.2(GAME). Eyezmaze.com. 12 June 2006. Upon release, On decided to retain the \\"ver.3\\" part of the title rather than naming the game simply GROW as he had originally intended. On continued to develop other games in the GROW series after this point including GROW Cube and GROW ORNAMENT, and in 2005-2006 his games had become popular enough with gamers that Western gaming press began to cover his work.On. The article of GROW appeared in \\"Superjuegos Xtreme\\".. Eyezmaze.com. 30 September 2006. After receiving numerous questions regarding why the GROW series seemed to begin with \\"ver.3\\" instead of \\"ver.1\\" and where \\"ver.1\\" and \\"ver.2\\" could be located, On decided to recreate new reduced versions for ver.2 and ver.1 which he released in that order in June and December 2006 respectively. With growing English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, and French interest in the games, On translated the website into the relevant languages in April 2009.On. Multilingualization in EYEZMAZE..

A vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, Paxton's style draws from blues and jazz music before World War II and was influenced by Fats Waller and \\"Blind\\" Lemon Jefferson. According to Will Friedwald in The Wall Street Journal, Paxton is \\"virtually the only music-maker of his generation ‚Äî playing guitar, banjo, piano and violin, among other implements ‚Äî to fully assimilate the blues idiom of the 1920s and '30s, the blues of Bessie Smith and Lonnie Johnson.\\" Background Originally from the Watts district of Los Angeles, Paxton's grandparents moved from Louisiana to California in 1956. These southern roots would have an influence on Paxton as a young boy. After spending time listening to his hometown blues radio station, as well as the old Cajun and country blues songs his grandmother used to sing, Paxton became interested in these early sounds, developing a breadth of knowledge pertaining to such music along the way. He began playing the fiddle when he was twelve, only to pick up the banjo two years later. As a teenager, he began to go blind, losing most of his eyesight by the age of 16. Since his childhood, he has added piano, harmonica, Cajun accordion, ukulele, guitar, and the bones to his musical arsenal, although the banjo was his first serious instrument. In addition to blues and jazz, he uses these instruments to play ragtime, country blues, and Cajun music. He is Jewish. He graduated from Verbum Dei High School in 2007. As a Verbum Dei student, he had a corporate work-study assignment at the Braille Institute of America. In 2007, Paxton moved to upstate New York to attend Marist College and soon after began playing gigs in and around the Brooklyn area. Although not signed to a record label, he continues to play old-time, blues, and roots festivals throughout the United States, as well as various shows opening for old-time string bands including The Dust Busters. Paxton's talent and contributions to acoustic blues have earned him comparisons to contemporary artists such as Taj Mahal, Keb' Mo', and Corey Harris. Similar to groups such as the Carolina Chocolate Drops, he is one of the few contemporary African-American banjo players touring today. Paxton was named Artistic Director of the Port Townsend Acoustic Blues Workshop and Festival in 2014 by Centrum in Port Townsend, Washington. He succeeded musicians Daryl Davis, Corey Harris and Phil Wiggins in the role. Living Blues magazine placed Paxton on the cover of their issue entitled \\"The Next Generation of the Acoustic Blues,\\" in December 2012. In 2014, he voiced and sang the lines of \\"The Highwayman\\", a character from the fourth episode of Over the Garden Wall, \\"Songs of the Dark Lantern.\\" In 2017, Paxton appeared in the award-winning documentary film The American Epic Sessions, directed by Bernard MacMahon, recording Blind Gary Davis's ‚ÄúCandy Man‚Äù on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.

Neville Jones, (1903‚Äì1970) was an English-born botanist who spent most of his life and career in the United States. He was a professor of botany at the University of Illinois (Urbana) at the time of his death. Biography George Neville Jones was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, England on January 26, 1903, the eldest of seven children (six brothers and a sister). The family moved to Manitoba while he was still very young, and then to Seattle, Washington state, at the end of his high school years. Jones entered the State College of Washington (now the Washington State University, in Pullman, Washington) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930. His father, Alfred Loft Jones, died while George Neville was an undergraduate. He earned Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Washington in Seattle. His doctoral thesis was published as the Flowering Plants and Ferns of Mount Rainier in 1938. He contributed over 1800 specimens to the herbarium at the University of Washington while a student there. G. Neville, as he preferred to be known, was an instructor of biology at Harvard University and a technical assistant at the Arnold Arboretum from 1937 to 1939. He moved to the University of Illinois in 1939, as a taxonomist and curator of the herbarium. Between the years of 1939 and 1968, he contributed approximately 46,000 specimens to the herbarium, as well as publishing the Flora of Illinois in 1945. He produced second and third editions of this work in 1950 and 1963. He became an assistant professor in 1944, and was appointed a Guggenheim Fellow for a study of the botany of the Northwest Coast of North America. Jones died on June 25, 1970, from injuries sustained in a car accident that had occurred on April 14, 1968. He was survived by his wife, Almut Gitter Jones, who was also in the car; by two daughters from a previous marriage, and all his siblings. He and his wife were on their way to Robert Allerton Park, a natural area belonging to the University of Illinois, at the time of the accident.

Its antithesis, \\"two wrongs don't make a right\\", is a proverb used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct as a response to another's transgression. \\"Two wrongs make a right\\" is considered \\"one of the most common fallacies in Western philosophy\\". History The phrase \\"two wrongs infer one right\\" appears in a poem dated to 1734, published in The London Magazine.  Examples  This is an informal fallacy that occurs when assuming that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out. :Speaker A: You shouldn't embezzle from your employer. It's against the law. :Speaker B: My employer cheats on their taxes. That's against the law, too! If Speaker B believes in the maxim \\"the law should be followed,\\" then his unstated premise is that breaking the law (or the wrong) is justified, as long as the other party also does so. Yet if Speaker B believes the maxim \\"it is acceptable to break the law to wrong those who also break the law\\" he is committing no logical fallacy. From the conversation above, it is impossible to know which Speaker B believes. This fallacy is often used as a red herring, or an attempt to change or distract from the issue. For example: :Speaker A: President Williams lied in his testimony to Congress. He should not do that. :Speaker B: But you are ignoring the fact that President Roberts lied in his Congressional testimony! Even if President Roberts lied in his Congressional testimony, this does not establish a precedent that makes it acceptable for President Williams to do so as well (at best, it means Williams is no worse than Roberts). By invoking the fallacy, the contested issue of lying is ignored. The tu quoque fallacy is a specific type of \\"two wrongs make a right\\". Accusing another of not practicing what they preach, while appropriate in some situations, does not in itself invalidate an action or statement that is perceived as contradictory. Criticism Common use of the term, in the realm of business ethics, has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the Journal of Business Ethics. Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of retribution by Thomas Hobbes. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well, since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property, but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes another's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse to recklessly violate ethical rules. Conservative journalist Victor Lasky wrote in his book It Didn't Start With Watergate that, while two wrongs do not make a right, if a set of immoral things are done and left unprosecuted, this creates a legal precedent. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away with them as well. Lasky uses as an analogy the situation between John F. Kennedy's wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. (which led to nothing) and Richard Nixon's actions in Watergate (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).It Didn't Start With Watergate. Victor Lasky.  Two wrongs don't make a right  Two wrongs don't make a right is a proverb that contradicts this fallacy - a wrongful action is not a practical or morally appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action.
