The approach in Hieroglyphs Without Mystery is an abbreviated Gardiner's Sign List, categorized and described as a 'study reference appendix'-(16 pages), with many of the most common or more important Egyptian hieroglyphs. With the older styles and outlines of hieroglyphs being redone and rethought by modern Egytologists, new approaches to books on the Egyptian language and the hieroglyphs have been tried.

It tells the story of a bloody work and downfall of a Soviet Cheka security official involved in mass executions during the Russian Civil War. Plot The film is set during the Russian Civil War in the period of the Red Terror. In a provincial Cheka (the All-Russian Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage) office in an unnamed small town, a routine bureaucratic work is taking place. Every day, a Cheka troika tribunal made of director Srubov and his assistants Pepel and Katz reads out a long list of all kinds of real and perceived counter-revolutionaries and class enemies. Those arrested are always immediately found guilty and the sentence, regardless of the accusation, gender and age of the person, is the same - to be shot. The terrible conveyor of death operates in the basement, overseen by Srubov: the prisoners are systematically taken out of their cell, ordered to undress, placed against the wall in fives, and shot, usually in the back of the head. Following the secret killings, the naked corpses are then dragged by feet through a special window in the cellar, loaded into a truck, and taken away, to forever disappear without a trace. Srubov, a young man from an intelligentsia family, philosophically talks of the historical necessity of extermination in the service of the Bolshevik Revolution. He is highly organised, dutiful, ruthless, and absolutely loyal to the cause. Eventually, however, pangs of conscience become so unbearable to Srubov that, after his own father is shot by his Cheka comrade and personal friend Katz, he experiences a nervous breakdown and is committed to a mental asylum. Medical examination reveals a stigma in the shape of a bullet scar on the back of his head. In a sequence ominously similar to the executions, he is ordered to undress, placed against the wall, and sprayed with water from a hose. Cast * Igor Sergeyev as Andrey Pavlovich Srubov * Aleksei Poluyan as Ian Karlovich Pepel * Mikhail Vasserbaum as Isaac \\"Isa\\" Katz * Sergey Isavnin as Khudonogov * Vasili Domrachyov as Solomin * Aleksandr Medvedev as Mudynya * Aleksandr Kharashkevich as Boje * Igor Golovin as the commandant *Nina Usatova as the cleaner *Sergey Migitsko as Captain Klimenko's relative History The Chekist was adapted by Jacques Baynac from Vladimir Zazubrin's short story \\"–©–µ–ø–∫–∞\\" (known variably in English as \\"Sliver\\", \\"The Splinter\\", or \\"The Chip\\"), which was written in 1923 but has remained unpublished until the Glasnost era in 1989 when it was printed in the journal Sibirskie Ogni. Zazubrin, a former Bolshevik infiltrator of the Okhrana and veteran of both sides of the Civil War, himself fell victim to the Great Purge and was himself arrested and executed in 1937, along with Valerian Pravdukhin who wrote the preface for the original intended publication. The film was produced by Oleg Konkov and Guy Seligman for the French TV ARTE. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.  Reception  Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film Festival, said of the film: \\"Rogozhkin eventually penetrates into the psychotic mind of the Chekist with a moment of sublime insight, reminiscent of Bertolucci's equally disturbing portrait of the fascist killer in The Conformist.

Content The film poses numerous questions about the events surrounding the attacks and presents alternative theories for who was behind them. The film implicates the Metropolitan Police and Tony Blair and claims that the true perpetrators of the attacks were MI5 and / or Mossad, who tricked the four men into travelling to London with rucksacks, in order to provide CCTV footage later to be used as evidence in the investigation of the attacks. It alleges that the four bombers were actually murdered in Canary Wharf and did not die as suicide bombers in the explosions on the three tube trains and one bus where the attacks took place. This thesis was taken up in the book on the London Bombings Terror on the Tube. Critical reception An episode of the BBC programme The Conspiracy Files titled \\"7/7\\", which first aired on 20 June 2009, addressed part of the claims made in the film as well as other theories surrounding the attacks.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lkp01 The programme also revealed Muad'Dib to be John Hill from Sheffield, tracking him down to an address in Kells in the Republic of Ireland. Release The film was first released on the Internet on 5 November 2007, two years after the attacks. Physical copies were also sent to many of the people connected with the attacks. The film was shown on 9 September 2009 at the 9/11 Film Festival at the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland, California. On 7 July 2012 and 7 July 2019 updated and expanded versions were released. Legal action Hill was arrested and extradited to the United Kingdom on a charge of perverting the course of justice for sending DVDs of the film to the judge and jury foreman in a trial linked to the attacks. He was acquitted on 12 May 2011.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in April 1991, and was reprinted in February 1998. Plot King Anaximander of Sark calls in his high priest Khumanos to talk about a drought ravaging their city. After the ritual sacrifice of many high priests, Anaximander decides that a larger offering to their god, Voltantha, is required. He directs Khumanos to sacrifice Qjara, a more prosperous city to the north. To do this correctly, Khumanos seeks out Solon in the desert, to which he expresses doubts about the mission. Solon sees Khumanos' compassion as a weakness and shows him the 'Sword of Onothimanos, which is just a rusted blade. Khumanos becomes emotionless and devoted to the mission. So much so that he kills Solon because he outlived his usefulness. Conan is on the outskirts of Qjara awaiting a caravan to Shadizar. He is invited into the carvan sector of Ojara by some local children. He settles down in a bar and meets Afriandra in disguise. She proves her precognitive ability by correctly predicting the death of a nearby patron. When Zaius comes to the bar looking for her, Conan provides a distraction by taunting him. Zaius says he is not worth the effort. Conan begins a romance with Afrianda, which offends Zaius. The two men have a quick fistfight which Conan is winning, which Afrianda implores him to stop. Conan demands a formal duel which Zaius rejects on the basis of Conan not being a citizen. After Conan defends Qjara's gates from a nomad attack, he becomes an honorary citizen and uses the opportunity to challenge Zaius to ritual combat. Zaius accepts. Meanwhile, King Anaximander begins a diplomatic mission to Qjara. He witnesses proof of what he thinks of as Qjara's debauchery and asks the king and queen for permission to set up a temple to Voltantha in the city. Qjara's royalty goes one better, proposing a \\"marriage\\" between the goddess Saditha and Voltantha. The deal is done, and Khumanos begins his work. Khumanos bids slaves to mine three veins of glowing green rock from a Sarkian mountain. Extended exposure to this rock causes sores and cancer and even death. Keeping the rocks of the three veins separate, the slaves refine it into three separate statues. These three statues are hoisted onto carts and sent by three different routes to Qjara, avoiding populated areas and going through the wastelands. Despite the heat and hard labor, Khumanos insists the carts be driven by human labor with limited breaks. In Qjara, Conan prepares for his duel. Zaius preens and postures for the crowd, angering Conan. When the duel begins, Zaius' first stroke cuts off his own head. Not recognizing this as a ritual suicide, Conan begins ridiculing Zaius for backing away from the fight. This angers the royalty and forces them to cast him out of the city.

Piperaquine was developed under the Chinese National Malaria Elimination Programme in the 1960s and was adopted throughout China as a replacement for the structurually similar antimalarial drug chloroquine. Due to widespread parasite resistance to piperaquine, the drug fell out of use as a monotherapy, and is instead used as a partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy. Piperaquine kills parasites by disrupting the detoxification of host heme. Medical uses Piperaquine is used in combination with dihydroartemisinin for the treatment of malaria. This combination is one of several artemisinin combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This combination is also recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of severe malaria after administration of artesunate. Piperaquine is also registered for use in some countries in combination with arterolane. However, this combination is not recommended by the World Health Organization due to insufficient data.. Contraindications Like chloroquine, piperaquine can prolong the QT interval. Although large randomized clinical trials have not revealed evidence of cardiotoxicity, the World Health Organization recommends not using piperaquine in patients with congenital QT prolongation or who are on other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Like chloroquine, piperaquine is thought to function by accumulating in the parasite digestive vacuole and interfering with the detoxification of heme into hemozoin. Resistance Parasites that survive piperaquine treatment have been increasingly reported since 2010, particularly in Southeast Asia. The epicenter of piperaquine resistance appears to be western Cambodia where in 2014 over 40% of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatments failed to eliminate parasites from the patient's blood. Characterizing piperaquine-resistant parasites has been technically challenging, as parasites that survive piperaquine treatment in patients appear to remain sensitive to piperaquine in vitro; i.e. piperaquine appears to have the same IC50 in sensitive parasites and resistant parasites. The mechanism by which parasites become resistant to piperaquine remains unclear. Amplification of the parasite proteases plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3, both involved in degrading host hemoglobin, is associated with resistance to piperaquine. Similarly, mutations in a gene related to chloroquine resistance, PfCRT, have been associated with piperaquine resistance; however, parasites that are resistant to chloroquine remain sensitive to piperaquine. In contrast, amplification of the gene for the parasite transporter PfMDR1, a mechanism of parasite resistance to mefloquine, is inversely correlated with piperaquine resistance. Pharmacokinetics Piperaquine is a lipophilic drug and therefore is rapidly absorbed and distributed across much of the body. The drug reaches its maximal concentrations approximately 2 hours after administration. Chemistry Piperaquine is available as a base, and as a water-soluble tatraphosphate salt. History Piperaquine was discovered in the 1960s by two separate groups working independently of one another: the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute in China and the Rhone Poulenc in France. In the 1970s and 1980s piperaquine became the primary antimalarial drug of the Chinese National Malaria Control Programme due to increased parasite resistance to chloroquine. By the late 1980s, the use of piperaquine as an antimalarial monotherapy diminished as increasing parasite resistance to piperaquine was observed. Beginning in the 1990s, piperaquine was tested and adopted as a partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy.

NBBF has been an affiliate of FIBA Africa since 1963, and its offices are located in Abuja and Lagos. FIBA competitions The senior men's Nigerian national basketball team has participated in the FIBA Africa Championship games 17 times, in: 1972, 1978, 1980, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 . Earning one gold, three silver and three bronze metals, and participated twice in the FIBA World Cup, in 1998 and 2006, where they placed 13th and 14th respectively. The last edition of the Africa Championship saw Nigeria national basketball team clinching the gold medal after defeating the dominant Angolan team. This feat has placed the Nigeria national men's basketball team 1st in Africa and 16th in the world ranking while the women national team are placed 6th in Africa and 42nd in the world. This was achieved through painstaking planning of the Board of the federation lead by Tijjani Umar. Recently, the team has enjoyed success, due to an orchestrated recruitment of American college and professional players of Nigerian descent. A team dominated by Nigerian-Americans qualified for the 2006 FIBA World Championship, marking only the second time in the country's history that they qualified to the FIBA World Cup. Eight players on the team that represented Nigeria at the 2009 FIBA AfroBasket tournament were born in the United States. Nigeria also qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics, where their team consisted of 10 Nigerian- Americans, 10 of which were born in the United States. Other competitions Nigeria has won several medals at the All-Africa Games, and placed 4th in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, falling short to 3rd place England. The Nigerian male basketball team D'tigers participated in the 2018 Gold coast common wealth games and lost all games they played. Afrobasket 2015 Champions Nigeria's senior men's basketball teams, a.k.a. D‚ÄôTigers, are finally the champions of Africa following their exploits at the recently held 2015 Afrobasket Men's Championship in Tunisia from August 19‚Äì30, 2015. The victory we are celebrating today did not come easy as the Tijjani Umar-led Board of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) had to face different hurdles on the way to get to this level which other Boards before it strove to attain. The road to today's success actually began in 2013 following the second tenure of Tijjani Umar as president of the NBBF. Despite distractions placed on its way, the Board began work in earnest and went for the best players the country had within and outside the shores of the country. At the Afrobasket in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire in 2013, many basketball faithful looked up to Nigeria to break the stranglehold Angola had on the continent's basketball but injuries and other technical factors scuttled that dream. Not one to take defeat lightly, Umar and his team with contributions from the players, did a self appraisal and came to the conclusion that, the team, with its array of world class players, needed the services of an experienced technical hand to transform the team into the champions they truly are. That was how, American William Voigt was selected from among the names who applied to tinker the Nigerian team. He too, hungry to succeed on his first assignment in Africa, came along with his own staff to complement the Nigerian assistants provided by the NBBF. Three players from the Nigerian league, the DStv Men's Basketball League, were among the preliminary team selected to begin camping in Abuja on July 15, 2015 but visa hitches prevented them from joining the team's pre-tournament training in France and Italy where the team participated in invitational tournaments as well as friendly matches. Painfully though, just when the team was rounding off their training in Italy, the team's pivot, Ike Diogu picked up a calf- muscle injury which eventually ruled him out of the competition. While some basketball pundits saw this as a setback and actually concluded that Nigeria's dream of becoming African Champions had been shattered, Diogu himself, feeling bad though, told his teammates that he was just one person out of the 12 soldiers going to war, pressing it on them that they were capable of beating every contender to the title. The turning point for the team was the loss to host country, Tunisia, in the group stage. NBBF president, Umar told the players in the locker room that the loss was a wake-up call for them to gird their loins and play the best basketball of their lives. From there they never looked back as they took every game in their stride until they met their 2013 nemesis, Senegal who they dispatched in over-time after a grueling game that put the capacity crowd on the edge of their seats. Now in the final, the players were more fired up to end the reign of the Angolans, who had earlier, on the road to the final, lost to Senegal in the group stage. Going into the final, the Director-General of the National Sports Commission (NSC), Mallam Al-Hassan Yakmut had confirmed to the NBBF President, that the Vice President, on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was going to put a call through to the team to wish it good luck on behalf of an expectant nation. Minutes before the jump-ball in the final, the team received a call from the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who told the players to believe that they could stop Angola's winning streak and become African champions. With that message at the back of their mind, like the tigers they truly are, they went into the game, the initial bravado by the Angolans notwithstanding, clawed their way back, point after point, making the perennial champions look ordinary in the process until they were finally dethroned by a nine-point victory for Nigeria at 74-65. Their first in the history of the championship and an Olympic ticket in the kitty. They have done the great work, beating the dreaded Angolans and clinching a back to back Olympic ticket. The rest is for the people and government of Nigeria to appreciate and reward this historic feat.

Thes. 25 ; Pollux, viii. 111. The exact divisions between the three classes is uncertain, but the geomori ranked between the wealthy eupatrids, the only class who were permitted to hold the highest civil and religious offices, and the poorer demiourgoi.  Class distinctions  Some scholars have noted that the precise meaning of these classes, as well as the nature of the division, are obscure. Even though one can say that nobles, husbandmen, and artisans belong to the eupatrids, geomori, and demiourgoi classes, respectively, there are no methods to ascertain any particulars respecting the relation in which the geomoroi stood to the two other classes. It is also not known whether an individual can transcend or be demoted to another class such as the case of the poorer nobles who might have fallen into the ranks of the geomori. One, however, could turn to Grecian historians for insight, particularly in the way they described geomori and two other social classes in the Athenian society as \\"quasi equal\\" with the eupatrids exceeding the others in dignity; the geomori exceeded in usefulness; and, the demiourgi exceeded in number.  Geomori concept  The name geomori may either signify independent land-owners, or peasants who cultivated the lands of others as tenants. The geomoroi have, accordingly, by some writers been thought to be free land-owners, while others have conceived them to have been a class of tenants. It seems, however, inconsistent with the state of affairs in Attica, as well as with the manner in which the name geomoroi was used in other Greek states, to suppose that the whole class consisted of the latter only; there were undoubtedly among them a considerable number of freemen who cultivated their own lands, but had by their birth no claims to the rights and privileges of the nobles. What is certain for some historians is that geomori and the social stratification in Attica is similar to the social distinctions adopted by other societies that have emerged from nomadism. There are no recorded political distinctions between the geomoroi and the demiourgoi; and it may either be that there existed none at all or if there were any originally, that they gradually vanished. This would account for the fact that Dionysius (ii. 8) only mentions two classes of Atticans; one corresponding to the Roman patricians, the other to the plebeians. There are sources, however, such as Aristotle whose works indicated that the class divisions by Theseus marked the modification to the constitution in the direction of popular government. Some authors also consider the social divisions as a mechanism to unite the separate communities into a united country by describing the function and privileges of the people who came from these within the new society. In Samos the name geomoroi was applied to the oligarchical party, consisting of the wealthy and powerful.Thucyd. viii. 21; Plut. Quaest. Rom. p. 303; Mtiller, Dor. iii. 1. ¬ß 4. In Syracuse, the aristocratic party was likewise called gamoroi, in opposition to the demos.Herod, vii. 155; Hesych. s. v. Tdjjiopoi; Miiller, Dor. iii. 4. ¬ß 4 ; Gbller, de Situ et Orig. Syrac.

An oak savanna plant community located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States, it is an ecotone (a transitional area) between the tallgrass prairies to the west and the temperate deciduous forests to the east. A part of the Upper Mississippi River basin, it is considered endangered with less than 5% of the original ecosystem remaining intact, due mostly to overgrazing and conversion to agriculture. Fire and disturbance Historically, wildfire has been the primary driver and determinant of the forest dynamics in the plant community. Due to this the resulting canopy structure has been relatively sparse (the basal area ranges approximately from 4 to 29 meters hectare‚àí1). Presence and biodiversity of plant species is largely controlled by the frequency of fire. Typical tallgrass prairie vegetation such as grasses, forbs, shrubs, and sedges, increase with an increase in the amount of fire, whereas tree density and basal area decrease. After European American settlement and the abandonment of fire as a land management regime, most savannas have been converted into closed canopy woodlands, with shade tolerant and fire-intolerant species dominating rather than the historic primary and secondary succession species dependent on fire. Species distribution Trees: * Quercus macrocarpa (Bur oak) * Tilia americana (American basswood) * Acer saccharum (Sugar maple) * Quercus rubra (Red oak) Intact habitat A survey in 1985 concluded that only of oak savanna remain, roughly 0.02% of what is estimated to have existed at the time of European settlement. Highly dispersed and fragmented, none of the present habitat falls under the designation of National Forests but comes under the administration of the states' Department of Natural Resources organizations or federal entities such as the Fish and Wildlife Service. Remaining intact habitat areas include: * Devil's Lake State Park, on the Baraboo Range in south-central Wisconsin * Savanna Army Depot in extreme northwestern Illinois * Parts of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge in eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin * Richard J.

Hamiltonian decompositions have been studied both for undirected graphs and for directed graphs; in the undirected case, a Hamiltonian decomposition can also be described as a 2-factorization of the graph such that each factor is connected. Necessary conditions For a Hamiltonian decomposition to exist in an undirected graph, the graph must be connected and regular of even degree. A directed graph with such a decomposition must be strongly connected and all vertices must have the same in-degree and out-degree as each other, but this degree does not need to be even. The medial graph of the Herschel graph is a 4-regular planar graph with no Hamiltonian decomposition. The shaded regions correspond to the vertices of the underlying Herschel graph. For 4-regular planar graphs, additional necessary conditions can be derived from Grinberg's theorem. An example of a 4-regular planar graph that does not meet these conditions, and does not have a Hamiltonian decomposition, is given by the medial graph of the Herschel graph. Complete graphs Every complete graph with an odd number n of vertices has a Hamiltonian decomposition. This result, which is a special case of the Oberwolfach problem of decomposing complete graphs into isomorphic 2-factors, was attributed to Walecki by √âdouard Lucas in 1892. Walecki's construction places n-1 of the vertices into a regular polygon, and covers the complete graph in this subset of vertices with (n-1)/2 Hamiltonian paths that zigzag across the polygon, with each path rotated from each other path by a multiple of \\\\pi/(n-1). The paths can then all be completed to Hamiltonian cycles by connecting their ends through the remaining vertex. Expanding a vertex of a 2k-regular graph into a clique of 2k vertices, one for each endpoint of an edge at the replaced vertex, cannot change whether the graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition. The reverse of this expansion process, collapsing a clique to a single vertex, will transform any Hamiltonian decomposition in the larger graph into a Hamiltonian decomposition in the original graph. Conversely, Walecki's construction can be applied to the clique to expand any Hamiltonian decomposition of the smaller graph into a Hamiltonian decomposition of the expanded graph. This expansion process can be used to produce arbitrarily large vertex-transitive graphs and Cayley graphs of even degree that do not have Hamiltonian decompositions. The directed case of complete graphs are tournaments. Answering a conjecture by Paul Kelly from 1968, Daniela K√ºhn and Deryk Osthus proved in 2012 that every sufficiently large regular tournament has a Hamiltonian decomposition. Number of decompositions Every 4-regular undirected graph has an even number of Hamiltonian decompositions. More strongly, for every two edges e and f of a 4-regular graph, the number of Hamiltonian decompositions in which e and f belong to the same cycle is even. If a 2k-regular graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition, it has at least a triple factorial number of decompositions, :(3k-2)\\\\cdot(3k-5)\\\\cdots 7\\\\cdot 4 \\\\cdot 1. For instance, 4-regular graphs that have a Hamiltonian decomposition have at least four of them; 6-regular graphs that have a Hamiltonian decomposition have at least 28, etc. It follows that the only graphs whose Hamiltonian decompositions are unique are the cycle graphs. Computational complexity Testing whether an arbitrary graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition is NP-complete, both in the directed and undirected cases. The line graphs of cubic graphs are 4-regular, and have a Hamiltonian decomposition if and only if the underlying cubic graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. As a consequence, Hamiltonian decomposition remains NP-complete for classes of graphs that include line graphs of hard instances of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. For instance, Hamiltonian decomposition is NP- complete for the 4-regular planar graphs, because they include the line graphs of cubic planar graphs. On the other hand, this equivalence also implies that Hamiltonian decomposition is easy for 4-regular line graphs when their underlying cubic graphs have easy Hamiltonian cycle problems. Random regular graphs of even degree almost surely have a Hamiltonian decomposition, and more strongly there is a randomized polynomial time algorithm which, when given as input a random regular graph of even degree, almost surely finds a Hamiltonian decomposition in it.

Novel of Polish history (in Polish Stara ba≈õ≈Ñ. Powie≈õƒá z dziej√≥w Polski) - is a historical novel by popular 19th-century Polish writer J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski published by Gebethner i Wolff (Gebethner & Wolff Publishers) in 1876 in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire. This work was the first novel in Kraszewski's long series of historical novels dealing with various periods in Poland's history. The second edition was published in 1879, in a lavishly illustrated form, with the plates done by then popular illustrator Micha≈Ç Elwiro Andriolli. The manuscript of the novel was destroyed during World War II. The content of the novel refers to old Polish stories and legends, including one about a cruel ruler prince, Popiel. He is one of the novel's main characters, though the author calls him \\"Chwostek\\". The story takes place during the dimly known times of pre-Christian Poland, in the lands of the pagan Polans tribe. The first theme of the novel is the political struggle between Chwostek, his wife Brunhilda and their court, as against the clans and free farmers. The Prince wants to introduce an absolute rule modeled on that of the Holy Roman Emperor, while his subjects want to preserve their freedoms. As the struggle intensifies, The Prince commits ever more cruel acts (mutilations, murders etc.), causing his subjects to openly rebel against his rule. Weaker in warriors and support, The Prince calls for help from his German allies and a civil war rages. Finally Chwostek and his allies are defeated, he and his family die during the siege of his keep, and the clans and free farmers elect a new ruler, Piast the Wheelwright. The second theme of the novel, in addition to political, is the thread of love. Doman, a young but wealthy farmer and warrior, falls in love with beautiful Dziwa. She, however, believes that her calling is to serve the pagan gods, and therefore refuses to become his wife. Doman decides to do anything to win her love. Adaptations The novel has been a subject of many adaptions: * In 1891 Alfred Szczepa≈Ñski published a drama in five parts based on the themes of Stara ba≈õn titled Piast Pierwszy (Piast I) in Vienna, Austria, * In 1900 Julian Baczy≈Ñski published, in Che≈Çmno, his book Kr√≥lewna Ho≈ºa (Princess Buxom) inspired by the Kraszewski's novel. * In 1907 W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski brought to the Lviv's stage his opera titled Stara ba≈õ≈Ñ (An Ancient Tale) based on Kraszewski's work. * In 2003 story was adapted for the screen by the film director Jerzy Hoffman as An Ancient Tale: When the Sun Was a God.

As both a remedy to that absence and a means to encourage unban renewal and development in the provincial capital city of San Miguel de Tucum√°n, the Governor, Luis F. Nougu√©s, organized the construction of a government palace to replace the colonial cabildo then still serving as his offices. The cabildo housed not only the governor's offices; but also a courtroom and small jail.Tucum√°n Turismo: Casa de Gobierno The governor commissioned local architect Domingo Selva, whose design was an eclectic form of French baroque, with an Italianate influence. Following the cabildo's demolition two adjoining properties were purchased, and construction on the palace began in 1908. Completed in 1910, the new government palace was inaugurated on July 9, 1912, in a ceremony led by the Governor, Dr. Jos√© Fr√≠as Silva, and the President of Argentina, Roque S√°enz Pe√±a. The palace at night Facing Plaza Independencia, the city's central square, the building remains one of the most architecturally significant in the region. Its grandiose exterior is matched by an ornate interior, which is probably best known for its sal√≥n blanco (\\"white room\\"). Used historically for official ceremonies, the white room features spiderweb chandeliers and ceiling panels decorated by the Spanish artist, Julio Vila y Prades (recently restored by local sculptor Santos Legname). The remains of one of Tucum√°n's most distinguished sons, Juan Bautista Alberdi, were transferred from their La Recoleta Cemetery resting place (in Buenos Aires) and returned to the province on August 28, 1991, when they were placed in a crypt built for the occasion in the government palace's basement. The palace is open for guided tours.Turismo en Tucum√°n References Governmente Palace Category:1912 establishments in Argentina Category:Government buildings completed in 1912 Category:Government buildings in Argentina Category:Palaces in Argentina Category:Tourist attractions in Tucum√°n Province Category:Baroque Revival architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Tucum√°n Province ","title":"Tucum√°n Government Palace"},{"id":"24004236","text":"MiG-29 may refer to *Mikoyan MiG-29, a Soviet-Russian fighter aircraft *Mig 29 Soviet Fighter, 1989 game by Codemasters *MiG-29 Fulcrum (1990 video game), 1990 combat flight simulation by Domark *MiG-29 Fulcrum (1998 video game), 1998 combat flight simulation by Novalogic ","title":"MiG-29 (disambiguation)"},{"id":"24004238","text":"Lun√©ville-Croismare Airport is an airport in France, located approximately 3 km (2 miles) east-southeast of Lun√©ville in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department. The airport is used for general aviation, with no commercial airline service. History The airbase was constructed during World War II, as an all-weather temporary field, built by the United States Army Air Forces XII Engineer Command during December 1944, after German forces were removed from the area. It was built on a graded surface using Pierced Steel Planking for runways and parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure, plus a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with drinkable water and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. The airfield was known as Lun√©ville Airfield or Advanced Landing Ground Y-2. It was turned over for operational use by the Twelfth Air Force on December 25, 1944. The 324th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolts from the airfield from January through May 1945. With the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, the Americans began to withdraw their aircraft and personnel. Control of the airfield was turned over to French authorities on May 29, 1945. * Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. .

Following a particular Upstate New York animal shelter and its staff over a three-year time span, Wade gives her audience a complex, honest look at the situations that arise when it comes to homeless animals and some of the difficult, controversial decisions that must be made within them. Synopsis Millions of stray and unwanted dogs are born into the world everyday. When these animals have nowhere to go and no one to care for them, it becomes a situation that society needs to make a decision about. Animal shelters have become one solution for the issue of these homeless animals, but then the question becomes, what do we do with them then? This question is controversial, in that not all of them can be adopted. As a result, many animals are euthanized, a fate extremely controversial in itself. Sue Sternberg, the founder of an animal shelter in rural area in upstate New York, does her best to help alleviate this issue. Sternberg and her staff take on countless animals brought to them for shelter and are forced to find ways to deal with making difficult decisions when it comes to them, including whether they will need to be euthanised or kept in the shelter. Some dogs of course are adopted out to loving families, but others remain in the institution for longer periods of time. The staff is also forced to deal with situations such as animals who have a history of aggression, and if it is ethical to keep attempting to place that dog in a home. Since the documentary is filmed over a long period of time, from the perspective of the people actually working in a shelter, the audience gets a unique and honest perspective on topics that can often seem one-sided.When stray dogs are brought to shelters, the employees must determine if the animal is fit to be adopted. Controversies An online community of pet lovers and owners has a forum promoting a boycott of the film. The post claims that controversy surrounding Sternberg is nothing new to the rescue and adoption community. Many people believe strongly in her methods while others find her cruel and violent. It is also stated that a good amount of the public criticism comes from now ex-employees of Rondout Valley shelter and Sternberg who have released information about the employer‚Äôs controversial actions. Subject profile Sue Sternberg, the main subject of the film, is a well-known name in the rescue community. She is a self-proclaimed dog lover, and says ‚ÄúDogs are my life‚Äînot just my own, but all dogs.‚Äù In 1993 she bought a failing boarding kennel, Rondout Valley Animals for Adoption in upstate New York which serves as the setting for the documentary where she promotes and carries out behavioral and temperament assessments. There is existing controversy within the pet and rescue community surrounding Sternberg herself and some of her methods for dealing with dogs in her shelter. Many people believe that her method of testing traumatized dogs is unreliable, and pushes the animals to display aggression. This then deems them ‚Äúunadoptable‚Äù and leads to euthanasia. It is argued that many of the dogs that display aggression only do so because they are continuously prodded, and with a little attention would easily be acceptable for adoption. Those in support of her argue that shelters need some way to determine whether or not dogs are dangerous and should be adopted out which is what she is doing. About the director Cynthia Wade works out of New York City and Massachusetts offices and has directed seven award-winning documentaries, all known for being intimate and emotional. She received a BA cum laude from Smith College and a Master‚Äôs degree from Stanford University in Documentary Filmmaking. Wade has also directed commercials for various non-profit organizations and foundations.Cynthia Wade Productions. ‚ÄúCynthia Wade: Documentary Filmmaker and Cinematographer‚Äù, 2012. Retrieved on 24 February 2013. In a 2003 interview Wade said that she decided to direct Shelter Dogs because she was ‚Äúinterested in doing a film about ethics, where there were no easy answers.‚Äù During the interview she admitted that before the project she saw animal euthanasia in black and white terms, but throughout filming learned about the other aspects involved in the decision. The article also includes that Wade shot the film by herself and bonded with the animals, making it an emotionally traumatic and moving experience.Roeder, Amy. ‚ÄúA Dog‚Äôs Life‚Äù , 01 June 2003.

This site not only gives the general public specific information about the documentary, but also includes helpful information regarding pet adoption in general. It provides links about the adoption process, how to find the right pet, medical issues to consider when adopting, and other pet related information. With this website viewers and those interested in the documentary subject are able to delve deeper and learn more about the things Wade believes are important enough to create films about.Borkan, Mark.‚ÄúShelter Dogs: A Documentary by Cynthia Wade‚Äù , 2004.

The film won the Grand Prize at the Director's View Film Festival, the Audience Award at the Newport International Film Festival, the Best of the Fest award at the Northampton Film Festival and the Audience Award at the Orinda Film Festival. An article from a no kill animal shelter in Minnesota, Animal Ark, was critical of the film. The reviewer claims the documentary ‚Äúfalls short‚Äù and is more about Sternberg and Rondout Kennels than the issue of homeless animals and how to help them. In the article it is said that the staff‚Äôs only solution seems to be to kill the animals and doesn't discuss spay/neuter policies or other issues surrounding the topic. More specifically the author believes Sternberg herself to be cold, and that she brings up many assumptions and misconceptions that could ‚Äúdo more harm to the human community than good.‚Äù It was aired on television as part of the documentary series America Undercover, and aired on HBO in January 2004, continuing to play for the next couple of months on the network.

It was founded in 2005 and is exclusively active in the passenger transport sector. At present Regiotrans run about 200 train services / day. On March 17, 2015, the Romanian Rail Safety Authority revoked the company's Part B safety certificate and the company ceased operations on all routes until further notice. CFR, the national rail carrier has taken over (from March 18, 2015, for the time being) some of the routes; but not all, and those that CFR had taken on operated with a skeleton service. The sudden cessation of Regiotrans services, with virtually no notice, took many travellers by surprise; some passengers being stranded in fields. Their Regiotrans season tickets were honoured by CFR, but clearly only if CFR were providing an emergency replacement. A refund, however, was available for longer period season ticket holders. Particularly in the Banat region, there were no alternative bus routes. Many villages and even substantial towns, therefore, had no practical public transport option. Services restarted on certain routes on the 1st April 2015, the company apparently having obtained the safety certificates following a fast track procedure ( \\"in regim de urgenta\\"). Further re-openings were effected in mid/late April 2015 (for example Ineu‚ÄìCermei), several routes, however, remain closed, following changes in the subsidy allocations and calculation' regulations, that occurred in March 2015. The Company had been experiencing difficulties due to alleged subsidy corruption. Not the least problem faced by its major shareholders and directors, was the fact that a majority shareholder and joint senior executive, Costel Comana somehow managed, after taking drugs, to commit suicide by hanging himself with his shoelaces (\\"cu »ôireturile de la pantofi\\") in a toilet aboard an air flight between Columbia and Costa Rica. Comana had fled Romania for Brazil after the arrest of his co-chief executive (and joint owner of Regioalatori), Iorgu Ganea. Ganea had been arrested and faced prosecution regarding subsidy irregularities. Routes Regiotrans primarily runs local trains. Many of the services (especially in the Banat)are very infrequent - with the service between Liebling and Jebel running just once a week until its withdrawal on 1 April 2015. Indeed, a number of services appear to have been withdrawn from this date, for example: http://www.regiotrans.ro/mersul--trenurilor-buzias-gataia-jamu-mare. Others lines have had their services drastically reduced: for example between Praid and BƒÉlƒÉu»ôeri (on the line Praid‚ÄìBlaj) there is now only one train per day in each direction which makes a round trip from Praid for any purpose impossible: http://www.regiotrans.ro/mersul--trenurilor-teius-blaj-tarnaveni-praid.

He compiled the bibliographic section of the Enciclopedia general ilustrada del Pa√≠s Vasco (1970), and the monumental Eusko-bibliographia: diccionario de bibliograf√≠a vasca (10 volumes, 1970‚Äì1981, with further supplements), which has been described as \\"one of the most significant reference works on Basque studies\\".Nancy Zubiri, A Travel Guide to Basque America (2nd edition, University of Nevada Press, 2006), p. 270. Biography Early life and education Juan Manuel Bilbao Azkarreta was born on October 31, 1914 in Cayey, Puerto Rico. His father, Juan Bilbao, born in Getxo (Bizkaia), had emigrated \\"to the Americas\\" at the age of 12, in 1870. There he married Matilde Azkarreta. In 1917 the family moved to the Basque country, where Jon Bilbao spent his childhood and youth. Bilbao Azkarreta's secondary education was at least partly at the Jesuit college in Bilbao. In 1932 obtained the degree of Bachelor of Science at the University of Valladolid. Between 1932 and 1936 he attended the Universidad Central de Madrid, pursuing studies in Philosophy and Literature, specializing in History. He took a degree in Medieval History of Spain with Latin and Arabic as the language requirements. He then returned to Bilbao, where there were plans to open a Basque University, but after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War he enrolled with the Eusko Gudarosteak (Basque Battalions) as a lieutenant of engineers, serving 1936-1937. First Exile On 20 June 1937, the day after the fall of Bilbao to Nationalist troops, Jon Bilbao managed to escape at night in the motor launch \\"Sagrada Familia\\" from Zierbena (Bizkaia) to Bayonne. Two months later, he embarked in Bordeaux for Guadeloupe, later making his way to Puerto Rico. He made contact with exiled professors such as Mar√≠a Zambrano at the University of Puerto Rico, but in 1938 opted to enroll at Harvard University for further study. He spent many hours in Boston Public Library, sifting through dictionaries, encyclopedias and biographies to fill the filecards that were eventually to form the basis of his monumental Bibliografia Eusko, a standard work of reference in Basque studies. Moving from Boston to New York, he enrolled at Columbia University where he resumed the studies he had begun in Madrid, obtaining his degree in May 1939 with a dissertation on the work of Lope Garc√≠a Salazar, a 15th-century Basque historian, working under Professor Federico de On√≠s. He also followed the courses in Phonetics and Phonology taught by Tom√°s Navarro Tom√°s. In 1940-1942 he pursued doctoral studies at the University of California Berkeley, followed by a period as instructor of Spanish, first at the Institute of Linguistics in South Carolina (1942) and then at Columbia University (1942‚Äì1944), where he was admitted as a doctoral candidate in 1945. Circumstances prevented him from completing his doctorate. He had in 1939 been appointed a deputy director of the \\"Basque Government in Exile\\". In this capacity he was sent on a study and fund-raising trip to Boise (Idaho) in 1940, wrote in support of the Basque cause with M. de la Sota and A. Irala, and worked with the Belgian Office for Latin America as associate editor of the Journal Belge (1944) and Ambos Mundos (1945‚Äì46). His activities in Basque-Belgian co-operation during the struggle against fascism led to him being made a Knight of the Belgian Order of the Crown after the end of the Second World War. In 1943, he was granted U.S. citizenship, registering his name as Jon Bilbao. Return to the Basque Country In 1947, after a decade in exile (1937‚Äì1947), he was able to return to the Basque Country, where he worked for three years (1947‚Äì1950) with the ethnologist J.M. Barandiaran as editorial secretary to Eusko Jakintza (Spanish title Revista de Estudios Vascos). Thanks to his American passport, Jon Bilbao was able to travel to Madrid, where he conducted research in 1949-1950. From 1950 to 1954, J. Bilbao lived in Cuba, where he worked on his book Vascos en Cuba: 1492-1511, published by Ekin in Buenos Aires in 1958. From 1954 he lived in Getxo with his wife and children, and was active for the Basque nationalist cause. In 1958 he was arrested by Franco's police. Thanks to his American passport he was not imprisoned but in 1960 he was declared \\"persona non grata\\" and expelled from the country. Leaving his family in Getxo, he went to live in Biarritz, but after a year was expelled as an undesirable alien by the French police. On 8 December 1960 he decided to return to the U.S. Second Exile Continuing to work on his monumental bibliography, Jon Bilbao taught Spanish at Georgetown University in 1964-1965, and at the Naval Academy in Annapolis (Maryland) in 1966-1968. In 1968 the director of the newly established Center for Basque Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, the young anthropologist William A. Douglass, invited Jon Bilbao to take up the position of instructor in Basque Studies. His academic duties included teaching a course on Basque history, and working to extend UNR's Basque Collection, making it \\"the best library in the Basque diaspora\\", from 3,000 volumes in 1968 to about 25,000 in 1980, the year of his retirement. In 1970 the first volume of his ten-volume Eusko Bibliographia was printed. The work was completed in 1981, and was followed by supplements in 1985 and 1996. In 1970 he was appointed director of the \\"Basque Studies Summer Courses\\", in the decade 1970-1980 was organized five in Ustaritz, Arantzazu Loiola, Vitoria-Gasteiz and O√±ate. He was also one of the organizers of NAFO (North American Basque Organizations, 1972). In the summer of 1971, with his colleague and friend W. A. Douglass, he toured eight Latin American countries, visiting universities, libraries, and Basque centers in search of a wealth of material that would result in the book Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World (1974). It is a history of the Basques in the Americas. Retirement Following his retirement from the University of Reno in 1980 he returned to the Basque Country full of enthusiasm to undertake two new projects: the Institute of Basque Studies Library and Institute for the Study of the Basque Diaspora. During the first two years, the winds were favorable due to the aid of several Basque entities: the three Councils, the Basque Government, the Universities of Reno and the Basque Country and the Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Vitoria who generously allowed him to move to the Institution Sancho el Sabio. It provides in-house library of Getxo and weekly working time will alternate between his people and Vitoria. Over time, the Department of Culture of the Basque Government financial aid is decreasing and J. Bilbao created the \\"International Association of Basque Literature\\" with the help of prominent personalities of Basque culture. Moreover, in 1987 founded the \\"Harrilucea Association for the Study of History\\" with a desire to open a museum and a library in Getxo. Unfortunately some of these plans were the unfinished Symphony \\"Unfinished\\" by Schubert. The initial hopes and expectations were followed the sadness and disappointment in him and some of his friends and collaborators. Marriage and children On 10 February 1945, Jon Bilbao married Marta Saralegui (daughter of a benefactor of the Basque cause in Cuba) in Havana, Cuba, with the president of the Basque Government in Exile as his best man. From this marriage a daughter, Amal, was born in 1948 in Biarritz, and a son, Jon, in 1953 in Havana. His first marriage ending in divorce, he married again in 1985 with an American woman, Gayle Slavin, in Reno (NV). Death and afterward On March 30, 1994 J. Bilbao suffered the first stroke while working in Vitoria and was admitted to the Sanatorium Gorliz in a rehabilitation program. After a second attack that could not be restored, died on May 23 at the age of 79. The Basque newspaper Deia printed three obituaries, one by W. A. Douglass, one by L. White, and one by J. Zulaika. Awards His work was recognized by the Basque institutions and J. Bilbao was distinguished on several occasions: UNR professor emeritus in 1981, corresponding member of the Basque Academy in 1973 and honorary member since June 19, 1987; partner Bascongada of the Society of Friends of the Country since November 20 of 1981; member of the Hall of Fame in 1988 by the Society of Basque Studies in USA, doctor honoris causa by the UPV / EHU since November 9, 1995.

Early life and family Princess Urraca with her mother Princess Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was born on July 14, 1913 at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. She was the sixth and youngest child of Prince Ferdinand Pius of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Calabria (1869‚Äì1960) and his wife Princess Maria Ludwiga Theresia of Bavaria (1872‚Äì1954). Ferdinand Pius was the Head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and pretender to the defunct throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from May 26, 1934 to January 7, 1960. Urraca had five older siblings, four sisters and one brother: Princess Maria Antonietta (1898‚Äì1957), Princess Maria Cristina (1899‚Äì1985), Prince Ruggiero Maria, Duke of Noto (1901‚Äì1914), Princess Barbara Maria (1902‚Äì1927), and Princess Lucia (1908‚Äì2001). Through her father, Urraca was a granddaughter of Prince Alfonso of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Caserta (1841‚Äì1934) and his wife Princess Maria Antonietta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1851‚Äì1938). Urraca was descended from Francis I, King of the Two Sicilies (1777‚Äì1830) through her paternal great-grandfathers, Ferdinand II, King of the Two Sicilies (1810‚Äì1859) and Prince Francis of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Trapani (1827‚Äì1892). Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of Ludwig III, King of Bavaria (1845‚Äì 1921) and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1849‚Äì1919). Urraca chose not to celebrate her birthday, stating: \\"How can a Bourbon celebrate on the day of the Bastille's taking?\\" Adult life As the daughter of the heir-apparent, then head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Urraca regularly represented her family at royal and aristocratic functions and charitable events. She attended the funeral of her great uncle Prince Leopold of Bavaria on October 3, 1930 at St. Michael's Church in Munich. Urraca, her mother, and her sister Lucia attended an afternoon dance tea at the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten and the Hungarian Aid Association's Hungarian Ball in Munich in January 1934. She also took part in the closing events of Munich's Carnival celebrations in February 1936. On April 16, 1936, Urraca attended the wedding of her first cousin Infante Alfonso of Spain, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies to Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma at the Minoritenkirche in Vienna. She was a guest of honor at the Austrian Armed Forces' Spring Parade in April 1936, along with Alfonso XIII of Spain, Princess Maria Anna of Bourbon-Parma, and Prince Elias of Bourbon-Parma. Urraca attended the Baltic Red Cross Ball and the ball of Countess Adelheid Arco-Valley in the Cherubins√§len of the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in February 1938. On October 23, 1957, she attended the wedding of her first cousin Princess Marie Gabrielle of Bavaria and Georg, Prince of Waldburg zu Zeil und Trauchburg in Munich. On the night of January 10, 1957, Urraca was driving her eldest sister Maria Antonietta to her home in Lindau, Germany when their automobile collided with a truck that had skid on ice near Winterthur, Switzerland. Maria Antonietta was killed in the accident and Urraca was seriously injured. Urraca was also an active supporter of Duosicilian historical societies and other royalty and nobility organizations. In October 1993, she attended a conference of over 200 Italian nobles and aristocrats at the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, which advocated for the nobility's renewed leadership in the defense of Catholic principles in political and cultural institutions. Her first cousin once removed and claimant to the Duosicilian throne, Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, was also in attendance. In February 1994, Urraca traveled to Gaeta where she participated in a tribute to the centenary of the death of Francis II, King of the Two Sicilies and an observation of the 133rd anniversary of the conclusion of the Siege of Gaeta which marked the victory of the Kingdom of Sardinia over Two Sicilies.  Death, interment and legacy  Filialkirche St. Peter und Paul cemetery Urraca died on May 3, 1999 in Sigmaringen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. She was interred in the cemetery of the Filialkirche St. Peter und Paul in Rieden, Swabia alongside her sister Maria Antonietta, her parents Ferdinand Pius and Maria Ludwig Theresia, and her brother Ruggiero Maria. Urraca's burial site was marked with a simple wooden cross affixed with a small brass plaque bearing her name, until it was replaced by a large cross- shaped headstone with a similar small brass plaque. In 2013, the Institute of Historical Research of the Two Sicilies held a mass and graveside service at Filialkirche St. Peter und Paul to pay tribute to Urraca on the centenary of her birth and the 14th anniversary of her death.

Parsi was largely made up by Amir Sjarifuddin's former colleagues from the wartime resistance struggle in East Java. Some of them originated in Gerindo ('Indonesian People's Movement'), a leftwing, nationalist and pro-Sukarno group active before the war. There were also some persons, like Abdulmadjid, Moewaladi and Tamzil, who had lived in the Netherlands during the war, and taken part in the anti-fascist resistance struggle there. The primary objective of Parsi was the independence of Indonesia from colonial rule, which was to be followed by the construction of a socialist society.Legge, J. D.

Moreover, the statement lamented the merger with the 'rightwing' and 'reformist' Paras.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia.

Early life Smith was born and brought up in the working-class neighbourhood of Aston Manor, Birmingham, the son of a toolmaker, William Smith and his wife Annie Griffiths, who supplemented the family income by charring. Reggie, as he was generally known, attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Aston; the family were frequently short of money since his father was often ill; to save expense, Smith never told his parents that he needed glasses for his very short sight. Having read David Copperfield at the age of 12 he determined that he wanted to become \\"a teacher to share the wonder of such books with others.\\" Smith went on to Birmingham University, from which he graduated in 1937 with a BA degree with honours in English literature. Smith had a great love of poetry and a phenomenal memory for poems, prose and plays. While at university he founded the Birmingham Socialist Society and met poet Louis MacNeice, at the time an assistant lecturer in classics. He became a lifelong friend. According to MI5 files, Smith was recruited as a Soviet spy by the art historian Anthony Blunt during a visit to Cambridge in 1938. He commented later, \\"I think I presented Anthony Blunt with a conundrum: was I rough trade or was I a gent slumming? I think that it went through his mind that I might make good spy material.\\" Smith was unusual material for a spy; ebullient and friendly, he made no secret of his communist beliefs, and friends reported him unable to keep secrets. His flamboyant character and lifestyle was to cause some concern among other spies, who according to MI5 critiqued his behaviour as not showing \\"the stability or competence that should distinguish a party member\\". Romania, Greece, Egypt, Palestine After tackling multiple temporary jobs including actor, postal worker, archaeologist, editor, and teacher, Smith applied for a post with the British Council, and was posted as lecturer in English in Bucharest, Romania in 1938. He returned on leave to the UK in the summer of 1939, and was introduced to the novelist Olivia Manning by the writer Walter Allen. In preparation for the meeting, Smith had read her work. He admired it greatly, and considered it showed \\"signs of genius\\"; he was also immediately smitten with its author. A few weeks later, on 18 August 1939 the pair were married at Marylebone registry office, with MacNeice and the poet Stevie Smith as witnesses. Unconventional as ever, the bridegroom failed to produce a wedding ring for the ceremony. Throughout their marriage, Smith strongly supported his wife's writing, encouraging and sustaining her during Manning's frequent despondency and discouragement about her success. A few days later, Smith and his bride were recalled to Romania, arriving just as Britain declared war on Germany. Smith was exempt from military service due to his work with the British Council, though it is likely that his poor eyesight would have meant failing the required medical. During their 13 months in Romania, Smith and Manning witnessed the approaching war, including the abdication of King Carol and the rise of Fascism. The couple's experiences were to form the basis of the first two novels of the Fortunes of War, The Great Fortune and The Spoilt City. Smith appears in the novel as the central character of Guy Pringle, a large, extroverted, and gregarious communist who pays little attention to his new wife while lavishing attention and time on everybody else. The Smiths participated regularly in the caf√© society, but Manning often went home early, leaving her new husband to expound earnestly but naively on the merits of communism, including how much better Jews would be well treated in a Russian-occupied Romania, and excusing the Soviet pact with Hitler, and the Red Army's invasion of Finland. Just as in the novels, Smith's name was broadcast by the Gestapo as that of a spy. In October 1940, the couple escaped the rising fascism, fleeing to Athens, Greece. Typically when choosing what to pack Smith chose his books rather than work suits, which he needed for his ongoing lecturing for the British Council. In April 1941, as the German army neared the Greek capital, they were once again forced to flee, this time to Egypt. After a delay, Smith was once again given a teaching posts by the British Council in October 1941, this time at Farouk University in Alexandria. The pair's time spent in Greece and Egypt formed the foundation for the last four novels of the Fortunes of War. In September 1942, the couple moved to Jerusalem, where Smith became the controller of programmes of the Palestine Broadcasting Service, later moving to the post of acting deputy postmaster-general for the Palestine government. Subsequently, released MI5 files say that throughout the war, Smith had been secretly working to increase Soviet influence in the countries where he was posted. Return to the UK At the end of the war in 1945, Smith returned to the UK, where he was appointed as a radio producer in the BBC features department by Laurence Gilliam. According to features producer Douglas Cleverdon, Gilliam \\"genially tolerated\\" Smith's Communist Party membership. In 1947, he was identified by MI5 as a \\"secret member of the CPGB\\" (Communist Party of Great Britain) and part of a communist cell at the BBC in 1947, and as a result his movements were followed and his telephone bugged. An MI5 officer noted that \\"Reggie has paraded his opinions (so) flamboyantly that his friends thought that he was consequently in danger of losing his job.\\" Indeed, as the Cold War developed, fears of a communist in the features department led him to being transferred to the drama department in 1954. Following the Soviet invasion of Hungary, Smith resigned his Communist Party membership. Given a free hand and liberty, Smith flourished as a radio producer, in what is considered a golden period for radio. Important work from his BBC days include The Easter Rising, 1916 (1966) about the Irish uprising, and The Pump (1972), a documentary about a major heart operation. He was a kind, generous and enthusiastic man, well known for finding parts in his productions for anybody who seemed to need one. Harold Pinter and Richard Burton were among those he helped in the early days of their careers. He was also well known for his passionate enthusiasm for chess, cricket and rugby, and he would sometimes disappear from a production midway through the day to attend a match. Smith continued his socialising ways, spending hours in the pub with seasoned drinkers such as Louis MacNeice, Dylan Thomas, Bob Pocock, and Bertie Rodgers, always in the public bar, never the saloon, due to his Marxist principles. He would often announce that he was \\"off to the pub\\" at dinner parties at his own home, sometimes taking a male guest and sometimes not. He was also a considerable womaniser, and had numerous affairs throughout his married life, though neither he nor Manning contemplated divorce. Final years Smith took early retirement from the BBC, and in 1973 was appointed professor of liberal and contemporary studies at the New University of Ulster. He held the post until his retirement in 1979, when he was made professor emeritus. Manning refused to move to Ulster, and so the couple were parted for several months of the year. She died in July 1980, and in 1981, Smith married Diana Robson, with whom he had been in a long-term relationship since the 1960s. Smith was visiting professor of literary arts at the University of Surrey from 1979 to 1983, and in 1984, he published a book about the poet Anna Wickham. Smith died of cirrhosis of the liver on 3 May 1985, aged seventy, at the Royal Free Hospital. A well-liked and highly gregarious man, his funeral and PEN memorial meeting were standing room only. Guy Pringle, Smith's fictional counterpart, was portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the 1987 BBC television adaptation of the Fortunes of War. Works * The Writings of Anna Wickham: Free Woman and Poet.

Albert Einstein was widely known during his lifetime for his work with the theory of relativity and physics in general. He was also an important peace activist, a believer in a very limited form of world government and a socialist. His political opinions were of public interest through the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and academic projects around the world. He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed him to speak and write frankly, even provocatively, at a time when many people were silenced due to the rise of the Nazi movement. Humanitarianism Einstein participated in the 1927 congress of the League against Imperialism in Brussels. Einstein also met with many humanists and humanitarian luminaries including Rabindranath Tagore with whom he had extensive conversations in 1930 prior to leaving Germany.Sawf.org Einstein and Germany Einstein receiving his certificate of American citizenship from Judge Phillip Forman in 1940. He retained his Swiss citizenship. Born in Ulm, Einstein was a German citizen from birth. As he grew older, Einstein's pacifism often clashed with the German Empire's militant views at the time. At the age of 17, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and moved to Switzerland to attend college. The loss of Einstein's citizenship allowed him to avoid service in the military, which suited his pacifist views. In response to a Manifesto of the Ninety-Three signed by 93 leading German intellectuals including Max Planck in support of the German war effort, Einstein and three others wrote a counter-manifesto. Einstein accepted a position at the University of Berlin in 1914, returning to Germany where he spent his time during the rest of World War I. Einstein also reacquired his German citizenship. In the years after the war, Einstein was very vocal in his support for Germany. In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. In 1921, Einstein refused to attend the third Solvay Congress in Belgium, as his German compatriots were excluded. In 1922, Einstein joined a committee sponsored by the League of Nations, but quickly left when the League refused to act on France's occupation of the Ruhr in 1923. As a member of the German League of Human Rights, Einstein worked hard to repair relations between Germany and France. Einstein moved to the United States in December 1932, where he worked at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California,Clark, R. \\"Einstein: The Life and Times\\" Harper-Collins, 1984. 880 pp. and lectured at Abraham Flexner's newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 due to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. During the 1930s and into World War II, Einstein wrote affidavits recommending United States visas for European Jews who were trying to flee persecution and lobbied for looser immigration rules. He raised money for Zionist organizations and was, in part, responsible for the 1933 formation of the International Rescue Committee. which gives support and shelter to refugees from social and political persecution. In Germany, Deutsche Physik activists published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating Einstein. Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark led a campaign to eliminate Einstein's work from the German lexicon as unacceptable \\"Jewish physics\\" (J√ºdische Physik). Instructors who taught his theories were blacklisted, including Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg, who had debated quantum probability with Bohr and Einstein. Philipp Lenard claimed that the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula needed to be credited to Friedrich Hasen√∂hrl to make it an Aryan creation. A man convicted of inciting others to kill Einstein was fined a mere six dollars. After World War II ended, and the Nazis were removed from power, Einstein refused to associate with Germany. Einstein refused several honors bestowed upon him by Germany, as he could not forgive the Germans for the Holocaust, where six million of his fellow Jews were murdered. Einstein, however, re-visited Germany on a trip to Europe in 1952. Zionism Einstein was a prominent supporter of both Labor Zionism and efforts to encourage Jewish-Arab cooperation. He supported the creation of a Jewish national homeland in the British mandate of Palestine but was opposed to the idea of a Jewish state \\"with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power.\\" According to Marc Elis, Einstein declared himself a human being, a Jew, an opponent of nationalism, and a Zionist; he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine but until summer 1947 conceived of this as a bi-national state with \\"continuously functioning, mixed, administrative, economic, and social organizations.\\"\\"Einstein and Complex Analyses of Zionism\\" Jewish Daily Forward, July 24, 2009Fred Jerome, Einstein on Israel and Zionism: His Provocative Ideas About the Middle East Albert Einstein, seen here with his wife Elsa Einstein and Zionist leaders, including future President of Israel Chaim Weizmann, his wife Dr. Vera Weizmann, Menahem Ussishkin, and Ben-Zion Mossinson on arrival in New York City in 1921. His speeches and lectures about Zionism were published in 1931 by The Macmillan Company and eleven of these essays were collected in a 1933 book entitled Mein Weltbild and translated into English as The World as I See It; Einstein's foreword dedicates the collection \\"to the Jews of Germany\\".Originally published by Querido, an Amsterdam publishing house and available in reprint paperback from Filiquarian Publishing, LLC, . In the face of Germany's rising militarism, Einstein wrote and spoke for peace.See the AMNH site's popup of translated letter from Freud, in the section \\"Freud and Einstein\\", regarding proposed joint presentation on \\"What can be done to rid mankind of the menace of war?\\" Einstein publicly stated reservations about the proposal to partition the British mandate of Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish countries. In a 1938 speech, \\"Our Debt to Zionism\\", he said: \\"I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain‚Äîespecially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\\"David E. Rowe & , Einstein on Politics: His Private Thoughts and Public Stands on Nationalism, Zionism, War, Peace, and the Bomb (2007), p. 33. His attitudes were nuanced: In his testimony before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in January 1946 he stated that he was not in favour of the creation of a Jewish state,Evan Wilson, A Calculated Risk: The U.S. Decision to Recognize Israel (1979) 2009 p.149. while in a 1947 letter to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru intended to persuade India to support Zionist aims of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, Einstein stated that the Balfour Declaration's proposal to establish a national home for Jews in Palestine \\"redresses the balance\\" of justice and history, claiming that \\"at the end of the first world war, the Allies gave the Arabs 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks to satisfy their national aspirations and five independent Arab states were established. One per cent was reserved for the Jews in the land of their origin\\". Einstein remained strongly supportive of unlimited Jewish immigration to Palestine. Extract of page 37 Extract of page 440 The United Nations ultimately recommended division the mandate and the establishment of a Jewish State, and the 1948 Arab-Israeli war broke out as the mandate ended. Einstein was one of the authors of an open letter to the New York Times in 1948 deeply criticizing Menachem Begin's Herut (Freedom) Party for the Deir Yassin massacre which he attributed to \\"terrorist bands\\" and likened Herut to \\"the Nazi and Fascist parties\\". He further stated \\"The Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party\\". Einstein said of the party that \\"Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti- imperialism...It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character\\", while also criticizing Irgun by calling it a \\"terrorist, right- wing, chauvinist organization\\".New Palestine Party Visit of Menachem Begin and Aims of Political Movement Discussed When President Harry Truman recognized Israel in May 1948, Einstein declared it \\"the fulfillment of our (Jewish) dreams.\\"\\"Was Einstein a Zionist\\" Zionism and Israel Information Center Einstein also supported vice president Henry Wallace‚Äôs Progressive Party during the 1948 Presidential election which also advocated a pro-Soviet and pro-Israel foreign policy.\\"Albert Einstein was a political activist\\" Jewish Tribune,14 April 2010 Einstein served on the Board of Governors of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In his Will of 1950, Einstein bequeathed literary rights to his writings The Hebrew University, where many of his original documents are held in the Albert Einstein Archives. When President Chaim Weizmann died in 1952, Einstein was asked to be Israel's second president, but he declined, stating that he had \\"neither the natural ability nor the experience to deal with human beings.\\" He wrote: \\"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it.\\" Civil rights Einstein was a proponent of civil rights. When he arrived in America, he objected to the mistreatment of African Americans. Einstein, who had experienced heavy anti-Semitic discrimination in pre-World War II Germany, worked with a number of leading civil rights activistsCivil Rights Movement and civil rights organizations (such as the Princeton chapter of the NAACP) to demand equality and denounce racism and segregation.Albert Einstein, Radical: A Political Profile :: Monthly Review Wherever he saw injustice, Einstein spoke out. When African-American singer and civil rights supporter Marian Anderson was denied rooms at hotels and forbidden to eat at public restaurants, Einstein invited her to his home. After a bloody racial riot in 1946 in which 500 state troopers with submachine guns attacked and destroyed virtually every black-owned business in a four-square-block area in Tennessee and arrested 25 black men for attempted murder, Einstein joined Eleanor Roosevelt, Langston Hughes, and Thurgood Marshall to fight for justice for the men. Later, 24 of the 25 defendants were acquitted. In 1946, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist traveled to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the alma mater of Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall and the first school in America to grant college degrees to blacks. At Lincoln, Einstein received an honorary degree and gave a lecture on relativity to Lincoln students.Albert Einstein, Civil Rights activist Harvard Gazette Also, when two black couples were murdered in Monroe, Georgia, and justice was not served, Einstein was so outraged, he lent his prominence to actor and activist Paul Robeson‚Äôs American Crusade to End Lynching and wrote a letter to President Truman calling for prosecution of lynchers and passage of a federal anti-lynching law. He became good friends with Robeson and when Robeson was blacklisted because of his activism against racism, again it was Einstein who opened his home to his long-time friend of 20 years. From the Scottsboro Boys case to the numerous attempts to stop the execution of Willie McGee, a black Mississippi sharecropper accused of raping a white woman, and efforts to prevent New Jersey from extraditing Sam Buckhannon, a black Georgian who had escaped a chain gang after serving 18 years for stealing a pack of cigarettes, Einstein used his fame to condemn American racism. Racial views Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries of Einstein released in 2018 contains what has been called racist remarks. He notes how the ‚ÄúChinese don‚Äôt sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.‚Äù After earlier writing of the ‚Äúabundance of offspring‚Äù and the ‚Äúfecundity‚Äù of the Chinese, he goes on to say: ‚ÄúIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.‚Äù Einstein‚Äôs perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: ‚ÄúJapanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúPure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.‚Äù  Gay rights  Einstein was one of the thousands of signatories of Magnus Hirschfeld's petition against Paragraph 175 of the German penal code, which condemned homosexuality. The petition ran for more than thirty years in the intellectual circles thanks to the activity of Hirschfeld's Wissenschaftlich- humanit√§res Komitee (Scientific-Humanitarian Committee), which collected many signatures from Jewish members of the German intellectual elite.[Carol Dunn, \\"The Jewish Connection to Homosexuality in the Third Reich\\", University of Sydney], citing p. 24,[3], John Lauritsen and David Thorstad, The Early Homosexual Rights Movement (1864-1935), New York Times Change Press, 1974, 14  Animal rights  Einstein was opposed to violence against animals, so he thought that one should \\"embrace all living creatures\\". He also sympathized with the idea of Vegetarianism. The latest indications, a letter written to Hans M√ºhsam, dated March 30, 1954, suggest that Einstein was a vegetarian for the last year of his life, though he appears to have supported the idea for many years before practicing it himself. In this letter Einstein states that he was feeling quite well without non-vegetarian food and that \\"man was not born to be a carnivore\\". But already a year before he wrote in another letter: \\"I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience\\".Alice Calaprice (Hrsg.): The Ultimate Quotable Einstein. Princeton University Press 2011, , S. 453‚Äì454. () Atomic bomb Concerned scientists, many of them refugees in the U.S. from German anti-Semitism, recognized the danger of German scientists' developing an atomic bomb based on the newly discovered phenomena of nuclear fission. In 1939, the Hungarian √©migr√© Le√≥ Szil√°rd, having failed to arouse U.S. government interest on his own, worked with Einstein to write a letter to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which Einstein signed, urging U.S. development of such a weapon. On 11 October 1939 Alexander Sachs, an adviser to Roosevelt on economic affairs, delivered the Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter and persuaded the president of its importance. \\"This requires action\\", Roosevelt told an aide, and authorized secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes. By 1942 this effort had become the Manhattan Project, the largest secret scientific endeavor undertaken up to that time. By late 1945, the U.S., with support from the United Kingdom and Canada, had developed operational nuclear weapons, and used them on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Einstein himself did not play a role in the development of the atomic bomb other than signing the letter although he did help the United States Navy with some unrelated theoretical questions it was working on during the war. According to Linus Pauling, Einstein later expressed regret about his letter to Roosevelt, adding that Einstein had originally justified his decision because of the greater danger that Nazi Germany would develop the bomb first.Scientist Tells of Einstein's A-bomb Regrets. The Philadelphia Bulletin, 13 May 1955. (PDF document from the Swiss Federal Archives from Internet Archive.) In 1947, Einstein told Newsweek magazine that \\"had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.\\" In that same year, he wrote an article for The Atlantic Monthly arguing that the United States should not try to pursue an atomic monopoly, and instead should equip the United Nations with nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of maintaining deterrence. Cold War politics Einstein, 1947, age 68 When he was a visible figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and developed working relationships in both the West and what was to become the Soviet bloc. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international r√©sum√©s. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism, Einstein was writing about a single world government believing ‚ÄúThere can never be complete agreement on international control and the administration of atomic energy or on general disarmament until there is a modification of the traditional concept of national sovereignty.‚Äù it was at this time that he wrote, \\"I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth ‚Äî sticks and stones.\\" Other versions of the quote exist. In a 1949 Monthly Review article entitled \\"Why Socialism?\\" Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the \\"predatory phase of human development\\" . With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. Einstein was a member of several civil rights groups, including the Princeton chapter of the NAACP. When the aged W. E. B. Du Bois was accused of being a Communist spy, Einstein volunteered as a character witness, and the case was dismissed shortly afterward. Einstein's friendship with activist Paul Robeson, with whom he served as co-chair of the American Crusade to End Lynching, lasted twenty years. In 1946, Einstein collaborated with Rabbi Israel Goldstein, Middlesex University heir C. Ruggles Smith, and activist attorney George Alpert on the Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, which was formed to create a Jewish-sponsored secular university, open to all students, on the grounds of the former Middlesex University in Waltham, Massachusetts. Middlesex was chosen in part because it was accessible from both Boston and New York City, Jewish cultural centers of the U.S. Their vision was a university \\"deeply conscious both of the Hebraic tradition of Torah looking upon culture as a birthright, and of the American ideal of an educated democracy.\\" The collaboration was stormy, however. Finally, when Einstein wanted to appoint British economist Harold Laski as the university's president, George Alpert wrote that Laski was \\"a man utterly alien to American principles of democracy, tarred with the Communist brush.\\" Einstein withdrew his support and barred the use of his name. The university opened in 1948 as Brandeis University. In 1953, Brandeis offered Einstein an honorary degree, but he declined. Socialism In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. However, later in his life, Einstein was in favour of socialism and in opposition to capitalism, as illustrated by the following quote: His opinions on the Bolsheviks changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a 'well-regulated system of government' and called their rule a 'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history'. He later adopted a more balanced view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: \\"I honor Lenin as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice. I do not consider his methods practical, but one thing is certain: men of his type are the guardians and restorers of the conscience of humanity.\\"Einstein: An Intimate Study of a Great Man. Dimitri Marianoff, Palma Wayne. p.96 Einstein's house in Princeton, NJ Einstein held Georgism (named after the political economist Henry George) in high regard, writing: \\"One cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness, artistic form and fervent love of justice.\\" Given Einstein's links to Germany and Zionism, his socialist ideals, and his links to Communist figures, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation kept a file on Einstein that grew to 1,427 pages. Education (academic freedom) Einstein considered Joseph McCarthy, a U.S. senator involved in the anti-communist Red Scare, a danger to intellectual and academic freedom. In 1953, William Frauenglass, a New York city school teacher who, having been called to testify, refused, and facing dismissal from his position, wrote to Einstein for support. In his reply, Einstein stated: \\"The reactionary politicians have managed to instill suspicion of all intellectual efforts into the public by dangling before their eyes a danger from without. Having succeeded so far they are now proceeding to suppress the freedom of teaching and to deprive of their positions all those who do not prove submissive, i.e. to starve them.\\" Einstein's advised: \\"Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify, i.e. he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country.\\" Einstein concluded, \\"If enough people are ready to take this grave step they will be successful. If not, then the intellectuals of this country deserve nothing better than the slavery which is intended for them.\\"Letter to William Frauenglass, published in the New York Times June 12, 1953 War Cartoon of Einstein, depicting him shedding his \\"Pacifism\\" wings and raising a sword labeled \\"Preparedness\\" in response to an increasingly hostile Germany (circa 1933). Einstein was a lifelong pacifist and believed that wars stood in the way of human progress. He believed that wars were the result of natural aggressive tendencies found within all organisms and that the aims and causes of war were simply justification for these tendencies. He advocated the creation of a supranational organization would make war as impossible in Europe as it was impossible between the former kingdoms that comprised the German Empire.Einstein, Albert. \\"My Opinion on the War\\" (1915)Einstein, Albert.

It lasted for 46 episodes, 39 of which were written by John Wagner. It has the second greatest number of episodes and pages (285) of any Judge Dredd story. It is part of a longer storyline about mutants. Plot summary Prologue The prologue \\"Under New Management,\\" in 2000 AD #1649, sets the scene for \\"Tour of Duty,\\" which began in the next issue. It is the first day in the term of office of new Chief Judge Dan Francisco, who in an earlier story has won an election for chief judge after campaigning on an anti-mutant platform.2000 AD #1628‚Äì1633 He exiles his predecessor as chief judge, Judge Hershey, and Judge Dredd from the city, due to their strong support for mutant rights. Francisco stops mutant immigration into Mega-City One and begins a policy of encouraging mutants to leave the city and live in four townships being built in the Cursed Earth, the inhospitable, radioactive desert outside the city. Dredd is put in charge of overseeing the construction and development of the townships, ostensibly because he is the best man for the job, but really in order to keep him out of the way. As a further punishment, Dredd's prot√©g√© Judge Beeny is sent with him as his deputy. \\"Tour of Duty\\" In Mega-City One, Chief Judge Francisco decides that the mutant townships are not good enough, and insists on spending more money on them to ensure that the mutants enjoy adequate standards of living. Deputy Chief Judge Sinfield objects, regarding the expense as an unnecessary burden on the city's budget, but Francisco overrules him, reasoning that the mutant expulsions should at least be done with some humanity. Francisco's relative leniency towards the mutants‚Äîin spite of the fact that he supports forcing them to choose between mandatory sterilisation or exile‚Äîbegins to cost him the support of the hardliners, such as Sinfield, who put him in office in the first place.2000 AD #1651 Meanwhile in the Cursed Earth, Dredd is assigned four judges, one for each township. Not only is four judges not enough, but each of them is inadequate to the task before them, due to some deficiency ‚Äì Cunningham never completed his Cursed Earth survival training, Munn is insubordinate, Heck is incompetent and Ramone is addicted to medication. Dredd takes this as a sign of the low priority accorded to his mission.2000 AD #1651 Dredd insists that one judge per township is not sufficient to maintain order, and urges Sinfield to send greater numbers, but Sinfield refuses. Instead, Dredd is forced to create an amateur police force by deputising some of the mutants.2000 AD #1659 The new townships are soon threatened by a vicious gang of violent mutants, led by a psychic called Pink Eyes, who has telekinetic powers. Dredd pre-emptively kills many of them, but fails to prevent an attack on one of the townships by the survivors. The gang slaughters scores of mutants, kidnaps Judge Munn, and vanishes. When Sinfield calls off the search for Munn after only a few days, Dredd is disgusted by Sinfield's dereliction of duty, saying \\"He's not fit to wear the badge ... something will have to be done.\\"2000 AD #1657‚Äì1663 Dredd eventually manages to find the gang, ruthlessly exterminate them all, and rescue Munn. However Pink Eyes has tortured Munn so brutally that he is left with permanent brain damage and is unable to return to duty, or even to a normal life. Dredd holds Sinfield responsible and decides to lodge a formal complaint against him, but when he goes to see the chief judge, he discovers that in his absence, Francisco has resigned due to his poor health, and Sinfield has become acting chief judge. Unknown to Dredd, Sinfield has secretly drugged Francisco with an illegal hypnotic drug in order to persuade him to resign and take his place, in order to impose harsher policies against mutants. Sinfield orders Dredd to return to the Cursed Earth until his complaint can be heard by the Council of Five.2000 AD #1664‚Äì1667 and #2010 The story described so far was all written by John Wagner. There then follow seven episodes comprising three stories, written by Al Ewing, Gordon Rennie and Robbie Morrison, describing Dredd's further adventures in the Cursed Earth, in which Dredd deals with other dangerous situations.2000 AD #2010 and #1668‚Äì1673 Wagner returned to \\"Tour of Duty\\" in 2000 AD #1674 with a 13-episode segment subtitled \\"The Talented Mayor Ambrose.\\" \\"The Talented Mayor Ambrose\\" Dr Byron Ambrose is the mayor of Mega-City One. He is also, unknown to everyone, the infamous serial killer PJ Maybe in disguise, having murdered the real Ambrose and stolen his identity some years earlier.Judge Dredd Megazine #231‚Äì234 On his first day in office as acting chief judge, Sinfield summons the mayor to his office and orders him to raise taxes and cut back on his popular social programmes, to make up for the shortfall in the city's budget caused by the expensive mutant township project. When the mayor protests, Sinfield threatens to undermine his re-election campaign if he does not do as he is told. Furious, Maybe decides to assassinate Sinfield, and infects him with deadly fungal spores. When Sinfield unexpectedly survives, Maybe covertly injects him with deadly bacteria, but again Sinfield pulls through. Realising that somebody is trying to kill him, Sinfield decides he wants the city's best judge to investigate, and puts Dredd in charge of the case, knowing that even though Dredd wants Sinfield to resign, his sense of duty will ensure that he is diligent in finding the assassin. Dredd brings Beeny with him to assist him.2000 AD #1674‚Äì1680 Frustrated by his double failure to kill Sinfield, Maybe becomes impatient and sends a robot, disguised as Judge Hershey, to infiltrate the Grand Hall of Justice and assassinate him. By chance Dredd happens to be there, and destroys the robot. DNA found on the robot is traced back to Ambrose, since Maybe had swapped his own DNA for Ambrose's in Justice Department's records when he stole Ambrose's identity. Maybe is arrested and interrogated by Beeny. However his true identity is exposed when Dredd obtains an old sample of Maybe's DNA from an archived evidence file and sends it for forensic analysis. When it matches Ambrose's DNA record, Maybe confesses.2000 AD #1682‚Äì1686 \\"Mega-City Justice\\" \\"The Talented Mayor Ambrose\\" was followed by \\"Mega-City Justice,\\" the concluding chapter of \\"Tour of Duty.\\" In the opening episodes PJ Maybe is sentenced to death. The public are told that Mayor Ambrose died of natural causes.2000 AD #1687‚Äì1688 The story then returns to the feud between Dredd and Chief Judge Sinfield. The Council of Five dismisses Dredd's complaint against Sinfield,2000 AD #1689 after Sinfield ensures a favourable outcome by appointing three of his hardline supporters as new Council members.2000 AD #1674 Dredd responds by running for election to the office of chief judge.2000 AD #1690 However in order to gain enough support, Dredd has to agree to compromise on the issue of mutant rights. During the election campaign, which polls suggest Dredd is winning, Maybe ‚Äì hoping for a reprieve ‚Äì tells Dredd that he suspects that Sinfield drugged Francisco, as Maybe recognises the symptoms, having used the same drug extensively on his own victims. After an investigation, Sinfield is arrested by Judge Buell, and the drug is discovered in Sinfield's safe. Sinfield is removed from office and sentenced to 20 years. Francisco is reinstalled as chief judge, and appoints a new Council of Five, which includes Dredd, his exile finally over. The Council (Dredd dissenting) votes to commute Maybe's sentence to life in recognition of his aid.2000 AD #1691‚Äì1693 Follow-ups The events of \\"Tour of Duty\\" would carry on into later strips: * \\"The Skinning Room\\" had Sinfield's arrival on the Titan penal colony. The Council of Five decided to make his sentence public and decided to end the Sinfield-caused crime wave and contempt for authority with a crackdown on Sector Fifty. Dredd was disgruntled and bored by his Council status, drifting off in the middle of meetings (to Francisco's amusement), but took advantage of his status to commandeer vast resources for the crackdown.Progs 1700-1704 * The Mega-City economy was left in disarray by Sinfield, leading to cuts under the \\"Big Community\\" slogan.Prog 2011 and Megazine #312 * \\"The Family Man\\" in Megazine #312-3 showed Township Three was flourishing - to the extent that norm citizens were using face-changers and fake ID to disguise themselves as mutants, disgruntled that only mutants could live in these less violent, more liberal areas. A faction within Justice Department's Black Ops, however, assassinated them all and the judge in charge of Three with them, allowing them to install a Sinfield-era hardliner who would deliberalise the township. * PJ Maybe would escape before the start of the next epic, \\"Day of Chaos\\". The townships would become involved at the end of that story, voting to send a 40,000 strong army to aid the devastated city.

It was founded in December 1945 at a meeting in Cheribon, as the Socialist People's Party (Paras) of Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir and the Socialist Party of Indonesia (Parsi) of Defence Minister Sjarifuddin merged. Sjahrir became chairman of the unified party, whilst Sjarifuddin became vice-chairman.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 147 In January 1946, the party and its youth wing Pesindo, joined (along with all other major political forces at the time) the Tan Malaka-led national front Persatuan Perdjuangan. By February the same year, the Socialist Party had come to view the Persatuan Perdjuangan as an attempt to replace the existing government, and the party and Pesindo withdrew. Following their withdrawal, the Persatuan Perdjuangan was able to pressure Sjahrir to resign from his position as Prime Minister. Sukarno offered the Persatuan Perdjuangan to form a new cabinet, but such a government never materialized due to conflicts inside the front. As the Persatuan Perdjuangan couldn't form a government, Sjahrir was again offered to form a government. In May 1946 the government launched Konsentrasi Nasional, a coalition intended to compete with Persatuan Perdjuangan. The Socialist Party and Pesindo became core constituents of KN, along with the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), Masjumi, the Labour Party of Indonesia and various mass organizations. Soon, KN and Persatuan Perdjuangan clashed, as Persatuan Perdjuangan initiated militant struggle against the government. Sjahrir was kidnapped by Persatuan Perdjuangan (but was released soon thereafter).Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 148 In October 1946, the government was broadened to include leaders from several political forces. A new pro-government coalition, Sajap Kiri, was founded to support the Linggadjati Agreement with the Dutch government. Sajap Kiri consisted of the Socialist Party, Pesindo, PKI and the Labour Party of Indonesia. Towards late 1946, the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) was enlarged. The Socialist Party was given 35 out of 514 seats. In May 1947 the Dutch government issued an ultimatum to the Indonesian government, demanding Dutch de jure sovereignty over Indonesia until 1949. This ultimatum created a split inside the Socialist Party, as Sjahrir expressed some conciliatory attitudes towards the Dutch positions. Sjahrir faced opposition from Sjarifuddin's followers and Sajap Kiri, and in June 1947 Sjahrir resigned as Prime Minister. When Sjahrir had travelled to address the United Nations, Sjarifuddin was appointed acting party chairman. When Hatta formed a new government, the Sjajrir-led faction of the Socialist Party supported it whilst the rest of Sajap Kiri opposed it.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 149 Sjahrir and his followers left the Socialist Party, and on February 12, 1948, they formed the Socialist Party of Indonesia (PSI). PSI was joined by 4 out of 5 Socialist Party representatives in the KNIP Working Group and 19 out of 35 Socialist KNIP members. Most of the party grassroots stayed with Sjarifuddin, however.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 150 In August 1948 the Socialist Party issued a statement of self-criticism, stating that the foundation of Parsi in 1945 had been a mistake, that a communist party should have been built instead and that the merger with 'rightwing' and 'reformist' Paras should not have taken place.Rose, Saul.

Lang (17 April 1911, in New York ‚Äì 22 February 1986, in Branford, Connecticut) was an American musical arranger, orchestrator and composer of band music, as well as a musical educator. He is credited for writing the orchestral arrangements (orchestrations) for over 50 Broadway theatre shows, including many landmark productions, such as Li'l Abner (1956), Hello, Dolly! (1964), Mame (1966), George M (1968), Annie (1977) and 42nd Street (1980). Together with Robert Russell Bennett, he orchestrated the record-breaking productions of Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady (1956) and Camelot (1960).Obituary, The New York Times, 25 February 1986. Russell Bennett, the dean of musical orchestrators, remarked that the original arrangements Lang had prepared for Annie Get Your Gun (1946), which utilized a modern technique of orchestral scoring, were beautifully done.Robert Russell Bennett (ed. George Joseph Ferencz), The Broadway Sound, University of Rochester Press, 1998, p. 197. Musical education In 1933 Lang graduated from Ithaca College, which later awarded him an honorary doctorate for his career. He pursued further musical studies at Columbia University and the Juilliard School. By 1934 Lang had signed with the busy theatrical orchestration department at Chappell Music run by Max Dreyfus. There he was expected to be the principal orchestral arranger (orchestrator) for about five musical shows a year being produced on Broadway and also be expected to collaborate with his colleagues on shows assigned to them as needed. During the war years, Lang along with Robert Russell Bennett, Don Walker, and Ted Royal were recognized as the busiest orchestrators on Broadway.Steven Suskin, The Sound of Broadway Music, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009, pp. 7 & 15. \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\" Score An early assignment were the original orchestrations for Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun, in which Lang employed the new so-called \\"microphone technique\\" where the singer would carry the melody line without much support or competition from the orchestra. He would later use this to excellent effect for Rex Harrison's speaking-singing on My Fair Lady, but belters like Ethel Merman expected full-bodied orchestral underpinnings. Producer Richard Rodgers and the musical director Jay Blackton wanted the more traditional \\"live theater\\" sound and asked Russell Bennett to redo it during the tryouts. In his autobiography Bennett suggests that he merely adjusted Lang's work without unbalancing it; but others have claimed that Bennett rewrote practically everything and saved the show.Russell Bennett p. 197 & notes. Steven Suskin has confirmed that at least Lang's version of Anything You Can Do survived and was used in the final show, to which many other orchestrators eventually contributed.Suskin p. 321. Nevertheless, Bennett apparently appreciated Lang's work and happily collaborated with him on a number of other successful scores. Band music Throughout his career Lang was a prolific arranger for bands and would often serve as a guest conductor and adjudicator for school festivals and clinics. Representative of his transcriptions was the 1952 arrangement of Raymond Scott's March of the Slide Trombones.Music Journal, Vol. 30, Issue 12, Elmo Publications, 1952, p. 12. He would also compose himself, such as the hoe-down toned The Country Bumpkin, prefiguring his hillbilly phase on Li'l Abner. Lang also served as a partner and editor at Lawson-Gould Music, Inc.Philip J. Lang Biographical Entry from Theatre, Film and Television Biographies. Other credits The Phil Lang Orchestra recorded 13 78 rpm selections of popular dance music for Brunswick Records in 1938-39. Morton Gould's \\"Tropical\\" and \\"Pavanne\\" were typical of the modernistic novelty style of the recordings, which are very rare today.http://www.78discography.com/BRN8000.htm Apart from helping out on the film versions of Hello Dolly!, and Abner, Lang did little else for the movies. He was, however, a frequent musical arranger for prestige television programing, such as Hallmark Productions, David Susskind, Omnibus, Radio City Music Hall shows and The Tonight Show. Starting in 1949, Lang became an associate professor of orchestration, often lecturing during the summer sessions. He mainly taught at the University of Michigan and the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1950 he wrote the college textbook, Scoring for the Band, which was published by Mills Music, New York. Later in his career Lang became popular as an orchestrator for ballet and opera, including the Metropolitan Opera and Ballet de Marseille, as well as the Boston Pops Orchestra.Lang Biographical Entry & NYT Obituary.

Excavations at the site began in 2003. The site has provided evidence of decorated stone slabs, a stone wall thick with foundations, and a large building described as a Neolithic temple.Towers et. al. 2015, pp. 22‚Äì23. The earliest structures were built between 3,300 and 3,200 BC, and the site had been closed down and partly dismantled by 2,200 BC.Towers et. al. 2015, pp. 2‚Äì3. The site General plan of the site. Today the Brodgar peninsulaWickham-Jones 2015, p. 76. is a finger of land a few hundred metres wide, situated between the saltwater Loch of Stenness to the southwest and the freshwaterWickham-Jones 2015, p. 31. Loch of Harray to the northeast. To the southeast are the Standing Stones of Stenness and to the north-west is the Ring of Brodgar. A short bridge connects these two sites. Also visible from the site are, to the east, the chambered cairn at Maeshowe and, to the southeast the Barnhouse Settlement. A couple of kilometres northwest of the Ring of Brodgar is the Ring of Bookan, a third henge, with associated mounds.Wickham-Jones 2015, p. 18. The Neolithic village at Skara Brae lies a few kilometres away, as does the chambered cairn at Unstan. More archaeology is probably submerged beneath the lochs.Wickham-Jones 2015, p. 13. In Neolithic times, the Loch of Stenness was probably a wetland area rather than a lake. People from Skara Brae would have been able to walk to the Ness of Brodgar, watch or take part in ritual activity and walk home within a day.Wickham-Jones 2015, p. 53. The structures at the Ness of Brodgar are made of flagstone, a sedimentary rock found abundantly throughout Orkney.Towers et. al. 2015, p. 11. Flagstone is easily split into flat stones and was therefore a good material for fine building work using Neolithic tools. Some of the stone found on site is too thin for floor tiles or wall building, and is understood as the first evidence ever found of roofs.Towers et. al. 2015, p. 10. Key structures The structures at Brodgar are numbered in the order of discovery. As more of the site was uncovered and the interpretations improved, some numbers went out of use, so as of 2016 the key structures are numbered 1, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Structures 1, 8, 12 and 14 appear to have been constructed around 3,000 BC. These stand on top of earlier remains that, as of 2016, have not yet been uncovered, but are thought to date to 3,300‚Äì3,200 BCE. Structure 1 Structure 1 Structure 1 as it appeared in July 2016. Structure 1 has a complex history and appears to have been built on top of the remains of an earlier structure.Towers et. al. 2015, pp. 18‚Äì19. The official guide to the dig suggests that this structure appears to have been central to the site. Originally it was more than long, but was radically rebuilt within about a century of its first construction: two doors were blocked up, a new door was inserted and a new wall built. It was decorated with many pieces of stone artwork, some of which were internal to the walls and would never have been seen while the building was in use. Some of the individual stones of structure 1 were painted in yellows, reds, and oranges using ochre pigment made of haematite mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs. This is the first discovery in Britain of evidence that Neolithic people used paint to decorate their buildings. In 2015 the bones of a baby, which died around the time of birth, were unearthed in a recess of this building. Structure 8 Structure 8 In this image taken in July 2016, structure 8 is visible to the rear. The prominent structure is structure 11\\\\. Structure 8 is roughly contemporary with structure 1, probably having been built just after structure 1 was completed.Towers et. al. 2015, pp. 20‚Äì21. It comprised ten piers and ten recesses, and had six hearths. The remains of at least two earlier buildings lie beneath it and structure 8 appears to have undergone severe subsidence itself. Its floor slumped in antiquity, causing the roof to fall in, and some of its stones were used to form structure 10. Structure 8 was the first place where stone roof tiles were discovered on site and the first place where coloured pigment was found on the walls. Uniquely among the buildings of the Ness of Brodgar, and indeed uniquely in Neolithic Europe so far as we know, finely-worked stone spatulas were found here. They resemble flattened spoons and have been made with great care. None of them show signs of wear and their purpose is unknown. Other finds from this structure included a whalebone mace head and a whale's tooth set in stone. Structure 10 Structure 10 This image taken in July 2016 shows archaeologists at work on structure 10\\\\. Structure 10, artistic reconstruction c. 3000 BC. Structure 10 was discovered in 2008, and was described by excavators as \\"temple-like\\". It has walls thick and still standing to a height of more than . The building is long and wide and a standing stone with a hole shaped like an hourglass was incorporated into the walls. There is a cross-shaped inner sanctum and the building was surrounded by a paved outer passage. It is believed to have been constructed around 2,900 BCE, and appears to have been partly rebuilt around 2,800 BC, probably due to structural instability. This is the largest structure of its kind anywhere in the north of Britain and it would have dominated the ritual landscape of the peninsula. Structure 10 was used until around 2,400‚Äì2,200 BCE, when it appears to have been \\"closed\\" in an extraordinary and unique episode of ceremonial demolitionWickham-Jones 2015, p. 75. involving the slaughter of several hundred cattle. Bones of approximately 400 cattle-tibias (shin bones) comprise the vast majority of bones found. The bones were laid around structure 10 and an upturned cow skull was placed within it. The tibias appear to have been cracked to extract the marrow, suggesting that this slaughter was accompanied by a feast. All the slaughter seems to have taken place in a single event. After the feast, the whole carcasses of several red deer were placed atop the broken bones, and structure 10 was largely destroyed. This event appears to have marked the closure and abandonment of the Ness of Brodgar site. Structure 12 Structure 12 Structure 12 in July 2016. Just visible at the back of this photograph is celebrity archaeologist Neil Oliver. Structure 12 was built around 3,000 BCE. It comprises six piers, four recesses and two hearths. It is the southernmost structure so far uncovered, but there are believed to be more structures farther south still underground (some of which, unfortunately, may be under the site's spoil heap). It was made of well-dressed stone but, like several other buildings on the site, appears to have suffered from structural problems and was partly rebuilt. An annexe to the north, added later in the Neolithic, is not well integrated into the original stonework.Towers et. al. 2015, pp. 24‚Äì25. This annexe contained masses of grooved ware pottery, including some very large vessels, some made with techniques not otherwise known from the Neolithic, and some coloured black, red or white. The red colour was made of ochre, and the black of soot; the source of the white colouring has not yet been determined. The grooved ware from Orkney is the oldest known in Britain, and the style appears to originate from Orkney and radiate southwards. Structure 14 Structure 14 Structure 14 as it appeared in July 2016. The tarpaulins visible in this image are left over from when the site was covered and closed down (dig restarted 4 July). The tyres were used to weigh them down. Structure 14 was built around 3,000 BCE, roughly contemporaneously with structures 1, 8 and 12. Like them it was built on top of earlier structures. It is the most northerly of the buildings so far uncovered. It has three entrances, four piers, four recesses, and two hearths. Apart from its size it is generally similar in design to structure 8. A great deal of stone from structure 14 was taken in antiquity for re-use elsewhere, and like all the other structures except structure 10, it appears to have been largely demolished by 2,600 BCE. The ends of this building appear to have been used for different purposes and, as of 2016, the floor is undergoing chemical analysis to determine what they were. An unusual axehead, made from gneiss, and a carinated bowl from the early Neolithic which may predate grooved ware, have been found in this structure.

Pottery, cremated animal bones, stone tools, and polished stone mace heads have also been discovered. Some of the stone slabs are decorated with geometrical lozenges typical of other Neolithic sites. There are the remains of a large stone wall (the \\"Great Wall of Brodgar\\") that may have been long and or more wide. It appears to traverse the entire peninsula where the site is located, and may have been a symbolic barrier between the ritual landscape of the Ring and the mundane world around it. A baked clay artefact known as the \\"Brodgar Boy\\", and thought to be a figurine with a head, body, and two eyes, was also unearthed in the rubble of one structure in 2011. It was found in two sections, the smaller of which measures 30 mm, but is thought to be part of a still larger object. In 2013, an intricately inscribed stone was found in structure 10, described as \\"potentially the finest example of Neolithic art found in the UK for several decades\\". The stone is inscribed on both sides. A few days later archaeologists discovered a carved stone ball, a very rare find of such an object in situ in \\"a modern archaeological context\\". Recent finds include Skaill knivesA flaked stone with a sharp edge used for cutting. This neolithic tool is named after Skaill Bay, the location of World Heritage Site Skara Brae in Orkney. See and hammer stones, and another, perhaps even bigger wall. The dig involves archaeologists from Orkney College and from the universities of Aberdeen, Cardiff and Glasgow. World Heritage status The Heart of Neolithic Orkney was inscribed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to the Ring of Brodgar, the site includes Maeshowe, Skara Brae, the Stones of Stenness, and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Scotland, whose \\"Statement of Significance\\" for the site begins: > The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the > triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were > approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt > (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first > cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than > the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a > remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol > of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of > civilisation. ... Stenness is a unique and early expression of the ritual > customs of the people who buried their dead in tombs like Maes Howe and > lived in settlements like Skara Brae. Since the importance of the Ness was discovered only in 2003, it was not mentioned explicitly in 1999 and was not one of the four key sites. Nevertheless, the Ness of Brodgar \\"contribute[s] greatly to our understanding of the WHS\\" according to Historic Scotland.

The family is named after paleocetologist Remington Kellogg. Description Remingtonocetids have long and narrow skulls with the external nare openings located on the front of the skull. Their frontal shields are narrow and their orbits small. Their mouth has a convex palate and an incompletely fused mandibular symphysis. The dental formula is . The anterior teeth are flattened mediolaterally, making them appear shark-like. In the postcranial skeleton, the cervical vertebrae are relatively long and the sacrum is composed of four vertebrae of which at least three are fused. The acetabular notch is narrow or closed and on the femoral head the fovea is absent. Skeleton of Kutchicetus minimus Cranial fossils are common but dental remains are rare. The postcrania morphology is based entirely on a single specimen of Kutchicetus which was small and had a long and muscular back and tail. Perhaps remintonocetids swam like the South American giant otter which swims with its long flat tail. With long and low bodies, relatively short limbs, their elongated rostrum, remingtonocetids looked like mammalian crocodiles, more so than Ambulocetus. They could both walk on land and swim in the water and most likely lived in a near-shore habitat. At least one genus, Dalanistes, had a marine diet. Remingtonocetids are often found in association with catfish and crocodilians, as well as protocetid whales and sirenians. They were probably independent of freshwater. Distribution Remingtonocetidae was long considered endemic to the coastline of the ancient Tethys Ocean during the Eocene (present-day Pakistan and India), but the discovery of Rayanistes in Egypt indicates that remingtonocetids had a broader distribution than previously thought.

The laser cavity is a waveguide with a racetrack geometry (but this can also be another geometry), which enables it to lase in two counterpropagating directions: clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW). The light is evanescently coupled out of the cavity to a straight output waveguide. Semiconductor ring lasers (SRLs) are miniature ring laser devices with potential applications in optoelectronics, photonics and all-optical circuits. The first SRLs were developed in the 1980s. Recently, they have been of interest as potential random-access memory storage devices for all-optical computers. Semiconductor ring lasers are literally ring-shaped optical waveguides with a lasing medium. They have the ability to trap light in a ring, and recirculate it continuously as long as they remain powered. The material of choice for SRLs is indium phosphide. SRLs can be square with corner reflectors, or, as is more common with the smaller designs, have a curved, \\"racetrack\\" shape. Devices are currently on the order of a 100 micrometres, but further miniaturization should be possible using existing silicon microelectronics technology. In the summer of 2010 researchers Dr. Muhammad Maqbool and Kyle Main of Ball State University and Dr. Martin Kordesch of Ohio University were able to successfully develop the first Aluminum Nitride SRL on the order of 20 micrometers in diameter. This SRL was constructed by depositing a 4 micrometer thick semi conducting Aluminum-Nitride film doped with Ti+3 ions onto a stretched fiber optic cable of 12 micrometer diameter. This SRL was shown to have considerable gain and a low threshold pump power, making it a highly efficient laser system. The light was confined only to the film and did not reflect off of the outer surface of the optical fiber. Such an arrangement is called a \\"Whispering Gallery Mode\\".Muhammad Maqbool, Kyle Main, and Martin Kordesch, \\"Titanium-doped sputter-deposited AlN infrared whispering gallery mode microlaser on optical fibers,\\" Opt. Lett. 35, 3637-3639 (2010) Maqbool and Main plan to expand their work to include the development of nano scale SRLs on carbon nanotubes. SRLs may serve as the basis of a new form of optical random access memory. The direction of circulation of light (clockwise or counterclockwise) would indicate the polarity of the bit (0 or 1). Due in part to the bistable and highly non-linear nature of the devices, they can be fed a starting signal from either direction. The directionality is maintained as long as the device remains powered. Other potential applications include \\"a digital response device that reshapes optical signals that have become distorted, effectively acting as a gate.\\" and a device for resynchronizing optical signals to eliminate timing \\"jitter\\". A European research project formed in 2006 to study potential applications of SRLs. It is known as IOLOS, (Integrated optical logic and memory using ultra-fast micro-ring bistable semiconductor laser), and will receive funding of ‚Ç¨1.25 million over three years.

Life and works Harvey was born at Liverpool, Lancashire in 1968 to Maureen and Brian Harvey. He has a brother, Timothy, who is a music teacher in Chester. A former secondary school English teacher, his first serious attempt as a playwright was in 1987. He entered a competition, with a first prize of ¬£1,000, for young writers at the Liverpool Playhouse, with his play The Cherry Blossom Tree, a blend of suicide, murder and nuns. He won National Girobank Young Writer of the Year Award for The Cherry Blossom Tree. Encouraged by this success he wrote Mohair (1988), Wildfire (1992) and Babies (1993), the latter won the 'George Devine Award' for 1993 and The Evening Standard's 'Most Promising Playwright Award' for 1994. In 1993, Harvey, premiered Beautiful Thing, a gay-themed play-turned-film for which he won the John Whiting Award in 1994. In 1995 his play Boom Bang-a-Bang premiered at the Bush Theatre, London, and was originally directed by Kathy Burke. Harvey cites it as \\"my most comic play ever, but with some dark bits\\". Centred on a group of friends gathering to watch the Eurovision Song Contest, the play was a sell-out. Also in 1995 Rupert Street Lonely Hearts Club was premiered. Guiding Star (1998), is a portrayal of a man's struggle to come to terms with the Hillsborough disaster, while Hushabye Mountain (1999) deals with a world that has learned to live with HIV/AIDS. Television and film works include: West End Girls (Carlton); Love Junkie (BBC); Beautiful Thing (Channel Four/Island World Productions); the 1999-2001 hit/cult comedy series starring Kathy Burke and James Dreyfus, Gimme Gimme Gimme (Tiger Aspect); Murder Most Horrid (BBC); and Coronation Street (ITV). He wrote the book for Closer to Heaven, a stage musical with songs and music written by Pet Shop Boys. Closer to Heaven ran for nine months at the Arts Theatre in London during 2001 and in Australia in 2005. In 2003, on hearing the singer-actress Abi Roberts perform, he offered to write a solo show for her. Taking Charlie was the outcome, staged at the 2004 Edinburgh Festival with Roberts starring, under the direction of Susan Tully. The piece was darkly comic and focused on the destructive nature of an insecure, 30 year-old addict. His first novel All She Wants was published in 2012 by Pan Books. Since 2013, Harvey has co-written the Radio Four sitcom series What Does the K Stand For? based on the experiences of comedian Stephen K. Amos growing up as a teenager in south London in the 1980s. The programme's third series commenced in January 2017. Harvey is married to casting director Paul Hunt.

He spent eleven years with Blackpool in the 1940s and 1950s, making 157 league appearances and scoring one goal. He made his debut for Blackpool, who were then managed by Joe Smith, on 6 September 1948, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Derby County at Bloomfield Road. He went on to make a further five appearances during the 1948‚Äì49 league campaign, deputising for Ron Suart. Wright made fourteen league appearances in 1949‚Äì50, during which season Suart left for Blackburn Rovers. In 1950‚Äì51, Wright made twelve league appearances, but sat out Blackpool's entire run to their second FA Cup Final. The following season, 1951‚Äì52, he made fifteen appearances, before missing the whole 1952‚Äì53 term. In 1953‚Äì54, Wright returned to the line-up; however, he was still unable to nudge out Tommy Garrett from the left-back berth, and therefore made only eight league appearances. Once again, he did not appear in the club's run to another, this time successful, FA Cup Final. Wright was absent again for the entirety of the 1954‚Äì55 campaign, but it was in 1955‚Äì56, his eighth season with the Tangerines, that he was given an extended run in the team. He made thirty-eight starts in the club's 42 league games as they finished as runners- up in Division One. He scored his first and only goal for the club in 1956‚Äì57, in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Luton Town at Bloomfield Road on 8 September, during one of his sixteen league appearances. Wright had another sustained run in the Blackpool team during 1957‚Äì58, making 31 appearances. 1958‚Äì59 was Wright's eleventh and final season on the Fylde. Ron Suart, with whom he had competed for the number-3 shirt earlier in his Seasiders career, succeeded Joe Smith as manager. Suart gave seventeen starts to Wright, the final one occurring on 3 January in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Manchester United at Old Trafford. Post- retirement After retiring, Wright became a coach and then manager (from 1969 to 1972) at Tranmere Rovers. Wright died in 2005.

ESSA-9 replaced the ESSA-7 satellite. Launch and orbit ESSA-9 was launched on a three-stage Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch occurred at 07:47 UTC (02:47 EDT) on February 26, 1969. The spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit of 101.4¬∞ inclination. Immediately after launch ESSA-9 had a perigee of and an apogee of , giving it an orbital period of 115.2 minutes, or a mean motion of 12.5 orbits per day. ESSA-9 operated for 1,726 days before it was deactivated in November 1972. Spacecraft The ESSA-9 spacecraft was similar to the TIROS series of satellites, having an 18-sided polygonal shape that measured in diameter and high. It weighed . The body of ESSA-9 was made of aluminum alloy and stainless steel. The shell of the craft was covered with 10,020 solar cells. The solar cells recharged the 63 nickel‚Äìcadmium batteries during the time the spacecraft was in sunlight. ESSA-9 employed the same cartwheel-style stabilization as the TIROS-9 satellite. The satellite used a magnetic attitude spin coil (MASC) to control its attitude while in orbit. The magnetic field induced by the MASC's current interacted with the earth's magnetic field to provide the torque necessary to maintain a desired spin rate of 9.225 rpm.Spacecraft details Instruments ESSA-9 carried two sets of two main instruments, the Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) and the Flat Plate Radiometer (FPR). The AVCS was used to collect imagery of cloud cover on earth. The cameras had a resolution of and covered an area of . The cameras took single images of a particular region of the earth's surface once a day. The FPR's were used to measure the global distribution of solar radiation reflected by the earth and the earth's atmosphere. They also measured long-wave emissions from the earth. The sensors used in the ESSA satellites were from the earlier Nimbus program.

Context In 1860, Ii Naosuke was the most influential advisor to the shogunate. Ii, a leading figure of the Bakumatsu period and a proponent of the reopening of Japan after more than 200 years of seclusion, was widely criticized for signing the 1858 Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States Consul Townsend Harris and, soon afterwards, similar treaties with other Western countries. From 1859, the ports of Nagasaki, Hakodate and Yokohama became open to foreign traders as a consequence of the Treaties. Ii was also criticized for reinforcing the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate against regional daimy≈çs through the Ansei Purge.. Naosuke also made strong enemies in the dispute for the succession of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iesada, and because he forced retirement on his opponents, specifically the retainers of Mito, Hizen, Owari, Tosa, Satsuma and Uwajima. These policies generated strong sentiment against the Shogunate, especially among proponents of the Mito school. Assassination The Sakuradamon gate today. The assassination took place on 24 March 1860, on Double Third Festival where all daimyos stationed in Edo (modern Tokyo) were scheduled to enter Edo Castle for meetings. The assassins attacked Ii's entourage just outside the Castle, near the Sakuradamon (Sakurada Gate) when Ii was reaching the premises. Ii had been warned about his safety, and many encouraged him to retire from office, but he refused, replying that \\"My own safety is nothing when I see the danger threatening the future of the country\\". Ii's entourage was composed of around 60 samurai guards and Ii's palanquin carriers. A total of 17 Mito r≈çnin ambushed Ii together with Arimura Jisaemon (Jizaemon Arimura), the lone member of the group who was not from Mito since he was a samurai from Satsuma Domain. While an attack at the front drew the attention of the guards, a lone assassin fired one shot into the palanquin containing Ii, with a Japanese-made Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, which had been copied from the firearms that Commodore Matthew Perry had given the shogunate as gifts. Drawing the injured and likely paralyzed Ii out, Arimura decapitated Ii and then performed seppuku. Arimura Jisaemon, on the point of committing the assassination. Woodblock print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The conspirators carried a manifesto on themselves, outlining the reason for their act: Accounts of the violent event were sent via ship across the Pacific to San Francisco and then sped by pony express across the American West. On June 12, 1860, The New York Times reported that Japan's first diplomatic mission to the West received the news about what had happened in Edo. The assassination dealt a severe blow to the prestige of the Shogunate so that officials refused to admit Naosuke's death for a month, claiming that he was merely injured and was recuperating. The minister's death was only made official in April when the office of Tairo was declared vacant. Consequences The popular upheaval against foreign encroachment and assassination of Ii forced the Bakufu to soften its stance, and to adopt a compromise policy of k≈çbu gattai (\\"Union of the Emperor and the Shogun\\") suggested by Satsuma Domain and Mito Domain, in which both parties vied for political supremacy in the years to follow. This soon amplified into the violent Sonn≈ç J≈çi (\\"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians\\") movement. An account cited the Sakuradamon Incident ushered a decade of violence in Japan, reviving the culture of the warrior rule and warrior spirit. For the following years until the fall of Bakufu in 1868, Edo, and more generally the streets of Japan, would remain notably hazardous for Bakufu officials (see attack on And≈ç Nobumasa) and foreigners alike (Richardson murder), as the Sonno Joi movement continued to expand. According to Sir Ernest Satow: \\"A bloody revenge was taken on the individual [Ii], but the hostility to the system only increased with time, and in the end brought about its complete ruin\\". The conflict reached its resolution with the military defeat of the Shogunate in the Boshin War, and the installation of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Despite the defeat of the Bakufu, Naosuke's positions on foreign policy and defense were favored rather than those introduced by Abe Masahiro, who was appointed to the same office later on.

Life John was born in Norfolk, son of Thomas Towers, a wealthy fishmonger of Yarmouth (d.1589), and his wife Margaret.https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D925385 He matriculated as a sizar of King's College, Cambridge around 1595, entered Queens' College, Cambridge as a scholar in 1598, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1602 and Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1606. On 15 March 1607-8 he was elected a fellow, and on 9 July 1611 he was incorporated at Oxford. He graduated Bachelor of Divinity (BD) in 1615, and obtained that of Doctor of Divinity (DD) per regias literas on 13 December 1624. Previously he was appointed chaplain to William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton, and by him was presented to the rectory of Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, on 11 April 1617. On 11 October 1623 he was instituted rector of Yardley-Hastings in the same county, and on 4 July 1628, being at the time of the king's chaplains, he was presented to the vicarage of Halifax in Yorkshire. On 14 November 1630 he was instituted Dean of Peterborough, and on 3 April 1634 was installed a prebendary of Westminster. He was an ardent supporter of the royal prerogative, and on 11 September 1637 wrote requesting that the collection of ship-money in Peterborough might be entrusted to him instead of the sheriff. On 1 October 1638 he was instituted rector of Castor, Northamptonshire, and on 8 March 1639 he was enthroned bishop of Peterborough, after much lobbying. In his episcopal office Towers supported William Laud in his changes in ritual. On 4 August 1641 he was included in the list of thirteen bishops formally impeached by the House of Commons on account of their co-operation with Laud in enactment of illegal canons in convocation, in consequence of which they were prevented from voting while their cause was pending. On 28 December in company with John Williams, archbishop of York, and ten other bishops, of whom nine were among those impeached, Towers signed the well-known protest declaring the actions of parliament in their absence null and void. On John Pym's motion, those who had signed were impeached as guilty of high treason for subversion of the fundamental laws of the kingdom and the very being of parliament, and on the last day of the year Towers and nine others were lodged in the Tower of London. After about four months he was released, retired to Peterborough, and then to Oxford, where he remained till its surrender in 1646. He then returned to Peterborough, where he died in obscurity on 10 January 1649. He was buried in the cathedral. By his wife Mary (d. 14 November 1672), he had a daughter Spencer, who married Robert Pykarell, rector of Burgate in Suffolk, and died on 16 February 1657 aged 37, and another daughter Catherine, who married Oliver Pocklington, rector of Brington, and died in 1689, and a son William Towers. John Towers' wife was Mary Foskett daughter of Thomas Foskett of Olney (d.1633).https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D866356 In 1633, Thomas Foskett mentions the seven children of his daughter Mary Towers as beneficiaries in his Will, including her son Thomas Towers. Towers was the author of Four Sermons, London, 1660, edited by his son.

Thomas was part of the Wales team that won the Triple Crown in 1909, and faced all three major Southern Hemisphere teams; New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, for Newport. Rugby career Thomas began his rugby career with local lower tier club Pontnewydd before moving to Newport in 1899.Edwin Thomas profile blackandambers.co.uk He was first capped for Wales in the 1904 Home Nations Championship encounter with Scotland. This was the second game of the tournament for Wales, having begun the Championship with a draw against England. The selectors brought five new caps into the Welsh team for the Scotland game, and Thomas was one of four new players brought into the pack. Played at St. Helen's in Swansea, Wales dominated the game with the pack providing the Welsh backs with plenty of possession. After the victory over Scotland, Thomas was reselected for the final game of the campaign away to Ireland. The encounter to Ireland ended in Welsh defeat, blamed mainly on poor referee decisions. Thomas was not selected for the 1905 Championship, but was part of the Newport team to face the Original All Blacks, on the All Blacks first overseas tour. Newport lost the game narrowly, but Thomas played with great zeal,Billot (1972), pg 37. supporting Newport's star forward, Charlie Pritchard. Before winning his third cap, Thomas would face another two touring teams for Newport; South Africa in 1906 and Australia in 1908, both matches resulted in narrow losses to the tourists. Thomas was eventually reselected for Wales for the 1909 Home Nations Championship, five years after his last Wales appearance. Thomas again missed the opening game of the tournament, brought in as a replacement for George Hayward for the Scotland game. After a win over Scotland, Thomas kept his place for the rest of the Championship, which saw victory over France and then Ireland. By beating all the other Home Nations, Wales won the Championship and collected the Triple Crown; and the victory over France, although not officially part of the tournament until the 1909/10 season, also gave Wales a Grand Slam of wins. Thomas played one more international match, the opening encounter with France for the 1910 Five Nations Championship, which Wales won 49-14. The next match Thomas was replaced by Newport team-mate Harry Jarman. After his retirement from rugby, Thomas became a publican, running the Bridgend Inn in Pontnewydd. The Bridgend Inn was once used as the club headquarters of his old team Pontnewydd RFC, and Thomas retained his close relationship with his former club, and was made a life member in 1949.Jenkins (1991), pg 109.

O'Brien (born 1944) is an American geneticist. He served as Chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1986 to 2011. In December 2011, he created the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics, St. Petersburg State University, Russia as Chief Scientific Officer. O'Brien is known for his research contributions in comparative genomics, virology, genetic epidemiology, mammalian systematics and species conservation. Career Stephen J. O‚ÄôBrien served as Chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1986‚Äì2011. In December 2011, he created the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics, St. Petersburg State University as Chief Scientific Officer. In January 2013, he joined the Faculty as Professor at the Oceanographic Center, Nova Southeastern University, Ft Lauderdale Florida. Stephen J. O‚ÄôBrien earned his Ph.D in genetics at Cornell where he expanded the nascent discipline of biochemical genetics, developing the gene-enzyme maps of Drosophila melanogaster. His biochemical mapping would stimulate his editing of six editions of Genetic Maps: Locus Maps of Complex Genomes (1980-1993) (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Publications), international unabridged compendiums of plant, animal, bacteria and virus genetic maps that were prelude to the online NCBI gene mapping databases of species whole genome DNA sequences. O‚ÄôBrien is known for his research contributions in comparative genomics, virology, genetic epidemiology, mammalian systematics and species conservation. In 1983, he and his collaborators discovered the remarkable genetic uniformity of the African cheetah, a prelude to a new discipline of Conservation Genetics. Over three decades of filed studies with his students and colleagues, he subsequently reported over 800 publications, many in the highest rated scientific journals of how genetics could inform and facilitate management action for endangered species. These included identifying new species of elephant, clouded leopard and orangutan plus detailed genetics studies on threatened wildlife species including cheetahs, lions, tigers, giant panda, leopards, pumas, jaguars, koalas, solenodons, and humpback whales. In 1982, O‚ÄôBrien's team at the NIH published a comprehensive gene map of domestic cat as cover article in Science and compared genome organization of the cat to human, mouse and other species demonstrating extreme conservation of chromosomal synteny (homologous gene order) between disparate mammalian species. These and subsequent studies established the field of Comparative Genomics. This discipline today remains a baseline for interpreting the organization and evolution of human and established the domestic cat as a powerful genetic model for hereditary cancer and infections diseases in man and animals. In 1996 O‚ÄôBrien's team described he first human gene to influence HIV-1 infection and AIDS progression, CCR5-Œî32, using population genetic based association analysis. This discovery has led to several HIV entry inhibitor developments that have been approved by FDA as also stimulated the first real cure of HIV-AIDS in the so-called Berlin patient who permanently cleared HIV when infused with CCR5-Œî32/CCR5-Œî32 donor stem cells in 2006. O‚ÄôBrien's group used similar genetic association studies to invigorate the field of Genetic Epidemiology, describing over 30 AIDS restriction genes and also applying these gene discovery strategies to chronic infectious human diseases including, hepatitis c, hepatitis, HBV hepatocellular carcinoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2009 O‚ÄôBrien joined with David Haussler and Oliver Ryder to found the Genome10K project, an international consortium of genome scientists joined together to facilitate the whole genome sequencing, assembly and annotation of 10,000 vertebrate species. Dr. O‚ÄôBrien has a strong dedication to education, evidenced by his appointments as adjunct professor at thirteen universities: Harvard University, The Johns Hopkins University, Cornell University, Duke University, St Francis University, Peking University-Beijing, University of Maryland, University of Minnesota, Michigan State University, Colorado State University, George Washington University, George Mason University, and Hood College of Frederick. He has mentored more than fifteen Ph.D. students including: Roger Reeves, Dennis Gilbert, Robert Wayne, Cheryl Winkler, Jose Lopez, Melanie Culver, Eduardo Eizirik, Olga Uphyrkina, Carlos Driscoll, Meredith Brown, and Shu Jin Luo in addition to eight M.S. theses and over thirty post-doctoral fellows. Since 1996 he has directed an internationally heralded short course sponsored by the Smithsonian and American Genetics Association, entitled ‚ÄúRecent Advances in Conservation Genetics‚Äù, the most recent (2018) edition at Front Royal, Virginia, U.S.A. In 2018, Dr. OBrien was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2016 O'Brien was elected as a Foreign Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Dr. O‚ÄôBrien was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Science, to the Explorer's Club, and to the Cosmos Club.

It was founded on 9 March 2001 to help the families of disappeared Kurds in Turkey. According to Yakar-Der, more than 1,500 persons are unaccounted for following the \\"special war\\" period in Turkey from 1993 to 1998, in the context of actions taken to root out the PKK. These activities were brought to light in the Susurluk scandal which surfaced in 1996 and resulted in several high-level resignations in the Turkish Government. About The current (May 2019) President of Yakar-Der is Pervin Buldan. Its stated objectives are: * To investigate the unknown killings of known opponents of the State and the disappearance of such people under very suspicious situations and circumstances; * To investigate and try to find out who are responsible for the unknown killings and/or disappearances of such activists, and to bring them to book, i.e. to make certain that they are arrested, prosecuted and punished; and *To work with the families of those who have been killed or who have disappeared. History Yakar-Der was established as a result of a long struggle organised by what came to be known as the Saturday Mothers, a group of women who protested every Saturday for about two years in front of the Galatasaray High School in Taksim in Istanbul. It is a successor to the Association Mag-Der, which was closed down by the Turkish authorities because of alleged irregularities with respect to the Turkish Law of Associations. Each year, Yakar-Der, together with the Turkish Human Rights Association (ƒ∞HD) and the International Committee Against Disappearances (ICAD), organise a series of special events to mark the Week of Disappeared People. In May 2006, they organised the 5th International Conference against Disappearances, in Diyarbakir. In 2008 they organized sit- down strikes, a photo exhibition and panel discussions with the relatives of missing persons. They also filed a complaint with the public prosecutor and demanded the punishment of officials responsible for the disappearance of the missing persons. In May 2009, they began a campaign to urge Turkey to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.

Two British Special Operations Executive agents and an officer of the former Royal Yugoslav Air Force were put ashore at Peraziƒáa Do, just north of Petrovac. On 4 February the three agents went ashore from the British submarine HMS Thorn. They were Major Terence Atherton (a former journalist and agent in Belgrade), Lieutenant Radoje Nedeljkoviƒá of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force and Sergeant Patrick O'Donovan, wireless operator. The operation failed completely. The presence of the Yugoslav officer implied links to the royalist Chetniks and it is suggested that this caused Tito to suspect the British of being spies. Nothing beneficial arose, therefore, and the British agents left Tito. They vanished soon thereafter, as did the large amount of gold and Italian money that they carried. British liaison officer at Mihailoviƒá's headquarters Duane \\"Bill\\" Hudson prompted Mihailoviƒá to ordered a formal inquiry into the fate of the Atherton mission. A summary of the results of this investigation was sent by Hudson to SOE office in Cairo. According to the results of the inquiry, the most probable culprit for Atherton's death was ƒçetnik leader Spasoje Dakiƒá.

Listed at , 165 lb., Hamrick batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Fast and steady, Hamrick was one of many ballplayers who interrupted their careers to serve during World War II. Hamrick started his professional baseball career as a shortstop and pitcher in 1939, playing for the Nashville, Charleston and Americus Minor league teams. During his stay at Americus, he made the All-Star team in 1941 and batted over a .300 batting average for most of the year. His most productive season came in 1943, when he hit 145 in 460 at-bats with Nashville for a .310 average. Hamrick joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 1943. The following season, he began spring training with the team in Wilmington, Delaware, because the war kept the teams out of Florida for camp due to the submarine threat. Hamrick left spring training as Philadelphia's starting shortstop, but he left for the military service after appearing in 74 games. With the end of the war, Hamrick rejoined the team (by then the Phillies) in 1946, but the competition for a roster spot was now overwhelming as Skeeter Newsome became the everyday shortstop. In a two-season majors career, Hamrick was a .204 hitter (92-for-452) in 118 games, including 34 runs, 32 RBI, 13 doubles, two triples, one home run and one stolen base. He made 74 appearances at shortstop (86) and second base (31), and posted a collective .946 fielding percentage. After that, Hamrick hit .266 (92-for-346) for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1946, his last professional baseball season. Hamrick died in his homeland of Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 87.

The eight networks include Automotive.TV, Cars.TV, Comedy.TV, ES.TV, Justice Central, MyDestination.TV, Pets.TV and Recipe.TV. All the shows appearing on the networks are produced and distributed exclusively by Entertainment Studios, but are also distributed in traditional broadcast syndication, to some controversy by cable providers who have rejected carriage of the networks under those grounds as providing low customer value when those programs are all available on traditional television stations. In addition, Byron Allen in early 2018 acquired The Weather Channel, which remained mainly under carriage agreements under its old management, along with its own separate corporate structure. History The networks were launched in May 2009 through a deal with Verizon FIOS and have since expanded to several other pay-TV services. The networks are also offered direct-to- consumer through a Roku/Amazon Fire TV channel known as \\"SmartTV.com\\". On March 22, 2018, Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios announced its intent to acquire The Weather Channel's television assets from an NBCUniversal/Blackstone Group partnership. The actual value is undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million; the channel's non-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale. Likewise, the regional sports networks Entertainment Studios is purchasing in conjunction with Sinclair Broadcast Group will be operated in a separate venture, Diamond Sports Ventures. Ratings As of the end of 2017, only two of the channels in the suite, Justice Central and Comedy.TV, maintained a nightly Nielsen average enough to tabulate a rating, while the others five had such a low sample size, they unable to be rated; the two channels also are regularly among the least rated Nielsen-measured networks in the United States. ESN has since classed the other five networks together as one unit known as \\"ESN Lifestyle\\" for ratings purposes to allow Nielsen classification, though this has not been reflected on-air. As of 2019, Comedy.TV was the lowest-rated network measured by Nielsen, with an average of 1,000 primetime viewers. Justice Central had the highest viewership among Allen networks, averaging 11,000 viewers. The remaining five channels have a combined average of 3,000 viewers. Channels *Cars.TV - dedicated to notable cars, showcasing the collectors, designers, innovators, and ultimate car enthusiasts. *Comedy.TV - comedians performing live and taped, as well as hosted talk and variety shows such as Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen and Comedy.TV. *ES.TV - entertainment news, variety shows, and celebrity profiles. *Justice Central - reruns of Entertainment Studios' court shows America's Court with Judge Ross, We the People With Gloria Allred, and Justice for All with Judge Cristina P√©rez. *MyDestination.TV - dedicated to showcasing exotic destinations around the world, and Beautiful Homes & Great Estates *Pets.TV - dedicated to pets and pet lovers, celebrating the best in show and the people who love them. *Recipe.TV - showcasing chefs, recipes, food and cuisine from around the world. Carriage lawsuits On December 3, 2014 a $10 billion racial discrimination lawsuit was filed against AT&T;'s U-verse division and DirecTV by the National Association of African American Owned Media (NAAAOM) for allegedly violating the Civil Rights Act of 1866. NAAAOM is headed by Entertainment Studios Vice-President Mark DeVitre. The lawsuit claimed that Entertainment Studio Networks were denied carriage by the two providers on racial concerns. In December 2015, AT&T; and DirecTV (by then part of AT&T;) reached a settlement with Entertainment Studios to carry the networks, with Comedy and Justice Central carried on DirecTV, and Comedy, Recipe, ES, MyDestination, Cars and Pets added to U-verse, along with Justice Central's existing carriage. The same type of lawsuit, again for $10 billion, was filed against Charter on January 28, 2016, which seeks carriage as part of Charter's merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks into the front-facing Spectrum brand. Charter and Comcast (which had a separate $20 billion suit filed against them by Entertainment Studios and NAAOM) filed an appeal to dismiss the lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on First Amendment grounds, which was dismissed by the 9th Circuit on November 19, 2018, allowing the two suits to go forward to trial. Comcast successfully petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari to challenge the Ninth Circuit's decision, which the Court granted in June 2019.

History  Two short piers at Amlwch were built following a private Act of Parliament of 1743, when the harbour was improved. Two octagonal houses, with small lanterns protruding from the roof, were added. They were described in the New Seaman's Guide as \\"small white houses displaying lights at night\\". In 1816 an outer pier, about long, was built to give shipping extra protection inside the harbour. In 1817, a small lighthouse with a light above high-water mark was built, subsequently replaced with the present lighthouse. The drydock and lighthouse on the small creek at Amlwch once served the shipping of one of the largest copper mines in Europe, located at Parys Mountain.

The band's music draws on a diverse range of influences (including reggae, blues, funk, dub, jazz, ragga and acoustic folk) and combines live playing with samples and programming, resulting in an organic sound that has sometimes been compared to a British version of Arrested Development.NME.com entry for Urban Species. Retrieved 17 August 2009 The band's music is frequently associated with the acid jazz movement of the mid-1990s. Urban Species' consistent core figure and effective leader has been Peter \\"Mintos\\" Akinrinlola, but the band's line-up has at various times included other producers and rappers plus many of the best musicians from the London funk and jazz-funk scenes. The band is also known for collaborations, most notably with Terry Callier and Imogen Heap. History Prehistory (MC Mint and Renegade) The band was founded in Tottenham, North London, England, by childhood friends Peter Akinrinlola (who took on the rapper's name of \\"MC Mint\\", later revising it to \\"Mintos\\") and Winston Small (who provided beats under the name \\"DJ Renegade\\"). Growing up in the 1980s, both shared an interest in various underground music including hip-hop (which at the time was restricted mainly to its electro and rap subdivisions), dancehall reggae, rave and blues. The duo began writing together in 1988. For sampleable material, they drew extensively on the stock of jazz and funk records owned by Renegade's older brother, which came to shape their organic, live-sounding musical approach. Under the MC Mint & DJ Renegade name, the duo recorded their first white-label release ‚Äì \\"It's My Thing\\" ‚Äì in 1989. The disc became an underground and pirate radio hit in the UK and also came to the attention of two high-profile New York radio stations (Kiss and WBLS) who eventually put the track into frequent rotation. Inspired by this initial success (which, as an unsigned act without commercial backing, they were unable to immediately follow up), Mintos and Renegade eventually produced a second self-funded and distributed single called \\"Got To Have It\\". This attracted the interest of British DJ Gilles Peterson, a champion of new black British music who was also the owner of the Phonogram Records subsidiary Talkin' Loud (the label for acts including Incognito, Omar Lye-Fook, Young Disciples and Galliano). Talkin' Loud eventually signed Mintos and Renegade in 1992 under the new project name of Urban Species. 1992‚Äì1993 ‚Äì Urban Species develop their profile The first formal Urban Species track to be released was \\"Hide And Seek\\" (which appeared on the Talking Loud Sampler Volume 2 compilation). Shortly afterwards, Urban Species expanded from a core duo to a trio with the addition of a second rapper, Doc Slim (real name Rodney Green). Slim was one of Mintos' and Renegade's old school friends, and had an MC delivery inspired by ragga- style toasting and street humour. For live appearances, Urban Species drew on a pool of live funk musicians (including drummer Andrew Missingham, bass player Yolanda Charles and guitarist Nemo Jones, as well as members of Incognito and Galliano) to ensure that they delivered full-fledged musical shows instead of DAT-based PA performances. As a consequence ‚Äì and following well-received support slots for MC Solaar, Guru's Jazzmatazz project and the Stereo MCs ‚Äì the band developed a strong live reputation and soon attained headline-act status. 1994 ‚Äì Listen Urban Species released their debut album ‚Äì Listen ‚Äì in May 1994. The band had extended the musicality of their concerts to their recording sessions, incorporating live instruments alongside the samples and programming, and going for a spacious, organic feel to the album atmospheres. Listen included the earlier single \\"Gotta Have It\\" as well as \\"Hide And Seek\\". It also produced three more singles ‚Äì the title track (featuring singer Chezer√©), \\"Spiritual Love\\" and \\"Brother\\". The latter two were hits, and the album received wide critical acclaim. Over the next eighteen months, the band continued to develop their profile. They became successful in continental Europe (particularly in France) and maintained their inroads into the US via New York, where they had developed an underground following considerable airplay and an acclaimed performance at the 1994 New Music Seminar. Aiming for a truly international approach, the band also toured the Far East and Africa, where they continued to befriend other musicians and educate themselves. 1995‚Äì1997 ‚Äì line-up and direction changes As the success of Urban Species grew, Mintos became the dominant force in the band. This in turn caused friction between him and Renegade, who was also finding the rigours of touring to be difficult. Not without regret, Renegade opted to leave Urban Species in 1995. He would subsequently follow a career as a hip- hop/R'n‚ÄôB producer with Dub Wise Productions. With Mintos now in overall charge of the project, Urban Species began to move towards a more collective approach (similar to that of their contemporaries Massive Attack) in which the group's core membership was less important than the opportunities offered by collaboration. In 1997, the band began recording material for a second album, Blanket. The first sign of a new approach came with the 1997 EP Religion and Politics. The two songs featured on the EP (the title track and 'Changing of the Guard') were both collaborations with 1960s American jazz-folk-soul singer Terry Callier, whose career had recently been reinvigorated in the UK by the interest of the acid-jazz community. 1998‚Äì1999 ‚Äì Blanket Further album sessions followed, with the assistance of new producer Raw Deal. During this period, Doc Slim was replaced in the band (both in the studio and onstage) by a new MC called Tukka Yout. Mintos also invited contributions from various other artists outside the Urban Species core. These included veteran British rappers Blak Twang and MC Mell'O', plus singers Elizabeth Troy, Jeffery Darnell (a fellow Talkin' Loud signing), future house star MJ Cole and singer- songwriter Imogen Heap. Due to Urban Species' higher European profile, Blanket was originally released in continental Europe in late 1998, without a UK release until the following year. However, the album was similarly successful to Listen and received similar critical acclaim. As well as incorporating the collaborations with Terry Callier, the album produced two singles ‚Äì the title track (co-written by and featuring Imogen Heap) and \\"Woman\\". 2000‚Äì2008 ‚Äì hiatus Following the release and promotion of Blanket, Urban Species released no new material bar occasional remixes. In the early 2000s, Mintos put Urban Species on indefinite hold to concentrate on family life and other projects. During this period he wrote material for S Club 7, The Freestylers and LHB as well as various unspecified \\"unsigned talent\\". He also developed a career outside music as an entrepreneur, starting up an Overseas Property company as well as an organic coffee business. 2008‚Äìpresent ‚Äì reunion On 6 December 2008, Mintos announced an Urban Species reunion via his MySpace blog. He commented \\"My break from music went on for a lot longer than I intended. I kept saying 'yeah, this year... this year... this year...' and before I knew it six years flew by. But nothing before its time, I always say. I got my groove, passion and hunger back plus I got a lot of things to say.\\" Mintos' two main creative foils in the reunion appear to be Doc Slim and Blanket producer Raw Deal, with whom he is recording a third Urban Species album.\\"My first blog ‚Äì a heads-up from Mintos\\" ‚Äì posting on Urban Species MySpace page by Mintos, 6 December 2008 (accessed 17 August 2009) The band are also intending to carry out a reunion tour featuring various former Talkin' Loud colleagues, about which Mintos has commented \\"I spoke to Omar and (he) likes the idea. Bluey from the Incognito is said to be down and he's gonna speak to Carleen Anderson from the (Young Disciples).

Its dual purposes are to conduct advanced research in pure and applied mathematics, and to provide postgraduate education leading to Masters and PhD degrees in mathematics, computation and computational finance. The institute also runs training programs in schools aimed at increasing mathematics awareness and leading to competitions such as the Mathematics Olympiads. It is affiliated to Utkal University which is one of the largest affiliating universities. History The Institute began functioning in 1999 inside a room of the Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar. In July 2008, IMA acquired its own residential campus, built by Tata Steel in Bhubaneswar city, when it was established as a full-fledged, degree granting academic institution. Campus The main Institute is a complex, which was designed by architect Karan Grover, with an investment of Rs. 140 million. The campus also includes computer laboratories, classrooms, a library, as well as residential accommodations. A play ground and a volleyball court are also included. Activities The current focus areas of research within the institute include wavelet analysis, stochastic processes, functional analysis, Algebraic Topology, Differential Geometry, Group Representations, operator theory, fuzzy logic, geometric application in physics, approximation theory, Lie Algebra, Astronomy, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and cyclone modelling, Machine Learning in Finance, Computational Finance. The institute offers a B. Sc. Honors degree in Mathematics and Computation as well as M. Sc. degrees in Computational Finance and Data Science.. It currently admits 30 students each year based on a national entrance examination. It also provides training to school students for mathematical competitions. The institute professes to investigate the mathematical tradition of ancient India. It also provides awards to eminent mathematicians in the state of Odisha. B.Sc. Honours in Mathematics and Computing The Institute offers a Bachelor of Science (Honours) Degree in Mathematics and Computing. The course includes the study of pure mathematics as well as mathematical modeling and the use of abstract methods to solve concrete problems. Computer Science is major and compulsory for every student and it includes the study of Algorithms design, analysis, Cellular Automata and other branches in Theoretical Computer Science. Rigorous training and lot of exposure in pure mathematics is given to the students. In the final semester, each student must submit a dissertation.  M.A./M.Sc. in Computational Finance  Finance as a subject has emerged to be an extremely involved branch of knowledge with growing number of stock exchanges and investors in the field. Risk and return that constitute cardinal aspects of the subject, remain as a major concern for every investor, individual as well as institutional. Volumes of data encountered in the process make investment decisions difficult. In apparently erratic behaviors of the market, however the mathematicians try to capture patterns vis- a-vis predictability, which may help investors decide on their investment. Computational finance otherwise called financial engineering deals with portfolio selection, options and futures, asset pricing, managing derivative markets and hedging under uncertainty. The course imparts, besides, basic grounding on finance, expertise for modeling under uncertainty, a high level of computational skill geared towards finance, knowledge of financial accounting and regulations. The aim is to produce a competent financial engineer capable of analyzing existing financial products and suggest new innovative products for the financial market.  M.A./M.Sc. in Mathematics with Data Science  From 2018, the institute started a master's degree course in Data Science, one of the emerging fields of the current day. It is a programme of 2 years, after which the candidates are granted a M.Sc. degree from the Utkal University.

As an integrated operator, the Group develops and finances the construction of renewable energy facilities, and manages operations and maintenance for its own account and for third parties. According to its own figures, the company is active in 22 countries with an installed global capacity of 12,468 MW (as of June 2019), with wind being the largest sector, followed by solar and energy storage. The company is also involved in marine energy. The company was formerly known as EDF Energies Nouvelles until it was rebranded in April 2018 to its current name, EDF Renewables. History In 1990, the Soci√©t√© Internationale d'Investissements Financiers ‚Äì √ânergies (SIIF √ânergies) was created by P√¢ris Mouratoglou, a thermal and hydroelectric power plant development company. The firm in 1999 positioned itself in the renewable energy sector and in 2000, P√¢ris Mouratoglou sold 35% of SIIF √ânergies to √âlectricit√© de France (EDF). In 2002, EDF increased its stake in SIIF √ânergies to 50%. Two years later, SIIF became EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN), while maintaining the same capital structure. EDF listed EDF Energies Nouvelles on the stock exchange in 2006. P√¢ris Mouratoglou retained a 25.1% stake of the capital at that time, while EDF held 50%, the balance being the free float on the stock market. EDF Energies Nouvelles unlisted from the stock market on 15 August 2011, following EDF's buy-out of the remaining 50% stake from P√¢ris Mouratoglou and the free float, pushing EDF's stake in EDF Energies Nouvelles to 100%.  International expansion  In 2012, the group increased its involvement in offshore wind energy and entered the markets of Poland, Israel, Morocco and South Africa. A year later, EDF Energies Nouvelles expanded into the Indian market. EDF Energies Nouvelles that year acquired the wind power business of S√©chilienne-Sidec (now Albioma) for ‚Ç¨59 million. The company entered Brazil and Chile in 2015. Upon expanding into China in 2016, the company acquired an 80% stake in Hong Kong-based UPC Asia Wind Management, a company specialising in onshore wind power in China. This move was based on a strategy that saw increasing its wind capacity in China by working with Chinese partners on a project-by-project basis. In April 2017, EDF EN announced the acquisition of a 67.2% majority stake, in addition to convertible bonds, in Futuren, a wind farm operator, valued at around ‚Ç¨188 million. In December of that year, EDF launched the Solar Plan, with which the EDF Group hoped to build 30 GW of solar photovoltaic power in France between 2020 and 2035, for an investment of around ‚Ç¨25 billion. In 2018, EDF Energies Nouvelles rebranded to become EDF Renewables to boost international appeal. In April of that year, the group acquired Luxel, a company specialising in photovoltaic installations, with the acquisition concluding on 1 April 2019.  Core business activities  Onshore and offshore wind power Wind power is EDF Renewables' main sector with 87% of its total installed capacity distributed mainly in Europe and North America. Wind power is EDF's main growth driver. As of June 2019, the group had a total of 12.468 MW gross in operation and 4,055 MW under construction in 22 countries. EDF signed a supply contract with the Procter & Gamble Group in 2015 to supply wind power to its North American manufacturing sites. The 123 MW wind farm is expected to help P&G; achieve their goal to reduce CO2-emissions by 30% by 2020. The group is a key player in offshore wind energy, with two offshore wind farms in Belgium (C-Power) and the United Kingdom (Teesside). In March 2019, EDF Renewables acquired stakes in two Chinese offshore projects, the Dongtai IV and V wind farms, that will be delivered in cooperation with Chinese power utility China Energy Investment Corporation (CEI) by 2021. It is involved in three structuring projects under development in France, won through a government call for tenders, totalling nearly 1,500 MW in Saint-Nazaire, Courseulles-sur- Mer and F√©camp.  Photovoltaic sector  The photovoltaic solar sector is EDF Renewables' second largest business sector. It currently has solar energy projects in 13 countries with an installed capacity of 2,423 MW, according to own figures. In 2016, EDF Renewables opened the Bolero solar power plant in Chile‚Äôs Atacama Desert in with a capacity of 146 MW. One of the company's subsidiaries, French solar panel manufacturer Photowatt, announced to be forming a joint venture with Canadian Solar and EMC Greentech to develop solar panels based on a new technology. In 2019, EDF Renewables, along with Total Eren and their joint venture EDEN Renewables India, signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to develop four solar power projects in India, with a capacity of 716 MW.  Electricity storage  In March 2018, EDF announced a major electrical storage plan with the objective of becoming the European leader in the sector by 2035, for an investment worth ‚Ç¨8 billion over the period 2018-2035. In June 2018, EDF opened a 49MW battery storage facility in West Burton, UK. The firm acquired British battery storage start-up Pivot Power in November 2019 for an undisclosed amount.  International operations   Europe   Germany  On 5 July 2017, EDF EN announced the acquisition of Offshore Wind Solutions (OWS), a German company specializing in the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms, in order to complete its operations conducted through Reetec Gmbh, in which EDF EN acquired a stake in 2007. EDF began the refurbishment of the Eckolst√§dt wind farm in Thuringia in December 2018, updating its capacity from 14.5 MW to 34.5 MW when the works are finished. EDF Renewables acquired wind projects of 300MW under development in Germany from Altus in September 2019.  France  In June 2017, EDF opened the Montagne-Ard√©chois wind farm, the most powerful in the Auvergne- Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. The facility consists of 29 turbines with an installed capacity of 73.5 MW. At the end of June 2017, the Mont-des-Quatre-Faux wind farm project was greenlit by the authorities. Supported by EDF EN in association with the Belgian developer WindVision, it will eventually include 63 wind turbines with a capacity of 3.5 to 5 MW each. On July 6, 2017, EDF EN Services, an EDF subsidiary operating and maintaining wind and photovoltaic power plants, inaugurated the Villeveyrac (Occitania) regional management centre. It is permanently connected to the European control centre in Colombiers, H√©rault, which supervises and controls remotely all the renewable production units managed by EDF EN. On July 19, 2017, the President of the Occitania Region, Carole Delga, signed a new collaboration agreement with the EDF Group to support Occitania in its ambition to become a positive energy region, including achieving economic development, assisting in the energy transition and providing training and employment. A few days, later, EDF Energies Nouvelles and Naval Energies-OpenHydro launched the construction of the first hydro turbine assembly plant in France at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin (Manche), named Normandie Hydro. In October 2017, EDF EN and ArcelorMittal M√©diterran√©e announced the commissioning of the 12 MW La Fossette photovoltaic power plant in Fos-sur-mer (Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne). In December 2017, EDF EN announced to be constructing new wind and solar projects in Occitania, with 120 MW of projects to be built in 2018 and 2019, as well as 500 MW of projects under development. In the summer of 2018, EDF opened the Belfays wind farm in the Grand Est region, with an installed capacity of 20 MW. In September 2019, the company inaugurated a solar power plant on the site of the former Aramon thermal power plant. A month later, the company commissioned a wind farm with a capacity of 22 MW in the Marne region.  United Kingdom  In April 2017, EDF Renewable Energy, in a joint venture with EDF Energy, announced the commissioning of the Corriemoillie (47.5 MW), Beck Burn (31 MW) and Pearie Law (19.2 MW) wind farms. Beck Burn was opened in July that year. Also in July 2017, EDF Energy Renewables announced the acquisition of 11 Scottish wind farm sites from asset manager Partnerships for Renewables, with a potential capacity of 600 MW. In May 2018, EDF Energies Nouvelles bought the \\"Neart na Gaoithe\\" wind farm in Scotland from Irish company Mainstream Renewable Power, following a competitive process. It will produce 450 MW. The farm is planned to go online in 2023. EDF Renewables opened its wind farm in Blyth in July 2018, where the individual turbines are connected via offshore cables to bring the electricity produced onshore.

Retrieved July 2013. Dalanistes is closely related to Remingtonocetus (the type genus of Remingtonocetidae, a slightly more derived family of early whales), but also shares several features with Ambulocetus (the type of Ambulocetidae, earlier more primitive whales), and, with its combination of terrestrial and amphibious adaptations, Dalanistes apparently is an intermediate form between these two groups. Isotopic evidence suggest that Dalanistes had a marine diet. Dalanistes is known from several localities and collections. The holotype is a skull and a postcranial skeleton. Additional fossils referred to Dalanistes include crania, several vertebrae and sacra, possible caudals, one side of the pelvis, and a distal femur. The alveoli is all that is left of the dentition, but the dental formula apparently was . The vertebral elements of the sacrum are solidly fused and form a well-developed articular surface for the pelvis. The ilium is robust and long, and has a large acetabulum similar to that in Remingtonocetus. The femur had a spherical head, a medial condyle considerably larger than the lateral, and a shallow patellar groove. Taken together this morphology suggests the presence of well-developed hind limbs. Dalanistes is similar to but 20% larger than Remingtonocetus; the external nares are located more anteriorly (above C1); the sagittal crest is much higher; the rostrum is angled down 20¬∞ relative to the main axis of the braincase; the mandibular symphysis is relatively open (ends at P3) and the mandibular canals fail to unite at the symphysis. This mandibular morphology is also different from that of Andrewsiphius (another remingtonocetid). Dalanistes was named by contracting \\"Dalana\\" and \\"-istes\\" to allude to the Greek name platanistes used for (unrelated) South Asian river dolphin. Both the genus and species name refer to local place names near the type locality: Dalana Nala and Basti Ahmed respectively.

History Ufomammut was formed in Italy in 1999 by Poia, Urlo and Vita, a lineup that has remained stable until 2020, when Vita left the band to dedicate himself to other musical projects. The trio has developed a sound characterised by lengthy songs centered on repeated heavy riffs coupled with droning vocals and the use of sound effects and synths. Ufomammut released their debut studio album Godlike Snake in 2000 through Beard of Stars Records. It was followed in 2004 by Snailking, which was later reissued by Supernatural Cat Records in 2009. The third album Lucifer Songs was released in 2005 and brought the band to discover new sonic paths with a massive use of droning sounds and synths, while in 2007 the band recorded a collaboration album with fellow Italian band Lento titled Supernaturals: Record One. Poia (left), Vita (centre) and Urlo (right) performing at Shagoo Shagoo Fest 2008.In 2008, they released their fourth studio album, Idolum, pushing even further the monolithic sound and psychedelic vein of their music to a new level of composition. In 2010 the band released Eve, their fifth album. Eve consists of one 45-minute atmospheric track, divided into five distinctive movements; it depicts Eve as a figure reminiscent of both Lucifer (in her rebellion against God) and Prometheus (in bringing knowledge to humanity). ORO, divided into ten movements, was delivered by Neurot Recordings in two separate pieces during 2012: the first chapter, Opus Primum, in April, and the second, Opus Alter, in September. The concepts behind ORO are expansive and multi-faceted, mutating the Italian palindrome which translates to \\"gold\\" with the Latin translation of \\"I pray.\\" ORO's two chapters can be considered as a single track, as the last part of Opus Primum is able to flow easily into Opus Alter. Ecate came out in 2015 and it's the seventh album of the band, out again for Neurot Recordings. Its title is Italian for the pre-Hellenic goddess Hecate, able to move toward the world of humans, the world of the gods and the world of the dead. The seventh album of the band is an evolution in terms of composition and song structure, it's an aggressive and complex album that bring the previous works to a new form. The band's latest album 8 came out on 22 September 2017 through Neurot Recordings and Supernatural Cat for the vinyl release in Europe. It is a continuous flux of music (its title symbolizing infinity), a single stream divided in 8 songs, recorded live together with no overdubs with the exception of vocals and synths. Ufomammut live at Soulcrusher II Festival, Nijmegen (Netherlands) (2017) Ufomammut have made continual appearances at festivals like Roadburn, Hellfest, Asymmetry, Dour Festival, Ieper Fest, Stoned from the Underground, South of Mainstream, Festival d'Affaire, Metalride fest, Le Guess who festival, Maryland Death Fest, Brutal Assault Festival, FIMAV and more and have been touring several times around Europe, reaching the USA and Canada in 2015, New Zealand and Australia in 2016 and Russia in 2017. Ufomammut's live shows are supported by the video and graphic art studio Malleus Rock art lab, a rock artist collective of which Poia and Urlo form a part .Sleeping Shaman interview Malleus Artistic Collective Dead Sparrow interview The band announced Vita's departure and their temporary hiatus in January 2020.  Style  The sound of Urlo's bass and Poia's guitar are typically distorted, Vita's drum rhythms are slow and oppressive and a peculiarity of the band are the psychedelic and hypnoticvisuals during the live shows. During the live performances the band syncs loops of videos with the different parts in their composition, adding up to the sound layers in the sound image to create a feeling of being taken on a journey. The songs structure is in many cases similar to the one typical of Progressive_Rock. The sound of Ufomammut is the product of research around the instruments and amplification setup, resulting in the use of custom tube amplifiers with heavy full size cabinets, and Drop_B_tuning on guitar and bass.

Background  IPS is a result of Annex I of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-8, which tasked the DIS with developing an integrated planning system. In replacement of the National Planning and Execution System (NPES), IPSO is I CS/NI MS compliant and is based on coordination and synchronization rather than command and control. The IPSO applies to federal departments and agencies, with a role in homeland security, when conducting scenario-based planning. It is particularly useful for developing plans against the fifteen National Planning Scenarios. The IPS's doctrine supports: * Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5), * Homeland Security Presidential Directive‚Äì8 (HSPD-8), Annex I, * National Response Framework (NRF), * National Incident Management System (NI MS), * National Preparedness Guidelines (NP G), and * National Strategy for Homeland Security (NSHS).  Purpose  The Integrated Planning System (IPS) fulfills the requirement for a standardized national planning process and integration system as directed by Annex I to HSPD-8. The system is intended to provide a basic framework for the development of a series of products leading to a synchronized federal plan. The IPS is a how-to guide for federal departments and agencies to develop contingency planning documents that support state, local, and tribal governments. It provides a common federal planning process made up of three levels of planning: strategic, operational, and tactical; it supports the development of a family of related planning documents: Strategic Guidance Statements (SGSs), Strategic Plans, Concept Plans (CONPLANs), Operations Plans (OPLANs), and Tactical plans.  Hierarchy of Plans  IPS introduces four planning levels: Strategic, conceptual, operational, and tactical.  Federal Requirement  The target audience for the IPS are the Federal agencies with a role in homeland security, with a particular focus on agencies that rely on, or provide assistance, to other agencies. Federal agencies with no existing planning processes are required to adopt the IPS. The IPS does not supersede any existing state, local, and tribal planning processes. However, it is the standard planning system that the Federal Government will use for scenario-based planning. The IPS is compatible with many existing planning systems. State, local, and tribal governments are not mandated to adopt the IPS; at the same time, they are the foundation of the homeland security planning process since their participation in integrated planning and understanding of the work product is crucial.  Key Terms  Contingency Planning: Contingency planning creates plans in anticipation of future incidents based on the most current information. A contingency is an incident that would involve national resources to prevent, protect, respond, or recover from terrorist attacks or natural disasters. Crisis Action Planning: Crisis action planning occurs in response to a credible threat or incident. It occurs in a time-compressed environment with the objective of developing an executable plan. Planners operating in a crisis action planning environment normally attempt to modify an existing contingency plan related to the incident threat or scenario. If a plan is unavailable, a crisis action plan will be developed. Strategic Guidance Statement (SGS): The Secretary will develop an SGS for each NPS set, in coordination with the heads of Federal agencies with a role in homeland security. Additional planning requirements will be developed as the Secretary, in coordination with Federal agencies with a role in homeland security, deems appropriate. The Secretary will appoint and approve a development team for each SGS. Strategic Plan: The Secretary will develop a corresponding strategic plan for each approved SGS, in coordination with the heads of Federal agencies with a role in homeland security and the director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) 24 for terrorism- related NPS. The secretary will appoint a development team for each strategic plan. A strategic plan must be completed no later than 90 days after the associated SGS is approved and shall be effective upon the secretary's approval. Concept Plan (CONPLAN): The Secretary will develop a CONPLAN for each approved strategic plan, in coordination with the heads of federal agencies with a role in homeland security and in consultation with appropriate state, local, and tribal governments. A CONPLAN must be completed no later than 180 days after the associated strategic plan is approved. Operations Plan (OPLAN): The Secretary will review OPLANs in the interest of identifying gaps and seams, enhancing unity of effort, and linking plans to exercises. The intent of this feedback process is to identify potential operational shortfalls that might jeopardize the ability to achieve strategic objectives.

Dingwall Castle was a medieval fort and royal castle in the town of Dingwall, eastern Ross-shire, Scotland. The castle is believed to have been established by Norse settlers in the area in the 11th century. Wars of Scottish Independence During the Wars of Scottish Independence the castle was garrisoned by the forces of king Edward I of England. However it was later captured by Scottish forces for king Robert I of Scotland (Robert the Bruce) led by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross. From the castle, the Earl of Ross (chief of Clan Ross) led the men of Ross to fight against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. As a reward in 1321 King Robert granted Dingwall Castle with the town and lands of Dingwall to the Earl of Ross. Murder in the Castle These broken walls are the only remaining ruins of the original Dingwall Castle In 1370 a feud arose between William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (chief of Clan Sutherland) and Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver (chief of Clan Mackay). A meeting was arranged for them to meet at Dingwall Castle to resolve their issues.History of the House and Clan of Mackay by Robert Mackay (1829), p.47: Quoting A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland by Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656). However, Iye Mackay and his son Donald Mackay were both murdered in the castle while they were asleep by Nicholas Sutherland, 1st of Duffus, brother of the Earl of Sutherland. See page: Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver for a detailed explanation of the feud. Duel Sometime at the beginning of the 15th century a duel is said to have taken place between the governor of the castle, who had been appointed by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Thomas Munro, brother of Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis (chief of Clan Munro). The two met at the village of Maryburgh and after an argument dirks were pulled and a duel took place in which Thomas Munro killed the governor of Dingwall Castle.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1898). History of the Munros of Fowlis p. 12. The Scottish Castles Association states that the new governor of the castle was \\"assassinated\\" by one of the Munroes and replaced by a Mackay. Lord of the Isles occupation In 1411 Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles (chief of Clan Donald) captured Dingwall Castle as part of his attempt to seize the title of the Earldom of Ross.Anderson, William (1862), The Scottish nation: or, The surnames, families, literature, honours, and biographical history of the people of Scotland, Fullarton, p. 37-8. This took place shortly before the Battle of Harlaw. In 1438 the next successive Clan Donald chief, Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross was officially recognised as the Earl of Ross and took up his residence at Dingwall Castle. His son, John of Islay, Earl of Ross was not as successful; the Earldom of Ross was confiscated from him and the castle became a royal possession once more in 1475. John Munro, 11th Baron of Foulis was then made governor of the castle, who in turn was succeeded by Andrew Munro, 2nd of Milntown. The next governor in 1488 was Sir James Dunbar. 16th century In 1507 Andrew Stewart, Bishop of Caithness carried out improvements after the castle had been assaulted by the MacDonalds and Mackenzies. Later governors were John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl (1516 - 1522), John Earl of Moray - brother of king James V of Scotland, David Sinclair - until 1550, George Munro, 4th of Milntown also known as \\"of Docharty\\" in 1561, Sir Andrew Keith, (Lord Dingwall), in 1584, Sir John Preston Earl of Desmond in 1605. Downfall The Crown abandoned Dingwall Castle in about 1600 and it eventually fell into a ruin. The castle ceased to be maintained after the death of king James VI of Scotland in 1625. It was used as a quarry until 1817 when it was finally levelled and only a few fragments remain. The remains are protected as a scheduled monument. Tunnel A tunnel still exists that runs from the site of Dingwall Castle to the basement of nearby Tulloch Castle. The tunnel has now collapsed, but it is possible to view this passageway through an air vent on the front lawn of Tulloch Castle's grounds.

Forming out of a tropical wave and an upper-level low pressure system on August 16, Claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of Tallahassee, Florida. By the afternoon, the storm had attained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and steadily tracked towards the Florida Panhandle. Early on August 17, the center of Claudette made landfall on Santa Rosa Island. Several hours after landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center took over primary responsibility of the storm. Later on August 17, the final public advisory was issued on the system as it dissipated over Alabama. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm warnings for the coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas. One fatality resulted from rough seas off the coast of Panama City, Florida. Later that day, another man drowned after falling off his ship near Bay County. An EF0 tornado spawned by the storm in Cape Coral, Florida damaged 11 homes, leaving $103,000 (2009 USD) in damages. Additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to $125,000 (2009 USD) as a result of Claudette. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Claudette originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 7. On August 11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600 mi (965 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did not anticipate further development of the system. By the afternoon of August 12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong upper-level wind shear created an unfavorable environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea. By August 15, convection began to consolidate around the center of the system as it passed over the Florida Keys. Early on August 16, the system rapidly organized, with a low-level circulation developing roughly 80 mi (130 km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. Favorable environmental conditions led to the NHC anticipating the system to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Several hours later, the first advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Four. Low wind shear provided an environment that promoted quick development of the cyclone and the storm was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 12 hours. The depression tracked northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east. Around 11:00 am EDT, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Claudette in light of information from the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in Tallahassee, Florida that found winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) around the center of circulation. During the afternoon of August 16, a brief increase in wind shear due to a trough over the southeastern United States, caused the center to become exposed. Despite this, Claudette attained its peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) around this time. Around 1:10 am EDT (0510 UTC) on August 17, the storm made landfall near the eastern end of Santa Rosa Island with winds of 45 mph (85 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), the lowest pressure recorded in association with the storm. Several hours after landfall, convection associated with the storm quickly decreased and by 8:00 am EDT, the NHC issued their final advisory on Claudette as it weakened to a tropical depression. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) began issuing advisories on the system. The HPC issued their final advisory late on August 17 as the remnants of Claudette began to dissipate over Alabama. The remnants persisted for several more hours before becoming indistinguishable over Mississippi, on August 18. Preparations Upon being classified a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for areas between the Alabama-Florida border and the mouth of the Suwannee River. Residents in these areas were urged to quickly prepare for the storm by ensuring their hurricane kit was fully stocked and ready. East of the center of Claudette, along western Florida, residents were warned about possible heavy rainfall that could cause flooding. Storm surge near where the storm was forecast to make landfall was expected to reach . Residents in areas of Wakulla County prone to storm surge were urged to evacuate before the arrival of the storm by the Wakulla County Emergency Management Office. Shortly after 3:00 pm EDT, the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama issued a tropical storm wind warning for areas between Destin, Florida and Pascagoula, Mississippi. A flood watch was also issued for most of the Florida Panhandle, as rainfall from Claudette was anticipated to exceed . An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for most of southeastern Alabama. During the afternoon of August 16, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents in St. Joseph Peninsula State Park and Stone State Park on Cape San Blas in Gulf County, Florida. Two shelters were opened in Bay County, one at the Dean Bozeman High School and the other at Bozeman Learning Center. Voluntary evacuation orders were also given to residents living in low-lying areas along the coastline. Although no plans were put in place to open shelters, the Emergency Operations Center in Washington County raised their activation level to stage two. In Franklin County, the Emergency Operations Center was placed at stage three and voluntary evacuation orders were issued for Alligator Point. After an afternoon briefing, officials in Walton County declared a State of Emergency based on available information on the storm. In Wakulla County, the American Red Cross opened a shelter in Crawfordville at a local church. Impact Florida Storm total rainfall for Claudette By the evening of August 16, upwards of of rain had fallen in parts of Franklin County. In Apalachicola, a daily record of of rain fell on August 16, surpassing the previous record set in 1931. However, with an exception of a tree falling across U.S. Route 98, no damage was caused to Apalachicola. By the dissipation of the storm, a maximum of of rain fell in Big Coppitt Key. A tornado was reported near Cape Coral and multiple tornado warnings were issued for Florida in association with rain bands from the storm. Twenty-three homes were damaged by the tornado in Cape Coral. Damages to 11 out of 23 of the homes from the tornado amounted to roughly $103,000. Florida Governor Charlie Crist briefly toured the damage from the tornado. The tornado was later rated EF0 with winds between 70 and 80 mph (110 and 120 km/h). The National Weather Service also stated that the tornado was on the ground for between 4:42 pm and 4:45 pm EDT. Tropical Depression Claudette weakening over Alabama on August 17 One drowning was reported off Panama City, Florida. By the early evening, officials closed down a segment of Highway 20 due to a fallen tree and power line. In Leon County, a total of 440 residences lost power. By 9:40 pm EDT, the highway was reopened and power to all 440 homes was restored. Other power outages were reported near Parker and in downtown Panama City. Roughly 500 residences were left without power in Walton County. In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 residents lost power during the storm. Most of the residents had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 homes at a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after a man was knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed to reach him but during the rescue, he fell off the life raft and was lost. The search was later called off as he was presumed dead. Along the coastline, waves produced by Claudette resulted in the loss of of sand in coastal areas of Bay, Walton, Franklin and Gulf counties. An estimated $100,000 worth of sand was lost in all four counties. A maximum storm surge of was recorded in Destin as the storm made landfall. In all, two people were killed throughout the state and damages amounted to $350,000. Elsewhere Upon making landfall, flash flood watches were issued for parts of southern Alabama due to the threat of heavy rainfall. In the state, Claudette produced widespread moderate rainfall, peaking at in Bradley. Some areas received up to in a two-hour span, prompting the National Weather Service to issue flash flood warnings. Flash flood watches were also issued for Hale, Sumter and Perry counties. The remnants of Claudette created a very moist atmosphere in parts of Alabama, resulting in several days of afternoon thunderstorms. Some of these thunderstorms produced gusty winds, recorded up to 45 mph (75 km/h) in Jefferson County. In Rainbow City, lightning struck an apartment building, sparking a fire and leading to the evacuation of two units of the building. Damage from the fire was estimated at $20,000. In Georgia, outer bands of the storm also a maximum of at Fort Benning.

It became well known for its song \\"The Flies Crawled Up the Window\\", sung by Hulbert, which was released as a record and proved a major hit. The film was released in the U.S. as Night and Day. Plot Policeman Jack (Jack Hulbert) attempts to track down a gang responsible for a smash and grab raid, thereby proving his worth to his disapproving father (Peter Gawthorne), a Scotland Yard detective.

British Pictures wrote, \\"As entertainment, it's curious. Hulbert and Courtneidge clown about nicely but it's hard to see how this film was one of the biggest hits of its year (big enough to be the punchline of a comic song in the following year's The Good Companions). Opportunities for them to \\"do their stuff\\" are poked into the narrative in the oddest places. They search a thief's flat and spontaneously break into a silly dance. It would be charming if it wasn't so bloody irritating. Perhaps the most interesting bits of the film now are the sequences filmed on location both on the streets of London and in Madame Tussauds (though you have to doubt the effectiveness of any film chase sequence in which you get more interested in the passing billboards than the action). All in all, it's a film which has dated badly and which doesn't show off the stars to their best advantage\\"; while TV Guide wrote that though the \\"Dialog drags a bit, as though it's being read for the stage. Hulbert saves his performance with a lot of likable charm\\"; and AllMovie called it a \\"breezy quota quickie\\", concluding that \\"Matching Jack Hulbert laugh for laugh is his wife and longtime stage partner Cicely Courteneidge\\"; and Screenonline noted that \\"Jack's the Boy is acknowledged as one of the team's best films.\\" References External links  Category:1932 films Category:1932 comedy films Category:British films Category:British comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Gainsborough Pictures films Category:Films produced by Michael Balcon Category:Films directed by Walter Forde Category:Films scored by Jack Beaver Category:Police comedy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:1930s police films ","title":"Jack's the Boy"},{"id":"24005585","text":"Liu Zhenya Liu Zhenya (; born 1952) is Chairman of Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) which proposes to build a global super grid of low-loss HVDC power lines for long distance energy exchange and trade.

Released on June 11, 2009, it was directed by Lee Yeon-woo and starred Kim Yoon-seok and Jung Kyung-ho.  Plot  Jo Pil-seong is an idle detective who spends his time scratching off lottery tickets in his office, while his wife and children work in a manwha shop. Pil-seong secretly takes his wife's emergency money of and tells his friend to bet it on a bull name Gomi in a bullfight. Gomi is declared as a winner, and Pil-seong's friends celebrate their victory later that night as they wait for him to arrive. Meanwhile, an escaped prisoner named Song Gi-tae intervenes in the celebration and steals Pil-seong's money. When Pil-seong finds out what has happened he confronts the criminal, but suffers a humiliating defeat. Pil-seong reports to his colleagues and his boss that he encountered the infamous Gi-tae, but none of them believed in him. In an attempt to recapture Gi-tae, Pil-seong decides to recruit his friends (who were beaten up by Gi-tae earlier) and found him inside a house with his girlfriend, Kyeong-joo. Formulating a plan, Pil-seong tells his friends to stand by the outside window of where Gi-tae was, while Pil-seong himself sneaks into the house, armed with pepper spray. Gi-tae, however, was aware of Pil-seong's presence and once escaped before the police arrived. Before leaving, Gi-tae takes out his knife, stabs Pil-seong's right hand, and warns him that the next time he'll kill him if he tries to capture him again. Suffering from public humiliation as well as being kicked out of the house by his wife (because of her money), Pil-seong decides to train himself in fighting Gi-tae. When taking taekwondo lessons one day, Pil-seong learns that the upper part of the human rib cage is the vulnerable area of taking his opponents down. He later buys himself his own handgun as his own personal defense weapon. In the next encounter of Gi-tae, Pil-seong got him surrounded by keeping Kyeong-joo hostage. As he forced Gi-tae to keep moving on, Pil- seong's friends intervened, causing Gi-tae to escape once again. Pil-seong's friends begged him to give up capturing Gi-tae for his own sake, but he refuses. Meanwhile, one of Gi-tae's accomplice, Pyo Jae-seok, was arrested by Pil-seong. He confiscates Jae-seok's handphone and orders him to bring back the money that Gi-tae stole from him. Learning that Gi-tae was hiding somewhere in a fishing village, Pil-seong uses a bullhorn and asks Gi-tae to reveal himself. Realizing that Pil-seong has the money and Jaeseok's cell phone, Gi-tae calls him and tells him that he is next to the manwha shop where his family works. Holding a gasoline tank, he gives Pil-seong one hour to meet him and bring the money, or else he'll destroy the manwha shop with his family inside. Pil-seong did as he was told but also asked his colleagues and policemen to arrive in his family's manwha shop. Pil-seong arrived in a small fenced area and buried the money, before Gi-tae came. Wanting to capture Gi- tae, he non-fatally shoots him in the stomach with his handgun. He discards his handgun and takes Gi-tae's knife and asks for a fair fight. The battle then ensures as both Pil-seong and Gi-tae beat each other up to the pulp. Finally cornering Pil-seong, Gi-tae asks him for the money and threatens to kill him if he doesn't. Gi-tae finds the money and walks off. However, Pil- seong regained consciousness and eventually defeats his opponent by accurately striking him in the upper rib cage. Pil-seong is barely conscious from the fight, but is satisfied on his efforts of capturing Gi-tae. Pil-seong's colleagues later finds him in the cell sleeping with Gi-tae handcuffed. Few days later, Pil-seong and his colleagues was awarded for a higher position as officers and led a ceremonial parade to Pil-seong's daughter's school. The film ends as Pil-seong and the fellow officers gave a salute.  Cast  * Kim Yoon-seok ... Jo Pil-seong * Jung Kyung-ho ... Song Gi-tae * Kyeon Mi-ri ... Detective Jo's wife * Sunwoo Sun ...

In the early records he is often referred to as Albert Noorman ('Norwegian'). Biography Albert Andriessen Bradt (spelled \\"Bratt\\" during his lifetime) was born at Fredrikstad in √òstfold, Norway. He moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands at a time when commerce between Norwegian and Dutch merchants was well established.Karel Hansen Toll (Andreas Nilsen Rygg. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XIV: Page 244) In 1636 he joined a party for New Netherland. In a 1636 agreement between Bradt and Kiliaen van Rensselaer, Bradt is listed as a tobacco planter. In the early records, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Albert the Noorman\\".Evjen, John Oluf. Scandinavian Immigrants in New York, 1630-1674, K. C. Holter, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1916 On October 8, 1636, the twenty-nine year old Bradt, his wife Annetje, and their two children, Barent and Eva, sailed aboard the Wapen Van Rensselaerwyck, arriving in New Amsterdam on March 4, 1637, after a difficult voyage. During the crossing, on Sunday, November 2, 1636, Annetje gave birth to a son they named \\"Storm\\". They would later have five more children, Engeltje, Gisseltje, Andries, Jan, and Dirck (or Hendrick). Their destination was Rensselaerswyck where Bradt worked at a saw mill and a tobacco plantation. Initially, Andriessen was to operate the mill with his partners, but not long after his arrival he took the liberty of dissolving the partnership and established himself as a tobacco planter. After about a year, he and his brother, Arent, began growing tobacco for the patroon and participating in the fur trade. Bradt later operated two large sawmills on a location that later was known as Lower Hollow from the patroon, Van Rensselaer,Albany County Timeline (Albany County, New York) on a stream winding across south-central Albany County, New York. It empties into the Hudson River after flowing around the west side of Castle Island,Colonial Albany Social History Project (Stefan Bielinski, Project Director) and came to be called Normans Kill named after Albert. Normans Kill is the first tributary of the Hudson River south of the city of Albany. He was also a woodcutter, sawyer and fur trader which brought him commercial success. He was one of the elders of the Albany Lutheran Church. Marriage Albert married Annatje Barents Van Rolmers/Rottmer (1608-1661) on April 11, 1632 in Oude Kerke, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The bans were made on March 27 of that year. Annatje had German parents, but according to some genealogies was born in Oudenbrath (erroneously thought be in Norway), or Oudenbroeck (currently Altenbruch), Germany. After Anna's death, Albert sold the New Amsterdam property and lived at Norman's Kill. He created a document dated 3 June 1662 whereby he paid all of his children for their shares in all of their mother's estate: Eva (Roeloff) Swartwout, Barent Albertsen, Storm Albertsen, Engeltje (Teunis) Slingerlandt, Gisseltje (Jan) Van Echelen, Andreis Albertsen (minor), Jan Albertsen (minor), and Dirck Albertsen (minor). He then married Pieterje Jans, the widow of his former sawmill partner. After her death in 1667, his third wife was Geertruy Coeymans Vosburgh who was also a widow. This third marriage was unhappy. She filed a court petition for separation and alimony on 13 January 1669, and after a long court battle, they were legally separated \\"because of strife and differences that hath arisen between them\\" on 24 October 1670; she received annual alimony of 80 schepels in apples and beavers. In 1672, Albert Andriesen Bradt turned the saw mills over to son Barent Albertsen Bradt. In his old age, Albert Andriesen Bradt's behavior became even worse and his children were ordered to deal with him. Albert Andriesen Bradt lived his last few years with unmarried son Dirck Albertsen Bradt in Albany, NY. Children In October 1647, Bradt's eldest daughter Eva married her first husband, Anthony De Hooges (1620-1655), colonial secretary and superintendent of Rensselaerwyck. After the death of her first husband, she married Roeloff Swartwout, the founder of Kingston, New York and Hurley, New York.Anthony De Hooges and Eva Albertsz Bradt (boydhouse.com) Retrieved March 1, 2016 Albert's son, Barent, married Susanna Dirkse Mayer in Albany. They had 8 children together, but the marriage suffered from Barent's intemperate behavior which led to several court appearances on battery and assault charges. Barent derived his income from sawing, probably at his father's saw mill. He also found success in real estate as he acquired several parcels and built several houses in Albany. He severed on juries and as firemaster and roadmaster. He also acquired lots at Halfmoon and Schaghticoke. Albert's third child, Storm Albertse Van Der Zee (of the Sea) was born while en route to the New World. He married Hilletje Lansing about 1666. Growing up on the Normans kill, by the mid-1650s he was trading lumber, furs, and tobacco in New Amsterdam ‚Äì probably on his father's behalf. In 1662, he obtained a lot and then a house in Beverwyck. Thereafter, he settled in Albany ‚Äì forming a number of trading partnerships, opening a tavern, and then married Hilletie. He died at the age of 42 after an illness. Albert's fourth child, Engeltje Bradt, married Teunis Cornelisse Slingerland and had 8 children. Teunis and Engeltje purchased 9874 acres of land from the Indians, this land lies east of the Helderberg Mountains and in the present towns of New Scotland and Bethlehem. This land also includes the villages of Slingerlands on the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. Teunis was appointed commissary by Governor Thomas Dongan in the 1680s. Albert's fifth child, Geseltje Bradt, married twice. First to Jan van Eschelen who died in 1668 in Albany and second to Hendrick Willemsen. Albert's sixth child, Andries Albertse Bradt, married twice. First to Neeltje () and second to Conrelia Teunisse van Wie (Veryvay). Albert's seventh child, Jan Albertse Bradt, married Maria Post who was baptized in 1649 in Recife, Brazil. Maria's parents Adriaen Crijnen Post and Claretje Moockers were from the Hague, Netherlands and lived for a while in the West India Company's colony in Recife, Brazil. The family sailed for the colony of New Netherland on 30 June 1650. Captain Post led a group in settling the successful colony on Staten Island as he had cultivated friendly relations with the Indians there. The colony was attacked and burned by Hackensack Indians on 15 Sep 1655 as a result of the Peach Tree War. Among the sixty- seven prisoners were Adriaen, Claartje, their five children (Adrian, Maria, Lysbeth, and two unknown children), and two servants of the Post family. Chief Penneckeck sent Adriaen to bargain with Peter Stuyvesant for the prisoners' release that October. Adriaen traveled to and from Manhattan and the Natives' base at Paulus Hook, New Jersey several times before a negotiation was made. Many of the prisoners, including Claartje and the children, were exchanged for ammunition, wampum, and blankets. By van der Capellen's orders, Adriaen and the other survivors returned to Staten Island to build a fort. He gathered the cattle that had survived the attack, butchering some and using others for milk, in an effort to feed his group. By the next spring, Adriaen was too ill to perform his duties. Claartje asked that someone else be appointed agent to van der Capellen and, in April, she petitioned Stuyvesant to keep soldiers on the island. Stuyvesant decided against it since there were so few people there. When Van der Capellen heard of the great havoc made by the Indians in his colony, he instructed Captain Post to gather together the survivors and to erect a fort on the Island and also to keep the people provisioned. This, however, was impracticable, as the Captain with his starving family during the ensuing winter were obliged tocamp out under the bleak sky without any protection or means of defense. The authorities recognized the insurmountable difficulties in the way of protecting the colony, and decided to withdraw the soldiers and abandon him to his fate unless he would remove with his people and his patron's cattle to Long Island. (N.Y. Col. Doc.,XIII, 60-1.) The creditors of Van der Capelle, seeing the desperate condition of the colony, he began to harass Post for the payment of the Baron's debts, and suit was brought by Jacob Schellinger and others against him as agent for the Baron for payment of a note; and Janneke Melyn claimed as hers some of the few cattle still in Post's possession. The attempt at colonizing Staten Island by individual enterprise having failed, the Island was purchased by the West India Company, to whom nineteen persons presented a petition, August 22, 1661, for tracts of land on the south side, in order to establish a village, which was allowed by the Company, Captain Post being one of the grantees. (N.Y. Col. Docs.,XIII., 206) It is probable, however, that he did not avail himself of the grant, but removed to Bergen (now Jersey City, N.J.) about this time, if, indeed, he was not already a resident there. In 1662, he was one of petitioners to have a clergyman settled at Bergen, and promised to contribute twenty florins therefore yearly. (N.Y. Col Docs MSS XIII, 233.) The family later moved to what is now Bergen, New Jersey, becoming some of the first settlers of the Acquackononk Tract. Adriaen remained active in public life. As an ensign in the Bergen Burgher Guard, he took an oath of allegiance on 22 November 1665. Philip Carteret, the governor of New Jersey, requested Adriaen as an interpreter in a meeting to purchase land from the sachem, Oraton, in May 1666. Adriaen also served on jury at the Admiralty Court at Elizabethtown in May 1671, was elected as a representative of Bergen to the New Jersey General Assembly on 7 June 1673, and became a Lieutenant in Bergen's militia in 1675. Adriaen was buried 18 February 1677 in Bergen, Hudson, New Jersey. Albert Andriessen Bratt's final child, Dirck Albertse Bradt, was born during the 1640s. He grew up on his father's farm and mill. He seems to not have married but was identified as a householder in Albany in 1679 and participated in real estate and other transactions with his father and other family members. In 1681, he joined with other Albany burghers in petitioning the court regarding the Indian trade. In 1684, his Albany taxes were in arrears. By the early 1680s, Dirck Albertse's aging and irascible father came to live in his Albany home. Dirck Albertse occasionally appeared before the Albany court. But, following the death of his father in 1686, his life in the community's record is best described as marginal. Dirck Albertse Bradt died sometime after 1702 when he was elected constable for Canastigione.

Scotland Yard detectives hunt for a dangerous criminal who has recently returned to England. The film was based on an Edgar Wallace story The Gaunt Stranger, which is the basis for his play The Ringer. Forde remade the same story in 1938 as The Gaunt Stranger. There was also a silent film of The Ringer in 1928, and a 1952 version starring Donald Wolfit. It was made at Beaconsfield Studios.Wood p.73 Cast * Patric Curwen as Dr. Lomond * Esmond Knight as John Lenley * John Longden as Inspector Wembury * Carol Goodner as Cora Ann Milton * Gordon Harker as Samuel Hackett * Franklin Dyall as Maurice Meister * Dorothy Bartlam as Mary Lenley * Henry Hallett as Inspector Bliss * Arthur Stratton as Sgt.

This film, which hails from England, is the sort of melodrama that provides more amusement than excitement\\"; while in The BFI Companion to Crime, Phil Hardy wrote, \\"this is the best version of this oft-filmed play...Directed by Forde with a slickness and pace unusual in British films of the period, especially considering the film's stage origins...Hokum, but enjoyable.\\" References Bibliography *Wood, Linda.

He is best known for his solo Public Domain and Million Dollar Baby series of mixtapes, and introducing the term \\"wavy\\" as a slang in popular lexicon. He made his mixtape debut in 2006, and signed a recording deal with fellow Harlem-based rapper Jim Jones' label/group ByrdGang. Following a streak of financial and ethical grievances, Max B parted ways with Jones in 2008. The two became embroiled in a bitter feud which pitted Jones and his associates on one side, and Max B and his affiliates on the other. Max B is closely associated with producer Dame Grease, and fellow rapper French Montana where the two collaborated on the Coke Wave mixtape series. In mid 2009, he was sentenced to 75 years in prison on conspiracy charges pertaining to armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated assault and felony murder. While in prison, he secured a deal with Amalgam Digital to publish his debut album Vigilante Season which was released in 2011. On September 16, 2016, it was announced that Max B took a 20-year plea bargain for aggravated manslaughter and was set to be released on July 1, 2029. In July 2019, Max B had his sentence reduced from 20 years to 12 years. He is scheduled to be released sometime in 2021. Early life Max B was born Charly Wingate on May 21, 1975https://www.instagram.com/p/BjBy1nmgOwR/ and raised in New York City. His mother, Sharon Wingate, the eldest of eight siblings, had battled with substance abuse for most of her life and eventually served a year and a half in prison for her crack addiction. Charly was largely raised by his grandparents. According to his mother, his grandmother taught Charly her strong religious values from a young age. As a child, he was friends with future rapper and Dipset founder Cam'ron. He grew up with music in the household, and had sung in the Boys Choir of Harlem. Despite his grandmother‚Äôs best efforts, Charly was heavily influenced by the streets, and at the age of 18, began serving a sentence for robbery in 1997. Wingate went on to serve 8 years in prison, before being released in 2005. Following his release, he immediately began pursuing a career in music, choosing the stage name Max B. The \\"B\\" being shorthand for Biggaveli, a portmanteau referencing The Notorious B.I.G. (\\"Biggie Smalls\\"), Jay Z (\\"Jigga\\") and Tupac Shakur (\\"Makaveli\\"). According to Wingate, his love for rap music came from his deceased brother, Eric, who left him collections of cassettes while he went in and out of town. Music career Max B entered the industry spotlight through his affiliation with The Diplomats, in particular Cam'ron who was a childhood friend of his. Cam'ron introduced Max to Jim Jones, who would then go on to found ByrdGang in 2006 with Max B as a starring member, with Stack Bundles, Mel Matrix and Lady Jha Jha. By 2008, Max B had left ByrdGang amid his allegations he had been forced into a contract which offered him inadequate pay and no recognition of his artistic contributions which included writing hooks, verses and melodies for Jim Jones during their stint. He alleges he was paid $300 for live shows where Jones earned in the range of $10,000‚Äì15,000. In 2005, Max B appeared as a feature on various records, including \\"G's Up\\" and lead single \\"Baby Girl\\" off of Jones' sophomore album Harlem: Diary of a Summer released in August. He appeared as a feature on \\"You Gotta Love It\\" off of Cam'ron's Killa Season album released in May 2006, and released his debut mixtape Million Dollar Baby the same month. Max B collaborated on the ByrdGang mixtape M.O.B. (Members of ByrdGang) released on July 7, and made several feature appearances on Jones' mixtape The 7 Day Theory released on September 27. Arrest and bail In 2006, Max B became embroiled in legal trouble when he was arrested on September 29 in connection to a botched robbery turned homicide that occurred in Fort Lee, New Jersey, allegedly involving his \\"on-again off-again girlfriend\\" Gina Conway and step-brother Kevin Leerdem. While away, Max B had already recorded several feature appearances on Jim Jones' third album Hustler's P.O.M.E. which was released in November. In addition to writing for Jones on other tracks, most notably its lead single and Jones' highest- charting single to date \\"We Fly High\\" which was released on October 21. Public Domain and Public Domain 2 Max B's second solo mixtape Public Domain: Million Dollar Baby Radio was released on November 2 while the rapper remained behind bars. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Deez My Streets\\" and \\"Dom Perignon\\" among others. Followed by his third mixtape Public Domain 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer released in December of that year. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Blow Me A Dub\\" and \\"De La Soul\\" among others. Both mixtapes were hosted by Connecticut-based veteran DJ Big Mike, whom Max would develop an extensive relationship with throughout his career. After having spent 10 months imprisoned, Max B was released on July 11, 2007 on a reported $2 million in bail. Short of funds, portion of Max's bond was raised by selling his publishing over to his label owned by Jim Jones. It would eventually go on to become one of many grievances and disputes Max would share with his former labelmate and head Jim Jones. Max B's fourth mixtape Public Domain: The Prequel was released later in the month following his release from prison. He appeared as a feature on Styles P's \\"Holiday\\" off of his third album released on December 4. Max B collaborated on the MOB2 (Members of ByrdGang 2) mixtape released on October 20, and had written for Jones' digital album which came out on February 19 the following year. Exactly one month prior to Max's release, on June 11, his friend Stack Bundles had been killed in his neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens. In a 2009 interview before his trial, Max expressed his loss stating, \\"That was fucked up because the nigga Stacks was close to me, I ain't even gonna front. I was in jail at the time, so a nigga was sitting. A nigga learned to cope with that thing pretty well though, R.I.P. to Stacks. Shout out to my nigga, he played me all the joints he had. Man, that was my nigga.\\" Leaving ByrdGang By 2008, Max B had left ByrdGang and publicly distanced himself from the \\"Dipset\\" movement. He had begun concentrating on his own rap collective named Gain Greene which included members Al Pac, Mak Mustard and Scarlett O'Harlem. He began associating with South Bronx rapper French Montana, then best known as the founder/host of the \\"street DVD\\" series Cocaine City, and who shared a similarly bitter history with Jim Jones. The two collaborated on their first song together \\"Waavvyy\\" off of French's sophomore tape Live From Africa released on April 29. Max also developed a close relationship with Boston rappers Mall G and T.P., Connecticut rapper Hollywood Fergie, and G-Unit's Tony Yayo. Million Dollar Baby 2 and Public Domain 3 On March 1, Max B released his first solo project since his departure from ByrdGang, his fifth mixtape Million Dollar Baby 2. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Why You Do That\\" and \\"Sexy Love\\" among others. Hosted by New York-based Mexican- Belgian female DJ Lazy K, the two then released his sixth mixtape Million Dollar Baby 2.5 on June 7. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Won't Go Far\\" and \\"She Touched It In Miami\\". Max B released his seventh mixtape Public Domain 3 on June 10, hosted by veteran DJ Whoo Kid. The record became a significant mark of Max's independence, including scathing references towards his former partner turned rival Jim Jones. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Picture Me Rolling\\", \\"Lip Sing\\", \\"Ready To Ride\\", and \\"Paperwork\\" featuring Al Pac. Wavie Crockett and Domain Diego On July 21, Max B released his eighth mixtape Wavie Crockett. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Gotta Have It\\" and \\"Takin' Pictures\\" among others. With the popularity of his mixtapes, he had embarked on his first tour to the West Coast earlier in the year. The fourth installation in his flagship \\"Public Domain\\" series, Domain Diego was released on July 28, with a significant portion of the record having been recorded in San Diego, California during his trip. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Try Me\\" and \\"I'm So High\\" among others. On October 1, he released his tenth mixtape Goon Music 1.5: The Doomship. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Free Al Pac\\", \\"I Wasn't There\\" and \\"Cops Come Runnin\\". Feud with Jim Jones Following his departure from ByrdGang, Max B engaged in a bitter feud with Jim Jones alongside fellow rapper French Montana. According to interviews, French and Max shared a common group of friends and associates. However, due to French's existing problems with Jim Jones, and Max being signed to his ByrdGang at the time, the two had yet to collaborate. This would soon change as the two became embroiled in one of the more infamous street beefs in New York hip hop. Background According to Max B, his beef with Jones stems from his allegations he was forced into a contract which offered him inadequate pay and no recognition of his contributions which included writing hooks, verses and melodies for Jim Jones during their stint together. He also alleges he was paid $300 for live shows where Jones earned in the range of $10‚Äì15,000. In his infamous interview on The Come Up Vol. 18 (2008), he confirmed having delivered \\"10 albums\\" worth of material to Jones to fulfill the terms of his contract. In the case of French Montana, his beef with Jim Jones had begun earlier. Albeit also attributed to Jones' disdain towards French for the infamous footage in Cocaine City Vol. 4 (2006), depicting Jones and his Dipset crew being beaten and driven-out during a brawl in Rucker Park, by the Brooklyn-based Junior MAFIA associated with the late Notorious BIG. According to French, his personal problems with Jones stems from his claims that Jones was publicly insinuating having a hand with the people responsible for a shooting targeting French. In a 2009 interview with VladTV, French claimed that Jones ‚Äì by then well known for his numerous feuds and provocations ‚Äì was using the late-2003 incident to increase his reputation in the streets. Feud By the time Max B left ByrdGang in 2008, Jim Jones had garnered a streak of feuds with rappers, ranging from Junior MAFIA to would-be Jay-Z affiliate Tru Life. Tru Life had already appeared in various interviews, including one on Cocaine City Vol. 8 (2007) showing off two Dipset chains he claimed to have snatched off of Jones. Max B's affiliation with French and their mutual beef with Jim Jones was a very public one ‚Äì resulting in numerous back-and-forth \\"diss\\" videos, interviews, confrontations and accusations ‚Äì which appeared on street DVDs such as Cocaine City, Smack, Come Up, Sub-0, as well as websites such as HipHopBeef.com and WorldStarHipHop.com which were just beginning to gain a foothold. The feud also involved Jim Jones affiliate Hell Rell, and at differing points of time various rappers from Dipset or ByrdGang close to Jones. On February 5, 2009, Max B and French Montana would go on to release their debut collaborative mixtape Coke Wave, and which included productions from Dame Grease, Young Los and J. Cardim. The run up to which was marred by tension and confrontation between the feuding sides. Notable bits from the series of back-and-forth videos include, French and Max B mocking Hell Rell's standing in relation to Jones, and Rell firing back; Max B's allegations of infidelity by Jones' wife Chrissy; Max B recalling an off-camera altercation with Jones in the street in late 2008; footage of French and Max's crew confronting Jones at his Manhattan studio followed by a standoff with police in November (Cocaine City Vol. 12); and an attempted reprisal against Max B by ByrdGang leading to a brawl at a club in Brooklyn in January 2009. Allegations of blackballing Together with his producers Dame Grease and Young Los, newfound partner French Montana, and mixtape DJ's Big Mike and Lazy K, Max B had garnered a sizeable underground movement that pushed his music online and throughout the North Eastern region. Particularly noteworthy since, throughout their stint Max B and French would allege being \\"blackballed\\" by radio and media. In a September 25, 2008 video on WSHH, they would go on to accuse Jim Jones for using his influence to further dissuade labels and websites from covering the rappers. As a response to being blackballed, the two would rely on grassroots and online methods of promotion. French Montana ‚Äì who had a background in Cocaine City ‚Äì and Max B, would utilize outlets such as street DVDs and hip hop websites to promote themselves and their respective projects. Since the early-2000s, street DVDs had emerged as a lucrative underground medium providing a \\"behind the scenes\\" look into the business and politics of major and upcoming rappers. By the late 2000s, websites such as WSHH and others would take on the same spot; consequently, marking the decline of street DVDs as an outdated and non-lucrative format. Another tactic was to release a flood of music/mixtapes. In 2008 alone, Max B had released over half a dozen mixtapes. The Coke Wave mixtape, and its sequel Coke Wave 2, were accompanied by DVD films which included music videos, in-studio footage, skits, and videos revolving around their beef with background commentary. Coke Wave 2, in addition to the Take A Look Into My Life DVD, which were released subsequent to Max B's sentencing, further included footage related to his trial and commentary on his legal situation. French would touch on the subject of having been blackballed in a number of interviews following his mainstream breakout. In a 2012 interview from prison, Max B touched on the subject noting, > I was completely blackballed, my songs on the radio. I couldn‚Äôt help myself > but I was always able to help French do what he wanted to do [...] if I had > to blow trial, at least I know a n**ga out there holding it down [...] I‚Äôm > talking to French; we communicate a couple times a week [...] he real wavy > right now. Amalgam Digital and Vigilante Season In June 2008, Max B had signed a three-album deal with independent record label Amalgam Digital. Soon after, however, they would be prevented by Jim Jones' legal team from making any commercial releases of Max's music. This would continue until May 2010, a year after Max B was sentenced, where in a lawsuit victory a New York City judge ruled that Jones no longer had rights over the now-incarcerated rapper's music. Thereby allowing Amalgam to release his debut album Vigilante Season. The project which was recorded in 2008, and originally intended to be released sometime after Public Domain 3, was finally released on March 22, 2011. Notable songs from Vigilante Season include \\"Money Make Me Feel Better\\", \\"Where Do I Go\\" and \\"Lord Is Tryna Tell Ya Something\\" among others.  Final year releases   Quarantine and Public Domain 6 The first half of 2009, would be Max B's last as a free man. Following the release of his eleventh mixtape Coke Wave on February 5, he released his twelfth mixtape Quarantine on February 21 later that month. The fifth installation in his flagship \\"Public Domain\\" series, notable tracks off Quarantine include \\"I Ain't Tryna\\", \\"All My Life\\", \\"Don't Love Hoes\\", and \\"DJ Saved My Life\\" featuring Mak Mustard. On June 4, Max B was sentenced to 75 years in prison, found guilty on 9 of 11 counts in the case involving himself, Gina Conway and Kevin Leerdam. Based on the testimony of Conway, he is accused of conspiring the event, and will be eligible for parole in 2042. Conway was sentenced to 18 years, and Leerdam was sentenced to life in prison. Following his verdict, his fourteenth mixtape Million Dollar Baby 3 was released on June 30. His fifteenth mixtape and sixth installment in his \\"Public Domain\\" series, PD6: Walking The Plank, was released on July 12. Notable tracks off the record include \\"Dead Solver\\", \\"Never Wanna Go Back\\", \\"Letter To Stack Bundles\\", and \\"What You Want From Me\\" featuring Beanie Sigel and French Montana. His collaborative mixtape Coke Wave 2 with French was released on November 3, 2009. Post-jail releases Albeit in prison since June 2009, Max B has been featured on various artists' records, utilizing preexisting recordings or through phoned-in verses and messages from prison. A collaborative mixtape titled Dopeman with fellow Gain Greene rapper Mak Mustard was released on April 4, 2010. A collaborative mixtape A Wave Called Yes with Amalgam labelmate Young Riot was released on May 26. The record contained two collaborative tracks featuring Curren$y who had signed to Amalgam in 2009, having had the opportunity to work with Max during his final months before his sentencing. In 2012, Isaiah Toothtaker released a collaborative mixtape called Toothy Wavy which featured phoned-in verses from Max B, and production by The Hood Internet. When Kanye West's album was scheduled to be named Waves, Max B (originator of the wave), expressed approval of the name change. He called in the Breakfast Club and said \\"It's all love. I appreciate it.\\" In 2016, a phone conversation with French Montana was featured on the track \\"Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission\\" from Kanye West's 7th studio album, The Life of Pablo. He dropped a song with French Montana called \\"Hold On\\" in 2019. Felony murder charges According to authorities, Max sent his ex- girlfriend, Gina Conway, and his stepbrother Kelvin Leerdam, in 2006 to rob two men in a Holiday Inn, in Fort Lee, Northern New Jersey. On September 22, 2006, Conway and Leerdam ambushed Allan \\"Jay\\" Plowden in room 408 and restrained him with duct tape, while awaiting Plowden's partner, David Taylor. Also in the room was Gissele Nieven. When Taylor arrived, he was immediately shot, point-blank, execution-style, in the head. He did not have any money on him. The crew fled the scene, Plowden then alerted the hotel front desk of the murder. As police entered the room, Plowden was caught moving $30,000 out of the room. Plowden was later charged with money laundering and identity theft. One week later Conway, Leerdam and coordinator Max B were apprehended and charged. On January 9, 2007 Max B was remanded to Bergen County Jail in New Jersey on a $2 million bail.Phillips, Rashad. (2009-01-16) Bronx Woman Confesses In Alleged Max B.

It is located in behind Mount McKay, in the Fort William First Nation and Neebing Municipality. Loch Lomond is considered to be a deep oligotrophic lake. The natural re-charge level of Loch Lomond from underground spring water is estimated at per day. It is approximately long and averages about in width. The extreme depths over most of its area causes the greater part of Loch Lomond to become stratified each summer and has characteristically low temperatures in the hypolimnion.https://www.flickr.com/photos/41619238@N04/3835634066/ History This body of water bore the Ojibwe name Gaa-zaasaagijiwegamaag (recorded as \\"kazazeekeege waigamag\\") meaning \\"the high lake that is always overflowing\\", but a Scotsman of the North West Company thought it so much looked like the original Loch Lomond that he named it as such. During the year 1906 the city of Fort William began tunnelling through the rock of Mount McKay and laying water pipe, but it was not until 1909 that the first water flowed through the pipes and into the homes of residents of Fort William. The engineering department of the city of Fort William was headed by city engineer H. Sydney Hancock Jr., who was Waterworks engineer from February 1906 to February 1911.http://www.thunderbaymuseum.com/government.htm#G3 He was in charge of the construction of the Loch Lomond Water Supply system. Fort William's water supply was contaminated in 1906 leading to a typhoid epidemic. The City Council's response was to construct a tunnel under the Kaministiquia River to bring pure water to Fort William from Loch Lomond. Tunnels were drilled through Mount McKay to the Loch at a final cost of $500,000. The system was completed in 1910. In 2006, the Bare Point Water Treatment Plant on Thunder Bay was expanded to serve the entire city from a single source. In order to prevent pollution all activities including travel and fishing are prohibited on Loch Lomond.

Plot The film depicts the rivalry between two firms of brewers. Ironsides, a modern company led by the ruthless Edward Ironside and his son John, seeks territorial expansion to crush its rivals and seize control of their business. They are faced by the smaller, more gently run Greenleaf brewery which is about to celebrate its 150th anniversary. Cast * Nova Pilbeam as Margaret Greenleaf * Edmund Gwenn as Edward Ironside * Jimmy O'Dea as Matt Boyle * Moore Marriott as Geordie * Graham Moffatt as Albert Baldwin * C.V. France as Tom Greenleaf * Peter Coke as John Ironside * Alexander Knox as Saunders * Ivor Barnard as Naseby * Walter Forde as Pianist at Wedding * James Knight as Ironside's Chauffeur * Hay Plumb as Greenleaf Employee * Charles Rolfe as Ironside Thug * Harry Terry as Brewery Worker * Jean Webster-Brough as Maggie Production The film was made by Ealing Studios, roughly a year after Michael Balcon had taken over from Basil Dean as head of production. It was released shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, the last Ealing film to be released in peacetime. Reception The film's representation of the differing management styles of the Ironside and Greenleaf companies has traditionally been seen as an analogy for Nazi Germany and the United Kingdom in the lead-up to the outbreak of war.Perry p.42-43 The film has also come to be seen as a precursor of the later \\"Ealing Comedies\\", sharing a similar theme of big versus small, traditional versus modern with the later films which began with Hue and Cry in 1947.

Although not considered to be one of the foremost of the Poets of the Nobility, his work provides a portrait of the gentry society of north-west Wales at the start of the Tudor period. On the basis of his name and a reference to him in a later 16th-century manuscript in the hand of the antiquary Thomas Wiliems, it can confidently be accepted that he was a native of the parish of Aberdaron in Ll≈∑n. His date of birth is not known and our knowledge of him depends almost entirely on the evidence of his poetry, of which 28 poems survive. He was a friend of the Anglesey poet Lewys M√¥n, one of the most important poets of that period. He probably died in the early 1530s and was buried in Nefyn. Lewys Daron sang to patrons in Arfon, Meirionnydd, Eifionydd and Ll≈∑n, an area corresponding to the modern county of Gwynedd in north-west Wales. His poems, in the Welsh traditional metres, include awdlau and cywyddau. His patrons included the Stradlings and the gentry families of Penrhyn, Bodfel, Bodeon, Glynllifon, Carreg, Cochwillan (near Bethesda), Plas Iolyn (near Ysbyty Ifan) and others. He is perhaps best known for his elegy (marwnad) to the renowned poet Tudur Aled (d. 1526), whom he knew. His work includes a cywydd on behalf of three ladies of Anglesey requesting a millstone for the parish church of Nefyn and another cywydd on behalf of Sir John Wynn of Gwydir asking for a stallion from Dafydd, Prior of Beddgelert. He also wrote a praise poem to P√Ærs Conwy, Archdeacon of Llanelwy (St Asaph). Bibliography *A. Cynfael Lake (ed.), Gwaith Lewys Daron (University of Wales Press, 1994).

It was built in between 1808 and 1816 by John Pinch the elder. Numbers 1 to 13 have been designated as Grade I listed buildings. Description Nos. 1 and 2 are a continuation of Park Place, which faces south. No. 3 has a curved front, linking Nos. 1-2 to the rest of the terrace, which continues northwards, facing west. The houses in Park Place are smaller than Nos. 3-13 of Cavendish Place, so Pinch made No. 2 slightly shorter than No. 3 and No. 1 slightly shorter than No. 2, to avoid a sudden change in height between the two terraces. Each building has 4 storeys plus a basement and rises as the terrace climbs up the hill. To give visual continuity along the stepping terrace, the platband and the cornice are ramped up at the end of each house, instead of abruptly breaking and restarting at each step. This technique was used by Pinch at various sloping sites in Bath. Unusually for a Bath terrace, some of the houses have painted exteriors. In other parts of the country, Georgian houses were painted, but Bath stone was usually considered presentable enough without paint. Bombing and reconstruction In 1942 Nos. 6-9 were severely damaged by incendiary bombs. These houses were repaired in 1949.

It is about SW of the front light of the Doubling Point Range Lights, and about east of Doubling Point Light. The pyramidal bell structure was built in 1914, two years after a large steamship, the Ransom B. Fuller, ran aground in the fog on this section of the river. History The signal was rung to assist ships navigating the treacherous S-bend section of the river known as Fiddler Reach. It was a bell from 1914 until the late sixties and then a horn until it was discontinued in 1982. The signal, while not part of the Kennebec River Light Station, was tended by its station keeper. He reached it along a footpath that included a boardwalk and two wooden bridges. While it was a bell, it was rung by means of a clockwork counter weight system that had to be rewound every 4 hours. Bell signals were distinguished by the number of strokes and length of time between them. This signal was two strokes every twenty seconds. (16 pages, with 3 photos) The structure eventually fell into disrepair. The original bell was removed by the Coast Guard in 1972 and is now displayed on the campus of the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. It was restored by volunteer effort of the \\"Range Light Keepers\\", a self-described \\"group of interested local Maine citizens and visitors\\". A replacement bell has been obtained and kept at the Arrowsic Town Hall.Until 2016 when the bell was installed on the tower's exterior bell arm The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 5, 2009 and the listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of August 14, 2009.

Career After growing up in the A.C. Milan youth system, Maiolo was promoted to the senior side under manager Fabio Capello, and later made his professional debut and only appearance for the club in the Coppa Italia the following season, on 23 October 1996, in a 2‚Äì0 away win over Reggiana; however, he did not make a single league appearance for the club during the 1996‚Äì97 season. Due to his inconsistency, behavioural issues, and recurring injury troubles, which also affected his fitness, he never made his Serie A debut. He spent the remainder of his career in the lower Italian divisions, playing for Italian clubs: Pro Sesto (1997‚Äì99; 2000‚Äì01; 2002‚Äì05) in Serie C2, Livorno (1999‚Äì2000) in Serie C1, Campobasso (2001) in Serie C2, Prato (2001‚Äì02) in Serie C2, Legnano, first in Serie C2 (2005‚Äì06), and later in the Amateur divisions (2011‚Äì12), and Como (2006‚Äì07) in Serie D; following the bankruptcy of Italian club Olimpia Ponte Tresa, and their subsequent re-founding in the Amateur divisions of Italian football, he went on to play in the Amateur divisions himself, first with Olimpia Ponte Presa, (2008‚Äì09; 2010‚Äì11), then with Gallaratese (2009), and finally with his former club Legnano (2011‚Äì12). Style of play Initially regarded as a promising forward in his youth, who was capable of playing both as a striker or as creative forward, Maiolo possessed good feet and an eye for goal, and was also an accurate free-kick taker, whose technique was inspired by Roberto Baggio during their time at Milan together; he was also an accurate penalty taker, and was capable of both scoring goals himself, and providing assists for team-mates. Despite his talent, his career was marred by injuries, inconsistency, and behavioural problems, which affected his fitness.

In 1858, the shogunate under tair≈ç Ii Naosuke attempted to end this direct daimy≈ç- Imperial Court collusion with a harsh purge (the \\"Ansei Purge\\") of those who did not support its authority and foreign trade policies.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Ansei no taigoku\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 33. while simultaneously promoting closer ties between the Shogunate and the Imperial Court. This took the form of a proposed political marriage between Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi and the sister of the Emperor, Princess Kazunomiya. Following the murder of Ii Naosuke in 1860 and the attempted assassination of his successor, And≈ç Nobumasa, the idea of k≈çbu gattai faded into the background. It was strongly opposed by proponents of the Sonn≈ç j≈çi movement, who sought to overthrow the shogunate and restore political power to the Emperor, as well as by major daimy≈ç such as Shimazu Hisamitsu of Satsuma Domain and Matsudaira Shungaku of Fukui Domain who sought a compromise proposal whereby the Tokugawa clan would retain some measure of hegemony under a European-style parliamentary system. Despite this opposition, the marriage between Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi and Princess Kazunomiya took place in 1862. Tokugawa Iemochi died in 1866, by which time events had increasingly rendered the k≈çbu gattai concept obsolete. In 1868, the Boshin War and the Meiji restoration rendered k≈çbu gattai irrelevant.

The final development in a lineage that included the Air Force's F-86 Sabre, the FJ-4 shared its general layout and engine with the earlier FJ-3, but featured an entirely new wing design and was a vastly different design in its final embodiment. Design and development Compared to that of the FJ-3, the FJ-4's new wing was much thinner, with a six percent thickness-to-chord ratio, and featured skin panels milled from solid alloy plates. It also had an increased area, and tapered more sharply towards the tips. Slight camber behind the leading edge improved low speed characteristics. The main landing gear design had to be considerably modified to fold wheel and strut within the contours of the new wing. The track of the main wheels was increased and because they were closer to the center of gravity, there was less weight on the nosewheel. Wing folding was limited to the outer wing panels. An FJ-4B with six rocket pods FJ-4F prototype with an additional rocket motor The FJ-4 was intended as an all- weather interceptor, a role that required considerable range on internal fuel. The FJ-4 had 50% more fuel capacity than the FJ-3 and was lightened by omitting armor and reducing ammunition capacity. The new wing was \\"wet\\"; that is, it provided for integral fuel tankage. The fuselage was deepened to add more fuel, and had a distinctive \\"razorback\\" rear deck. A modified cockpit made the pilot more comfortable during the longer missions. The tail surfaces were also extensively modified and had a thinner profile. The overall changes resulted in an aircraft that had little in common with the earlier models, although a family resemblance was still present. The two prototypes had the same Wright J65-W-4 engine as the FJ-3, but production aircraft had the J65-W-16A of thrust.Bowers 1990, pp. 387 The first FJ-4 flew on 28 October 1954 and delivery began in February 1955. Of the original order for 221, the last 71 were modified in the FJ-4B fighter-bomber version. This had a stronger wing with six instead of four underwing stations and stronger landing gear. Additional aerodynamic brakes under the aft fuselage made landing safer by allowing pilots to use higher thrust settings, and were also useful for dive attacks. External load was doubled. The most important characteristic of the FJ-4B, however, was that it was capable of carrying a nuclear weapon on the inboard port station. It was equipped with the LABS or Low-Altitude Bombing System for the delivery of nuclear weapons. The Navy was eager to maintain a nuclear role in its rivalry with the Air Force, and it equipped 10 squadrons with the FJ-4B. It was also flown by three Marine squadrons. In April 1956 the Navy ordered 151 more FJ-4Bs, bringing the production to a total of 152 FJ-4s and 222 FJ-4Bs. The Navy ordered six FJ-4s to be converted to FJ-4F to test rocket engines, but only two were completed. These featured the North American Rocketdyne AR-1 engine, installed in a fairing above the tail pipe of the jet engine. It ran on hydrogen peroxide and JP-4 jet fuel, and provided an additional of thrust for short periods. The FJ-4F reached speeds of Mach 1.41 and altitude of 71,000 ft (21,600 m). Redesignation With the new designation system adopted in 1962, the FJ-4 became the F-1E and the FJ-4B the AF-1E. AF-1Es served with United States Naval Reserve units until the late 1960s.

Casimir's lack of male heir spelled the end of the Piast Dynasty in the Kingdom of Poland.Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wr√≥bel, Richard J. Kozicki, Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , Google Print, p.249-250 After Casimir's death in 1370, she remarried Rupert I of Legnica. Family Hedwig was the third of five children born to Henry V of Iron and his wife Anna, daughter of Duke Wenceslaus of P≈Çock. Her brothers were Henry VI the Older, Henry VII Rumpold, Henry VIII the Sparrow, and her only sister was Anna, wife of Jan I of Racib√≥rz. First marriage Casimir III of Poland had two daughters Elizabeth and Cunigunde by his first wife Aldona of Lithuania. Casimir's second marriage to Adelaide of Hesse was loveless and childless; they spent most their marriage apart from each other. His third wife Christina Rokiczana, his mistress and a widow of a wealthy merchant, also bore no children. Casimir needed a son and he chose Hedwig as it would to strengthen his ties with Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Hedwig married Casimir III of Poland around 1365. However, Casimir was committing bigamy as was still legally married to his second wife (it is unknown whether Christina was still alive at the time). Casimir forged a papal dispensation because he was related to Hedwig by a fourth degree. In 1368 Pope Urban V allowed Casimir to stay with Hedwig since his marriage to Christina was invalid. Adelaide died in 1371. Casimir awaited the birth of a son. If no son was born then Casimir's nephew, Louis I of Hungary. Instead of a son, Hedwig bore three daughters: #Anna (1366 ‚Äì 9 June 1422). Married firstly William of Celje. Their only daughter was Anne of Cilli. Married secondly Ulrich, Duke of Teck. They had no children. #Cunigunde (1367‚Äì1370). #Hedwig (1368 ‚Äì ca. 1407), reportedly married ca. 1382 but the details are obscure. The question of the legitimacy of the three daughters was raised. Casimir had all three of his daughters legitimised. Casimir managed to have Anne and Cunigunde legitimated by Pope Urban V on 5 December 1369. Hedwig the younger was legitimated by Pope Gregory XI on 11 October 1371. On 5 November 1370 Casimir died, leaving Hedwig a widow with three young daughters. Soon afterwards, the middle daughter, Cunigunde died aged three. From Casimir's will, Hedwig received from the treasury of the king's 53 fine silver and 1 / 3 silver vessels in the amount of dowry and 1,000 fineslarge cents. Since Casimir did not have a male heir, his throne passed to his nephew, Louis I of Hungary, though Casimir's sister, Elisabeth of Poland, acted as regent for a period of time when Louis was in Hungary. Second marriage Hedwig did not remarry straight away. She returned to her home in ≈ªaga≈Ñ where she lived at the court of her brother, Henry VI the Older. On 10 February 1372, Hedwig married for a second time to Rupert I of Legnica, son of Wenceslaus I of Legnica and Anna of Cieszyn. The marriage produced two more daughters: #Barbara (ca. 1384 ‚Äì Trebitz, 9 May 1436), married on 6 March 1396 to Rudolph III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg and Elector of Saxony. Through this union, Jadwiga was a direct ancestor of the Kings of Denmark and the House of Gonzaga, rulers of Mantua and Montferrato. #Agnes (before 1385 ‚Äì after 7 July 1411), a nun in Wroclaw. After eighteen years of marriage to Rupert, Hedwig died. She was buried in Silesia.

He began his career in amateur football before joining Burnley in 1974, although he failed to establish himself at the club and was later loaned out to Stockport County during the 1975‚Äì76 season. After being released by Burnley in the summer of 1976, Dixey moved into non-League football and represented a number of clubs including Kettering Town, where he was a losing FA Trophy finalist in 1979, Scarborough and Nuneaton Borough. Career As a youth, Dixey represented his home county of Leicestershire at schoolboy level and played for local club Wigston Fields. In December 1974, while playing as an amateur for Southern Football League side Enderby Town, he was spotted by scouts from Burnley, who invited him to the club for a trial. He subsequently signed professional terms with the Football League First Division outfit after impressing manager Jimmy Adamson during his trial period. Dixey made his senior debut on 1 April 1975, deputising for the unavailable Jim Thomson in the 2‚Äì4 defeat away at Carlisle United. He played twice more during the remainder of the season; a 1‚Äì1 draw with Everton the following week and the 3‚Äì2 win against Tottenham Hotspur on 12 April 1975. The latter proved to be Dixey's final game for Burnley as he was not selected during the 1975‚Äì76 campaign, eventually joining Fourth Division side Stockport County on loan for the rest of the season in February 1976. He made 14 appearances in total for the Edgeley Park club during his loan spell, scoring once, before being released on a free transfer by Burnley in May 1976. Dixey subsequently returned to Southern League football, signing for Kettering Town in August of that year. He spent three seasons with Kettering and in 1979 he was part of the team that reached the Final of the FA Trophy before losing 0‚Äì2 to Stafford Rangers at Wembley Stadium. Dixey transferred to Alliance Premier League (APL) side Scarborough ahead of the 1979‚Äì80 season and while there he came up against his former club Burnley in a 0‚Äì1 defeat in the First Round of the FA Cup on 22 November 1980. In March 1981 Dixey switched clubs again, transferring to Nuneaton Borough, who paid Scarborough a fee of ¬£9,500 for his services. Although the club was relegated from the APL shortly afterwards, he was an integral part of the team that won the Southern League Midland Division in 1981‚Äì82, thereby earning promotion back to the APL after only one season. He later became club captain as the side finished as runners-up in consecutive campaigns in 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85, finishing behind Maidstone United and Wealdstone respectively. On 16 November 1985, Nuneaton faced Burnley in the FA Cup in the only competitive meeting between the two sides to date. However, Dixey again suffered defeat to his former club as Burnley, by then relegated to the Football League Fourth Division, won 3‚Äì2 at Manor Park. After several years with Nuneaton, Dixey transferred to Atherstone United, where he ended his playing career. Dixey now teaches plumbing at Leicester College.

It is located about 12 km north of Kozhikode city on the National Highway 66. It is bounded by the Arabian Sea at the west and Korapuzha River (Elathur River) at the north. The Elathur River is generally considered to be the boundary between the North Malabar and South Malabar in the erstwhile district of Malabar. At the 2001 census, Elathur panchayat has a population of 41,326 with a nearly equal proportion of Hindus and Muslims. The panchayat covers an area of 13.58 km2, but a major portion of the area has been taken up by National Highway 66, the State highway, rivers and the Indian Railways. Elathur is well connected by road and rail. The National Highway NH 66 passes through the panchayat. The Elathur railway station is located on the east side of the National Highway. The Kozhikode Regional Office of Hindustan Petroleum is located close to the railway station. The Arabian Sea lies to the west of Elathur. The Elathur beach stretches from Puthiyanirathe to Korapuzha. Marine mussels are abundant in this part of the sea. Elathur is situated on the northern side of Kozhikode city. City suburbs like Nadakkavu and West Hill, Kozhikode and Puthiyangadi lie on the road to Elathur. The local station of All India Radio is situated at Kunduparamba on this route. At the Pavangad junction, the road diverges east to Atholy and the straight road to north goes to Elathur. The Vengaly road over-bridge has solved the traffic issues of the past and after the over- bridge, Elathur is only five kilometers. Conolly Canal The historic Conolly Canal named after Henry Valentine Conolly, the collector of Malabar during the erstwhile British regime runs through Elathur. It was constructed during his tenure, in 1848, and was used as a major waterway, shipping goods and ferrying passengers in the Kozhikode district till the late 1950s. The canal links Korapuzha to Kallayi River. The whole network together forms Elathur backwaters.

Coke, who had that year been reappointed Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its architecture is significant as an example of the residential work of C.W. Dickey, the most prominent local architect of the period, and its landscaping represents the work of the preeminent landscape architect of the period, Richard Tongg. The house and grounds were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The house is not typical of Dickey's residential work, but displays fine craftsmanship and is well adapted to an indoor-outdoor lifestyle. It is a two- story, double-wall building on an L-shaped plan, with a gabled roof over one wing and a hipped roof over the other. The outside walls are of brick on the ground floor, with clapboard siding on the upper floor, both painted white. The interior floors are of ohia wood and the stairway bannister and dining room chandelier are of wrought iron. Tongg landscaped both the front yard and the back lot, which straddles Nuuanu Stream, during 1935-37\\\\.

This niche business school further offers Marketing, Finance and Econometrics majors or specializations. New papers on Global Finance, Business Policy, Environment Economics and Resource Management and Economics of Services have been included as the syllabus was further revised in 2010 to include various other domains of business. The department offers M Phil and Ph.D. programmes to which admissions are made in accordance with the rules of the University of Delhi. The department introduced, with effect from 1995‚Äì96, an undergraduate Honours Course in Business Economics in selected colleges of the University of Delhi. An updated syllabus was implemented from the academic year 2003. Workshops are organised to strengthen the teaching.  MBA (Business Economics)*  The MBA in Business Economics (erstwhile MBE) is a two-year, full-time course offering a dual major or specialization to students. Students are given a grounding in fundamentals of micro and macro economics and quantitative techniques - business statistics. These are coupled with specializations in the fields of quantitative techniques/finance/marketing/human resources systems and operations/regional and transport economics/ and applied environmental economics. Offerings by the department are industrial economics - teaching students to basics of structure-conduct-performance paradigm; basics of transfer pricing; M&As; etc., Economics of services - study of growing importance of the service sector in modern economies across the world; detailed study of four major global services, Economics of environment and natural resources management - schooling students in contemporary practices such as carbon credits). Since this is a niche business school batch intake is a very selective ~40 students which allows for a well-knit cohort, yet access to the huge infrastructure of the University of Delhi especially its South Campus where the Department is located. The program has tie-ups with various international universities and exchange programs in the past. Notable alumni across organisations in Finance, Marketing, Consulting & Economics. Recent years have however seen a distinctive trend for students to opt for careers in Analytics & Consulting, BFSI & Financial markets, Marketing Strategy & Market research and Economic Research. Assignments require the analysis of data from sources such as the World Bank and IMF, case studies, and presentations.

His career was shaped by two interventions by President Thomas Jefferson. In 1801 Jefferson appointed Mansfield as Professor at the newly founded United States Military Academy at West Point. Again at Jefferson's appointment, Mansfield served as the Surveyor General of the United States from 1803 to 1812, charged with extending the survey of United States land in the Northwest Territory.  Early Life  Mansfield was born in New Haven, Connecticut, son of a sea captain, Stephen Mansfield of New Haven and Hannah Beach of Wallingford, Connecticut.Dexter, Franklin Bowditch, Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale College: May 1745-May 1763, Volume 3 (Holt, 1896), p. 691 He entered Yale in 1773, but his father died suddenly near the end of his freshman year. He fell into \\"bad company\\" and was expelled from College in January of his senior year for complicity in a theft of books from the Library and \\"other discreditable escapades\\".Dexter, p. 691 Little is known of his life in New Haven for the next nine years, but he is said to have fought the British in the invasion of New Haven of July 5, 1779, and been taken prisoner but quickly released.Dexter, p. 691 Apparently reforming, he may have taught in New Haven, perhaps at the Episcopal Trinity Church on the Green schools where he is listed as a \\"clerk of the vestry\\" appointed by Rev. Bela Hubbard from 1786 to 1794,Croswell, Frederick, ‚ÄúA History of Trinity Church, New Haven, Read March 8, 1868‚Äù, Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, Volume I (New Haven Colony Historical Society, 1865) Appendix A, p. 76. and as a vestryman from 1790 to 1794. In 1786, he became the Rector of the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, where he remained save for a brief period teaching in Philadelphia, until 1802.Dexter, p. 692 Forgiven by Yale, in 1787 he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts and enrolled as graduating with his class of 1777. Dexter, p. 682 In 1800 he married Elizabeth Phipps of New Haven, daughter of an American Naval Officer.  Promotion by Jefferson  In 1801 he had printed some scientific papers titled Essays Mathematical and Physical, which were brought to Jefferson's attention by Senator Abraham Baldwin. Jefferson appointed Mansfield captain of engineers, so he might become a professor at West Point. After moving to West Point, Mansfield was appointed Surveyor General in Summer of 1803. Jefferson was dissatisfied with the performance of Rufus Putnam, whose surveys in the Congress Lands of Ohio were poorly executed. Putnam was also a Federalist. In 1801, the position had been offered to Andrew Ellicott by Jefferson, but he refused, because he was upset at slow pay for work he had done for the Federal Government. Mansfield's Essays included sections on determining longitude and latitude, which would be useful in improving precision in surveying. Jefferson made a recess appointment, which was confirmed by the Senate November 15, 1803. He was told to \\"survey Ohio and lands north of the Ohio River\\", with later extensions to Indiana Territory and Illinois Territory. Mansfield's Ludlow Station home, demolished 1891 Mansfield and his family moved to Marietta, Ohio (1803-1805), Ludlow Station (1805-1809) and near Cincinnati (1809-1812). Under Mansfield's direction the survey was continued down the Ohio River, with grids laid out northward from the river, thus dividing the territory into rectangular townships. Mansfield is credited with \\"considerable scientific ability and high standards of workmanship.\\" He laid out baselines and Meridians astronomically, adapting principles of celestial navigation to surveying, which Ellicott and others had used to extend the Mason‚ÄìDixon line decades earlier. Among his deputies were Thomas Worthington, Lewis Cass, and Ethan Allen Brown. Jonathan Williams, Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy sent Mansfield a letter March 20, 1809, \\"...your rank in the Corps doubtless settled, and I wish you were here to take direction of the Academy.\\" The War of 1812 in the West made surveying difficult. Mansfield returned to West Point in 1814 as Professor of Mathematics and Natural and Experimental Philosophy, continuing in this position until his retirement in 1828. He never was to direct the Academy. He and his wife moved back to Cincinnati, and he died February 3, 1830 while visiting New Haven. He arranged for Thomas Jefferson to sit at Monticello for the painter Thomas Sully, and the resulting full-length portrait now hangs in the USMA Museum. The city of Mansfield, Ohio is named for Jared Mansfield. He was father of author Edward Deering Mansfield.

Forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August 11, Ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August 12 before weakening back to a depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward. On August 14, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075 mi (1,735 km) east of the Leeward Islands. Early on August 15, the storm re-attained tropical storm status, at which time it was named Ana. After reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg), the storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and the unusually fast movement of Ana. In post-storm analysis, it was discovered that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on August 16, before reaching any landmasses. Numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic between August 15 and 17. Several islands took minor precautions for the storm, including St. Croix which evacuated 40 residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm. In the Dominican Republic, officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters. Impact from Ana was minimal, mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall. In Puerto Rico, up to of rain was reported, causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools. Meteorological history On August 9, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave associated with a small area of convective activity between the Cape Verde Islands and the western coast of Africa. The system eventually spawned an area of low pressure as it tracked towards the west. After slowly organising for a few days, the NHC reported early on August 11, that the system had developed into a tropical depression. The system at this time was located about 280 mi (455 km), west of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression developed deep convection around the center of circulation and continued to track generally towards the west in response to a mid-level subtropical ridge to the north. The depression was expected to gradually intensify as it moved over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and into an area of low wind shear; however it was anticipated that dry air would hamper the depressions chances of intensifying further. By August 12, the NHC reported that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after a burst of deep convection over the center. At this point, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, it was determined that the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40 mph (65 km/h) for 12 hours on August 12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August 13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24 hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration. alt=A disorganized mass of thunderstorms over Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The image depicts most of the eastern Caribbean and the surrounding landmasses. On August 14, roughly 24 hours after degenerating into a remnant low, convection began to redevelop over the system. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance plane deployed dropsondes into the system. They found that the system was regenerating and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression when it was located roughly 1,075 mi (1,735 km) east of the Leeward Islands. The depression continued to track westward in response to an upper-level high over the north Atlantic. Early on August 15, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again. By August 16, the forward motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered a region of dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission did not find any evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west- northwest at 26 mph (42 km/h). Early on August 17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low- level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low- level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba destroyed any chance of redevelopment. Preparations and impact alt=Colored map of a tropical storm's projected future track. Black dots, connected by a black line, indicate its estimated position at 12 hour intervals in the beginning and 24 hour towards the end of the track. The path starts in the eastern Caribbean and ends in the central Gulf of Mexico. On August 15, a tropical storm watch was issued for much of the Leeward Islands. Two days later, the watch was expanded to include Puerto Rico and areas in the eastern Dominican Republic between Cabo Enga√±o and Cabo Beata. As Ana weakened and dissipated, the watches were discontinued. alt=Map of rainfall in Puerto Rico. Only the eastern and western edges of the island have rainfall, denoted by areas colored in tan. In San Maarten, cruise agencies redirected ships to avoid the storm and secured vessels docked at port. Several ships were moved to Simpson Bay Lagoon where waves are generally small. In St. Kitts, officials evacuated 40 families in flood-prone areas to shelters ahead of the storm. On August 17, the National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico issued an Urban and Small Stream Flood Advisory for all of the eastern municipalities on the island. Flights in the area were delayed by several hours to avoid the depression. In the Dominican Republic, officials posted flood alerts for 12 provinces as the remnants of Ana were forecast to produce up to of rain in the country. General Luna Paulino of the civil army activated relief agencies ahead of the storm and notified residents of possible mandatory evacuations. Officials inspected the dams threatened by the storm to protect several towns and villages. Emergency officials stated that roughly 35,000 personnel were on standby in case of a disaster. Shelters were also prepped throughout the country; however, these were not opened and the residents who had voluntarily evacuated had returned home by the afternoon of August 17. In nearby Haiti, officials placed the country under yellow alert as the remnants of Ana could produce heavy rainfall over mountainous areas. In St. Thomas, sustained winds reached 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h). In Puerto Rico, rainfall was limited due to the storms' fast motion, triggering minor flooding but little damage. A maximum of of rain fell in R√≠o Grande. The rains caused the R√≠o Fajardo to rise, resulting in the issuance of an alert as officials warned it could overflow its banks. Several streets were temporarily shut down due to flooding, including one tunnel, and three schools had to be evacuated. Throughout the island, roughly 6,000 people were left without power as numerous branches were snapped off trees and knocked down power lines. There were also reports of waterspouts and tornadoes associated with Ana in Puerto Rico. Winds on the island gusted up to 42 mph (67 km/h). The remnants of Ana produced widespread rainfall across Hispaniola; however, there were no reports of damage from the system.

The game follows the protagonist, Johnny Bazookatone, trapped in the year 2050 in Sin Sin Prison by El Diablo, lord of the underworld. His guitar, known as \\"Anita\\" is taken from him, and so Johnny must travel to reclaim it. Reception Reviewing the PlayStation version, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the sharply detailed graphics, the player character's complex moves, and the high level of difficulty. They summarized \\"If you are looking for a great side-scrolling game, Johnny B. is your man!\\" A brief review in GamePro said that the game's graphics and music are the strong points, while the sometimes inaccurate controls is the main weak point. Maximum panned the game, criticizing the poor sprite detection and dull level design. Reviewing the Saturn version, Sam Hickman of Sega Saturn Magazine called Johnny Bazookatone \\"three hundred hours of the most boring platform action ever invented\\", citing blurry sprites, enemies which are persistently annoying rather than challenging, and the game's generally outdated look and feel. Scary Larry of GamePro commented on the game's irritating difficulty, particularly executing the crucial Shooting Float move, but was delighted with the rendered sprites, backgrounds, and music, and concluded, \\"Fans looking for a humorous cross between Earthworm Jim and Donkey Kong Country should check out Johnny.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation opined that while the gameplay mechanics are generic, the level design is clever and the graphics are genuinely next generation. He summarized, \\"While it's tempting to swear-off the side-scrolling action game as a by-gone product of the 16-bit era, there's something devilishly tempting about a game that looks and plays as good as Johnny Bazookatone.\\" Maximum regarded the Saturn version as unfavorably as the PlayStation version, lambasting it for its \\"hideously dated\\" story concept, overly small sprites, last generation graphics, lack of intelligent design to the levels or enemies, and frustrating puzzles. Scary Larry gave the 3DO version overall approval as well. While criticizing the awkward controls and lack of gameplay innovation, he found the game's \\"hip and well drawn\\" graphics, mixture of funk and house music, and overall style were enough to recommend it.

This analysis was independent of the castes, and Brahmins and Dalits were classified in the same \\"racial groups\\". For example, Telugu Brahmins and Chamars were classified as \\"Racial Element A\\". In total, he distinguished seven \\"racial elements\\", from A to G. Hodson used the classical \\"brachycephalic\\" and \\"dolichocephalic\\" terminology in force in racial discourses of the day. This was a typology constructed from the so- called \\"cephalic index\\" (the ratio of the maximum width of the head to its maximum length) and to classify human populations according to this purported scientific measure. Invented by the anatomist Anders Retzius (1796‚Äì1860), the cephalic index classification was disputed by Franz Boas's anthropological works, and Boas's criticisms are widely accepted today. Hodson also typically associates racial categories with supposed stages of economic and linguistic development, implying a hierarchy of racially defined cultures, a view characteristic of scientific racism. Hodson believed that the earliest occupants of India were probably of the \\"Negrito race\\", followed by the \\"proto-Australoids\\". Later, an early stock probably of the Mediterranean race, came to India and mingled with the proto-Australoids. He believed that these people spoke an agglutinative language from which the present Austroasiatic languages are derived. They had a rudimentary knowledge of agriculture, building stone monuments, and primitive navigation. This migration was followed by an immigration of more civilised Mediterraneans from the Persian Gulf (ultimately from eastern Europe). These people had the knowledge of the metals, but not of iron. They were followed by later waves of immigrants who developed the Indus valley civilization. All these immigrants were of the dolichocephalic type, but the Indus valley people had a mixed brachycephalic element coming from the Anatolian plateau, in the form of the Armenoid branch of the Alpine race. These people probably spoke the Dravidian languages. Later, a brachycephalic race speaking perhaps an Indo-European language of the \\"Pisacha or Dardic family\\", migrated to India from the Iranian plateau and the Pamirs. During about 1500 B.C., the Indo-Aryans migrated into Northern India. Publications *Thado Grammar, Eastern Bengal and Assam Secretariat Printing Office, 1905 *The Meitheis D.

Early life Lawrence Scanlan was born in Ballytarsna, near Cashel, County Tipperary, to Patrick and Catherine (n√©e Ryan) Scanlan. He studied at All Hallows College in Dublin, where he was ordained to the priesthood on June 28, 1868. He departed for the United States the following July, later arriving at the Archdiocese of San Francisco in California in November. He then served as a curate at St. Patrick's Church and later at St. Mary's Cathedral. In 1869 he became pastor of Pioche, Nevada. After briefly returning to California to serve in Petaluma, Scanlan volunteered for the mission in the Utah Territory, where he arrived at Salt Lake City in August 1873. There was then only one Catholic church in the territory, serving the nearly 800 members largely scattered among the region's various mining camps. Traveling by horseback, stagecoach, or rail, he developed a fairly regular circuit in which he visited the mining camps at Park City, Bingham Canyon, Mercur, Stockton, Ophir, and Silver Reef at least once a month. Scanlan introduced the Sisters of the Holy Cross from Indiana, and founded St. Mary's Academy and in 1875 Holy Cross Hospital. He opened numerous parishes and schools, and also established All Hallows College, Kearns-St. Ann's Orphanage, and Judge Mercy Hospital. He even celebrated Mass at the Latter-Day-Saints tabernacle in St. George, Utah in 1879. Episcopacy On November 23, 1886, Scanlan was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Utah and Titular Bishop of Lavanden by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on June 29, 1887, from Archbishop Patrick William Riordan, with Bishops Eugene O'Connell and Patrick Manogue serving as co- consecrators, in San Francisco. In 1890 Scanlan purchased an area of land for $35,000 to establish a cathedral and ground was broken there in 1899. When the vicariate was elevated to the rank of a diocese on January 30, 1891, Scanlan was named the first Bishop of Salt Lake. Legacy The greatest achievement during Scanlan's tenure was the Cathedral of the Madeleine. The construction of the cathedral was begun in 1900 and completed in 1909. On August 15, 1909, the cathedral was dedicated by Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore. The total cost of the construction itself was $344,000, a small fortune for the Utah Catholics of that time. Final years Scanlan later died at Holy Cross Hospital, aged 71. He is buried in the cathedral he built.

Submersible mixers are often used in sewage treatment plants to keep solids in suspension in the various process tanks and/or sludge holding tanks. Working principle The submersible mixer is operated by an electric motor, which is coupled to the mixer's propeller, either direct-coupled or via a planetary gear-reducer. The propeller rotates and creates liquid flow in the tank, which in turn keeps the solids in suspension. The submersible mixer is typically installed on a guide rail system, which enables the mixer to be retrieved for periodic inspection and preventive maintenance. Applications Examples of applications where submersible mixers are commonly applied: * Anoxic/anaerobic tanks and oxidation basins (activated sludge) at sewage treatment plants * IFAS, MBBR, and other fixed film biocarrier processes. * Mixing of sewage wet wells * Reception tanks and post-digestion tanks at biogas facilities * Liquid Manure storage tanks at dairy, hog, and poultry farms * Waste processing at slaughterhouses, poultry abattoirs, fish processing plants, etc. References Category:Sewerage ","title":"Submersible mixer"},{"id":"24006526","text":"Arthur Dixon (5 October 1879 ‚Äì 1946) was an English professional association footballer who played as a full back.

In front Magnus Heimannsberg, Albert Grzesinski and Bernhard Wei√ü The funeral of the murdered police officers 1933 Pictures of the suspects-Erich Mielke is in the top row far right The Murders of Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck were a double homicide that took place in Berlin, Germany on 9 August 1931, when police captain Paul Anlauf and officer Franz Lenck were assassinated by the paramilitary wing of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Both Anlauf and Lenck were members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). One of the murderers, Erich Mielke, later became the head of the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany, and was only tried and convicted of the murders in 1993. Planning and execution During the last days of the Weimar Republic, Berlin's contingent of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) had a policy of assassinating a Berlin police officer in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police. On August 2, 1931, KPD Reichstag members Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger received a dressing down from future East German Premier Walter Ulbricht, the KPD's leader in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger's failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht snarled, \\"At home in Saxony we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.\\"John Koehler, The Stasi, page 36. As a result of Ulbricht's words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate Captain Paul Anlauf, the forty-two-year-old commander of the Berlin Police's Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed Schweinebacke, or \\"Pig Cheek\\" by the KPD. According to John Koehler: On the morning of Sunday 9 August 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a final briefing to the hit team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Two young members of the Parteiselbstschutz, Erich Mielke and Erich Ziemer, were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, Max Matern gave a Luger pistol to a fellow lookout and said, \\"Now we're getting serious... We're going to give Schweinebacke something to remember us by.\\"The Stasi, pages 38-39. Kippenberger then asked Mielke and Ziemer, \\"Are you sure that you are ready to shoot Schweinebacke?\\"John Koehler, The Stasi, page 39. Mielke responded that he had seen Captain Anlauf many times during police searches of Party Headquarters. Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire B√ºlowplatz. He further reminded them that Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, whom the KPD had nicknamed \\"Hussar.\\" Kippenberger concluded, \\"When you spot Schweinebacke and Hussar, you take care of them.\\"The Stasi, page 39. Mielke and Ziemer were informed that, after the assassinations were completed, a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions. That evening, Captain Anlauf was lured to B√ºlowplatz by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the Prussian parliament. According to Koehler: > As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and > the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-plebiscite campaign. At one > point in this particular campaign, Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels > even shared a speaker's platform with KPD agitator Walter Ulbricht. Both > parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new > elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact > explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.The > Stasi, pages 39-40. At eight o'clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer spotted Captain Anlauf, Sergeant Willig, and Captain Franz Lenck walking in front of the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of B√ºlowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm- Stra√üe. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream \\"Schweinebacke!\\"The Stasi, page 41. As Captain Anlauf turned towards the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Sergeant Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his Luger and fired a full magazine at the assailants. Captain Franz Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over to Captain Anlauf, who had taken two bullets in the neck. As he died, the Captain gasped, \\"Wiedersehen... Gruss...\\" (\\"So Long... Goodbye...\\"). Meanwhile, Mielke and Ziemer made their escape. Aftermath According to John Koehler: Thousands of Berliners attended the funeral of the police officers. A monument, created by Hans Dammann, was erected to commemorate Anlauf and Lenck at the former B√ºlowplatz, then renamed Horst- Wessel-Platz, in 1934, and was opened with a ceremony on 29 September that year. In the aftermath, Captain Anlauf's oldest daughter was forced to drastically rush her planned wedding in order to keep her sisters out of an orphanage. German policemen lay a wreath on the monument to Captains Anlauf and Lenck during the Day of the German Police, 16 January 1937. Despite the fact that Captains Anlauf and Lenck were members of the SPD, the Nazi salute is given by many of those present. In 1951, Mielke ordered the demolition of the monument. According to Koehler: Koehler also stated: On 19 June 1934, the 15 conspirators were convicted of first degree murder. The three deemed most culpable, Michael Klause, Max Matern, and Friedrich Br√∂de, were sentenced to death. Their co-defendants received sentences ranging from nine months to fifteen years incarceration at hard labor. Klause's sentence was commuted to life in prison based upon his cooperation. Br√∂de hanged himself in his cell. As a result, only Matern was left to be executed by beheading on 22 May 1935. Matern was subsequently glorified as a martyr by KPD and East German propaganda. Erich Ziemer was officially killed in action while serving as an agent in the Servicio de Informaci√≥n Militar, the secret police of the Second Spanish Republic. Neumann and Kippenberger ultimately fled to the Soviet Union after their involvement in the killings was revealed. Ironically, both were arrested, tortured, and executed by the NKVD during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. Ghosts of B√ºlowplatz As the last survivor of the hit squad, Mielke would go on to lead the East German secret police, or Stasi, between 1957 and 1989. In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the first degree murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig.\\"E. German Stasi Chief on Trial; Political Error Seen : Justice: The spectacle seems an embarrassment. The murder charges predate communism's rise,\\" Los Angeles Times', February 11, 1992. The evidence for Mielke's guilt was drawn from the original police files, the 1934 trial transcripts, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke had admitted that \\"the B√ºlowplatz Affair\\" had been his reason for fleeing Germany. All had been found in Mielke's house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the files for purposes of \\"blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.\\"Berlin Journal; Silent Still, the Old Man Who Trafficked in Secrets New York Times, March 11, 1993. Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified about how Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the B√ºlowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965.Koehler (1999), page 1-3. During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber.\\"Ex-Chief of E. German Secret Police Freed : Europe: Court releases Erich Mielke. He served time for 1931 killings--but not for any crime from Communist era.\\" Los Angeles Times, August 02, 1995. When a journalist for Der Spiegel attempted to interview him in Pl√∂tzensee Prison, Mielke responded \\"I want to go back to my bed\\"\\"Besuch im Gef√§ngnis, Der Spiegel, August 31, 1992. (). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution. After twenty months of one and a half hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he \\"will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.\\"\\"Erich Mielke, Powerful Head of Stasi, East Germany's Vast Spy Network, Dies at 92.\\" The New York Times, May 26, 2000. After being paroled due to his advanced age and poor mental health, Mielke died on 21 May 2000, aged 92, in a Berlin nursing home. On 8 June 2000, flowers and wreathes left on his grave were found ripped apart and the grave defaced.\\"Stasi leader's grave defaced\\" The Irish Times, June 8, 2000.

It was founded by Nichij≈´ in 1384. In Japan it has a membership of about 100,000 households and several lay members overseas. The international branch of Kempon Hokke Shu is currently headed by Rev. Sinyou Tsuchiya. Overview Kempon Hokke's head temple, , is located in Kyoto. Kempon Hokke Nichiren‚Äôs religious writings inspired Nichij≈´ to leave the Tendai sect to learn more about Nichiren by visiting the various Nichiren temples. Nichij≈´ believed that these temples had already drifted away from Nichiren's spirit and teachings and founded his own temple, My≈çman-ji. In 1898, Myomanji-ha incorporated as the Kempon Hokke school and Honda Nissho (1867‚Äì1931) was appointed its first head administrator. Beliefs and Practice Much of Kempon Hokke's underlying teachings are extensions of Tendai (Â§©Âè∞, Cn: Tiantai) thought. They include much of its worldview and its rationale for criticism of Buddhist schools that do not acknowledge the Lotus Sutra to be Buddhism's highest teaching, as stated by Buddha Shakyamuni. For example, Kempon Hokke doctrine extends Tendai's , its theory of , and its view of the . Kempon Hokke teach that to be a disciple of Nichiren, one must: * Chant Namu Myoho Renge Kyo to the Object of Devotion of the Three Great Secret Laws (Gohonzon) * Believe exclusively in The Lotus Sutra * Believe exclusively in Shakyamuni Buddha of the 16th Chapter of the Lotus Sutra * Tell others to do the same * Base one's conversion practices on Nichiren's writing, the 'Rissho Ankoku Ron' (On Establishing The Correct Teaching for the Peace of The Land) Kempon Hokke members chant parts of the Lotus Sutra, as well as the Daimoku, Namu-myoho-renge-kyo, as their primary practice. Kempon Hokke claim to practice shakubuku towards non- believers, and sh≈çju towards believers. The difference of each school's traditional doctrine. Nichiren Shu was insisting that the Eternal Buddha as the truth of universe is Namu Myoho Renge Kyo Tathagata. Nichiren Sho Shu insists that Namu Myoho Renge Kyo Tathagata as the Eternal Buddha is Nichiren Daishonin himself. Those rely on Ongikuden (Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings) which is a forged letter. Honmon Butsuryu Shu insists that eight chapters (Happon) of Honmon of the Lotus Sutra are the prophecy book which Nichiren shonin appears to save people. They worship only the words of Namu Myoho Renge Kyo, but not the Eternal Buddha Sakyamuni. Kempon Hokke Shu insists that the Eternal Buddha is the Buddha Sakyamuni himself and that the Eternal Buddha Sakyamuni exists in each people's mind as the absolute spirit.

History   1987 ‚Äì 1999  The band was officially formed on May 1, 1987, by guitarist Neboj≈°a Simeunoviƒá, bassist Du≈°ko Milojeviƒá, drummer Dejan Milojeviƒá and guitarist and vocalist Stojan Radiƒçeviƒá Lole (1970‚Äì2016). Simeunoviƒá, also known as \\"Sabljar\\" (\\"Sabre-man\\"), spent his childhood in Libya and got the nickname from his father's hobby, sabre collecting. The first band he played in was the punk rock band Unbelievable Disgusting. The band had the first live appearance at the Rex cinema, on January 22, 1988. During the same year, the band recorded a two-song demo, featuring the tracks \\"Mamin nov usisivaƒç\\" (\\"Mama's New Vacuum Cleaner\\") and \\"Crveno\\" (\\"Red\\"). By the end of 1988, Radiƒçeviƒá had already left the band, forming the band Prizori Sa Venƒçanja (Images from a Wedding) with Darkwood Dub member Milorad Ristiƒá and Presing member Vladimir Markoviƒá. Simeunoviƒá then switched to vocals and the band got the temporary guitarist, Vera Kvark member Aleksandar Mitanovski, and, in October 1989, Goran Majkiƒá became the full-time guitar player. The band had their first recordings, four songs released as VIS D≈æa ili Bu, released on the Drugi talas ‚Äì Beograd '89 (The Second Wave ‚Äì Belgrade '89) various artists compilation in 1989. In 1990, the band recorded new material, released on the Lepa kaseta (A Nice Cassette) demo, and toured Yugoslavia. The material, with several other demo recordings, also appeared on the band's debut album Hej mornari (Hey Sailors), released on March 9, 1992, by Carlo Records. The A-side of the album was entitled Prokleti Harold (Damned Harold), and the B-side Nevidljiva ribizla (The Invisible Currant). With the witty bumper-sticker \\"Pobednici Splita '91\\" (\\"Winners of the 1991 Split Festival\\") on the album cover and the social-inspired lyrics, the album presented the band's lyrically ironical and musically guitar-oriented style found in the songs \\"≈Ωiveo Staljin i svetska revolucija\\" (\\"Long Live Stalin and the World revolution\\"), \\"Kraljica pica parka\\" (\\"Pussy Park Queen\\"), \\"Pobeda i poraz\\" (\\"Victory and Defeat\\"). After the album release, the band started touring Serbia. The band's frequent and effective live appearances, about a hundred of them in 1992, often featured cover versions of obscure songs, including \\"Lepi Mario\\" (\\"Pretty Mario\\") by Satan Panonski, which lead Index Radio to pronounce them the live act of the year. In 1994, Metropolis Records rereleased Hej mornari on cassette. With the release of the band's second album, Spremanje ribljeg gula≈°a zahteva visoku koncentraciju (Preparing a Fisherman's soup Takes High Concentration), the band toured Serbia once again, and had a first live appearance in a foreign country, in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. Like on the previous album, the band named the A-side of the album Konj (Horse) and the B-side Pas (Dog). The band's musical style influenced by numerous acts, including AC/DC, ZZ Top and Red Hot Chili Peppers, with the lyrics inspired by the end of socialism, similar to the ones found on the debut album, presented the social reality of the country they were living in. The songs \\"Drug Tito se krije u peƒáini\\" (\\"Comrade Tito Hides in a Cave\\"), \\"Velika svetska zavera\\" (\\"A Major World Conspiracy\\"), \\"Drugovi\\" (\\"Comrades\\"), and \\"Motori\\" (\\"Motorbikes\\"), a parody cover of the Divlje Jagode song, distinguished themselves as the most prominent. As guests on the album appeared Atheist Rap and Eva Braun members on backing vocals. In December 1995, the band released the CD Stra≈°ni sud (Judgement Day), which, with a punk oriented sound combined cataclysmic lyrical style, with the songs \\"Zanimljiva geografija\\" (\\"Interesting Geography\\"), \\"Neki drugi grad\\" (\\"Some Other City\\"), \\"Uradi sam\\" (\\"Do It Yourself\\"), inspired by the current political situation, \\"Veƒçna lovi≈°ta\\" (\\"Eternal Hunting Ground\\") and \\"Ustani i kreni\\" (\\"Stand Up and Go\\"), which became hits. As bonus tracks appeared five songs from the previous releases. After the album release, guitarist Goran Majkiƒá left the band, first serving the army and then moving to the United States where he got a master's degree at the NASA Center for Autonomous Control Engineering. With former Dead Kennedys and Butthole Surfers members, he formed the band God Dog. Igor Paniƒá took his place in D≈æa ili Bu. The new lineup recorded the album Kao da niƒçeg nije ni bilo (Like Nothing Ever Happened), in the late 1997, produced by Igor Borojeviƒá. On the album appeared the cover version of The Undertones single \\"Teenage Kicks\\" with lyrics in Serbian language entitled \\"Pas koji hoda sam\\" (\\"A Dog that Walks Alone\\"). The cassette edition of the album was published by ZMEX in January 1998, and, nine months later, the band released the CD edition under their own label Fabrika. The disc also included six of the band's promotional videos, the band biography and photos. On the Spring of 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the band ceased to exist. Simeunoviƒá formed the gothic/industrial band Chernobyl in House in April 1999, releasing the album 12 in 2002 through Active-Time.Sabljar Official MySpace  2003‚Äìpresent  In 2003, the band was reformed in the lineup which, beside Milojeviƒá, Paniƒá and Neboj≈°a Simeunoviƒá, featured keyboardist Stevan ƒêorƒëeviƒá and bassist Vladimir Marko≈°, and in 2005, the band released the best of compilation Retrovizor (Rear-view Mirror).

He was previously Vicar of the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wantage from 1847 to 1881, where he founded the Community of St Mary the Virgin. Life He was eldest son of John Laforey Butler (1786-1848), a member of the firm of H. and I. Johnstone, merchants and bankers, born in Bryanston Street, Marylebone, London, on 10 February 1818. His mother, Henrietta, daughter of Captain Robert Patrick, was of Irish, as his father was of Pembrokeshire, descent. After schooling at Enfield, he became a queen's scholar at Westminster in 1832, and was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1836. He won the Trinity essay in 1839, but, though a fair classical scholar, was unable to give sufficient time to the tripos, and took a pass degree in 1840. He commenced M.A. in 1844, and on 1 July 1847 was admitted ad eundem at Oxford, where he was made an honorary canon of Christ Church in 1872 (Foster). He was ordained by Bishop Sumner in Farnham chapel in 1841 to the curacy of Dogmersfield, under Charles Dyson. Subsequently for one year he held the curacy of Puttenham in Surrey, and in 1844, he accepted the perpetual curacy of Wareside, a poor outlying hamlet of Ware. Here he preached the discourses included in his 'Sermons for Working Men' (1847). Meanwhile, in June 1846, he was appointed by the dean and chapter of Windsor to the vicarage of Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wantage. There he founded, and acted as warden of, the penitentiary sisterhood of St. Mary's, in 1850, his name is inseparably associated. He retained the wardenship until his death. While at Wantage he trained as his curates the Rev. A. H. Mackonochie, the Rev. G. Cosby White, the Rev. M. H. Noel, the Rev. V. S. S. Coles, Canon Newbolt, and Dr. Liddon. 'I owe all the best I know to Butler' was a saying attributed to Liddon, but felt equally by many of the other churchmen who came under Butler's stimulating influence. Upon the deposition of Bishop Colenso in 1864 by the Cape Town Metropolitan synod, Butler was elected to replace him at a synod of the diocese of Natal; but the election was disapproved by Archbishop Longley, to whose views Butler loyally subordinated his own wishes. He was a great believer in obedience, and 'a still greater in submission.' In 1874, he was elected to convocation as proctor for the clergy of Oxford, and often brightened the debates by the short speeches in which he excelled. In politics he was rather conservative than otherwise. In 1880, however, he was nominated by Gladstone to a residentiary canonry at Worcester Cathedral, and while there did much good work in connection with the internal government of the cathedral, the establishment of a separate school for the choristers, and the formation of a girls' high school in the city. In 1885 Gladstone advanced him to the deanery of Lincoln in the room of Blakesley. To him the cathedral at Lincoln owes the evening service in the nave and numerous other improvements in the services. His vigorous health suddenly broke in January 1894, and he died at the deanery on 14 January, and was buried on the 18th in Lincoln Cathedral. His marble sarcophagus lies east of the choir stalls. Family His death was followed on 21 January by that of his wife, Emma, daughter of George Henry Barnett (1780-1871), head of the banking firm of Barnett, Hoare, & Co., whom he had married at Putney on 29 July 1843, and by whom he had issue. She was buried beside her husband in the Cloister Garth behind the high altar at Lincoln.

Developed by Thorn-EMI and built at their now-defunct site at Hayes in Middlesex, it was in British service from 1975 until about 2003 with the Royal Artillery. Cymbeline replaced Green Archer in British service, but in a larger number of larger units including the Territorial Army. Cymbeline came in Mk 1 and Mk 2 versions, the difference being their mobility; Mk 1 was on a lightweight two wheel trailer whereas Mk 2 was mounted on top of an FV432 armoured carrier. The Mk 1 was transportable underslung by a helicopter. Cymbeline was more accurate than Green Archer and a lot more mobile. Although mortar locating was its primary role, it was capable of various other tasks. Description The basic Cymbeline was a single unit on a turntable stand with four adjustable legs for levelling. The main elements were the antenna, the Foster scanner, the main electronic unit and a Wankel rotary generator (using two-stroke fuel) weighing 390 kg. This was strapped to a simple 590 kg trailer that it could be operated from. Off the trailer the radar was 2.29 metres high with the antenna up, 1.07 metres with antenna folded, 1.7 metres wide and 1.5 metres long. The radar itself had a nominal 100 kW peak average output and a nominal pulse repetition frequency of 4000 pulses/second. The radar was connected by cable to the operator‚Äôs console (‚ÄòIndicator Azimuth Unit‚Äô) and connected to this was the ‚ÄòMortar Coordinate Indicator‚Äô that displayed the located mortar‚Äôs position to the detachment commander. The Foster scanner converted a narrow radar beam, about 40 mils diameter, into one 720 mils wide and 30 mils high. This beam had five pre-set operating positions determined by five different radar horns that directed the beam onto the antenna at slightly different angles. Two beam positions were used with a mortar bomb being recorded by the operator as it went through each beam. This gave two ranges and elevations, and the time interval. The operator marked his screen at each bomb position and changed the beam angle which also recorded time. He then placed electronic markers against his marks (which represented the bomb‚Äôs position in the horizontal plane) which the analogue computer used to calculate the mortar coordinates using the expected mortar altitude that has been previously set. Setting-up the radar involved orientating it in a known azimuth (the basic mounting could cover an arc of 4800 mils) and setting the datum beam elevation between -90 and 360 mils so that it was above the radar horizon. Other beam positions, 25, 40, 45, 65 and 90 mils were relative to this datum. The lowest beam position was used to alert the operator that a bomb was in flight and where to expect it on his screen; once alerted he tilted the beam into the first position, waited for it to appear, and then switched to the next angle. The angles were pre-selected according to the local circumstances. Data memory was also available, although in British service this was normally only fitted to Cymbeline Mk 2; in essence it recorded the detected mortar bomb signal and allowed it to be replayed. Cymbeline could locate a mortar with an accuracy of 50 metres. 81 mm mortars could be located at up to 10 km and larger mortars to 20 km. Secondary roles were area and coastal surveillance, helicopter and light aircraft control, meteor balloon tracking and rapid survey. It could also observe and adjust ground and airburst artillery fire and high angle fire. In British service each radar held a spare main electronic unit, spare generator and spare displays. The radar includes an integral simulator for operator training and practice and built-in test functionality. Cymbeline Mk 2 was mounted on an FV432. The normal hatch covers over the rear compartment were replaced by a circular radar mounting, with three ‚Äòsupports‚Äô for the radar turntable. The radar could be rotated up to 12 800 mils. Prototypes used hydraulic supports to level the radar but the production version used mercury in the same manner as Green Archer Mk 2 had. When the taps were opened and the radar unclamped the mercury levelled itself and the radar floated on it. There was some internal furniture for the operator and the displays, as well as racking for the spare assemblies, and a simple hoist to lift the assemblies up to the radar. For movement the antenna was lowered and the whole radar surrounded by a folding grille attached to decking around the radar to protect it. Operational history In British service, the radars were used in the Falkland Islands in 1982, the Gulf War in 1991 and in the Balkans. The radars were organized in troops; originally these were in each field regiment (equipped with Abbot) and light regiment (equipped with L118 Light Gun) and were designated 'G Troop' in each regiment. The field regiments had Cymbeline Mk 2, the light regiments had Cymbeline Mk 1. In British service a radar troop normally comprised a radar command post, three radars, three listening posts (LPs) and a reconnaissance party led by the troop sergeant major. Radars and LPs were normally commanded by sergeants. The task of the LPs was to report mortars firing and the area they were in. Radars were only switched on in response to reports of hostile mortar fire, and so thereby avoiding continuous transmission in order to minimise the risk of detection. Radars reported the hostile mortar locations to the radar command post, from where they were reported to the Brigade Artillery Intelligence Officer and regimental headquarters for rapid counter-fire. The troop's maintenance section, with radar technicians deployed with the radar command post and attended radars as necessary. The troop commander was the Brigade Artillery Intelligence Officer and with the troop's artillery intelligence section was at brigade headquarters. In the late 1970s some troops were removed from regiments and concentrated into a specialist batteries. Four sets went to China, via the US, in 1979. Two may have been retained for study by Chinese radio engineers. The others were used in the border conflicts between China and Vietnam, with great effectiveness. These were such a disruption to the Vietnamese that in 1984 a special forces operation at the battle of Lao mountain was organised to destroy one of them. China eventually produced a reverse engineered version designated as Type 371. Variants Thorn-EMI developed a Mk 3 radar during the late 1980s, called Cervantes by the British Army. It made use of modern electronics, had a larger antenna, far greater range and some capability to locate guns and rocket launchers; however, the development effort was eventually abandoned.

His book Olio received the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Biography Early life Tyehimba Jess was born Jesse S. Goodwin. He grew up in Detroit, where his father worked in that city's Department of Health. His father later became the first vice president of Detroit's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Jess's mother was a teacher and nurse, who founded a nursing school at Wayne County Community College in 1972. According to Jess, he started writing poetry at age 16. Within just a few years, when he was 18, he had won second prize for poetry at an NAACP academic competition. He graduated from high school in 1984. Next, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he intended to be an English major and pursue his poetry writing. However, he soon abandoned this as an option, and dropped out of the university in 1987. During this time, to support himself, Jess worked as an intern at a bank, as a community organizer, and as substitute teacher in the public school system in Chicago. In 1989, he returned to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and by this time had switched his major to Public Policy. But Jess says that after he began to take classes at UIC with the poet and scholar Sterling Plumpp, who became a mentor, he realized that his real passion was for poetry. Plumpp's classes focused on literary figures from the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and '70s. And although he was just a few credits shy of a degree in Public Policy, Jess felt inspired enough to again switch back to poetry. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1991, with a BA degree in Public Policy. He later pursued a MFA degree at New York University which he received in 2004. Career As of 2017, Jess teaches poetry and fiction as an associate professor of English at the College of Staten Island of the City University of New York. He is also the faculty adviser for Caesura, the college's literary arts magazine. Jess's first book of poetry, leadbelly (Wave Books, 2005), was chosen by Brigit Pegeen Kelly as a winner in the 2004 National Poetry Series competition. Library Journal and Black Issues Book Review both named it one of the \\"Best Poetry Books of 2005\\". In April 2016, Jess released his second full- length poetry collection, titled Olio. This work has been described as \\"part fact, part fiction‚Ä¶.sonnet, song and narrative to examine the lives of mostly unrecorded AfricanAmerican performers‚Ä¶.\\" In his book he writes some poems in reference to Edmonia Lewis, John William Boone, Henry Box Brown, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Fisk Jubilee Singers, Ernest Hogan, Sissieretta Jones, Scott Joplin, Millie and Christine McKoy, Booker T. Washington, Blind Tom Wiggins, Bert Williams and George Walker. His work appeared in Soul Fires: Young Black Men on Love and Violence, Obsidian III: Literature in the African Diaspora, Power Lines: Ten Years of Poetry from Chicago's Guild Complex, and Slam: The Art of Performance Poetry.

Life and career Dobinson was born in 1898 in Darlington, County Durham, the son of Thomas William Dobinson, a porter, and his wife Annie. He attended Darlington Grammar School, where he played for the school football team, before joining the Army in 1915. He served in France with 52 Brigade Royal Field Artillery as well as playing for the Brigade's football team. After the war, he worked as a shipyard clerk, played football as an amateur for Sunderland West End, and established a reputation in Yorkshire and the north-east of England as a middle-distance runner. Dobinson signed for Durham City ahead of their first season in the Football League.. He made his debut on 3 September 1921, playing at centre forward in a 2‚Äì0 win at home to Southport in Durham's second match in the newly formed Northern Section of the Third Division.. His first Football League goal came in his sixth appearance, on 22 October in a 7‚Äì3 loss to his home-town club of Darlington, and by Christmas he had five goals from a dozen matches.

Dobinson's services were retained for the 1922‚Äì23 season, but they were mainly employed in helping the \\"A\\" team win the North-East Lancashire Combination title. After a trial with Third Division North club Chesterfield came to nothing, Dobinson signed for Queens Park Rangers of the Southern Section in June 1923. Playing in the Football Combination against West Ham United reserves in August, he trod on the ball and injured himself badly enough to be unable to train for several weeks. He made his first-team debut on 22 October in a 3‚Äì0 defeat away to Northampton Town, but, as at Burnley, he played mainly reserve-team football. His only other league matchhis last in the Football Leaguewas away to Luton Town in February 1924. At the end of the season, he returned to local football in the north-east with Thornley Albion, In 1928, he was granted a permit to play for amateur club Heaton-on-Tyne SC. Dobinson married Doris Taylor in 1929. The 1939 Register finds the couple living in Plymouth, Devon, where Dobinson was working as a departmental clerical officer. He died in Plymouth in 1990 at the age of 92.

The Jireh Chapel is a former Calvinistic Independent chapel in the Cliffe area of Lewes, the county town of East Sussex and the main town in the local government district of Lewes. It is more than 200 years old and has been designated a Grade I Listed building. History The ancient market town of Lewes has a well-established history of Protestant Nonconformism. Many chapels were established in the 18th and 19th centuries in the town itself and in its suburbs of Southover and Cliffe. One such place of worship was the Jireh chapel. In or around 1805 a dispute arose between Jenkin Jenkins, the minister at Cliffe's Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion chapel, and its congregation. He was dismissed by the Countess's Trustees and arranged for a new chapel to be built for him nearby. (The Countess of Huntingdon chapel, which opened in 1775, survived until the 1880s but has been demolished.) Jireh Chapel was placed in the hands of trustees about 1807. Prior to that time it had been the personal property of Jenkin Jenkins. The Trust Deed states that the Chapel is a place of Christian worship to be \\"frequented and enjoyed by a congregation of Protestant Dissenters of the Calvinistic persuasion professing ..\\". A list of certain Articles of Faith, extracted from the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, follows. The Article on Infant baptism (Article 27) is included in the Trust Deed of the Chapel. William Huntington S.S. that hung in the chapel Huntington's grave at the chapel Jenkins enlisted William Huntington to open the church, which was completed in 1805. Huntington, originally from Cranbrook in Kent, was an orthodox but controversial Calvinist preacher who ministered at Providence Chapel, Grays Inn Lane, London. Known by various pseudonyms, he became very popular in southeast England in the early 19th century, and helped to found several Calvinist chapels. An example of his eccentricity was his reference to Jenkins as \\"W.A.\\" (the \\"Welsh Ambassador\\") and himself as \\"S.S.\\" (\\"Sinner Saved\\"); the \\"W.A.\\" epithet featured on a tablet below the chapel's gabled roof which commemorated its opening. It reads . Huntington died in 1813 and was buried in a tomb in the small graveyard behind the chapel. The chapel proved popular, and was extended in 1826 to give a capacity of about 1,000. The interior was almost entirely wooden, with box- pews and galleries. A Sunday school was built in the grounds in 1874; it was linked to the chapel's north wall by a columned porch surmounted by a pediment. The chapel's use declined in the 20th century, and the Loyal Orange Institution of England, Southdowns Lodge used it for their annual commemorative service on the Sunday prior to November 5. Many members of the various Bonfire Societies attended this annual \\"Bonfire\\" service. The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster denomination was founded by Ian Paisley on 17 March 1951 in Crossgar, a village in County Down, Northern Ireland. It quickly became established across Northern Ireland, where dozens of churches were founded, and some congregations developed in the rest of Great Britain as well. Scotland and Wales each have several, and in there are seven in England. The Lewes congregation established itself in the Jireh chapel, which is therefore now in regular use again. Lewes has a strong history of non- conformism and has one of the few Orange lodges in the South of England. Architecture The Tuscan-columned porch Although externally clad in red brick and tiles, the chapel is completely timber-framed. The entrance is at the east end and is framed by a porch with columns of the Tuscan order, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"over-broad\\". Above this, three evenly spaced sash windows, an oculus and the stone tablet sit below the gable. A chimney breast extends up the west wall. The roof is covered with slate tiles and has a small boxlike louvred projection, topped with a pyramid-style cap, in the middle. There are four pairs of sash windows in the north and south walls, which are faced with mathematical tiles and slates respectively. Inside, wood predominates: the barrel-vaulted timber roof is supported on wooden columns attached to the gallery which runs around all four sides of the interior. The galleries are in turn held up with five timber columns on the north and south sides. Wooden staircases leading to the galleries are situated in all four corners. An octagonal pulpit stands at the west end. Original pine box-pews remain in the galleries and the main body of the chapel. The church today Lewes Free Presbyterian Church is one of seven such churches established in England: there are others in Bridlington in North Yorkshire, Bristol, Liverpool, London, Oulton Broad in Suffolk and Tavistock in Devon. Two Sunday services and a Monday meeting take place each week. The church was designated a Grade I Listed building on 25 February 1952. Under the name Jireh Chapel, the church was licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 with the registration number 15521.

His recommendations included prevention and online efficiencies, citing his own example of melanoma that could have been treatable if caught earlier given a family history of the condition. He described difficulties in obtaining approval for payment of radiation therapy for cancer that had spread to his brain, which his insurer had deemed \\"not medically necessary\\" and expressed frustration with the amount of time he and his physician had to spend in dealing with paperwork.Bacon, Kenneth H. \\"A Cancer Patient's Perspective\\", The Washington Post, July 21, 2009. Accessed August 17, 2009. He served as chairman of the Folger Shakespeare Library and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Death A resident of Washington, D.C., Bacon died at age 64 of complications related to melanoma, at his second home on Block Island, Rhode Island. He and his wife of 43 years, the former Darcy Wheeler, had two daughters.

He later moved to Frankfurt am Main, and then to Berlin. After he graduated from school, he pursued an interest in flying by attending Germany's hotbed of prewar aviation at Johannisthal. His instructor was Germany's first female pilot, Melli Beese. On 20 July 1913, Frankl earned pilot's license number 49. The outbreak of World War I sparked Frankl's volunteering to fly for his country. His flying ability and his personality both commended him to his superiors. While his professional life took off, so did his personal life. He fell in love with the daughter of Austrian Naval Kapit√§n zur See Edmund Stroll. Frankl converted to Christianity and married his love in early 1917. Aerial victories Frankl began his career of aerial victories early in the war, before the concept of the synchronized machine gun firing safely through the plane's propeller became a practical reality. On 10 May 1915, while flying as an observer in Feldflieger Abteilung 40 (FFA 40), he used a carbine to shoot down a French Voisin. He was awarded an Iron Cross First Class for this feat. It took exactly eight months for his second triumph. On 10 January 1916, while flying a Fokker Eindecker with KEK Vaux, he downed another Voisin; this one was armed with a 37mm Hotchkiss cannon. By 1 February, his victory total stood at four. Three months later, on 4 May, he became an ace. On 16 May, he was promoted from Vizefeldwebel into the officer's ranks as a Leutnant. He scored once more on 21 May. He was awarded the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern during late May, followed by the Hanseatic Cross. By this time, Frankl was one of only eight aces in the German flying service. Frankl's gallantry earned him the Pour le M√©rite after his eighth confirmed victory; the Blue Max was awarded on 16 July 1916. His guns rested until 2 August, when he tallied a Morane-Saulnier L. A double victory followed on 10 August. On 1 September 1916, he then transferred to Prussian Jagdstaffel 4 (Jasta 4) as it was formed from KEK Vaux, to fly Halberstadt D.Vs. On 1 January 1917, he succeeded to command of the squadron. Four wins in September and two in October made him a triple ace. In late December 1916, Frankl succeeded to command of Jasta 4. Then, after a six-month hiatus, he scored a quadruple victory on 6 April 1917, and his twentieth win on the following day. Killed in action His end came the day after that. While battling Bristol F.2 Fighters of No. 48 Squadron RFC on Easter Sunday, 8 April 1917,Frequency of Occurrences of the Date of Easter 1875 to 2124 Frankl's Albatros D.III lost its lower wing under the stress of combat manoeuvres, and he and his collapsed craft fell to his death near Vitry-Sailly, France.

His legacy Frankl's Jewish heritage likely resulted in his name and exploits being omitted from the 1938 book by Walter Zuerl, Pour le m√©rite-Flieger - Heldentaten und Erlebnisse unserer Kriegsflieger (Pour le m√©rite-Fliers - Heroic Deeds and Experiences of our Wartime Fliers),Bronnenkant, Lance J.

(Sweet 1964). Cameral deposits are common and concentrated ventrally. Apices typically have a slight to moderate exogastric curvature The Pseudorthocerida are included in a broad in-group of generally orthoconic cephalopods known as the Orthoceratoidea (Kroger 2008) along with the Ascocerida, Dissidocerida, Lituitida, and Orthocerida. The Pseudorthocerida were among the last living orthoconic nautiloids. One family, the Trematoceratidae, survived into the Triassic Period. Taxonomy Current understanding By current understanding the Pseudorthocerida contains the following families. :Pseudorthoceratidae :Cayutoceratidae :Pseudactinoceratidae :Spyroceratidae :Carbactinoceratidae :Trematoceratidae The Pseudorthoceratidae through Spyroceratidae are presented as subfamilies in Sweet (1964) and are included in the Pseudorthoceratidae sensu Sweet (1964). The Carbactinoceratidae are removed from the Actinocerida in Kroger and Mapes (2007). Earlier perspectives Pseudorthocerids were previously known as the Pseudorthocerataceae, a superfamily within the Orthocerida (Sweet 1964) which included the Silurian and later Pseudorthoceratidae and Middle Ordovician to Middle Silurian Proteoceratidae. Both have siphuncles that are partly cyrochoanitic with expanded segments and internal deposits but differ in the manner in which they develop. Flower (1976) distinguished Middle Ordovician pseudorthocerids from Silurian and later pseudorthocerids on the basis of how the siphuncle changes during the life of the animal. The earlier Proteoceratidae begin cyrtochoanitic with expanded segments and end up orthochoanitic with subcylindrical segments. As juveniles they are \\"pseudorthoceratoid\\", as mature individuals they are \\"orthoceratoid\\". In contrast the later Pseudorthoceratidae, begin orthochoanitic with subcylindrical segments and ontogenetically become cyrtochoanitic with expanded segments. As such they matured into \\"pseudorthoceratoids\\" from \\"orthoceratoid\\" juveniles. From this Flower (1976) concluded that the Ordovician and Silurian pseudorthocerids (sensu Sweet 1964) were derived from different orthocerids (Orthocerida) and were therefore polyphyletic. As a result, true pseudorthocerids were limited to the Pseudorthoceratidae while the earlier Ordovician look-a-likes were retained in the Orthocerida (Michelinocerida Flower)  References  Category:Orthoceratoidea Category:Prehistoric cephalopod orders Category:Paleozoic cephalopods Category:Mesozoic cephalopods Category:Cenozoic cephalopods Category:Extant Silurian first appearances ","title":"Pseudorthocerida"},{"id":"24006893","text":"Mauricio Andr√©s Pozo Quinteros (born 16 August 1970) is a retired Chilean football defender and current manager.

In the visual arts, interlace is a decorative element found in medieval art. In interlace, bands or portions of other motifs are looped, braided, and knotted in complex geometric patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the Migration period art of Northern Europe, especially in the Insular art of Ireland and the British Isles and Norse art of the Early Middle Ages and in Islamic art. Intricate braided and interlaced patterns, called plaits in British usage, are found in late Roman art in many parts of Europe, in mosaic floors and other media. Coptic manuscripts and textiles of 5th- and 6th- century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a \\"striking resemblance\\" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the Insular art manuscripts of Ireland and the British Isles.Mitchell et al. 1977, p. 59 History and application Interlace and rotational symmetry: Iron Age Torque de Foxados, Museo de Pontevedra, Galicia Northern Europe Interlace is a key feature of the \\"Style II\\" animal style decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the Lombards into Northern Italy. Typically the long \\"ribbons\\" eventually terminate in an animal's head. By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and Scandinavia, where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, runestones, high crosses, and illuminated manuscripts of the 7th to 12th centuries. Artist George Bain has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th- century Book of Durrow and the Durham Cathedral Gospel Book fragment as \\"broken and rejoined\\" braids.Bain 1973, p. 29 Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to Hiberno-Scottish monasteries from the eastern Mediterranean or came via Lombardic Italy is uncertain. Art historian James Johnson Sweeney argued for direct communication between the scriptoria of Early Christian Ireland and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt.Bishop 2001, p.270 This new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the Sutton Hoo treasure. The most elaborate interlaced zoomorphics occur in Viking Age art of the Urnes style (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.Graham- Campbell 1980, pp. 150-151 The full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the Insular art of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the Book of Kells and the Cross of Cong. Whole carpet pages were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone high crosses combined interlace panels with figurative ones. Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the Franco-Saxon school of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other Carolingian schools of illumination, where the tendency was to foliate decorative forms. In Romanesque art these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex. Some animal forms are also found. Islamic art Geometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of arabesque. Umayyad architectural elements such as floor mosaics, window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval Islamic art. Interlaced elaborations are also found in Kufic calligraphy. Southern Europe Interlace and knotwork are often found in Byzantine art, continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the three-ribbon interlace found in the early medieval Croatia on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.

It was originally a large complex located at the mouth of the Oude Rijn (old river Rhine), which today is believed to be about a kilometer westwards (offshore in the North Sea) of the current location of the European Space Research and Technology Centre. History Map of Brittenburg (as \\"Lugduno\\") in the Tabula Peutingeriana. The word dunum, traceable in Gaelic place names in the present day (Dundalk, Dunrobin Castle) and meaning \\"fortress\\" or \\"castle\\", is a typically Celtic element in European place-names. The site, known as \\"Brittenburg\\", was still visible in the dunes in the fourteenth century, but the gradual advance of the sea made the ruins lie on the beach in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Today, they would be somewhere in the Rhine estuary, inaccessible to archaeological research.D. Parleviet, \\"De Brittenburg voorgoed verloren\\", Westerheem 51.3 (2002). All that remains is a small set of finds, collected in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and a famous map by Ortelius. A copy of an old Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana shows Brittenburg as Lugduno; on the coast and with two towers. Eastwards from that point, two roads run towards Noviomagi (Nijmegen). Along the northern route, the following towns can be seen: Pretorium Agrippine (Valkenburg (South Holland)), Matilone (Leiden), Albanianis (Alphen aan den Rijn), Nigropullo (Zwammerdam), and Lauri (Woerden). All of these locations are situated on the Oude Rijn. The southern route begins with the town Forum Hadriani (Voorburg), shown directly south of Matilone. These towns were connected by the Fossa Corbulonis or Corbulo-canal. The first mention of the Brittenburg in a Dutch text is in a poem of Willem van Hildegaersberch in 1401, who called it Borch te Bretten. In 1490 there is also a mention of the visibility of the \\"burg te Britten\\". It was 'discovered' in 1520 when a storm exposed the whole complex and Roman artifacts (mainly stones and coins), were found. Some coins were dated, with the latest date being 270. The oldest picture of the Brittenburg is a woodcut (identified by Leiden professor Jan Hendrik Holwerda, curator of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden) by Abraham Ortelius in 1562 for Lodovico Guicciardini's first edition of The Low Countreys, printed in 1589 by Christophe Plantin in Antwerp. This woodcut was replaced in later editions with an engraving. The oldest picture was used later by Zacharias Heyns (1598, 1599) and Hermann Moll (1734, 1736). It concerns a land surveyor's draft (trigonometry), in which the distance from the ruins (by that time in the North Sea and only visible at low tide) westward to the church of Katwijk is mentioned, namely 1,200 'schreden' (= 1,080 meters). Brittenburg was part of the Roman border defense (limes), as the guard post (castellum) called Lugduno, the westernmost position situated along the Old Rhine, which formed the northern frontier of the Roman province Germania Inferior. Given the square shape of the inner structure, the Brittenburg was probably a lighthouse after the model of the lighthouse of Ostia Antica with a height of about 60 meters and a basis of 72 x 72 meters. Some historians also see a granary in the plan, but for this a drier, more inland location would have made more sense. Structures Corbulo-canal. Burcht te Bretten There has been a lot of confusion about the terms Brittenburg and Lugdunum Batavorum. The mysterious 'burcht te Bretten', a castle situated supposedly somewhere around Leiden (Bretten is the oldest name for the area between Leiden and the North Sea), has been sought since the Middle Ages. When the remains at Katwijk were rediscovered in 1520, they were (incorrectly) called Brittenburg for this reason. There were many burchts in this area that fell into disuse and were later torn down to reuse the stones in construction. Burcht van Leiden When the Tabula Peutingeriana was discovered by Conrad Celtes around 1500, Leiden scholars assumed that an old shell keep in the city center called the Burcht van Leiden, at the spot where the Leidse Rijn met the Oude Rijn, was Lugduno. Leiden has called itself (incorrectly) Lugdunum Batavorum for this reason. The Latin name of Leiden University is Academia Lugduno-Batava. The Batava was only added to distinguish Leiden from another Lugdunum. This term is even more unfortunately chosen, since those same scholars also assumed that Leiden was located within the old Batavia (region), which was in fact much further east, near Germany. Lugdunum was in the territory of the Cananefates, not the Batavi. Today Leiden is associated with the town Matilone on the tabula, and even that spot is considered to be a location somewhat eastwards of the Burcht van Leiden, at the site of a former cloister called Roomburg. Tower of Kalla Valkenburg in 1627. The Roman historian Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus wrote a story about the emperor Caligula, who lined up his soldiers and artillery on the beach and declared war on Neptune, god of the sea. After that he claimed victory over the ocean and commanded his men to collect shells as war booty.Suetonius, Life of Caligula 46 As a monument to this victory he built a tall lighthouse. This story resulted in a search for Caligula's lighthouse. In the 16th century, when many early tourists came to see the Brittenburg at low tide, people from Katwijk reported that their fishing nets were regularly stuck behind the stones of what they called \\"Kalla's tower\\" (Kalla = Caligula). This story of Caligula is probable, because a wine barrel was found originating from his personal vineyard in this area.Simon Wynia, \\"Gaius Was Here: The Emperor Gaius' Preparations for the Invasion of Britannia: New Evidence\\", in H. Sarfatij, W. J. H. Verwers, and P. J. Woltering, ed., In Discussion with the Past: Archaeological Studies presented to W. A. van Es (Amersfoort, 1999). Valkenburg Considered to be part of Lugdunum, the Roman army supply base Praetorium Agrippinae, modern Valkenburg, is said to have been founded by Caligula. Modern archeologists have found traces of Roman infrastructure and have installed ways to see these in the modern landscape. New Brittenburg South east of the Brittenburg is now the sole reminder of the ancient structure: the bus stop Nieuw Brittenburg (New Brittenburg), the main bus stop for the city centre and the beach of Katwijk.

The studio was custom-designed with stereo echo chambers, and its new large tracking floor made it well suited for larger productions such as horn and orchestra sessions (Presley's \\"Kentucky Rain\\" arranged by Glen Spreen, is an example). Wayne Jackson recorded there as part of the Memphis Horns, including the trumpet part on Neil Diamond's \\"Sweet Caroline\\". The studio had easy access the Memphis International Airport, and next door was the Memphis landmark John Grisanti's restaurant. American East helped complete many of the productions made at the North studio between 1968 and ‚Äò72. Both studios were fitted with similar equipment which allowed the easy transfer of tapes, and were able to operate all day and night to handle the demand. So much more work could be done, as Moman quoted to Billboard magazine. Moman also liked to work in anonymity during these years and the East location served that purpose well. In 1972 Moman and Crews had made arrangements for a split. Moman moved to Atlanta, then Nashville with American Sound Studios, and the studio on Thomas St. was closed. Crews restored the Deadrick location back to \\"ONYX\\". By 1975 STAX own studios had closed. From 1978 to 1988 ONYX was the studio for Allen Jones, ex-STAX engineer and producer (the Bar-Kays, Isaac Hayes, Albert King, Kwik), and the studio home for the Bar-Kays. It was purchased by musicians/producers Doyle and Robby Turner after Don Crews retired in 1978. By 1990 the studio was leased to Easley and McCain. Between 1990 and 2005 the studio was known as Easley McCain Recording, under the direction of producers Doug Easley, Davis McCain and Stuart Sikes. The studio was used by acts including Alex Chilton, Tav Falco, Rufus Thomas, The White Stripes, Loretta Lynn, Wilco, and Jeff Buckley. In 2005 the studio suffered a major fire and Easley McCain relocated to a new premises in 2009. https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/fire-at-easley-mccain- studio/Content?oid=1121357 https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/the-easley- mccain-era/Content?oid=3681853 After the fire the studio was bought by an out-of-state developer. After negotiating with the developer to protect this Memphis landmark custodial power was given to Brad Dunn in 2006 to campaign to get the studio reopened. Brad was supported by his father Robert and uncle Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, and sought input from Chips Moman, Don and Erick Crews on preserving the historical site. A trust was set up by new owner David Gicking to preserve the studio's future. The first phase was complete in 2011 after a detailed restoration. Brad Dunn (producer, engineer), Matt Martone and Will Gilbert (engineer) re-opened the studio in 2011 as American Recording Studio. American Recording Studio is the only physical location where any of the American Sound Studios legacy remains. It was still owned by David Gicking and Brad Dunn in 2017. American Sound Studios AKA American North on 827 Thomas street was demolished in 1989 for ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù. Recording artists In January 1969, Elvis Presley recorded his last number one hit \\"Suspicious Minds\\" with producer/engineer Chips Moman.

It was Tommy Cogbill's bass ride out in Dusty Springfield's hit \\"Son of a Preacher Man.\\" They were also the band in flutist Herbie Mann's 1969 Jazz Rock classic Memphis Underground. In 2007, they were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN.CMT News - Unsung Heroes Honored at Musicians Hall of Fame Induction - Calvin Gilbert - November 27, 2007 - CMT : News : Unsung Heroes Honored at Musicians Hall of Fame Induction Bobby Womack Bobby Womack worked at producer Chips Moman's American Sound Studio in Memphis, and played on recordings by Joe Tex and The Box Tops. Until this point, around 1967, he had had little success as a solo artist, but at American he began to record a string of hit singles, including 1968's \\"What Is This\\" (his first chart hit), \\"It's Gonna Rain\\", and \\"More Than I Can Stand\\". During this period he became known as a songwriter, contributing many songs to Wilson Pickett's repertoire; these include \\"I'm in Love\\" and \\"I'm a Midnight Mover.\\" He also played guitar on three of Aretha Franklin's hit-making late 1960s recordings, including the Lady Soul album, and \\"Chain of Fools\\". Among his appearances as a session musician from this period are Sly & the Family Stone's 1971 album There's a Riot Goin' On, and Janis Joplin's Pearl, which features a song by Womack and Michael McClure entitled \\"Trust Me\\". In 1971, on an album with jazz guitarist G√°bor Szab√≥, he recorded the instrumental \\"Breezin'\\", which later became a hit for George Benson. Joe Tex Joe Tex recorded his major hit, \\"Skinny Legs and All\\"(1967), and \\"I Gotcha\\"(1972), at American Sound Studio. \\"I Gotcha\\" was originally intended to be recorded by King Floyd, but Floyd never recorded a version of it. Instead, Tex went ahead and recorded it himself in the late 1960s, but ended up not releasing it. He decided to re-record the song in late 1971 at American Sound Studio and released it as the B-side of \\"A Mother's Prayer,\\" the first single off his 1972 album that was also titled I Gotcha. Radio DJs decided to flip the single over and started playing \\"I Gotcha.\\" This would result in Tex having his first major hit in five years as \\"I Gotcha\\" eventually peaked at number one on the R&B; chart and number two on the Pop chart and would sell around three million copies. Elvis Presley In January and February 1969, Elvis Presley recorded an extensive number of tracks during a period known as his comeback. One notable track, and the first to be released, was \\"In the Ghetto\\", unusual in Elvis' repertoire for its social commentary on the cycle of crime and poverty, followed by \\"Suspicious Minds\\", which became a centerpiece of his live performances that would begin that year.USA Today - Elvis faithful can't visit site of his last No. 1 - Copyright 2009 The Associated Press - 8/16/2009 - Elvis faithful can't visit site of his last No. 1 - USATODAY.com Indeed, four charting singles came from these sessions- \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", and \\"Kentucky Rain\\" ‚Äîas well as two critically acclaimed albums released during 1969, From Elvis in Memphis and the studio portion of From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis, also the strings and horns were scored at American East Studio. Mike Leach and Glen Spreen did most of the arranging, ‚Äúsweetening‚Äù the tracks at American East. Many of the unreleased songs were later issued on Back in Memphis in 1970. Additional tracks recorded during the 1969 sessions would continue to appear haphazardly on assorted Elvis albums as late as 1972, including a cover version of The Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\". B. J.

Further, David and Bacharach won Best Original Score. The version by B. J. Thomas was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States in January 1970 for four weeks and the first #1 single of the 1970s. It also spent seven weeks atop the U.S. adult contemporary chart.Whitburn, Joel (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications) The song was recorded in seven takes, after Bacharach expressed dissatisfaction with the first six. Dusty Springfield The sudden changes of pop music in the mid-1960s left female singers out of fashion. To boost her credibility as a soul artist, Dusty Springfield went to Memphis, Tennessee to record an album of pop and soul music at American Sound Studio. The LP Dusty in Memphis earned Springfield a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1970 and received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2001. International readers and viewers polls list the record among the one hundred greatest albums of all time. The LP's standout track \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\" was an international Top 10 hit in 1969.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Britannica online encyclopedia - Dusty Springfield - June 5, 2008 - Dusty Springfield (British singer) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia The Box Tops The Box Tops recorded Wayne Carson Thompson's \\"The Letter\\". Under two minutes in length, it was an international hit in late 1967, reaching Billboard's number- one position and remaining there for four weeks. Produced by Dan Penn and featuring 16-year-old vocalist Alex Chilton, the single sold over four million copies and received two Grammy Awards nominations. Their single \\"Cry Like a Baby\\" was a major hit in 1968, peaking at number two on Billboard. Some of their recordings' instrumental tracks were performed by session musicians like Reggie Young, Tommy Cogbill, Gene Chrisman, and Bobby Womack at Moman's American Sound Studio, and by future Chilton producer Terry Manning at Ardent Studios, although the actual group members performed on a number of the recordings, including their first hit \\"The Letter\\", and on all live performances.Gordon, Robert (1995).

The story is about the ladies that work in the church basement cooking meals for church functions. The musical is inspired by the humorous book Growing Up Lutheran, by Janet Letnes Martin and Suzann Nelson. Published in 1997, Growing Up Lutheran is a humorous \\"scrapbook of memories\\" of what it was like to grow up Lutheran in the Midwest in the 1950s.

Gunderson - Howard Wilson Plot A celebration of the church basement kitchen and the women who work there, Church Basement Ladies is a musical comedy featuring four distinct characters and their relationships as they organize the food and solve the problems of a rural Minnesota church about to undergo changes in 1965. From the elderly matriarch of the kitchen to the young bride-to-be learning the proper order of things, we see them handle a record-breaking Christmas dinner, the funeral of a dear friend, a Hawaiian Easter fundraiser, and a steaming hot July wedding. They stave off potential disasters, share and debate recipes, instruct the young, and keep the Pastor on course while thoroughly enjoying, (and tolerating) each other as the true \\"steel magnolias\\" of the church. Funny and down to earth, audiences will recognize these ladies as they witness the church year unfold from below the house of God.

Biography Grzesinski was born Albert Lehmann in Treptow an der Tollense, Germany, the illegitimate son of a maid, and grew up with grandparents. He assumed the name of his stepfather in 1892. He became a member of the SPD in 1897. In 1919, he became Under-Secretary of State in the Prussian War Ministry. He declined the position as Reichswehr Minister (Defense) in 1920. From 1922 to 1924, he was President of the Prussian Police, and from 1925 to 1926, he was President of the Berlin Police. His tenure as Minister of the Interior was marked by his efforts to promote democracy, and by the political violence in Germany at the time, especially the violence committed by the communists and hostility between the communists and the social democrats. In 1929, he banned the Rotfrontk√§mpferbund (Red Front Fighter's League) in Prussia. In May 1929 he was involved in the violent police suppression of illegal open-air communist rallies in Berlin meant to celebrate May Day, which led to several days of rioting known as Blutmai. Over 30 civilians would be killed and over a thousand arrested, leading to widespread criticism over the government response. He resigned on February 28, 1930, for personal reasons. From 1930 to 1932, he was again Police President. In 1931, as Berlin's Police President, he tried to gag Hitler, ordering him deported as an undesirable alien, but Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning did not sign the order.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794164,00.html#ixzz0b9r5kBIw He was removed from his position following the 1932 Preu√üenschlag (Prussian Coup), when he was succeeded by the former Police President of Essen, Kurt Melcher.

By comparing fragile boys who later succeed, with high achieving women who opt out, Pinker turns several assumptions upside down: that the sexes are biologically equivalent, that smarts are all it takes to succeed and that men and women have identical interests and goals. After decades of women's educational coups and rising through the ranks, men still outnumber women in business, physical science, law, engineering, and politics. In explaining this ratio, Pinker's stance is that discrimination plays just a bit part. If the majority of children with school and behavioral problems are boys, then why do so many overcome early obstacles, while rafts of high achieving women choose jobs that pay less or opt out at pivotal moments in their careers?

A member of the liberal Deutsche Demokratische Partei, Wei√ü was known as a key player in the political tensions during the Weimar Republic and a staunch defender of parliamentary democracy against extremists on the left and right.  Early life  Born in Berlin, German Empire into a prominent, liberal Jewish family, Bernhard Weiss earned a doctorate of law after studying law at the University of Berlin, the University of Munich, the University of Freiburg im Breisgau and the University of W√ºrzburg. In 1904 Bernhard Weiss volunteered to undergo military training and was commissioned as a reserve officer in the Royal Bavarian Army, since as a Jew he was not accepted in the Prussian army. During the First World War he was promoted to the rank of captain (Rittmeister). Weiss was the officer in charge of a medical company and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for his services. His three brothers and a cousin also fought in the war. One was killed and another seriously injured. Active in the Jewish community of Berlin, Weiss was a board member of the (reform) rabbinical seminary and a member of the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens (Central Union of German Citizens of Jewish Belief), the organization dedicated to protecting the civil and social rights of Jews in Germany while at the same time cultivating their German identity. Weiss made a name for himself as an exceptionally efficient lawyer and judge before being the first Jew to enter the civil service of pre-Weimar Germany. Deputy Chief of the Berlin Criminal Police In 1918 Weiss was appointed Deputy Chief of the Berlin Criminal Police, the Kripo, and became its head in 1925. In 1920 he was made head of the Political Police and was appointed Vice President of the entire Berlin police force in 1927. Weiss was a member of the liberal Deutsche Demokratische Partei (German Democratic Party). He played a central role during the political tension in the Weimar Republic, and was a fierce defender of the democratic republic against right-wing and left-wing extremists. The constitutional Weimar Republic was for Germany a radical change from the previous authoritarian regime. From the outset the Weimar republic was attacked from both extremes of the political spectrum. Weiss devoted himself to making the Kripo an institution which would defend parliamentary democracy. He was responsible for producing evidence of the subversive activities of the Russian trade delegation in Berlin. Walter Rathenau, the Jewish industrialist and politician who served Weimar governments in several capacities including that of Foreign Minister was assassinated in 1922, two months after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo. Weiss was closely involved in the successful hunt for Rathenau's murderers. He was always concerned with the struggles against both the communists and the brownshirts and ordered the confiscation of weapons found at their meetings. In 1927 Weiss ordered the shutting down of the Berlin branch of the Nazi party and in the same year had 500 of their members arrested for belonging to an illegal organization when they returned from a rally in Nuremberg. Confrontations with Joseph Goebbels While in office, Weiss was the target of a constant campaign of vilification organized by Joseph Goebbels, then a prominent Nazi activist, later the Reich Minister of Propaganda. Goebbels nicknamed Weiss ‚ÄúIsidore‚Äù and the Weimar Republic as ‚ÄúThe Jew's Republic‚Äù. Weiss sued Goebbels for libel and won his case. Goebbels did not refrain and Weiss was not intimidated so in the end Weiss sued Goebbels over 40 times. On several occasions Weiss also prevented Goebbels from speaking at Nazi meetings. Dr Wilhelm Arnold Drews, former Prussian Minister of the Interior, who appointed Weiss said in 1932 towards the end of Weiss' career: ‚Äúwhen we decided to appoint for the Home Service a Jew who was not baptized, we knew that the first had to be the best. It was you I chose and I am glad to say that you lived up to our expectations.‚Äù Franz von Papen, Chancellor of Germany in 1932 and Vice-Chancellor when Adolf Hitler came to power, had both Weiss and his superior arrested, albeit for one day only. Weiss's Escape to the United Kingdom Weiss finally decided to flee Germany just a few days before Adolf Hitler was made Chancellor. Weiss's police force was ordered to arrest their former Deputy Chief and Hermann G√∂ring offered to pay a reward for anyone who assisted in his capture. The forces came looking for Weiss while he and his daughter Hilda were at his brothers/sisters. They had to bury Weiss in the basement under the coal stack to prevent the forces from discovering him, they attempted to take Hilda but her Uncle and Aunty claimed she was their daughter and the forces left. A friend came to Weiss's assistance and drove him out of the country to Czechoslovakia. Weiss then went to the United Kingdom where he opened a printing and stationery business and lived out the remainder of his life. After his escape, Weiss was subsequently deprived of his German citizenship. In 1951, shortly before becoming a German citizen again, he died of cancer in London. Weiss's widow, Lotte Weiss (n√©e Buss), returned to live in Berlin immediately after her husband's death. She died in Berlin in 1952. After His Death \\"He was a man of extremes, a Jew imbibing Prussian values, small in stature, large in responsible behaviour and a staunch democrat,‚Äù wrote Uwe Dannenbaum in an article in the German newspaper Die Welt to mark the naming of the forecourt of the Friedrichstrasse railway station in Berlin in honour of the former police chief. The film \\"The Man who chased Goebbels\\" (2005) by Reiner Mathias Brueckner portrays Weiss as a resolute defender of the republican order. In 2007, the German Federation of Jewish soldiers established an award in his honour, the Bernhard Weiss Medal (Bernhard-Wei√ü-Medaille), to be awarded to fellow Germans who work for understanding and tolerance. The forecourt at the Friedrichstrasse station in Berlin and the Alexanderplatzstrasse in central Berlin were named after Bernhard Weiss. A plaque has been erected outside the Berlin house where he lived. The name of Dr. Weiss is clearly associated with the history of the unfortunate and short-lived Weimar Republic. He played a central role in the political tensions associated the Republic and was a fierce defender of the democratic republic against right-wing and left-wing extremists. He was very much in the forefront of efforts to preserve democracy in Germany. Weiss is Bernie Gunther's boss in many of the detective stories written by Philip Kerr.

Creed  Darul Islam is otherwise known as Darul Salam, which means \\"land of peace\\". The organization upholds doctrines that are not in line with the general beliefs of the majority of Muslims in Nigeria. First, the members of the organization believe that human society, and more specifically Nigerian society, has been corrupted by indecencies and licentiousness. This corruption militates against the practice of Islam; hence, it is necessary to migrate to the \\"land of Islam\\" or \\"land of peace\\" where Islam will be devotedly practiced. Second, Darul Islam's doctrine is that all Muslims are infidels until they profess the word of testimony, i.e. there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger. This means that, for a Muslim, imitating the parents or being born as a Muslim does not suffice. Professing the testimony is considered as a prerequisite to migrate to \\"Darul Islam\\" along with a pledge (Bai'ah) to the leader. Those who make the pledge and subsequently violate or revolt against it and denounce the organization, is considered to have become a repudiator of his faith.

In 1859, abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory, the second armory built in the U.S. Brown had intended to use the bell to alert slaves in the surrounding countryside that the revolt had begun. The raid ended when Marines under the command of Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee stormed the building. Brown and 10 of his men were later hanged for murder and treason. Two years later, with the Civil War beginning, a Marlborough unit in the Union Army took the bell from the Harpers Ferry Armory after being ordered to seize anything of value to the U.S. government to prevent it from falling into the hands of Lee's Confederate army. Knowing their hook and ladder company in Marlborough needed a bell, the soldiers removed the device and got permission from the War Department to keep it. Controversy over ownership Over the years, citizens of Harpers Ferry have tried in vain to have the bell returned to be exhibited in the John Brown Wax Museum or the reconstructed firehouse where John Brown was captured by Col. Robert E. Lee. \\"In the past, several mayors have tried to have it returned, but basically it's difficult to do. I suppose it requires a lot of energy that, frankly, no one has,\\" James A. Addy, mayor of the Appalachian town of 310 that is about from Washington, D.C., said. \\"I believe the bell is wired with an alarm, so it can't be surreptitiously taken, like at night.\\" \\"Oh, they've wanted it back,\\" said Joan Abshire, a member of the Marlborough Historical Society who recently finished a comprehensive study of the bell. \\"When I went down there (for research), they always said, 'Well, where's the bell?\\" The men from Marlborough saved it from obliteration, claimed Gary Brown, chairman of the city's Historical Commission, \\"Had they not taken the bell, it wouldn't exist. Virtually every bell in the South was melted down for munitions.\\" References Further reading * The John Brown Bell: The journey of the second-most important bell in American history, from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, to Marlborough, Massachusetts by Joan Abshire and available through the Marlborough Historical Society.

Limited numbers of these trees are cultivated in gardens for their small fruits, known as maqui berries. Most of the fruits commercially marketed come from the wild. Description Tree Aristotelia chilensis is a small dioecious evergreen tree that can reach in height. Its divided trunk has a smooth bark. Its branches are abundant, thin and flexible. Its leaves are simple, opposite, hanging, oval-lanceolate, naked and coriaceous, with serrated edges. The leaf venation is highly visible, and the leaf stalk is a strong red color. In the beginning of spring, the tree sheds the old cohort, which is used as a carbohydrate source to form the new leaves and flowers.Prado, C. & Damascos, M. (2001).

Stuntz (Eleocarpaceae) fifteen days before the flowering and the fall of the old cohort. Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology, 44(3), 277-282. 150x150px Flowers and berries When A. chilensis flowers at the end of spring, the white flowers are unisexual and small, but they eventually yield a small edible fruit. The small purple-black berries that form are approximately in diameter and contain 4 to 8 angled seeds. A seven-year-old tree can produce up to of berries per year. With fruit that tastes similar to blackberries, the species is known as the Chilean wineberry, and locally in Spanish as maqui or maque. Distribution Aristotelia chilensis is native to Chile and Argentina near the southwest coast of South America. It is found naturally in Chilean rainforests. Its native area includes the Coquimbo and Ays√©n regions of Chile, and is in total. Ecology Maqui berries are a favored food for birds at the end of summer. Deforestation of the Valdivian temperate rainforests in Chile suppresses seed dispersal by birds and leads to inbreeding depression.Valdivia, C. & Simonetti, J. (2006). Decreased frugivory and seed germination rate do not reduce seedling recruitment rates of Aristotelia chilensis in a fragmented forest. Biodiversity and Conservation, 16(6), 1593-1602. Harvesting and cultivation The berries of A. chilensis are collected from wild plants from December to March of each year by families, mainly Mapuche, who collect their harvest near the Andes Mountains. The harvesting process involves collecting the side branches of trees, shaking them to separate the berries and leaves from the branches, and then employing a mechanical process to separate the berries from the leaves. The stored fruits are sold in local markets, with prices ranging from . The average area yield is about per hectare annually, with an estimated yearly total of only , due to remote access and difficulty for transportation. Aristotelia chilensis is planted in home gardens and is not grown on an orchard scale. Most of the fruits on the market come from the wild. Maqui is frost sensitive and fairly tolerant of maritime exposure. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun, but with some protection against cold, drying winds. The soil should be slightly acidic with moderate fertility.Huxley, A. (1992). The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Aristotelia chilensis can be planted in USDA zones 8 to 12. It is cultivated in Spain, and in milder, moister areas of Britain, where winter frosts reduce plant stock, thereby stimulating growth of more shoots in spring.Grey-Wilson, C., & Matthews, V. (1983). Gardening on Walls. London. Propagation Seeds of A. chilensis germinate without cold stratification. In zones with the possibility of frost, it is recommended to sow in spring in a greenhouse. If they have grown enough, by autumn, the new plants can be planted into individual pots . The potted plants should stay in the greenhouse for the first winter. The following year, after the last expected frost in spring, the plants can be planted out into their final positions. In their first winter outdoors, some type of frost protection is required.Bean W. 1981. Trees and Shrubs Hardy in Great Britain. Vol 1 - 4 and Supplement. For further propagation, vegetal reproduction is possible: cuttings of wood with a length of can be planted into pots. These cuttings normally root, and can be planted out in the following spring.Chittenden, F. (1951) RHS Dictionary of Plants plus Supplement. Oxford University Press. Anthocyanin content Only limited polyphenol research has been completed on the maqui berry, which showed its anthocyanin content to include eight glucoside pigments of delphinidin and cyanidin, with the principal anthocyanin being delphinidin 3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (34% of total anthocyanins). The average total anthocyanin content was per of fresh fruit, or per of dry fruit, ranking maqui berries low among darkly pigmented fruits for anthocyanin content (see table at anthocyanins). One study found that anthocyanins are also present in maqui leaves.

Vincent Laurensz van der Vinne (1628‚Äì1702) was a Dutch Mennonite painter, linen- weaver, and writer.  Biography  Van der Vinne was born, lived and worked in Haarlem and was a student of Frans Hals for nine months in 1647.Vincent Laurensz. van der Vinne (I) in the RKD In 1649 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. In 1652 he left on a Grand Tour through Germany, Switzerland and France. For part of the trip he was accompanied by fellow painters Dirck Helmbreker, Cornelis Bega, Joost Boelen, and Guillam Dubois. This trip was recorded in Vincent van der Vinne's diaries and form an important archival record for the city of Haarlem. Grand tour The purpose of a grand tour in those days was Italy, but van der Vinne never made it there. Since Karel van Mander published his Schilder-boeck in Haarlem in 1604, most young Haarlem painters wanted to see the Italian paintings in real life, and it became a common rite of passage, but not without dangers. Van der Vinne endured many hardships on his journey, including being kidnapped for a short period. He even stopped making sketches of the countryside at one point, because he feared to be mistaken for a military surveyor. Judging from a map of his travels, he seemed daunted by the Alps, skirting them for weeks but never making the crossing, despite what appears to be 3 attempts to cross over to Turin. He nevertheless makes no mention of this in his diaries, and seems to feel that his sole purpose all along was to explore Germany and Switzerland. He became embroiled in the Swiss peasant war of 1653. On 10 May, Van der Vinne and his companions Boelen and Bega left Basel for Bern and were taken prisoner by a group of farmers. The leader of these farmers, Niklaus Leuenberger, let him and his companions go the next day. They returned to Basel and set off for Geneva, sticking as much as possible to trails on the Burgundian side of the troubles, through Vaud. This experience clearly cut off any plans of crossing the alps in the ways normally suggested by Van Mander's book, and Van der Vinne thus records an unusual journey that goes much farther west than his contemporaries from the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke were accustomed to travelling. Cornelis Bega, who spoke no French at all, returned home, but Van der Vinne and Boelen stayed in Geneva for 15 months. The next spring they traveled further south to Lyon and spent some months in Tournon. On the way back to Geneva, Boelen was molested by soldiers, having departed a few weeks before Van der Vinne. The borders were still very unsafe for travelers. Van der Vinne returned to Geneva on 12 April.  Massacre of the Waldensians  On 4 April 1655, Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano commanded the Waldensians to attend Mass or remove to the upper valleys, giving them twenty days in which to sell their lands. In the name of his father, the Duke of Savoy he sent an army and on 24 April, at 4 a.m., the signal was given for a general massacre so brutal, that it aroused indignation throughout Europe. Oliver Cromwell began petitioning on behalf of the Vaudois, and John Milton wrote his famous poem about this, \\"On the Late Massacre in Piedmont.\\" Just as Milton did, Van der Vinne expressed his own disgust and horror in a long poem, and the next month he decided to go home. Works Vanitas with a Royal Crown Though he started as a weaver working in Haarlem's famous white linen damask industry, van der Vinne quickly took to painting, and would take on any painting job no matter how small. According to Houbraken, this led to an oft- quoted comment by Job Adriaenszoon Berckheyde, who claimed that he was \\"the Raffael of sign-boards\\". When he spoke of his own work, van der Vinne often repeated the advice of his teacher Frans Hals, saying that \\"one must boldly smear the paint on; when you become confident in the art, then neatness will follow\\". What survives today from his hand are mostly still lifes and genre scenes, often with a similar arrangement of a vanitas items, and many include a trompe l'oeil portrait sketch on a paper hanging off a desk. In one of these, he has copied a crumpled drawing of himself by Leendert van der Cooghen. His style was copied by Evert Collier, Pieter van Eisen, and Barent van Eisen. Helmer J. Helmers devotes some pages to discussion of Van de Vinne's vanitas still-life paintings incorporating images of the executed Charles I of England Helmer J. Helmers.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015: pp 142-147  Family of painters  Gierstraat 50, Haarlem. A commemorative plaque reads that Vincent van der Vinne lived in this house with his first wife in 1663 and this is where their son Isaac was born in 1665. Another Vincent van der Vinne, a flower bulb merchant, lived here in 1839. He finally returned to Haarlem in 1655 and married Anneke Jansdr de Gaver in 1656, a widow with two small children. It was at this time that his portrait was painted by Frans Hals, probably as half of a pair of wedding portraits. When she died in 1668, he was left with four young children; Laurens (1658‚Äì1729), Maeijke (1659‚Äì1689), Jan (1663‚Äì1721), and Isaac (1665‚Äì1740). His sons all became successful painters. In 1668 he remarried, to Catalijntje Boeckaert, with whom he had four more children who died in infancy. In 1676 he became a member of the fire department (pompmeester). In 1677 he moved to a house in the Grote Houtstraat, where he lived until he died.Collections of Paintings in Haarlem: 1572-1745, by Pieter Biesboer (editor Carol Togneri), Getty Trust Publications, Los Angeles, 2001 In 1689 he became deacon of the Haarlem Mennonite community known as \\"de Blok\\". On 9 September 1693 he celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary, which was highly unusual. Important archive source for Haarlem guild By the time he became a widower, Van der Vinne was an established painter in Haarlem and had served on the board of the St Luke's guild in 1661 and 1662. In their archives is a list in his hand of 173 painters he considered competent. This list was edited by his son Laurens in 1702 with 157 'd's to indicate which of these artists had died before his father, and added to his Geslagt-Register, which was a description of active painters from the Haarlem guild.The list has been published in the book De archiefbescheiden van het St. Lukasgilde te Haarlem 1497-1798, by Hessel Miedema, 1980, This list was used as a source for Arnold Houbraken, who added these painters to his list. Much later Vincent's grandson Vincent Jansz. van der Vinne (1736‚Äì1811), himself a painter, used this list again to compare the names with the dates of painters who had joined the Guild of St. Luke in Haarlem.  Source for Arnold Houbraken  Van der Vinne's diaries, which he embellished on his return, were never published in his lifetime, but were used by Houbraken for his great work on Dutch painters, the Schouburg. The Vincent van der Vinne diaries, accompanied by modern commentary were published in Dutch in 1979. When Van der Vinne died he left a will of 20 pages, and among several properties, he owned paintings by Karel van Mander, Hans Gillisz. Bollongier, Pieter Claesz, Guillam Dubois, and by himself and his sons.

Deborah Kerr, a rising star, although not yet 20 years old, was given equal billing with Clifford Evans, who played Penn, but had far less screen time as the film primarily focused on Penn rather than her portrayal of his wife. The film concentrates of Penn's emblematic importance rather than simply as a historic individual, and he serves as a broader depiction of a freedom-loving Englishman.McFarlane, p. 22 The musical score was written by William Alwyn, the first time he had written for a feature film. His score is generally considered far superior to the film itself.Johnson, pp. 42-45 Made during the Second World War the film was intended in part as a propaganda effort to stir the United States out of isolationism and persuade it into joining the war on Britain's side, and was one of a series of historical films including The Prime Minister, The Young Mr. Pitt and The Great Mr. Handel which were made at the same time, as well as Thunder Rock and 49th Parallel which portrayed a similar message in a contemporary setting.Johnson, p. 42 Reception The film received universally bad reviews which criticised the lack of vitality in the historical figures who often resembled stereotypes.Capua p.15-16 When it was released in the United States the New York Times observed \\"Penn is definitely not one of England's better film efforts\\".Capua, p. 16 Evan's portrayal of Penn was generally praised for his \\"sympathetic\\" performance. Shortly afterwards, Lance Comfort directed Kerr in Hatter's Castle, which proved a major success. References Bibliography * Capua, Michelangelo. Deborah Kerr: A Biography.

The research in interoperability of enterprise practised in is various domains itself (Enterprise Modelling, Ontologies, Information systems, Architectures and Platforms) which it is a question of positioning.  Enterprise interoperability topics  Interoperability in enterprise architecture Enterprise architecture (EA) presents a high level design of enterprise capabilities that defines successful IT projects in coherence with enterprise principals and business related requirements. EA covers mainly (i) the business capabilities analysis and validation; (ii) the development of business, application, data and technical architectures and solutions, and finally (iii) the control of programme and project implementation and governance. The application of EA methodology feeds the enterprise repository reference frame with sets of building blocks used to compose the targeted system. The interoperability can be considered either as a principal, requirement or constraint that impact the definition of patterns to compose building blocks in the definition of targeted architectural roadmap. In this scope, EA within the TOGAF perspective, aims to reconcile interoperability requirements with potential solutions that make developed systems interoperable. So as to maintain the interoperability challenge quite present in the next steps of system‚Äôs lifecycle, several models and Frameworks are developed under the topic enterprise interoperability. Enterprise interoperability frameworks To preserve interoperability, several enterprise interoperability frameworks can be identified in the literature: * 2003: IDEAS: Interoperability Developments for Enterprise Application and Software. * 2004: EIF: The European Interoperability Framework * 2004: e-GIF: e-Government Interoperability Framework * 2006: FEI: The Framework for Enterprise Interoperability * 2006: C4IF: Connection, Communication, Consolidation, Collaboration Interoperability Framework * 2007: AIF: Athena Interoperability Framework * 2007: Enterprise Architecture Framework for Agile and Interoperable Virtual Enterprises The majority of these frameworks considers enterprise at several aspects, viewpoints or abstraction levels: business, process, knowledge, application, technology, data, technic, etc. and proposes guidelines to support modeling and connection capabilities between these levels. The semantic challenge is considered as transversal to all these abstraction levels. Setting up and applying guidelines and methodologies developed within these frameworks requires modeling efforts that identify and connect artifacts. Interoperability in software engineering The evolution of IT technologies aims to outsource IT capabilities to vendors to manage for use on demand. The evolution pathway starts form packaged solutions and goes through Infrastructure as a service (Iaas), Platform as a service (Paas), Software as a service (Saas) and recently the Cloud. Interoperability efforts are still mainly expected among these levels: * strategy to business * business to processes * processes to application Dealing with business process definition, alignment, collaboration and interoperability, several international standards propose methodologies and guidelines in these perspectives: * ISO 15704‚ÄîRequirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies * CEN-ISO DIS 19439‚ÄîFramework for Enterprise Modeling * CEN- ISO WD 19440‚ÄîConstructs for Enterprise Modeling * ISO 18629‚ÄîProcess specification language * ISO/IEC 15414‚ÄîODP Reference Model‚ÄîEnterprise Language In addition, recent standards (BPMN, BPEL, etc.) and their implementation technologies propose relevant integration capabilities. Furthermore, model driven-engineering provides capabilities that connect, transform and refine models to support interoperability. Metrics for interoperability maturity assessment The following approaches propose some metrics to assess the interoperability maturity, * LISI: Levels of Information Systems Interoperability * OIM: Organizational Interoperability Model * NMI: NC3TA reference Model for Interoperability * LCIM: Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model * EIMM: Enterprise Interoperability Maturity Model * Smart Grid Interoperability Maturity Model Rating System For the several interoperability aspects identified previously, the listed maturity approaches define interoperability categories (or dimensions) and propose qualitative as well as qualitative cross cutting issues to assess them. While interoperability aspects are not covered by a single maturity approach, some propositions go deeply in the definition of metric dimensions at one interoperability aspect such as the business interoperability measurement proposed by Aneesh.

Nightingale Conant. Retrieved on 14-Sep-2009 Income earned without having to work a job is commonly referred to as passive income. There are many strategies to achieve financial independence, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. To achieve financial independence, it will be helpful if you have a financial plan and budget, so you know what money is coming in and going out, have a clear view of your current incomes and expenses, and can identify and choose appropriate strategies to move towards your financial goals. A financial plan addresses every aspect of a person's finances. Passive sources of income to achieve financial independence The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of passive income that potentially yield financial independence. * Bank fixed deposits and monthly income schemes *Business ownership (if your business does not require you to operate) *Dividends from stocks, bonds and income trusts * Interest earned from deposit accounts, money market accounts or loans * Life annuity *Notes, including stocks and bonds * Oil leases *Patent licensing *Pensions *Rental property *Royalty from creative works, e.g. photographs, books, patents, music, etc. *Trust deed (real estate) # investing in transportation where you earn a given amount of money on a daily basis/weekly depending on the agreement you signed Approaches to financial independence If a person can generate enough income to meet their needs from sources other than their primary occupation, they have achieved financial independence, regardless of age, existing wealth, or current salary. For example, if a 25-year-old has $100 in expenses per month, and assets that generate $101 or more per month, they have achieved financial independence. They have no need to work a regular job to pay their bills. On the other hand, if a (for example) 50-year-old earns $1,000,000 a month but has expenses that equal more than that per month, they are not financially independent, as they still have to earn the difference each month to make all their payments. However, the effects of inflation must be considered. If a person needs $100/month for living expenses today, they will need $105/month next year and $110.25/month the following year to support the same lifestyle, assuming a 5% annual inflation rate. Therefore, if the person in the above example obtains their passive income from a perpetuity, there will be a time when they lose their financial independence because of inflation. If someone receives $5000 in dividends from stocks they own, but their expenses total $4000, they can live on their dividend income because it pays for all their expenses to live (with some left over). Under these circumstances, a person is financially independent. A person's assets and liabilities are an important factor in determining if they have achieved financial independence. An asset is anything of value that can be readily turned into cash (liquidated) if a person has to pay debt, whereas a liability is a responsibility to provide compensation. (Homes and automobiles with no liens or mortgages are common assets.) Since there are two sides to the assets and expenses equation, there are two main directions one can focus their energy: accumulating assets or reducing their expenses. Asset accumulation Accumulating assets can focus one or both of these approaches: * Gather revenue-generating assets until the generated revenue surpasses living/liability expenses. * Gather enough liquid assets to then sustain all future living/liability expenses. Expense reduction Another approach to financial independence is to reduce regular expenses while accumulating assets, to reduce the amount of assets required for financial independence. This can be done by focusing on simple living, or other strategies to reduce expenses. * Cut your fixed expenses wherever possible. (E.g., keep your internet service but discontinue cable; lower your phone plan type if you don't use all its features, etc.) See also *Mr. Money Mustache References Further reading *Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez (1992) Your Money or Your Life, Viking.

Description Comparative illustration of European badger (top), Asian badger (centre) and Japanese badger (bottom) Asian badgers are mostly lighter in colour than European badgers, though some forms may closely approach the former species in colour, if not darker, with smudges of ocherous and brownish highlights. The flanks are lighter than the middle of the back, and the facial stripes are usually brown rather than black. Unlike the facial stripes of European badgers, those of Asian badgers narrow behind their eyes and extend above the ears. The white parts of the head are usually dirtier in colour than those of European badgers. The light stripe passing along the top of the head between the two stripes is relatively short and narrow. They are generally smaller than their European cousins, and have relatively longer upper molars. They indeed appear to be the smallest of the three Meles badgers despite regional size variations, with the largest-bodied populations of the species found in Siberia where some populations are about the same size as the European badger.

The ranges of Asian and European badgers are separated in places by the Volga River. Asian badgers prefer open deciduous woodland and adjacent pastureland, but also inhabit coniferous and mixed woodlands, scrub and steppe. They are sometimes found in suburban areas. Hunting Asian badgers are legally hunted in China, Russia and Mongolia, as well as illegally within protected areas in China. Russia's established badger hunting season usually takes place from August to November.

Hazard was one of the pioneers in the field of Sovietology, particularly in Soviet law, administration and politics. Early life John Newbold Hazard was born in Syracuse, N.Y., Jan. 5, 1909. He earned the A.B. from Yale in 1930, the LL.B. from Harvard in 1934 and the J.S.D. (Doctor of Juristic Science) from the University of Chicago in 1939. His career as an American Sovietologist began shortly after the United States recognized the government of the USSR in 1933. Career Upon his graduation from Harvard Law School in 1934, he was sent by the Institute of Current World Affairs as the first American to study Soviet law at the Moscow Juridical Institute, later the Institute of State and Law. Only a handful of scholars were concerned with Russian diplomacy and business then, and scholarship on Russia was limited principally to historical studies. He approached the field of Soviet law as a pioneer and received the certificate of the Juridical Institute in 1937. Soviet desk When World War II broke out, Hazard joined the U.S. government and was assigned to the Soviet desk in the Division of Defense Aid Reports. He helped negotiate the conditions under which the Soviet Union joined the Lend-Lease program as its major recipient. He became deputy director of the Soviet branch of the Lend-Lease Administration, through which the United States furnished food, machinery and services to its allies. As an expert on the USSR, Hazard accompanied Vice President Henry Wallace on his secret mission to China in May, 1944. The following year he was chosen as an expert on Soviet law to assist Justice Robert Jackson in preparing the prosecution of Nazi leaders to be brought before an international tribunal for war crimes. Columbia University With his return to civilian life in 1946, he joined the Columbia faculty. Along with four other scholars, Hazard was a founder of the Russian Institute at Columbia University, now the Harriman Institute, the first academic center in America dedicated to Russian- Soviet studies. He also was a founder of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, the first American professional organization in the field. He was appointed professor of public law at the same time, beginning a teaching career that spanned two generations. He became the Nash Professor of Law in the Columbia Law School, received emeritus status in 1977 and continued to teach each semester until 1994. He was associated with the Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law at Columbia and helped shape its programs in Russian and East European law. He was the editor in chief of the Parker School Journal of East European Law, the leading journal in the field. The John N. Hazard Memorial Fellowship at Columbia's Harriman Institute exists to fund scholars researching Soviet and Russian law. John N. Hazard was the mentor of famous Sovietologist Harold J. Berman. Scholarship Hazard's books cover both political science and law. His textbook, The Soviet System of Government, first published by University of Chicago Press in 1957, has been republished in five editions and several languages. Other books include Soviet Housing Law (1939), Law and Social Change in the USSR (1953), Settling Disputes in Soviet Society (1960), The Soviet System of Government (1957), Communists and Their Law (1969), Managing Change in the USSR (1983), and Recollections of a Pioneer Sovietologist (1983).One of his last published works was: Many of his volumes are still in wide use in comparative law courses.

Lovestone became its executive secretary. Its mission was to assist trade unions in foreign countries, especially to help them remain independent of Communist influence.Morgan 144 Its original funding was one million dollars.Parmet, 203 The organization backed \\"free unions founded on collective bargaining in an open marketplace, and opposition to state-run unions on the Soviet model.\\"Morgan 151 The leadership of the AFL anticipated that Communists in each European country would have the backing of the Russian state and its propaganda in their efforts to dominate each nation's labor movement. The Americans thought Eastern Europe was probably lost to their movement, but many others needed their assistance, including Greece, Italy, and Turkey. Non- communist but statist regimes like Spain and later Argentina presented opportunities as well.Morgan 153-4 Initially their organizational counterpart was the World Federation of Trade Unions, which the AFL's rival, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), joined and which, it later transpired, the Soviets financed.Morgan, 152-3 The FTUC helped rebuild the shattered trade union movement in Europe and Japan. It sent food packages to destitute labor activists and union leaders. In addition to relief activities, it financed a trade school in Palermo.Merle Curti, American Philanthropy Abroad (Rutgers, 1998), 509 The FTUC helped fund the Force Ouvri√®re in France in opposition to the Communist-controlled labor confederation in 1948.Parmet, 230-1 David Dubinsky claimed in his memoirs that the FTUC resisted attempts by the CIA to control its operations, but the CIA's role was substantial. The CIA channeled funds to the FTUC for 20 years, beginning with efforts to influence the Italian elections in 1948. Even in meetings with their CIA counterparts, FTUC officials inflated their budgets to minimize the CIA's relative contribution. Dubinsky had misgivings throughout and the FTUC managed to maintain a certain independence and fought for less CIA control over their activities.Parmet, 235-6 See also *American Institute for Free Labor Development *American Center for International Labor Solidarity *Carmel Offie *International Confederation of Free Trade Unions Notes Sources *Anthony Carew, \\"The American Labor Movement in Fizzland: The Free Trade Union Committee and the CIA\\" in Labor History, February 1998 *Ted Morgan, A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone, Communist, Anti-communist, and Spymaster (NY: Random House, 1999) *Robert D.

He was forced to join the Royal Marines due to family hardship, and served as a junior officer during the American Revolutionary War. He was wounded in 1780 at the Battle of Martinique, and retired from the service in 1783; after living in financial difficulties for some years, he published two moderately successful novels in the 1780s, the second of which drew extensively on his experiences as a half-pay officer. He was recruited as a pro-government journalist and pamphleteer in 1788, and placed on a salary the following year. He became the founder and sole editor of two pro-government daily newspapers, the Sun and the True Briton, which ran for over a decade, and eventually retired from journalistic work in 1806. He was appointed to a number of government posts, most significantly the comptrollership of Chelsea Hospital, the post he held at his death. He was a distant relative of the philanthropist George Heriot, and the younger brother of the Scots-Canadian artist George Heriot. Early life Heriot was born at Haddington in 1760,Davis, 2008. the second son of John Heriot, the sheriff clerk of the town, and his wife Marjory; his older brother was George Heriot, later to become a prominent artist.Finley, 2000. The Heriots were part of the long- established family of the Heriots of Trabroun, the most well-known member of which was the seventeenth-century goldsmith and philanthropist George Heriot.LaBr√®que, 2000, notes the familial background in reference to his cousin. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1772, where Heriot attended the Edinburgh Royal High School;Davis, 2008. he had previously been educated at the Coldstream grammar schoolAnnual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 41 He studied at the University of Edinburgh after leaving the high school, but the collapse of his father's business in 1777 meant that he had to leave and seek employment.Davis, 2008. He lived for three months with an uncle in Forres, where a member of the local gentry attempted to procure him a commission from the Duke of Dorset. This was unsuccessful, but it had the effect of directing Heriot towards a military career. Late in 1778, having failed to obtain a commission in Scotland, he travelled to London, where he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Royal Marines in November 1778.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 42. The date is from Davis, 2008. He quickly arranged for sea duty - as the living expense of a shore posting was substantially more expensive to maintain - and was posted to HMS Vengeance, commanded by Captain Frederick Maitland. He served off the west coast of Africa and in the West Indies; when Captain Maitland left the Vengeance to take up command of HMS Elizabeth, Heriot was posted to HMS Preston. The Preston was an elderly fourth-rate ship, and Heriot quickly arranged to be transferred into the Elizabeth under Maitland. He first saw active fighting aboard the Elizabeth, in an attack on a convoy on 19 December 1779, and again at the Battle of Martinique on 16 April 1780, where he was wounded. He transferred to HMS Brune in July, commanded by Francis Hartwell, and was aboard her during the Great Hurricane in October 1780. He was appointed a first lieutenant of marines in August 1781, after the Brune had been paid off, and was later posted to HMS Salisbury and HMS Alexander, before being put on half-pay at the cessation of hostilities in 1783.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, pp. 43-4. Writing career Heriot, now living in London, had mortgaged his pay to help support his parents, and was without any source of income. In an attempt to support himself, he wrote two novels - The Sorrows of the Heart (1787), and The Half- Pay Officer (1789), the latter of which was semi-autobiographical. These raised enough to support him for two years, during which time he married Alison Shiriff, with whom he would have two daughters.Davis, 2008. He was hired as one of a number of journalists who wrote pamphlets and newspaper articles in support of the government during the winter of 1788-89, when George III's insanity had become a matter of very contentious debate.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, pp. 44-5. After the insanity crisis had passed, he was put on a permanent salary to continue this work; by 1791, he was drawing an annual salary of ¬£200.Davis, 2008. He was briefly involved with the Sierra Leone Company in 1791, but resigned the office of secretary shortly thereafter.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 45. He worked for the Oracle and the World newspapers in 1791, editing both, but did not remain in either post for long. In 1792, at the instigation of Edmund Burke, he was recruited by the Treasury to establish a pro-government newspaper, the Sun. This was secretly funded by members of the government, on a private basis; Heriot launched it on 1 October 1792,Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 49. and it quickly rose to become the second most popular newspaper in the country, behind The Times.Davis, 2008. He then launched the True Briton, a morning daily, on 1 January 1793;Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 49. it, too, was funded by the Treasury and maintained a strongly pro-government pro-Tory line.Barrell, p. 138 The True Briton would continue for eleven years before collapsing,Davis, 2008. whilst the Sun survived until Heriot retired in 1806.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 49. He continued to write during this period, including a history of Gibraltar (1792) to accompany a work by the artist Antonio de Poggi, and an account of the Battle of the Nile (1798).Davis, 2008. He was closely connected with the governing circles of the day, and through his personal connections with Pitt the Younger was able to secure two important government posts for his brother George in Upper Canada.Finley, 2000. He left newspaper work in 1806 and became a commissioner for the lottery; in 1810 he was made an Army deputy paymaster-general in the West Indies; and in 1816 the comptroller of Chelsea Hospital.Davis, 2008. He died in 1833, of \\"sudden paralysis\\", three days after his wife.Annual biography and obituary, 1834, p. 49.

The screenplay concerns criminals who try to scare a new chief lighthouse keeper on the Welsh coast, in an attempt to distract him from their scheme. Plot Sam Higgins alights at the train station for the Welsh village of Tan-Y-Bwlch to take over the North Stack lighthouse, which is believed by the locals to be haunted. There, he meets Alice Bright. She asks him to take her along to the lighthouse, explaining that she belongs to a \\"psychic society\\" and wants to investigate the \\"legend of the phantom lighthouse\\". He turns her down. Sam reports to Harbour Master David Owen, who informs him that Jack Davis, Sam's predecessor, \\"just disappeared\\", as did the chief lighthouse keeper before him. Owen confirms there was a major shipwreck a year ago, caused, so he believes, by the phantom light. Jim Pearce tries to bribe Sam to take him to the lighthouse; Sam guesses he is a reporter. Alice later overhears Jim ask about hiring a boat, so she tries her charms on him, but again fails. When Owen, Dr. Carey and others take Sam by boat to the lighthouse, Carey examines Tom Evans, a mentally disturbed member of the resident staff. Evans tries to strangle the doctor, who decides he cannot be moved in his present state, to Sam's discomfort. Just to be safe, Sam ties Tom up. Sam's remaining assistants are Claff Owen (David's brother and Tom's uncle) and Bob Peters. Then Jim shows up in a boat that is conveniently out of petrol. To Jim's surprise, he has a stowaway: Alice. Sam starts questioning his unwanted guests. Alice now tells him she is \\"an actress hiding from the police\\" because two admirers fought over her with knives. Strange things start occurring. First a fire breaks out near Tom's bed. Then, Sam overhears Jim plotting something with Alice and admitting he is not a reporter. He fears they may be communist saboteurs. Jim has Alice hang a radio aerial out the window of the bunk room, but Tom (whom Claff has untied) sees her do it and sneaks up behind her. He hears Jim returning, so he hastily retreats to his bunk. When Sam shows up, Jim tells him he is a naval officer after wreckers out to sink the Mary Fern for the insurance, most of the shares being held by the locals. Then Alice informs him that she is a detective from Scotland Yard. Jim starts to transmit a warning to the approaching ship, but Bob and Claff are rendered unconscious, the light is sabotaged, and a decoy light is turned on. After Jim sends Alice to fetch Sam, Tom knocks Jim out and disables his radio. When Alice and Sam return, Tom locks them all in. Jim, however, climbs down the side of the lighthouse and swims to the village to alert the coast guard. Claff wakes up and unlocks the door, allowing Sam to set about repairing the light. They overhear Carey talking to Tom and learn that the doctor is the mastermind. The Mary Fern is saved just in time. Then, trapped at the top of the lighthouse, Carey decides to jump.

The station mistress was based on Bessie Jones, who lived in the station house with her husband at the time and who was famous for dressing up in authentic Welsh costume. However the character portrayed in the film bore little resemblance to Bessie Jones in real life. Reception Writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene described the film as \\"an exciting, simple story\\" and compared its plot to that of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson's poem Flannan Isle. Specific praise was given to actors Harker (for a \\"sure-fire Cockney performance\\") and Calthrop (whom Greene favourably compared to Charles Laughton).

The screenplay concerns a cashiered Royal Naval officer and a young woman who join forces to solve a murder and hunt down a German spy ring. The film features a single song sung by Phyllis Stanley, \\"Toddle Along\\" (Ben Frankel, Moira Heath). It was shot at Teddington Studios in London. The film's sets were designed by the art director Norman G. Arnold. Plot Commander Heritage DSO is dismissed from the Royal Navy during the Second World War after being found guilty of losing some top secret documents. He revisits his places of the previous few days - mainly involving a string of women. He starts with Mary, a manicurist, in Blackpool. They originally meet in the Hotel Monopole. She has something to impart but then arranges to reconvene in the Bell & Dragon public house outside town.She‚Äôs not there and he is sent to a remote cottage up the road. Meanwhile a young Canadian woman, Miss Verity, arrives at the cottage and finds Mary dead, clutching a note with the words \\"Child's Theatrical Agency\\". She barricades the door when Heritage knocks and he leaves. She has seen his face and, when he comes back the next day, she takes the bus to Blackpool and reports the murder to the police. Hermitage follows her to the police station. They return to the station with the police, but the body is missing. The police threaten to charge Miss Verity with filing a false police report. Both head to Child's Theatrical Agency in London and from there to the BBC. Heritage brings a different woman, a sophisticated singer, who is coming for an audition. He then wanders off, looking for something. The Canadian woman follows him. On the train north to Liverpool - where Child has a dance academy - she doesn‚Äôt realise she is being interrogated by enemy agents. The female agent tries to have her shot in the dark as they go through a tunnel but manages to steal Miss Verity‚Äôs handbag. Heritage rescues her at the barrier when she tries to leave without a ticket. Meanwhile, Child and his hypnotist - the Great Riccardo - also arrive in Liverpool and hypnotise a Royal Navy officer (Petty Officer Grant) into giving away some secret plans regarding HMS Dandelion, commanded by Lippinscott. They want to hypnotise Miss Verity to see what she knows. In a bar, Heritage's former batman Mansel starts a fight to cause a diversion. Heritage then rescues Miss Verity from the hypnotist. In the bar Carter sends a woman (Bobby) to chat with Commander Lippinscott. As they sit, the harmonica player sends a coded message (hidden in the notes of the music). Lippinscott and Heritage eventually get together and it appears both are pawns in a bigger game to trap the traitors. In the morning Bobby leaves in a car with Lippinscott, The spies go into their hotel bedroom. Miss Verity tails one of the spies to the countryside by hiding in the back of his car. She in turn is trailed by Mansel and the police. Here the Great Riccardo is trying to dispose of the body of the manicurist disguised as a scarecrow by burning and burying it. Back in the hotel, experts in disguise decode the musical notation played by the harmonica player proving the sinister plot. Carter and Dr Benson then do a magic act. They pickpocket the message from Lippinscott during the act but do not realise the message in his pocket is blank. Heritage gets on stage as a volunteer and exposes the whole scam,explaining that the room is surrounded by police. Heritage and Miss Verity kiss and she is at a loss what to say further.

In the tintinnids, the lorica is frequently transparent and is used as domicile. Halofolliculina corallasia has a lorica that is attached as an outer structure, and into which it retracts when disturbed.

The race was held in the Aut√≥dromo Juan y √ìscar G√°lvez in Buenos Aires.  Report  The driver pairing formed by Norberto Fontana- Ricardo Mauricio (Toyota Corolla-TTA) won the sixth edition of the ‚ÄúBuenos Aires 200 Kilometres‚Äù, which took place today at the Aut√≥dromo Oscar y Juan G√°lvez, in the city of Buenos Aires. Runners-up were Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez-Anthony Reid (Honda New Civic-Equipo Petrobras) and third were Christian Ledesma-Jos√© Ciantini (Chevrolet Vectra-Chevrolet Elaion). The circuit was damp when the race began, and there was bright sunshine by the time it ended, which meant that the teams had to change the type of tyres their cars were using. An additional ingredient for this classic event. Having dominated proceedings during the entire weekend, Fontana and Mauricio had no trouble whatsoever in claiming victory in front of the 45,000 spectators which were present for the sixth edition of the race, making the most of the fantastic Toyota Corolla and using good pit strategy which allowed them to keep ahead at all times. Once again, the Buenos Aires 200 Kilometres did not allow any of the drivers to repeat victory and a new driver pairing lifted the cup, the same as Toyota, which thus won this race in Buenos Aires for the first time. ‚ÄúWe did a great job and formed an excellent team. We finally achieved this win. All the team worked very well and Diego Bruna did his job impeccably. This race I will always remember, because of what it means to win in Buenos Aires, because of my nephew who won the Formula Renault 1.6 (Ricardo Trosset) race. Everything turned as we had planned it. This is a perfect dream,‚Äù said an emotional Fontana during the press conference. Fontana drove the first stint and began edging away from Mat√≠as Rossi‚Äôs Renault M√©gane II (Renault Lo Jack Team), aboard a Corolla which adapted very well to the damp track, due to the great performance of the car during pre-event testing at the ‚ÄúOscar Cabal√©n‚Äù circuit in C√≥rdoba, which led to the Japanese product being very quick through the fast swerves of the circuit variant No. 12. As the laps passed by, Fontana dominated at ease, while the track gradually dried out and this meant the teams had to change their strategies during the event, as all cars had started with wet tyres and the tyre compound began wearing out on the drying track. The unexpected also happened in the fact that the safety car was deployed on lap six due to the stranded VW Bora of Gustavo Der Ohanessian. With the cars again bunched up, it looked as of Rossi might challenge Fontana for the lead, but the aspirations of Rossi did not get him anywhere, as Fontana once again eked out a gap. Behind them came Fabi√°n Yannatuoni (DTA) who was doing a great job in third place, ahead of Mart√≠n Basso (YPF-Ford) and Cac√° Bueno (Equipo Petrobras), while Scotland‚Äôs Anthony Reid fell to ninth place. When lap 15 arrived, the pitstops for driver changes, and due to the drying track, tyre changes, began. This changed everyone‚Äôs plans, as the mechanics concentrated on changing the tyres, while the drivers had to do their changes unassisted. In this aspect, the Toyota pitwork was very good and Mauricio was able to quickly reclaim the lead which Fontana had worked so hard to maintain. ‚ÄúWe claimed a very important win and this was on the basis of continuous work from all the team, which did a great job during the pre-event tests and throughout these last three years during which I was invited to compete in this race,‚Äù said Brazil‚Äôs Mauricio. Behind the leader, his countryman Camilo (Renault Lo Jack team) was trying to defend second place, having to fend off Lionel Ugalde (Ford-YPF) who had taken over the Ford Focus from Mart√≠n Basso and Pechito L√≥pez (Equipo Petrobras), who was already at the wheel of the Honda New Civic which Reid had previously driven. L√≥pez overtook Ugalde and on that same lap went in pursuit of the Renault, alongside which he did one of the race‚Äôs most outstanding manoeuvres, these two cars going side-by-side throughout the Curv√≥n Salotto, the back straight and the Ascari Chicane, prior to the cars rubbing sides and losing time. Camilo fell back at that moment, down to fifth place, while L√≥pez recovered and claimed the runner-up spot after having overtaken Ugalde. ‚ÄúWe changed some things in the car, which were very risky, but things turned out well and that allowed me to close in on the leader. For me, this is like a victory, if we think in the championship. I‚Äôm very grateful to Anthony who at his age continues giving us one hundred and fifty percent; he sometimes seems to be younger than me,‚Äù said L√≥pez. On his part, Reid stated: ‚ÄúMy start was not so good due to the car‚Äôs balance. As the track dried, the car went better. The driver change at the pits was fantastic.‚Äù Ledesma and Ciantini did an outstanding job, reaching the podium after starting from 11th on the grid with the Chevrolet Vectra of the Chevrolet Ealion team, thanks to a strategy decided at the last moment, when Ciantini drove the first stint. ‚ÄúWe practised the strategy with me doing the first stint, but last night I woke up and began thinking that we needed to change it; I had a feeling.

Based on the 1967 novel Endless Night by Agatha Christie, the plot follows a newlywed couple who feel threatened after building their dream home on cursed land. Plot Michael Rogers is a wistful and aimless young aspiring photographer working as a chauffeur and living with his mother in London. Though from a working class background, Michael aspires to a life of luxury, and is obsessed with the fine arts. Through his travels as a chauffeur, he discovers a spot along the Devon coast known as Gypsy's Acre, where a dilapidated Victorian mansion sits. Michael fantasizes about one day building a new home on the plot of land, and aims to one day have Santonix, a famed Italian architect whom he met through a client, design the home. While photographing Gypsy's Acre, Michael meets Ellie Thomsen, a young American visiting England, who is quickly taken by Michael's fantastical nature. While exploring the property, the two encounter Miss Townsend, a mysterious old woman who tells Michael that Gypsy's Acre is for sale, but that it is cursed land. Ellie leaves England and embarks on the remainder of her trip through Switzerland and Italy with Greta, her German language tutor who has taken on the role of a personal assistant. In Ellie's absence, Michael learns that she is in fact an exorbitantly wealthy heiress, and one of the richest young women in the world. He confronts her about this when she returns to England, but she explains she did not want to tell him as she thought it would dissuade him from pursuing her. She also reveals that, while visiting Italy, she was able to arrange a meeting with Santonix about building Michael's dream home. Furthermore, she reveals she has purchased Gypsy's Acre. Though initially angered by her deceit, Michael eventually relents, and he and Ellie marry in Wales. Ellie attempts to keep the marriage secret, as she fears her stepmother, Cora, and other family members may attempt to bribe Michael to divorce her based on his lower social class, but the union quickly makes international headlines. The family's attorney, whom Ellie lovingly refers to as \\"Uncle\\" Andrew swiftly attempts to buy Michael off, but he declines, insisting he and Ellie are in love. The couple subsequently purchase a local antique shop to operate. As construction of the home begins, Greta arrives, announcing she has taken a secretary job in London, and begins to slowly infiltrate the couple's new life together. Ellie is welcoming of her presence, but Michael dislikes her. Frank and the other family members approach Greta with a similar skepticism, and wish to distance her from Ellie. At the house, Ellie becomes unnerved when she notices Miss Townsend staring at the home from the fields below for hours at a time. While Michael attends an auction in the city, Ellie goes missing while out riding her horse. Her body is subsequently found in the woods on Gypsy's Acre. An autopsy suggests she died of unexpected cardiac arrest, but Michael contests this during the inquest, believing there may be foul play. Police attempt to track Miss Townsend, but are unable to locate her. After the inquest, Andrew notifies Michael that Ellie made him the sole beneficiary of her estate, and urges Michael to travel to the United States to tend to Ellie's business dealings there. Santonix, meanwhile, dies after a protracted battle with cancer. Upon returning to Gypsy's Acre from the United States, Michael witnesses an apparition of Ellie as he approaches the house. Upon entering, he and Greta embrace romantically, and begin to have sex‚Äîit is revealed the two lovers had conspired all along, preying on Ellie to take her estate: Greta killed her by lacing her allergy medicine with cyanide and bee venom, which stopped her heart. Michael and Greta's plans of a lavish life together are swiftly interrupted, however, when they receive an envelope postmarked from New York City‚Äîsent by Andrew‚Äîcontaining date-stamped photographs of them together long before Michael had met Ellie, serving as evidence of their conspiracy. Michael violently lashes out against Greta, blaming her for the predicament, and murders her in the swimming pool. This triggers a memory of from Michael's childhood, in which he killed his schoolmate by pushing him into a frozen pond, and stealing his watch as a memento. Michael is interviewed by police as well as Dr. Philpott, a local psychologist, and admits to helping murder Ellie. Philpott questions him about Miss Townsend, whom he presumes was paid to frighten Ellie, and then killed by Michael afterward to prevent her from exposing the plot; Michael, however, insists Miss Townsend never existed. As they question him further, Michael suffers a nervous breakdown, haunted by images related to those he has killed. Cast Production Development The novel was published in 1967. Christie later said she normally wrote her books in three to four months but Endless Night was done in six weeks.Crime Story Queen By Muriel Bowen. The Washington Post, Times Herald 15 Sep 1970: B4. Launder and Gilliat had spent two years working on a comedy about British divorce, Sex and the British. However they had to shelve it when a change in British law meant the plot became obsolete. Instead they decided to adapt the Agatha Christie novel, with Gilliat to direct and Launder to produce. Their aim was to write a cinematic script with a minimum of dialogue and a deliberate ambiguity of style \\"in the sense you're never really sure what is being said is what is really meant or really being said.\\" (In the end the film was produced by Gilliat's brother Leslie.) The film was partly financed from money by the NFFC.In the Picture Sight and Sound; London Vol. 40, Iss. 4, (Fall 1971): 187. Filming Grim's Dyke Entrance of Il San Pietro di Positano Filming took place in June 1971. Shooting locations included Christie's Auction House in London, as well as the West Country and Il San Pietro di Positano, Positano, Italy. The Philpotts' estate (Mike and Ellie's neighbors) was filmed at Grim's Dyke. Gilliat later said, \\"I felt very rusty getting back on the sent and I had a perfectly horrible time- funnily enough back at my very first studio.\\" Musical score The score was composed by American composer Bernard Herrmann. Commenting on the experience, Herrmann recounted: \\"I like to work on a film from the very beginning, but very few producers or directors think of that. They bring you in when the picture is near its final cut and they want you to do it within a very short time‚Äîalways the least amount of time in which you can possibly do it. Endless Night is an exception... Sidney Gilliat is a very experienced director who understands the problems, and he asked me to talk with him and consider what we should do musically at a very early stage.\\" Herrmann initially intended to implement a theremin in the score, but instead opted for a Moog synthesizer. Ellie's singing in the film was dubbed by Shirley Jones. Reception The film received mixed reviews. Although reasonably faithful to the novel, it is \\"An example of the sort of thing Christie was writing in her later years: moody psychological studies very different from, and not so much fun as, her early thrillers.\\" Contemporary critics have noted \\"Nice performances all around, with special admiration for Oscarsson's role as the dying architect.\\" Christie was initially pleased with the involvement of Gilliat, and the casting of the film. However, upon seeing the film, she \\"was very disappointed... It got flatter and less interesting every minute.\\"Dame Agatha Tells Whodunit--She Did: Grande Dame of Whodunit Los Angeles Times 15 Dec 1974: l1. Furthermore, she disliked the (admittedly brief) erotic nudity by Ekland in the film's final sequences. The initial release in Britain was unsuccessful, and United Artists decided against releasing the film in the United States.

Elliott.  Summary  World War II may be ending, but for 19-year-old bomber pilot, Henry Forester, the conflict still rages on. Shot down over France, Henry endured a dangerous trek to freedom, relying on civilians and French Resistance fighters to stay alive. But back home in Virginia, Henry is still reliving air battles with Hitler's Luftwaffe and his torture by the Gestapo. Henry worries about the safety of those who helped him escape‚Äîespecially the young French boy, Pierre, who may have lost everything in his efforts to save Henry. When Henry returns to France to find Pierre, he is stunned by the brutal aftermath of combat: widespread starvation, cities shattered by Allied bombing, and the return of survivors from the Nazi concentration camps. His efforts to find and secure the safety of Pierre help him to resolve the deep inner conflict he experiences at the beginning of the novel.  Relevance to other works by L.M. Elliott  Elliott is the author of novels for young adults, including \\"Annie, Between the States,\\" a Civil War story which tracks how the upheaval of that conflict changes the life of the young heroine. Another work, \\"Give Me Liberty,\\" recreates the rise of revolutionary fever in 1776 through the eyes of a young indentured servant who participates in one of the first battles of the war. \\"Under a War-Torn Sky,\\" the author's first novel, tells the story of Henry Forester, a young pilot flying bombing missions in World War II. In the novel, Henry is trapped behind enemy lines; with the aid of resistance fighters (the Maquis) as well as a host of brave French citizens, he is eventually reunited with Allied forces. Elliott drew inspiration for the novel from the experiences of her own father, who served as a bomber pilot in World War II and had to rely on the courage of everyday French people to reach freedom. This novel and the sequel, \\"A Troubled Peace,\\" are works of historical fiction. The characters, dialog, and plot twists created by the author are crafted as believable, authentic representations. The author's first-hand research, including travel to sites in France described in the books, allows for specific references to actual geography and historical events; extensive secondary research (using rare print sources as well as actual artifacts) provides a level of historical detail that is not common in the genre. The author creates added texture with references to literature and music popular in the times described. (British novelist and critic George Orwell appears in one scene of the novel, and the work of Albert Camus is referred to.) The author's works are noted for creating believable \\"coming of age\\" novels which make extensive use of the conflicts experienced by military personnel as well as civilians who have been swept up into war. Books by the author appear in school curricula throughout the United States and are popular on summer reading lists.

Now closed to rail traffic the bridge is used as a footpath. History The Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway's extension to Peebles was authorised on 3 July 1860 but by the time construction was complete the company had been absorbed by the much larger Caledonian Railway. The bridge was designed by Robert Murray, a local engineer living in Peebles, and George Cunningham, Consultant Engineer to the Caledonian Railway, and built of sandstone ashlar blocks. All eight arches are semicircular, skewed and constructed with helical courses, crossing the Tweed obliquely with four of the piers in the water, and the whole structure is built on a graceful curve of radius so as to align the route with nearby Neidpath Tunnel, at the eastern end of the viaduct and to the south of Neidpath Castle. In addition to the curve, the level of the trackbed falls approximately 6 feet (1.8 m) from west to east. The similar but smaller Lyne Viaduct is located a little to the west and is often confused with this bridge. On 1 January 1923 ownership of the viaduct, along with the rest of the Caledonian Railway, passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and thence to the Scottish region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The line lost its regular passenger traffic on 5 June 1950 and closed completely on 7 June 1954 but the Category A listed structure, one of the finest examples of skew arch construction in Scotland, remains as part of a footpath, the picturesque setting being popular with ramblers.

Indonesian Labour Front The party was founded as a national trade union center, the Indonesian Labour Front (Barisan Buruh Indonesia, BBI), on September 15, 1945.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2003. p. 161 As a political party Initially PBI was run by individuals who had worked at the Labour Department during the Japanese occupation. But in 1946 Setiadjit returned to Indonesia from exile in the Netherlands, and he assumed leadership of the party and became its chairman. Under Setiadjit, the collaborationist elements lost control over the party. Setiadjit's takeover in PBI was done with active support from the Indonesian government, as Sukarno had feared strong 'anarcho- syndicalist' tendencies of PBI. During the first year and half of the party under Setiadjit, the party was closely aligned with the larger Socialist Party.Rose, Saul. Socialism in Southern Asia.

A group that wanted to concentrate on trade unionism left the party, and refounded the BBI on December 31, 1945. This BBI later adopted the name Gasbi.

Brazilian mammarenavirus is one of the arenaviruses from South America to cause hemorrhagic fever. It shares a common progenitor with Argentinian mammarenavirus, Machupo mammarenavirus, Tacaribe mammarenavirus, and Guanarito mammarenavirus. It is an enveloped RNA virus and is highly infectious and lethal. Very little is known about this disease, but it is thought to be transmitted by the excreta of rodents. This virus has also been implicated as a means for bioterrorism, as it can be spread through aerosols. As of 2019, there had only been four documented infections of Brazilian mammarenavirus: two occurred naturally, and the other two cases occurred in the clinical setting. The first naturally occurring case was in 1990, when a female agricultural engineer who was staying in the neighborhood of Jardim Sabi√° in the municipality of Cotia, a suburb of S√£o Paulo, Brazil contracted the disease(The virus is also known as \\"Sabi√° Virus\\"). She presented with hemorrhagic fever and died. Her autopsy showed liver necrosis. A virologist who was studying the woman's disease contracted the virus but survived. Ribavirin was not given in these first two cases. Four years later, in 1994, a researcher was exposed to the virus in a level 3 biohazard facility at Yale University when a centrifuge bottle cracked, leaked, and released aerosolized virus particles. He was successfully treated with ribavirin. A fifth case, also naturally acquired in upstate S√£o Paulo, was reported in January 2020. The patient died 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Treatment Ribavirin is thought to be effective in treating the illness, similar to other arenaviruses. Compared to the patients who did not receive ribavirin, the patient who was treated with it had a shorter and less severe clinical course. Symptomatic control such as fluids to address dehydration and bleeding may also be required. Brazilian mammarenavirus is a biosafety Level 4 pathogen.

Plot Wealthy San Francisco socialite Cathy Mallory (Oberon) is entranced by the music of nightclub pianist Dan Evans (Andrews), who is blind. He is bitter and resents a potential lady bountiful's attempt to become his patron saint Next time she's at the club, bandleader Chick Morgan (Hoagy Carmichael) informs her that Dan has quit. Cathy arranges to meet him on a public beach as if by coincidence and introduces herself as Mary Willey, a woman of limited means who is also blind. They strike up a relationship and Dan explains how he lost his sight from another driver's car crash. Going to great lengths to continue the ruse, she and longtime companion Mrs. Willey rent an inexpensive apartment. Dan is persuaded to resume writing a piano concerto. Cathy sponsors a $5,000 prize for a contest without telling him, confident Dan's music will win. It does and will be performed at Carnegie Hall by the famed pianist Artur Rubinstein. Dan uses the money to undergo an operation in New York that restores his vision. At the contest, he meets Cathy Mallory and is attracted to her. He enjoys his newfound sight, spending time with her, but when he listens to the concert it stirs memories of Mary. He tells Chick to break the news to Cathy that he is going back to Mary. He and Chick take the train while Cathy and her aunt fly through the night. When he arrives at the ‚Äúclean but crummy‚Äù apartment, he hears Mary playing his music. He walks in, sees her‚Äîand smiles. Her aunt watches approvingly from the kitchen as they embrace. Cast * Dana Andrews as Dan Evans * Merle Oberon as Cathy Mallory / Mary Willey * Ethel Barrymore as Miss WilleyThe end credits clearly confirm what is said in the film. Miss Willey has never been married. The AFI Catalog is wrong in saying that she is Mrs. Willey. * Hoagy Carmichael as Chick Morgan * Arthur Rubinstein as Himself * Eugene Ormandy as Himself * Jacqueline White as Connie * Donald Curtis as George * Walter Reed as Jimmy * Jane Jones as Mamie Production The working titles of this film were Counterpoint and Memory of Love. RKO borrowed Dana Andrews from Samuel Goldwyn's company for the picture. He wore special contact lenses that made his eyes appear damaged and made it impossible for him to see. Scenes were shot in San Francisco, Trancas Beach and Lake Arrowhead, California, and in various locations in New York City. Because of logistical problems at Carnegie Hall, the entire concert was filmed on a soundstage. Andrews reprised his role in a May 29, 1950 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast, co-starring Joan Fontaine. Reception The film recorded a loss of $1,040,000.Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p46Richard B. Jewell, Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, Uni of California, 2016 New York Times critic Bosley Crowther panned the film for its ‚Äúincredibly mawkish plot‚Äú adding ‚Äú...the music, the prize concerto‚Äîwell, that is really the thing which puts Night Song in the spotlight as baldfaced and absolute sham. For this scrappy and meaningless jangle by Leith Stevens is good for nothing more than an excuse for filming the fiddles, the drums and the batteries of horns. And if Mr. Rubinstein and Mr. Ormandy can swallow it, along with their pride, they must have pretty strong stomachs.
