The restaurant was founded in 1972, and specializes in a signature dish called the \\"pizza pot pie.\\" It enjoys local popularity and has appeared in many publications and television shows. History There is no knowledge of when the building was first built. It has been speculated that the building had some ties to gentility, but those ties were severed in 1929. The parking garage across the street became known as the location of the \\"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\\", the infamous murder of seven rival gang members by Al Capone's men. It is rumored that the building itself was used as a lookout point for Capone's gunmen, though there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. . In November 1971 a fire broke out and burned the building to the ground. In April 1972, an attorney named Albert H. Beaver purchased the property. Beaver invested $150,000 into renovating the building. Beaver wanted to create something new and outstanding, and ultimately developed his own recipe for what he called \\"pizza pot pie.\\" Location and competition Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company are located at 2121 North Clark street Chicago, IL, which is in the Lincoln Park community. Lincoln Park is one of the most affluent areas of Chicago and attracts many tourists. According to Urban Spoon, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company was approved by 87% of the 900 people who voted. Most likely this is based primarily on the strength of their signature dish the Pizza Pot Pie. Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is generally considered the company's biggest competition and is the only pizzeria in the area to score higher with Urban Spoon's users. Caf√© Ba-Ba Reeba was voted at 85% approval, 2% less than Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Co for best restaurant in the northern area of Chicago. Fare Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company is the original creator of their non-traditional inverted dish known as the Pizza Pot Pie. The same recipe has been used since the restaurant first opened in 1972. It is \\"made up from scratch\\" with a tripled-raised Sicilian bread type of dough. The pizza pot pie includes plum tomato sauces, sausage made from Boston butts, button-sized mushrooms and cheese inside the crust. They also have a vegetarian option that includes the option of white or wheat crust. The Pizza Pot Pie has individual servings that come in two sizes: half-pound or one-pound. In addition to their Pizza Pot Pies, they have a variety of salad dinners and sub sandwiches known as grinders. One of the grinders they are known for is the \\"Italian Combination\\" that comes in an Italian loaf. The grinders also come in a vegetarian option that includes mushrooms, egg plant, peppers, olives and three kinds of cheeses. The \\"Salad Dinners\\" are large portions of salads. Another well known menu item is the \\"Mediterranean Bread.\\" Reception Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company has garnered some acclaim from various food critics and news outlets, not only for their pizzas but also the company's sandwiches, with CBS Chicago naming their oven grinder as one of the best sandwiches available in the city. The signature pizza dish, the pizza pot pie has also received favorable reviews from various outlets, many of them noting the generous portions. This praise for portions is not limited only to their pizza pot pies, but also the restaurant's sandwiches, salads, and appetizers. The restaurant has become famous enough on a local level that it has appeared in such Food Network shows as Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Food Network star Marc Murphy has commented on the pizza saying, \\"one bite of the pizza pot pie at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company and it was instantly deserving of The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\\" References Restaurants in Chicago Restaurants established in 1972 1972 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company"},{"id":"38522549","title":"2012 Central American Junior and Youth Championships in Athletics"},{"id":"38522557","text":"Eulitoma is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Eulimidae.Laseron, 1955.

In 1993 the Gemeente Haarlem accepted a gift of his entire oeuvre and named the new art hall on the Grote Markt, Haarlem after him. Verwey had given this gift in 1984 with the condition that a proper home for it needed to be created.

Harwood (born 1930) is an Irish screenwriter. She was born and raised in County Wicklow in the Irish countryside. She co-wrote two James Bond films, and went uncredited for adaptation work on a third.Sunday Independent, 18 August 2019, p.22. Life and career Harwood entered the film industry in 1949. Fluent in the French language, she trained at Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques (\\"I.D.H.E.C\\") in Paris, France. According to the Irish Digest, Harwood also studied filmmaking in England, then returned to Dublin to work in the Irish film industry. She became a continuity supervisor on films during the early to mid-1950s including Everybody's Business (a.k.a. Gno Gach Einne);Credited as Siobhan Harwood. Return to Glennascaul (shot in Ireland), starring Orson Welles;The film misspells her name as \\"Johanna Horward\\". The Flying Eye; Knave of Hearts (shot in London and France); and Orson Welles's Mr. Arkadin.The film misspells her name as \\"Johanna Horward\\". She also did assistant continuity on the Albert R. Broccoli productions The Red Beret and Hell Below Zero. In an interview with Irish Digest magazine, Harwood claims that the shortage of Irish film work reluctantly forced her to move to London where she worked for a talent agent. This at least gave her sufficient time to write. Among the publications she contributed to during the late 1950s and early 1960s was Punch. At some point the agency closed its London office and Harry Saltzman took over. Harwood stayed on as his secretary and eventually his reader in the late 1950s. She eventually persuaded him to let her write a film script. Saltzman phoned her one night with an idea for a Bob Hope film and asked her to develop it into an outline. Writing as \\"J. M. Harwood\\", she wrote a spoof 1959 James Bond short story called Some Are Born Great. Between 1960 and 1961 Harwood and Saltzman adapted the play The Marriage Game - originally by Mel Tolkin and Lucille Kallen - a comedy about \\"six girls in search of husbands.\\" The play opened at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, on 25 September 1961. According to Plays and Players, the comedy was scheduled to visit Liverpool, Eastbourne and Brighton \\"before coming into the West End.\\" Anthony Sharp directed with sets by Disley Jones.' Broccoli and Saltzman subsequently hired Terry Southern to write the script which was never filmed. According to the 1960 British Film and Television Yearbook, she wrote two unfilmed screenplays for Harry Saltzman's Woodfall Film Productions: City of Spades based on the 1957 Colin MacInnes novel to have been directed initially by Tony Richardson,Gavin Lambert re-wrote the script. then by Peter Yates;Barry Reckord did a new re-write. and Articles of War; of this script Harry Saltzman said that it \\"is a war story with a tremendously different twist. I don't think that there has ever been a war story like this. It has no message and it isn't a documentary - it's pure entertainment.\\"Saltzman, Harry. (1959) \\"Films and Filming\\". Also mentions upcoming production of Casino Royal [sic]. Saltzman subsequently had her work on the first two James Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love, and the non-Bond Saltzman co-production Call Me Bwana. Bond co-producer Albert R. Broccoli had originally hired Richard Maibaum and his friend Wolf Mankowitz to write the Dr. No screenplay. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.Inside Dr. No Documentary (DVD). Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006): MGM Home Entertainment. 1999. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. The film's director Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.Audio commentary (DVD). Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006): MGM Home Entertainment. 1999. Richard Maibaum felt \\"put out\\" that Harwood got an adaptation credit on From Russia with Love which he thinks she did not deserve. Maibaum conceded that she worked \\"some with the director, Terence Young, and made several good suggestions.\\" He puts her adaptation credit down to \\"studio politics.\\" Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely. Harwood also made uncredited contributions to the screenplay of Saltzman's The Ipcress File (1965).p. 79 Kremer, Daniel Sidney J. Furie: Life and Films University Press of Kentucky, 9 Oct 2015 Other work Harwood told the Irish Digest magazine in 1966 that she hoped to direct a film soon. \\"That's really what I want more than anything.\\" Harwood co-wrote the French film Ne jouez pas avec les Martiens (1967). She also translated into English three novels by French author Nicole Vidal: The Goddess Queen (1961), Nefertiti (1965) and Ring of Jade (1969).

Petr Herel: An Exhibition of Artist Books at the National Library of Australia. National Library of Australia. 1989. Pp.5 Gray's description might call a typical diary to mind, but she assures us this is not the case with Herel's books: \\"... although superficially similar to artists‚Äô sketchbooks, [Herel's books] differ in that they were created with an idea of unity\\".Anne Gray. Introduction. Petr Herel: An Exhibition of Artist Books at the National Library of Australia. National Library of Australia. 1989. Pp.5 Unlike an artists sketchbook or a diary, Herel's books are more conscious of what they are to contain, and how their contents will be delivered: \\"Herel‚Äôs books are blend of image and text, in which both have integrity and are enhanced by being placed together.\\"Anne Gray. Introduction. Petr Herel: An Exhibition of Artist Books at the National Library of Australia. National Library of Australia. 1989. Pp.1 As early as 1975, Elizabeth Cross identified Herel's inspiration coming from \\"... the work of Henri Michaux. ... [and] the less well known delicately evocative use of calligraphy in transforming figurative studies. They share a lyricism and spatial flexibility with many of Herel's works.\\"Elizabeth Cross. Imprint. Number Three. The Print Council of Australia. 1975. Pp. 2 There have been two presses which Herel has made the majority of his titles under. Labyrinth Press which he co-founded with Thierry Bouchard in 1980, and Uncollected Works Press which Herel founded in 2007.  Labyrinth Press  In 1980, Herel, who was then living in Canberra, Australia, co-founded Labyrinth Press with Thierry Bouchard in France. The last title from Labyrinth Press was in 2007. Bouchard's health resulted in their Labyrinth Press coming to an end. Bouchard died in 2008.  Uncollected Works Press  In 1991, Herel had used the imprint 'Uncollected Works' for Ruth Cowen's 'Real Estates of the Heart'. In 2007, Herel produced the first title under Uncollected Works Press in Melbourne.  The Graphic Investigation Workshop (and the Artist's Book Studio)  In 1979, he became the head lecturer of the Graphic Investigation Workshop (GIW) at the Canberra School of Art (renamed the Canberra Institute of Arts at the Australian National University in 1986). \\"[The Graphic Investigation Workshop] fostered an artistic sensibility coupled with a sense of technical excellence, rather than expertise in any given medium.\\"Sasha Grishin.

She is the daughter of Peter Madoff, and a niece of Bernard Madoff, who employed her as a compliance officer and attorney at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BLMIS) from 1995 until 2008. In December 2008 BLMIS was discovered to be a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, and closed as part of the Madoff investment scandal. Her uncle Bernard Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for the scheme, and her father, who was her boss at the company and the chief compliance officer, was sentenced to ten years in prison. In 2007, she married Eric Swanson, a former Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Profile, https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2009/oig-509.pdf (page 392); accessed February 4, 2016. She and Swanson met originally in April 2003 when the SEC performed an inadequate examination as to whether Bernie Madoff was front running customer orders--completely missing the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme that her own cousins (Bernie's sons) would expose in December 2008. No criminal charges have ever been filed against her for her potential role in the Madoff investment scandal. In 2015, U.S. Marshals auctioned 420 lots of assets belonging to Shana Madoff and her father Peter, pursuant to a court order. Personal life Shana Diane Madoff was born in Queens, New York, in 1967, and grew up in Woodbury on the North Shore of Long Island. She graduated from the University of Michigan in 1992, and from Fordham Law School in 1995.Shana Madoff profile, e-yearbook.com; accessed February 4, 2016. In 1997 she married Scott Skoller, a men's clothing store manager from Roslyn, New York, and changed her name to Shana Skoller. Together they had a daughter, Rebecca, before divorcing. In 2007, she married Eric Swanson, a former Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Career After her graduation from law school in 1995, Shana Madoff started work at her uncle's firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BLMIS). She was a rules and compliance officer and in-house counsel at BLMIS, a significant senior officer position for which she collected millions of dollars.\\"Madoff saga is far from over\\", fortune.com, July 2, 2012. She was responsible for ensuring that BLMIS complied with its legal and regulatory obligations, signing documents assuring the SEC that BLMIS's business records were truthful and accurate. In one case, she signed documents certifying to the SEC that BLMIS had 23 clients and $17.1 billion under management, when in fact it had 4,900 customers with $68 billion in investments. Shana Madoff was also a compliance officer and attorney for Cohmad Securities, which was co-owned by her uncle and helped bring investors to BLMIS. Shana Madoff also held prominent positions in investment industry organizations. She served on the Executive Committee of the Compliance & Legal Division of the Securities Industry Association, which merged with another industry organization to become SIFMA, the lobbying arm of the industry, in November 2006. She then became an active member of the Executive Committee of SIFMA's Compliance & Legal Division, while her father served on SIFMA's board of directors. She resigned that position after her uncle's arrest. Madoff scandal Bernard Madoff Subsequent to the Ponzi scheme in the Madoff investment scandal becoming public, a spokesman for Shana Madoff said she had \\"no prior knowledge of the horrific fraud perpetuated.\\" She is married to Eric Swanson, an attorney and a former Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the SEC, the securities regulator, whom she met in April 2003. She and Swanson met during an SEC examination of whether Bernie Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme, and the two started a regular correspondence; during 2003, Swanson sent Peter Madoff several regulatory requests. In March 2004, SEC lawyer Genevievette Walker- Lightfoot was reviewing Madoff's firm and raised questions to Swanson (who was her boss's supervisor) about unusual trading at one of the Madoff funds; she was told to instead concentrate on an unrelated matter. Swanson and her boss asked for her research, but did not act upon it. In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC‚Äôs New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running \\"the biggest Ponzi scheme ever\\". In April 2006, Swanson informed John McCarthy, Associate Director in the SEC Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, of his relationship with Shana Madoff, and McCarthy was very upset. When McCarthy found out later that month that the relationship was still continuing, and confronted Swanson about it, Swanson came clean and McCarthy was again extremely upset. Swanson left the SEC on September 15, 2006. The SEC closed its investigation of Bernie Madoff in 2006. In 2009, after the scandal broke, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz investigated, and concluded that there was no evidence that Swanson's romantic relationship with Shana Madoff influenced the closing of the SEC investigation of her uncle.David Stout, \\"Report Details How Madoff's Web Ensnared S.E.C.\\", nytimes.com, September 2, 2009. He did conclude, however, that: \\"Swanson's communication with Shana during the period of time he was engaged in a cause examination of her uncle and father's firm, created the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.\\" Swanson left the SEC on September 15, 2006. Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged on December 8, 2006.Stephen Labaton, \\"Unlikely Player Pulled Into Madoff Swirl\\", nytimes.com, December 18, 2008. The September 2007 wedding of Shana Madoff and Swanson was attended by Lori Richards, SEC Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations, who oversaw Swanson at the SEC. In 2008, Bernard Madoff spoke at a business roundtable meeting of his \\"very close\\" relationship with an SEC lawyer, and chuckled: \\"my niece even married one\\". In April 2009, Richards recused herself from the Madoff investigation. Swanson is now general counsel at BATS Trading, the third-largest U.S. stock exchange. Shana Madoff's uncle Bernard pleaded guilty to federal charges against him, following the Madoff investment scandal becoming public, in March 2009. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison. Her father, Peter, the chief compliance officer of BLMIS, who was her boss at the company, pleaded guilty in July 2012 to fabricating documents to evade taxes and to help BLMIS escape SEC scrutiny. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. As part of her father's forfeiture deal with the Justice Department, the $2.3 million in proceeds from selling Shana's five-bedroom East Hampton house was surrendered. In October 2009, court-appointed trustee Irving Picard charged in a civil lawsuit that she played a role in filing a January 2008 form that inflated the assets that the Madoff firm in fact had.America's Housing and Financial Frauds - Rodney Stich - Google Books Picard sued her, her father and two cousins (Mark Madoff and Andrew Madoff) for what he claimed was $198.7 million of misappropriated customer money while they were executives of BLMIS, alleging that had they done their jobs honestly the scheme might never have succeeded or continued as long as it did. Picard said: > It would seem impossible for her to carry out her compliance duties, year in > and year out, without questioning or considering whether BLMIS's IA > [investment advisory business] was a fraud. Either [she and her father] > failed completely to carry out their required supervisory/compliance roles, > or they knew about the fraud, but covered it up. She called the claim baseless, and said she had no knowledge of the scheme. In 2012, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: \\"We are not yet finished calling to account everyone responsible for the epic fraud of Bernard Madoff and the epic pain of his many victims.\\" Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee, referring to Shana and her cousin Andrew, said: \\"The prosecutors ... have done the low-hanging fruit; they are now reaching to the medium-level fruit‚Ä¶ Beyond the two kids, I do not know how much farther they will want to go.\\" Coffee said: > Prosecutors can use the same charges as they did against her father, maybe > not seeking 10 years, but I could see them giving her the choice of pleading > to a felony conviction on the same grounds.

A native of Ghent, Struye served in the Belgian Army during World War I. He qualified as a lawyer in the years after the war and also worked as a journalist at the Catholic newspaper La Libre Belgique. A royalist and patriot, Struye was soon attracted to the Belgian resistance during World War II and was influential once La Libre Belgique became an underground newspaper. His diary of life under occupation and writings on public opinion are important historical sources on the period. After the war, Struye entered politics in the Christian Social Party as a senator and held the portfolio of Minister of Justice (1947-1948). He subsequently held the post of President of the Senate on two occasions. Biography=Early life= Paul Struye was born in Ghent, Belgium in 1896, the son of Dr. Eug√®ne Struye and Jenny Linon. He was educated at Sint-Barbaracollege. During World War I, in 1915, Struye was smuggled out of German-occupied Belgium to join the Belgian army in exile, but was declared ineligible for all but ancillary military duties. Eventually he wrote to Queen Elisabeth to request a transfer to the front, where he served as a stretcher bearer. In 1918, while still at the front, he sat a philosophy degree. In November 1918, he was wounded in action. Between the wars, Struye joined the bar in Brussels and became a lawyer at the Court of Cassation by 1940. Alongside his legal practice he also wrote for the popular conservative newspaper La Libre Belgique from 1925 where he wrote a weekly column. =World War II= Under the German occupation between 1940 and 1944, Struye continued to practise as a lawyer. He began to keep a diary, recording his daily life. A royalist and Belgian patriot, he soon became involved in the Belgian Resistance, especially the La Libre Belgique of Peter Pan, an underground newspaper created in August 1940 which became one of the most prominent published during the period. Struye also keenly observed Belgian public opinion during the occupation and wrote regular reports on the subject for the Belgian government in exile. =Political career= In the first post- war elections in February 1946, Struye was elected as senator for the region of Brussels in the Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP). In March 1947, he was made Minister of Justice, responsible for the legal prosecution of former collaborators. He favoured a liberal approach towards sentencing, particularly in commuting death sentences, which was controversial. He resigned in November 1948. He took a pro-royalist stance during the Royal Question and a liberal stance in the Second Schools' War. He served two terms as President of the Senate between 1950-1954 and 1958-1973. He died in Ixelles on 16 February 1974.

Collaborative pedagogy believes that students will better engage with writing, critical thinking, and revision if they engage with others.Bruffee, Kenneth A. ‚ÄúCollaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 545 ‚Äì 562. Print. Collaborative pedagogy pushes back against the Current-Traditional model of writing, as well as other earlier theories explaining rhetoric and composition; earlier theories of writing, especially current-traditional, emphasizes writing as a final product (completed individually). In contrast, collaborative pedagogy rejects the notion that students think, learn, and write in isolation. Collaborative pedagogy strives to maximize critical thinking, learning, and writing skills through interaction and interpersonal engagement.Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. ‚ÄúCommunity Literacy.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 1097 ‚Äì 1116. Print. Collaborative pedagogy also connects to the broader theory of collaborative learning, which encompasses other disciplines including, but not limited to, education, psychology, and sociology. In the rhetoric and composition discourse community, there exists much support for and debate about the use of collaborative learning in the classroom. Although collaborative pedagogy deals with the strategies associated with promoting engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity, these theorists underscore collaborative pedagogy‚Äôs link to cultural studies, argumentation, community literacy, academic discourse, and university standards and policy connected with first-year composition.Bartholomae, David. ‚ÄúInventing the University.‚Äù When a Writer Can‚Äôt Write. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guildford, 1985. 134‚Äì165. Discussions of collaborative pedagogy also emerge in the technical communication field, a subset of rhetoric and composition. Technical communication incorporates collaborative pedagogy by attempting to bridge real work environments with university classrooms through group assignments.Blakeslee, Ann M. ‚ÄúBridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom- Workplace Collaborations.‚Äù Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348‚Äì391. Print Theorists in rhetoric and composition There are many rhetoric and composition theorists who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, Kenneth A. Bruffee, John Trimbur, Joseph Harris, and Wayne Campbell Peck, Linda Flower, and Lorraine Higgins. Kenneth Bruffee sees collaborative pedagogical strategies as natural to the learning process, more than individual thinking and learning.Bruffee, Kenneth A. ‚ÄúCollaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 545 ‚Äì 562. Print.

Support and critique=As an aid to a natural state of interaction= In ‚ÄúCollaboration and the ‚ÄòConversation of Mankind‚Äô,‚Äù Kenneth A. Bruffee cites thinking out loud and collaborating as natural states of learning, because they mimic the process of earlier stages of development. Citing Michael Oakeshott, Bruffee argues that ‚Äú[w]e first experience and learn ‚Äòthe skill and partnership of conversation,‚Äô in the external arena of direct social exchange with other people. Only then do we learn to displace that ‚Äòskill and partnership by playing silently with ourselves, in imagination, the parts of all the participants in the conversation‚Äù.Bruffee, Kenneth A. ‚ÄúCollaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 545 ‚Äì 562. Print., p.549 In other words, he believes that the concepts of independent learning and thinking are more like social constructs than a natural state of being. Despite believing in Oakeshott‚Äôs theories about collaborative learning being natural, he acknowledges the difficulty of blending this with the independent and authoritative environment of the classroom, especially the college first- year composition classroom. Bruffee confronts the overarching fact that ‚Äú[h]umanistic study, we have been led to believe, is a solitary life, and the vitality of the humanities lies in the talents and endeavors of each of us as individuals‚Äù.Bruffee, Kenneth A. ‚ÄúCollaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies.

Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 545 ‚Äì 562. Print., p. 550 However, Bruffee thinks that if composition instructors and scholars believe in writing and learning as a process from which everyone can benefit, then it is important to forge community through collaboration, despite the individualist discourse of the university. =As crossing socioeconomic boundaries= Wayne Campbell Peck et al. view collaborative pedagogy in a positive light, due to its success at the Community Literacy Center (CLC), which pairs inner-city high school students with student mentors from Carnegie Mellon University. They describe a curriculum encouraging students to write responses to the real world situations they face, such as writing their school administrators about detention policies.Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. ‚ÄúCommunity Literacy.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed.

Next, the students and administrators need to remain open to the others‚Äô perspectives to develop stronger community. Last, the program coordinators need to view all parties involved as equal stakeholders.Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. ‚ÄúCommunity Literacy.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller.

In ‚ÄúThe Idea of Community in the Study of Writing,‚Äù Joseph Harris echoes Bruffee‚Äôs sentiments that the community and individual work at cross- purposes within the university setting. He claims that although the term \\"collaborative\\" usually connotes a positive sense of belonging, community in reality often creates an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality, and also creating a dichotomy between individual and group, or in this case, student versus university. He wonders, ‚ÄúIf to enter the academic community a student must ‚Äòlearn to speak our language‚Äô [in reference to David Bartholomae‚Äôs ‚ÄúInventing the University‚Äù], and become accustomed and reconciled to our ways of doing things with words, then how exactly is she to do this?‚Äù.Harris, Joseph. ‚ÄúThe Idea of Community in the Study of Writing‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 748 ‚Äì 758. Print., p.753 Issues of inclusion, exclusion, community, and individual relate to collaborative pedagogy, because first-year composition instructors struggle to promote critical thinking and collaborative learning, while also meeting the demands of college-level writing. Harris does not provide much consolation to this problem, except to say that students need to learn to navigate the complexities of individual and community identity. =As critical engagement= John Trimbur both supports and critiques collaborative pedagogy, but his support is predicated upon adjusting the views of both conflict and resolution. His article, ‚ÄúConsensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning,\\" focuses on redefining the definition of ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù as it applies to collaborative pedagogy in the first-year composition classroom. He argues that, > To develop a critical version of collaborative learning, we will need to > distinguish between consensus as an acculturative practice that reproduces > business as usual and consensus as an oppositional one that challenges the > prevailing conditions of production. The point of collaborative learning is > not simply to demystify the authority of knowledge by revealing its social > character but to transform the productive apparatus, to change the social > character of production. In this regard, it will help to cast consensus not > as a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù practice but as a utopian one (Trimbur, 743).Trimbur, > John. ‚ÄúConsensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.‚Äù The Norton Book > of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, > 2009. 733 ‚Äì 747. Print., p. 743 After he links collaborative learning with his notion of the role of consensus, he claims that ‚ÄúThe revised notion of consensus I am proposing here depends paradoxically on its deferral, not its realization. I am less interested in students achieving consensus‚Ä¶as their using consensus as a critical to open gaps in the conversation through which differences may emerge‚Äù.Trimbur, John. ‚ÄúConsensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.‚Äù The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009. 733‚Äì747. Print., p.745 This notion of consensus helps students build community and collaboration by grappling with issues that do not lend themselves so easily to consensus as agreement. Theorists in technical communication There are many technical communication scholars who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, Aviva Freedman, Christine Adam, Ann M. Blakeslee, and Robert J. Johnson. Aviva Freedman and Christine Adam view the traditional classroom model as detrimental to students/future employees, because the classroom prevents critical thinking, independence, collaboration, and cooperation between coworkers.Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. ‚ÄúLearning to Write Professionally: ‚ÄòSituated Learning‚Äô and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.‚Äù Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom.

Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348‚Äì391. Print Robert J. Johnson thinks that writing is inherently collaborative, because technical writers have to acknowledge live audiences to accomplish real and necessary tasks.Johnson, Robert J. \\"Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing.\\" College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361‚Äì376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012. =Technical communication views collaborative pedagogy= The works of the scholars listed above and in the references section primarily deal with the conundrum of preparing students for collaborative work environments, when most of their work occurs individually and in a classroom environment. Freedman and Adam worry that the classroom creates trained in capacities in students, preventing them from adapting to a work world where authoritative boundaries are blurred and most stakeholders are equal.Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. ‚ÄúLearning to Write Professionally: ‚ÄòSituated Learning‚Äô and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.‚Äù Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom.

It stars Wayne Lai , Myolie Wu , Edwin Siu , Sire Ma , Yoyo Chen , King Kong Lee , Lau Kong , Cecilia Fong , Lee Shing-cheong & Susan Tse. It is the third installment of the critically acclaimed Rosy Business period drama series. Previous installments include 2009's Rosy Business and 2010's No Regrets. The idea first started by airing on Encore Tvb, which was the full version, airing 31 episodes, with the last 2 airing back to back. The incomplete version aired 26 episodes. Set primarily in Canton, China (now known as Guangzhou) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the show's story follows the affairs of Chinese spies and their entanglements with underground triads and the Empire of Japan. Wayne Lai stars as special government agent Kong Sheung-hung. Co-starring is Myolie Wu as Kong's partner Cheung Kei-sang, and Edwin Siu as their rival, Chau Sai-kai. No Reserve premiered on 1 October 2016 on TVB's streaming service, myTV SUPER. It later had a mainstream premiere at TVB Jade on 19 December 2016, with the series edited to 26 episodes. Synopsis Cheung Kei- sang (Myolie Wu) and the orphan Chau Sai-kai (Edwin Siu), two young lovers from a village in Southern China, are forcibly separated on their marriage day due to the Japanese invasion. Filled with hatred and vengeance, Sai-kai joins a Kuomintang secret agency, becoming their spy. Meanwhile, Kei-sang ends up in a Communist guerrilla militia and receives training to be their government‚Äôs spy. She takes up a different identity as a Cantonese opera performer and cozies up with many Japanese officials, to the point of selling her body to extract military intelligence. She also meets Kong Sheung-hung (Wayne Lai), another Communist spy, and together they go on a mission to search for a Japanese businessman, who is linked to the war. They meet the businessman, only to discover that he looks identical to Sheung-hung. They learn that the businessman, Suzuki Kazuo, is actually Sheung-hung‚Äôs long lost twin brother, who ended up in Japan and was raised by an abusive Japanese father. The repeated abuse turns Kazuo into a strange and psychotic man. In another mission, Kei-sang reunites with Sai-kai, but his ties with the Kuomintang puts their relationship at an impasse. Kei-sang is heartbroken to find Sai-kai turning into a psychopath, to a point of no return Confirmed cast and characters=Main= *Wayne Lai as Suzuki Kazuo () and Kong Sheung-hung (), a pair of twin brothers who were separated at a young age. Lai, who was willing to push aside other filming offers in order to accommodate his schedule to film No Reserve, was the first of the cast to be confirmed in late 2011. In regards of him portraying two different characters, Lai said, \\"It is difficult. The older brother ends up in Japan and is educated with Japanese culture, later becoming a Japanese businessman. He is also a man with wild ambitions and has a harsh childhood leading him to become a mad man. The younger brother stays in China and joins the guerrilla team... in the end, the two brothers will have to confront each other.\\" *Myolie Wu as Cheung Kei-sang (), a special agent for the Communist Party of China.She face the tragic loss of her father and younger brother leading to become a secret agent. Wu expressed that No Reserve is one of her most challenging scripts: \\"It is a powerful [story], with many ups and downs. It takes place during a war, so there will be tragic partings of life and death... it forces one to make certain decisions and choices. It's a brilliant script.\\" On replacing Sheren Tang as the franchise's female lead, Myolie admitted that the role had given her a lot of pressure, but said, \\"It is a completely new story. No one can replace [Tang]. Our performances will inevitably be compared, but I will do my best on my part.\\" As for Tang's response, she said, \\"[Producer Lee] has already stated before that he could not come up with a suitable story line for me and [Lai] in [No Reserve]. I trust his judgment.\\" *Edwin Siu as Chau Sai- kai (), a Kuomintang special agent who eventually goes psychotic, raping and assaulting random innocent people for his amusement. He became the enemy of Kong Sheung-hung and Cheung Kei-sang. Siu said that he has never come upon a more challenging character to portray, also expressing, \\"But no matter how many girls I touch, I will still be faithfully in love with Sang (Wu's character) until the end.\\" Siu is the second cast member to be confirmed to star in No Reserve. In 2008, Siu was in final negotiations to star in Rosy Business, but ultimately withdrew due to a schedule clash. *Sire Ma as Kam Wan-ling (), a fallen Qing Dynasty princess. She has never been to the outside since when she was a child. Sneak away home to look for adventure in the outside world. She admired Kong Sheung-hung. She has a tattoo on her back connecting to the secret treasure of the former Qing Dynasty. Ma was thrilled to be able to take part in the franchise, saying, \\"I have been hoping to take part in the franchise since I first heard that a third was in the making. It's a dream come true.\\" =Supporting= *Li Shing-cheong as a former Qing Dynasty official having false hope of restoring Qing Dynasty raised Ling. *Susan Tse as Ling's nanny who raised her with few qing dynasty remnant. *Lau Kong as a special agent of the Communist Party of China, supervisor of Kong Sheung-hung and Cheung Kei-sang. *Cecilia Fong as the mother of Suzuki Kazuo and Kong Sheung-hung. She has one regret of having lost her older son during an earthquake in Japan. *Yoyo Chen as ex-wife of Chau Sai-kai who he marries because of Kuomintang undercover mission to get closer to her father. *Man Yeung *Yu Yang as the father of Cheung Kei-sang who was killed by the Japanese Soldiers along with his young son. *Helena Law as a village old lady *Eric Li as a Kuomintang special agent, supervisor of Chau Sai-kai *King Kong as Japanese military commander, brother-in-law of Suzuki Kazu who was used by him to reach his goals. Production=Development and filming= After the critical and commercial success of No Regrets (2010), TVB encouraged Lee to produce a third installment. Though Lee was initially against the idea, he agreed to helm the project if Rosy Business head writer and assistant creative director, Cheung Wah-biu, would return to TVB. Upon learning that Cheung was tied to other projects, Lee put the production of No Reserve on hold, expressing that without Cheung, he would be unable to continue the franchise. In December 2011, Lee announced that he would consider retirement after finishing the post-production work of his crime serial, Bullet Brain. Lee admitted that the unsatisfying ratings from his 2011 drama, Bottled Passion, significantly impacted this decision. Despite his hopes for retirement, TVB contacted Lee for a contract renewal in late 2012. Lee eventually renewed his TVB contract in the spring of 2012 after TVB agreed to increase his pay and reduce his workload to one drama serial per year. Lee began pre-production work on No Reserve in September 2012. Lee's longtime collaborator and Bullet Brain head writer, Ip Kwong-yam, was attached to the script. No Reserve was Ip's first TVB drama since leaving the company sixteen years ago. Ip drafted a preliminary script for No Reserve in May 2012 and began officially working on the project after the completion of Lee's other production, Detective Columbo, in August 2012. The Chinese working title of No Reserve was announced to be \\"Dip Hyut Chi Hung\\" (). The title was later changed to \\"Dip Hyut Cheung Tin\\" (). A costume fitting press conference was held on February 20, 2013. Principal photography began on March 11 in Hong Kong. Other filming locations included Foshan and Zhongshan. A bless ceremony was held on April 8. Photography wrapped up in July 2013. =Casting= The success of Rosy Business and No Regrets relaunched the careers of main leads, Sheren Tang and Wayne Lai. Both leads respectively won best actress and actor at the TVB Anniversary Awards two years in a row for their acclaimed performances. In late 2011, Lai stated that he would be willing to push aside other filming offers in order to accommodate his schedule to film No Reserve. Lai reconfirmed this statement with the Singaporean media in July 2012. Tang also privately agreed to help Lee in No Reserve if her schedule allowed. When the No Reserve project was announced to be reopened in September 2012, Lai re- confirmed his return. A few days later, Lee announced that Myolie Wu would replace Tang as the serial's lead actress. With the exception of Lai, a core star to the franchise, Lee indicated that No Reserve would feature an entirely younger and fresher cast. Lee received a lot of complaints on Wu's casting; the complaints said that Tang had an irreplaceable role in the Rosy Business franchise. Wu's acting abilities were also questioned. Lee defended Wu, gushing that Wu was a TVB fadan who he wanted to collaborate with the most. Following Wu's casting, Lee announced that Edwin Siu had been cast as the serial's second male lead. Natalie Tong and Sire Ma were also announced to have joined, but Tong left the cast in early 2012 due to a schedule clash. A sales presentation trailer was filmed in October 2012. Helena Law, Yoyo Chen, Eric Li, Cheung Kwok-keung, and returning cast members Susan Tse and Li Shing- cheong were confirmed to join the cast in February 2013. Release When production first began, the Hong Kong media predicted that No Reserve would be one of TVB's anniversary dramas of 2013. However, in May 2013 when filming had hit its halfway mark, TVB pulled the drama from the 2013 broadcast lineup, and the series was being subjected to review by a censor board. It was said that the drama, which included sodomy and rape scenes, could be too violent for broadcast on a prime time network. Lee allegedly altered the story due to these restrictions. TVB had attempted to censor all the scenes alluding to the violence, cutting the drama from 30 episodes to 15. After three years in broadcast limbo, TVB finally confirmed in July 2016 that No Reserve would be getting an October 2016 premiere. Instead of getting a network broadcast, No Reserve would be released on TVB's streaming service myTV SUPER, which has more lax restrictions. At a promotional event to promote its release in September 2016, Lai said TVB's hesitance to air No Reserve on television was more likely due to the drama's politically sensitive topic rather than its sexual content. myTV SUPER will be airing the complete, uncut version on 1 October 2016. The first five episodes will be released on the first Saturday, followed by four episodes on the next every Saturday for four week & last five episodes released following week. TVB Jade will also air the edited version (26 episodes) from 19 December 2016, everyday at 9.30pm.

This includes cytokines and mitogens with crucial function in complex processes such as inflammatory response or tumor-induced angiogenesis. Most of these proteins are involved in processes in higher eukaryotes, however an unconventional export mechanism was found in lower eukaryotes too. Even proteins folded in their correct conformation can pass plasma membrane this way, unlike proteins transported via ER/Golgi pathway. Two types of unconventional protein secretion are these: signal-peptid-containing proteins and cytoplasmatic and nuclear proteins that are missing an ER-signal peptide (1). Signal-peptide-containing proteins These proteins contain a specific signal-peptide sequence, which is to be translated into the endoplasmic reticulum, but are, however, able to reach the cell surface unconventionally. They can be packed into a COPII-coated vesicle and directly fuse with plasma membrane or can fuse with endosomal or lysosomal compartment. Alternatively, they can be packed into non-COPII-coated vesicle as well and fuse with Golgi (before reaching plasma membrane) or directly delivered to the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmatic/nuclear secretory proteins Soluble proteins can reach the surface of the cell both by non-vesicular and vesicular mechanisms. Non-vesicular mechanisms use a carrier to get proteins into extracellular space (for example phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Vesicular mechanisms can use the lysosome-dependent pathway, microvesicle shedding or biogenesis of multivesicular bodies.

The Trinity is most commonly seen in Christian art with the Holy Spirit represented by a dove, as specified in the gospel accounts of the baptism of Christ; he is nearly always shown with wings outspread. However depictions using three anthropomorphic figures appear occasionally in most periods of art.See below and G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I, 1971, Vol II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5‚Äì16 & passim, and The Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age, and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical Ancient of Days, which is often cited in defense of this sometimes controversial representation. However, in Eastern Orthodoxy the Ancient of Days is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father‚Äîearly Byzantine images show Christ as the Ancient of Days,Cartlidge, David R., and Elliott, J.K.. Art and the Christian Apocrypha, pp. 69‚Äì72 (illustrating examples), Routledge, 2001, , , Google books but this iconography became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a halo shaped like an equilateral triangle, instead of a circle. The Son is often shown at the Father's right hand. He may be represented by a symbol‚Äîtypically the Lamb or a cross‚Äîor on a crucifix, so that the Father is the only human figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes of the Baptism of Christ. Later, in the West, the \\"Throne of Mercy\\" (or \\"Throne of Grace\\") became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes seated on a throne) is shown supporting either a crucifixG Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5‚Äì16 & passim, and , pp. 122‚Äì124 and figs 409‚Äì414 or, later, a slumped crucified Son, similar to the Piet√† (this type is distinguished in German as the Not Gottes)G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5‚Äì16 & passim, and , pp. 219‚Äì224 and figs 768‚Äì804 in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at least. By the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the wounds of his Passion, and the dove above or around them. In earlier representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a papal tiara.  Eastern Orthodox tradition  Old Testament Trinity icon by Andrey Rublev, c. 1400 (Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow) Direct representations of the Trinity are much rarer in Eastern Orthodox art of any period‚Äîreservations about depicting the Father remain fairly strong, as they were in the West until the high Middle Ages. The Second Council of Nicea in 787 confirmed that the depiction of Christ was allowed; the situation regarding the Father was less clear. The usual Eastern Orthodox representation of the Trinity was through the \\"Old Testament Trinity\\" of the three angels visiting Abraham‚Äîsaid in the text to be \\"the Lord\\". However scholars generally agree that the direct representation of the Trinity began in Greek works from the 11th century onwards, where Christ is shown as an infant sitting on the Father's lap, with the Dove of the Holy Spirit also present. Such depictions spread to the West and became the standard type there, although with an adult Christ, as described above. This type later spread back to the Eastern Orthodox world where post-Byzantine representations similar to those in the West are not uncommon outside Russia.Bigham, 89‚Äì98 The subject long remained sensitive, and the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 finally forbade depictions of the Father in human form. The canon is quoted in full here because it explains the Russian Orthodox theology on the subject: > Chapter 2, ¬ß44: It is most absurd and improper to depict in icons the Lord > Sabaoth (that is to say, God the Father) with a grey beard and the Only- > Begotten Son in His bosom with a dove between them, because no-one has seen > the Father according to His Divinity, and the Father has no flesh, nor was > the Son born in the flesh from the Father before the ages.

The Coptic Orthodox Church never depicts God the Father in art although he may be identified by an area of brightness within art such as the heavenly glow at the top of some icons of the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ. In contrast, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has many ancient icons depicting the Holy Trinity as three distinct persons. These icons often depict all three persons sitting upon a single throne to signify unity. The Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church follows the same practice.  Scenes  Only a few of the standard scenes in Christian art normally included a representation of the Trinity. The accounts in the Gospels of the Baptism of Christ were considered to show all three persons as present with a separate role. Sometimes the other two persons are shown at the top of a crucifixion. The Coronation of the Virgin, a popular subject in the West, often included the whole Trinity. But many subjects, such as Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement, which might be thought to require depiction of the deity in the most amplified form, only show Christ. There is a rare subject where the persons of the Trinity make the decision to incarnate Christ, or God sending out the Son. Even more rarely, the Angel of the Annunciation is shown being given the mission.for both, G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971, Vol II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, and , pp. 6‚Äì12 and figs 10‚Äì16  Less common types of depiction  Stained glass window depicting the Trinity in three persons. Saint Martin church, Courgenard, France. Especially in the 15th century, and in the less public form of illuminated manuscripts, there was experimentation with many solutions to the issues of depicting the three persons of the Trinity. The depiction of the Trinity as three identical persons is rare, because each person of the Trinity is considered to have distinct attributes. Nonetheless, the earliest known depiction of God the Father as a human figure, on the 4th century Dogmatic Sarcophagus, shows the Trinity as three similar bearded men creating Eve from Adam, probably with the intention of affirming the consubstantiality recently made dogma in the Nicene Creed. There are many similar sarcophagi, and occasional images at intervals until a revival of the iconography in the 15th century.Schiller, I, figs 7, 10, 11 The depiction was finally formally condemned by Pope Benedict XIV in the 18th century.Panofsky, Erwin, \\"Once More \\"The Friedsam Annunciation and the Problem of the Ghent Altarpiece\\", The Art Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Dec., 1938), pp. 419-442, College Art Association, JSTOR Even rarer is the depiction of the Trinity as a single anthropoid figure with three faces (Latin \\"Vultus Trifons\\"), because the Trinity is defined as three persons in one Godhead, not one person with three attributes (this would imply Modalism, which is defined as heresy in traditional Orthodox Christianity). Such \\"Cerberus\\" depictions of the Trinity as three faces on one head were mainly made among Catholics during the 15th to 17th centuries, but were condemned after the Catholic Council of Trent, and again by Pope Urban VIII in 1628, and many existing images were destroyed. The Trinity may also be represented abstractly by symbols, such as the triangle (or three triangles joined together), trefoil or the triquetra‚Äîor a combination of these. Sometimes a halo is incorporated into these symbols. The use of such symbols are often found not only in painting but also in needlework on tapestries, vestments and antependia, in metalwork and in architectural details.

Although statistical learning is now thought to be a generalized learning mechanism, the phenomenon was first identified in human infant language acquisition. The earliest evidence for these statistical learning abilities comes from a study by Jenny Saffran, Richard Aslin, and Elissa Newport, in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone speech. Each stream was composed of four three-syllable ‚Äúpseudowords‚Äù that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing ‚Äúpseudowords‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúnonwords‚Äù from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together and which ones only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning is thought to be one way that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words. Since the initial discovery of the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition, the same mechanism has been proposed for elements of phonological acquisition, and syntactical acquisition, as well as in non-linguistic domains. Further research has also indicated that statistical learning is likely a domain-general and even species-general learning mechanism, occurring for visual as well as auditory information, and in both primates and non-primates. Lexical Acquisition The role of statistical learning in language acquisition has been particularly well documented in the area of lexical acquisition. One important contribution to infants' understanding of segmenting words from a continuous stream of speech is their ability to recognize statistical regularities of the speech heard in their environments. Although many factors play an important role, this specific mechanism is powerful and can operate over a short time scale. =Original Findings= A spectrogram of a male speaker saying the phrase \\"nineteenth century.\\" There is no clear demarcation where one word ends and the next begins. It is a well-established finding that, unlike written language, spoken language does not have any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them. This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear. One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them. For example, in the phrase \\"pretty baby,\\" children are more likely to hear the sounds pre and ty heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ty and ba together. In an artificial grammar learning study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task. This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated. To determine if young children have these same abilities Saffran Aslin and Newport exposed 8-month-old infants to an artificial grammar. The grammar was composed of four words, each composed of three nonsense syllables. During the experiment, infants heard a continuous speech stream of these words . Importantly, the speech was presented in a monotone with no cues (such as pauses, intonation, etc.) to word boundaries other than the statistical probabilities. Within a word, the transitional probability of two syllable pairs was 1.0: in the word bidaku, for example, the probability of hearing the syllable da immediately after the syllable bi was 100%. Between words, however, the transitional probability of hearing a syllable pair was much lower: After any given word (e.g., bidaku) was presented, one of three words could follow (in this case, padoti, golabu, or tupiro), so the likelihood of hearing any given syllable after ku was only 33%. To determine if infants were picking up on the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword made up of the same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi. To look more closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport conducted another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month- old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream. =Further Research= This result has been the impetus for much more research on the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition and other areas (see ). In a follow-up to the original report, Aslin, Saffran, and Newport found that even when words and part words occurred equally often in the speech stream, but with different transitional probabilities between syllables of words and part words, infants were still able to detect the statistical regularities and still preferred to listen to the novel part-words over the familiarized words. This finding provides stronger evidence that infants are able to pick up transitional probabilities from the speech they hear, rather than just being aware of frequencies of individual syllable sequences. Another follow-up study examined the extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning. A related finding indicates that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities from a single set of input, suggesting that they are able to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this indicates that infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning. Despite the large role that statistical learning appears to play in lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn to segment words. Statistical learning studies are generally conducted with artificial grammars that have no cues to word boundary information other than transitional probabilities between words. Real speech, though, has many different types of cues to word boundaries, including prosodic and phonotactic information. Together, the findings from these studies of statistical learning in language acquisition indicate that statistical properties of the language are a strong cue in helping infants learn their first language. Phonological Acquisition There is much evidence that statistical learning is an important component of both discovering which phonemes are important for a given language and which contrasts within phonemes are important. Having this knowledge is important for aspects of both speech perception and speech production. =Distributional Learning= Since the discovery of infants‚Äô statistical learning abilities in word learning, the same general mechanism has also been studied in other facets of language learning. For example, it is well-established that infants can discriminate between phonemes of many different languages but eventually become unable to discriminate between phonemes that do not appear in their native language; however, it was not clear how this decrease in discriminatory ability came about. Maye et al. suggested that the mechanism responsible might be a statistical learning mechanism in which infants track the distributional regularities of the sounds in their native language. To test this idea, Maye et al. exposed 6- and 8-month-old infants to a continuum of speech sounds that varied on the degree to which they were voiced. The distribution that the infants heard was either bimodal, with sounds from both ends of the voicing continuum heard most often, or unimodal, with sounds from the middle of the distribution heard most often. The results indicated that infants from both age groups were sensitive to the distribution of phonemes. At test, infants heard either non-alternating (repeated exemplars of tokens 3 or 6 from an 8-token continuum) or alternating (exemplars of tokens 1 and 8) exposures to specific phonemes on the continuum. Infants exposed to the bimodal distribution listened longer to the alternating trials than the non-alternating trials while there was no difference in listening times for infants exposed to the unimodal distribution. This finding indicates that infants exposed the bimodal distribution were better able to discriminate sounds from the two ends of the distribution than were infants in the unimodal condition, regardless of age. This type of statistical learning differs from that used in lexical acquisition, as it requires infants to track frequencies rather than transitional probabilities, and has been named ‚Äúdistributional learning.‚Äù Distributional learning has also been found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants who were exposed to a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults. In a review of the role of distributional learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired. However, it does seem clear that this type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing. =Perceptual Magnet Effect= A related finding regarding statistical cues to phonological acquisition is a phenomenon known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person's native language acts as a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to the same category as the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language. Syntactical Acquisition A statistical learning device has also been proposed as a component of syntactical acquisition for young children. Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared. Later studies expanded these results by looking at the actual behavior of children or adults who had been exposed to artificial grammars. These later studies also considered the role of statistical learning more broadly than the earlier studies, placing their results in the context of the statistical learning mechanisms thought to be involved with other aspects of language learning, such as lexical acquisition. =Experimental Results= Evidence from a series of four experiments conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located in the middle of the sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary. Together these studies suggest that infants are able to extract a substantial amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or in the middle of the sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay. In a similar study, Saffran found that adults and older children (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language which had no cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an ‚Äúincidental‚Äù exposure condition in which participants‚Äô primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language. Although the number of studies dealing with statistical learning of syntactical information is limited, the available evidence does indicate that the statistical learning mechanisms are likely a contributing factor to children's ability to learn their language. Statistical Learning in Bilingualism Much of the early work using statistical learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language, consistent with the process of language acquisition for monolingual speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are bilingual. More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who speak more than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple artificial languages simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages. Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two artificial languages, adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were ‚Äúcongruent‚Äù‚Äîwhen the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent‚Äîa syllable that appeared in the middle of a word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language‚Äîand spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries. Similar work replicates the finding that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in this case). In their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.‚Äôs paradigm, and participants did learn the first artificial language to which they had been exposed better than the second, although participants‚Äô performance was above chance for both languages. While statistical learning improves and strengthens multilingualism, it appears that the inverse is not true. In a study by Yim and Rudoy it was found that both monolingual and bilingual children perform statistical learning tasks equally well. Antovich and Graf Estes found that 14 month old bilingual children are better than monolinguals at segmenting two different artificial languages using transitional probability cues. They suggest that a bilingual environment in early childhood trains children to rely on statistical regularities to segment the speech flow and access two lexical systems. Limitations on Statistical Learning=Word-Referent Mapping= A statistical learning mechanism has also been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated with one of those objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times over the course of the training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials. An alternative hypothesis is that learners in this type of task may be using a ‚Äúpropose-but-verify‚Äù mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge at the end of the training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word vash she might hypothesize that vash refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word vash. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word vash 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of vash (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of vash) and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that vash referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Trueswell et al. conducted a series of experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and- verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word- referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly. Overall, these results, along with similar results from Medina et al., indicate that word meanings may not be learned through a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, which ask participants to hypothesize a mapping even on the first occurrence (i.e., not cross-situationally). However, when the propose-but-verify mechanism has been compared to a statistical learning mechanism, the former was unable to reproduce individual learning trajectories nor fit as well as the latter. =Need for Social Interaction= Additionally, statistical learning by itself cannot account even for those aspects of language acquisition for which it has been shown to play a large role. For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition. Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants‚Äô ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable to take advantage of the statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction. Domain Generality Although the phenomenon of statistical learning was first discovered in the context of language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of ‚Äúwords‚Äù created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.,. Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant's ability to learn his or her language(s). Further evidence for domain general statistical learning was suggested in a study run through the University of Cornell Department of Psychology concerning visual statistical learning in infancy. Researchers in this study questioned whether domain generality of statistical learning in infancy would be seen using visual information. After first viewing images in statistically predictable patterns, infants were then exposed to the same familiar patterns in addition to novel sequences of the same identical stimulus components. Interest in the visuals was measured by the amount of time the child looked at the stimuli in which the researchers named ‚Äúlooking time.‚Äù All ages of infant participants showed more interest in the novel sequence relative to the familiar sequence. In demonstrating a preference for the novel sequences (which violated the transitional probability that defined the grouping of the original stimuli) the results of the study support the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy.

He was lightly campaigned during his racing career, competing in eleven races in five seasons and winning seven times. Until his last competitive season he was raced exclusively in Yorkshire running only at the meetings at York in August and Doncaster in September. Apart from the St Leger, his wins included the York Two-year-old Stake, the Great Subscription Purse and a division of the Oatlands Stakes. On his final appearance he ran a dead heat for the Ascot Gold Cup before being beaten in a run-off by the filly Camarine. After three seasons at stud in England he was exported to the United States where he died in 1841. Background Rowton was a dark-coated chestnut horse with no white markings who stood 15.2 hands high when fully grown. Henry Hall Dixon described him as being \\"as nearly perfection as possible\\", with \\"beautiful quarters\\", a \\"deer-like\\" head and an \\"exquisitely expressive eye\\". He was owned and bred by Edward Petre (1794-1848), a free-spending sportsman and gambler, who was a younger son of Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre. Like the rest of Petre's horses, Rowton was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire. Rowton was ridden in most of his races by his trainer's younger brother Bill Scott. Rowton was the only classic winner sired by Oiseau (1809-1826), a horse who was undefeated in a five race career, and who stood as a breeding stallion in both Ireland and England. Rowton's dam Katherina (also known as Perspective) was a daughter of the Oaks winner Landscape and was also closely related to the St Leger winner Ashton. Racing career=1828: two-year-old season= Rowton began his racing career at York Racecourse in August 1828. He started the 5/4 favourite for the Two-year-old Stake against eleven opponents. He was ridden in aggressive style by Bill Scott, who made use of the whip and at one point barged another runner into the rails before Rowton won \\"rather cleverly\\" by one and a half lengths. The Sporting Magazine's correspondent was not impressed by Rowton's physical appearance, describing him as having \\"a very long carcase\\" and showing \\"too much daylight underneath him to go a long distance\\". At the St Leger meeting at Doncaster Racecourse in September, Rowton ran in the Champagne Stakes, a race which attracted many of the best two-year-olds seen in the North of England that season. Bill Scott was taken ill just before the start of the race and was replaced by Bill Arnull. Rowton finished third of the nine runners behind Cant, a small but \\"pretty\\" colt owned by Lord Sligo. Three days later, Rowton contested the Two-year-old Stake at the same course. He was reunited with Bill Scott and started favourite, but after \\"a most excellent race\\" he was beaten a head by the filly Lady Sarah. =1829: three-year-old season= Rowton did not run as a three-year-old before his run in the Great St Leger Stakes at Doncaster on 15 September, although he had been strongly supported in the betting for the race since early in the year. Despite his lack of a recent run he was made 7/2 favourite in a field of nineteen runners which included The Derby winner Frederick and the previously undefeated colts Voltaire and Sir Hercules. Ridden by Bill Scott, Rowton led from the start and set an extremely strong pace. In the closing stages he was challenged by Voltaire, who had come from well back in the field, but under a \\"severe\\" ride from Scott, Rowton held on to win by half a length, with Sir Hercules in third. Voltaire was considered by some to have been an unlucky loser, with his jockey, Sam Chifney being criticised for his exaggerated waiting tactics. His owner, Lord Darlington however, declined the offer of a match race between the two colts, even when Rowton's connections offered to run the race with the St Leger winner carrying seven pounds more than his rival. Rowton's success was a third consecutive win in the race for John Scott and Edward Petre following Matilda in 1827 and The Colonel in 1828. On the following afternoon, Rowton was able to claim a ¬£350 prize for his owner without having to race when he was allowed to walk over in the Foal Stakes, the other five entrants having been withdrawn. =1830: four-year-old season= John Scott had predicted that Rowton would be better at four, but the horse had little chance to prove his trainer correct as his third season consisted of a single race. On 22 September, one year and four days after his last appearance, he ran in a sweepstakes for four-year-olds over the St Leger course at Doncaster. Ridden as usual by Bill Scott, he started 1/2 favourite and won from his only opponent, Lord Cleveland's colt Stotforth. =1831: five-year-old season= Rowton was slightly more active in 1831, although his campaign was restricted to three races in Yorkshire. On 5 August he competed away from Doncaster for the first time since 1828 when he was one of four horses to contest the two-mile Great Subscription Purse for four- and five- year-olds at York. He started and even money favourite and won by three quarters of a length from Lord Scarborough's four-year-old Windcliffe, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. In September, Rowton appeared at the Doncaster St Leger meeting for the fourth year in succession, his target on this occasion being the Gold Cup over two miles five furlongs. He sustained his first defeat for three years as he finished third of the seven runners behind Mr Wagstaff's three-year-old The Saddler. On the following afternoon he was moved up in distance to contest a sweepstakes over four miles and won by \\"half a head\\" from Medoro after an \\"excellent contest\\". =1832: six-year-old season= In 1832, Petre sold Rowton for 1,000 guineas to the brothers William and Sam Chifney, who formed a trainer-jockey team at their base at Newmarket. Sam Chifney, despite his efforts in the 1829 St Leger, was renowned for his tactical skill, being particularly adept at winning races with a late challenge which became known as the \\"Chifney Rush\\". The Chifney brother brought Rowton south with the Gold Cup at Ascot as their principal objective. On 19 June, the opening day of the Ascot meeting, he was assigned top weight of 129 pounds in the Oatlands Stakes, a handicap race over the Gold Cup distance of two and a half miles. Sam Chifney positioned the 5/2 favourite behind the leaders before making his challenge inside the final furlong. Rowton accelerated into the lead and won comfortably by three-quarters of a length from Paddy and The Saddler, with the 1830 Gold Cup winner Lucetta unplaced. Two days later, Rowton was matched against the outstanding racemare Camarine (ridden by Jem Robinson) in the Gold Cup, with The Saddler being the only other starter. Chifney abandoned his usual waiting tactics and sent Rowton into the lead from the start, setting a steady pace. Robinson produced Camarine with a strong challenge in the straight, but Rowton responded and after a severe contest the race ended in a dead-heat. Chifney again led from the start in the deciding heat, but on this occasion Rowton was unable to repel the filly's challenge and was beaten two lengths. Stud career Rowton was retired from racing and stood as a stallion in Britain for three years. In 1834, the Chifney brothers' financial problems led them to sell him for 1000 guineas to Jem Bland. Rowton sired no major winners but his daughters produced the 1000 Guineas winners Virago and The Flea. In 1835 he was sold to Merritt & Co and exported to stand at Hicksford in Virginia. Rowton suffered from rheumatism after his arrival in the United States and died in July 1841. In death, Rowton was partly returned to Yorkshire, as one of his leg bones was made into the handle of a carving knife used by John Scott in his dining room at Malton.

During World War I he served two spells of duty in France and Belgium in 1914‚Äì15 and 1915‚Äì16, including a period attached to the Connaught Rangers, and was wounded. In 1916 he was seconded in the rank of Captain to the Royal Flying Corps.Gradation list, Annual Army List 1914‚Äì39. In January 1918 de la Bere received a special staff appointment as a Conducting Officer in France, escorting visitors to the armies, and became an Assistant Press Officer in May 1918, retaining that appointment in the British Army of the Rhine after the Armistice with Germany. De la Bere then spent a number of years in staff positions in the War Office, receiving promotion to Major in 1931. In 1935 he returned to regimental duty in command of the Dorsets' regimental depot. Then in 1939 he was promoted to Lieutenant colonel and took command of the 1st Battalion Dorsets. On the outbreak of World War II they were stationed in Malta. The Siege of Malta began on 11 June 1940 following Italy's entry into the war. The island was dependent on supply convoys fighting their way through from Gibraltar or Alexandria, and meanwhile, the garrison and people were subjected to some of the heaviest bombing of the war for a period of over two years. For its part, the island provided a base for air and sea attacks on supply convoys to the Italian and German forces fighting in North Africa. On 27 July 1941 de la Bere, by now a Colonel (promoted 27 July 1940), was placed in command of a new Central Infantry Brigade, formed by a brigade headquarters that had come out from the United Kingdom and by infantry battalions that had been brought in as reinforcements from Egypt. De la Bere was injured in November 1941, but returned to duty within three weeks, and commanded the brigade until the end of the war, ending as an Acting Major-General. Central Brigade was redesignated 3rd (Malta) Infantry Brigade in 1942 and later became 233rd Infantry Brigade. During the siege de la Bere organised gifts and activities to maintain the morale of the civil population.Joslen.

After retirement from the bench in 1994, Carro founded Carro, Velez, Carro & Mitchell (now known as Carro, Carro & Mitchell), a private law firm in New York City. Carro is an ardent advocate for the Hispanic and Latino American community and human rights throughout the world, and has been a major leader in the founding and management of many bar groups, committees and legal and educational associations. He was described by The New York Times as a \\"legendary Justice.\\" Early life and education Carro was born in Orocovis, Puerto Rico on August 21, 1927. His family moved to New York City in 1937 when he was 10 years old and he grew up in East Harlem. Carro graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in 1945. He served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1947 and was a First Lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve from 1949 to 1954. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Fordham University in 1949 and his law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1952. Judge Carro attended one year at New York University's School of Public Administration through the City Executive Program. In addition he received a Masters of Judicial Process from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1984. Early career Growing up, Carro wanted to get social work experience. At the same time that he began law school in 1949, he began working as a social investigator for the city of New York. He continued in this position until 1952. After graduating from Brooklyn Law School in 1952, Carro worked as a probation officer in the Children's Division of the Domestic Relations Court until the fall of 1954. He worked as an officer with the New York City Police Department for one month, but then decided to resign. He preferred working with young people in a more direct, preventative way, before they committed a crime, were arrested and had to go to court. For this reason, he joined the New City Youth Board and worked with the council of Social and Athletic Clubs, otherwise known as the \\"street gang project\\" until 1958. In 1956, while Carro was working with the New City Youth Board, he was admitted to practice law. That year John was appointed to the State Commission Against Discrimination, and he worked as a field representative for the next 4 years. From 1960 to 1961 he was the Associate Director for a joint private, city, state and federally -funded organization, known as Mobilization for Youth, developing youth programs. Carro was appointed an Assistant to the Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1960, remaining at this post until 1965.

Carro was called to testify regarding his knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald. When Carro was a probation officer, he had become acquainted with Oswald. In 1953, when Oswald was 13 years of age, Carro was assigned to the case after Oswald had been found guilty of truancy from school and was remanded to the Youth House. During the Warren investigation in 1964, Carro testified about his interactions with Oswald, his opinions on Oswald's mental and psychiatric state, and whether or not his childhood gave any indication that he would commit any violent act in the future, such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1967, Carro appeared on the CBS Game Show \\"To Tell the Truth\\" in a subject concerning himself and his involvement of Oswald as a youngster. This episode exists on YouTube. Near the close of his testimony, Carro stated \\"Whatever I might say would just be an independent opinion on my own and I don't think that would be that valid.\\" thus concluding that the original psychiatric and social reports would be of most use to the Commission. Judge Carro has appeared in numerous documentaries about the Kennedy assassination. He is one of the few people still alive known to have meaningful interaction with the young Lee Harvey Oswald. Legal experience and court appointments From 1965 to 1969, Carro was in private practice and was law partner with Mary Johnson Lowe, a prominent African American attorney who was later appointed a Federal Court Judge. In 1969, Carro was appointed as Judge of the Criminal Court by New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay. In 1976, Carro became an Acting Supreme Court Justice and in 1977, was officially elected to the Supreme Court. Carro was the first Puerto Rican to be elected to the Supreme Court in the Bronx. Two years later in 1979, Governor Hugh L. Carey appointed Carro to the Appellate Division, First Department. This appointment made Carro the first Puerto Rican to ever sit on the bench as an Appellate Court Justice, which became a very significant and inspirational event for the Latino community and young immigrants across the United States. In 1988 John was nominated to become a Federal Judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which included Manhattan, the Bronx, and Westchester County. However, the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush White House did not act on his nomination for three years and John withdrew his name from consideration in 1991. Carro subsequently served 15 years at his post as an Appellate Court Justice, until his retirement in 1994. During this time he was involved with thousands of cases including personal injury, corporate finance and various commercial, financial, real estate, and criminal law matters. Later career In 1994, Carro retired as a judge and went back to practicing law. He founded the firm Carro, Velez, Carro & Mitchell now known as Carro, Carro & Mitchell with his fellow partners: his son John S. Carro, and Bartly L. Mitchell. John Carro continues to work at the firm in New York City which is best known for its representation of accident victims in negligence cases and its appellate practice. Awards, honors and civic involvement In 1987, Carro was awarded the Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Medal by New York Governor Mario Cuomo. In 1986 Carro was named one of the \\"100 most influential Hispanics in the United States\\".Influentials: A Look Back 20 Years - HispanicBusiness.com Among other numerous awards is a Lifetime Service Award from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Daily News, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, New York University, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the Puerto Rican Bar Association and the Association of Judges of Hispanic Heritage. The Association of Judges of Hispanic Heritage now presents an annual \\"John Carro Award for Judicial Excellence\\". The John Carro Award is presented to a member of the judiciary who manifests both a comprehensive understanding of the law but also a commitment to the preservation of human rights. Past recipients include United States Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor. Throughout his career, Carro has been involved in many bar groups, associations, and committees, and in several instances was a founding member. As a young lawyer, he incorporated or organized the Hispanic or Latino Associations for a number of New York City Departments, such as the Fire Department of New York City. He has taught, lectured, and written on topics related to his practice. Carro was an adjunct professor with the City University of New York from 1972 to 1983, Bronx Community College from 1983 to 1984, Fordham University from 1980 to 1982, Staten Island College from 1977 to 1978 and Lehman College from 1973‚Äì1975. Carro consistently turned down opportunities to teach at the law school level and instead preferred to teach at local New York colleges and speak at local high schools for the opportunity they provided to encourage his students to consider the law as a career choice. Carro taught a popular and comprehensive introduction to the law entitled, \\"The Criminal Justice System and Its Impact on the Poor\\" which did inspire many of his students to pursue a career in law. He spoke at DeWitt Clinton H.S. in the Bronx about the legal profession and inspired student Rolando Acosta, who later followed in Carro's footsteps and was appointed to the Appellate Division, First Department by Governor Eliot L. Spitzer. Carro has traveled worldwide as an independent legal observer for Amnesty International investigating human rights abuses. While serving in the Criminal Court, Judge Carro was named to a Presidential Task Force headed by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird to study racism and discrimination in the United States Armed Forces throughout the world. The task force consisted of top grade judge advocates from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, including Generals and Admirals. Judge Carro, as requested by the Task Force, was given a year's leave of absence from the Criminal Court bench to work on the report and was given an equivalent rank of a 1 star general and a diplomatic passport. From this experience Carro developed an interest in international human rights. He has visited Chile and Argentina as part of a Task Force on the treatment of incarcerated citizens in those countries.

When he arrived in Milwaukee harbor in 1841, there were 2,000 inhabitants, the roads were crude, most of the area was oak prairie, and the towns of the region had not yet been settled. Within 20 years, with the help of an influx of skilled engravers, especially from Germany, his firm was producing fine detailed maps, many of which became collectors items. He published 55 different maps during his life. An 1880s map of Milwaukee sold 100,000 copies, at a time when the population of the city was 150,000. Life and career Chapman was born in Southampton, Massachusetts. He learned the printer's trade working for the Springfield Republican. In 1836 he spent a year at New York University, and then taught school for four years, before moving to Prairieville, (now Waukesha), Wisconsin Territory, in 1841. His introduction to map publishing came when he and Philetus C. Hale published Increase Lapham's famous early maps of Wisconsin. By 1850, he had branched out on his own. Chapman was most well known as a map publisher. However, he was an educator in his early career, and remained heavily involved in the support of education throughout his life, even after his professional focus changed. He was a Commissioner of the Milwaukee Public Schools from 1856-1859 . When the office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction was inaugurated he was offered the position but declined. Later he was a member of the first Wisconsin State Normal School Board of Trustees.

Background  Skoda, a 658-ton barquentine, was built in Kingsport, Nova Scotia, designed by veteran master shipbuilder Ebenezer Cox. The barquentine marked the end of his thirty-year shipbuilding career, and was also the last deep sea vessel built and launched in Kingsport, bringing the shipbuilding era to a close at a yard that built some of the largest sailing ships in Canada. Skoda was commissioned for C. Rufus Burgess of Wolfville, Nova Scotia, who was the largest builder and owner of ships in the area. The vessel was named a patent medicine factory in Wolfville, also owned by Burgess. Skoda was launched on June 1, 1893.

G. Jung.Picture Archive webpage on the Jung Institute in Zurich website. He was also the first Emeritus Professor of Art Therapy at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. Michael Edwards was born in 1930 near Epping Forest on the eastern outskirts of London, England. After national service he studied at the St Albans Art College with the painter Norman Adams. Edwards was greatly influenced by Irene Champernowne, the founder of the Withymead centre in Devon, a therapeutic community where Edwards and other artists and therapists lived together with people in fragile mental health. Withymead was based on Jungian ideas and belief in the healing power of the visual and expressive arts.Stevens, A.; Withymead: a Jungian community for the healing arts (1991). Sigo Press. Edwards was the course director for the annual residential summer trainings at the Champernowne Trust until 2005. Edwards was an early and leading proponent of the field of art therapy. He was a founding member, chair, fellow and honorary life member of the British Association of Art Therapists. In 1969 he set up one of the first art therapy training courses in the world, located in Birmingham. The course later offered a master's degree. Around 1981 he established the first university-based art therapy training program in Canada, at Concordia University in Montreal, which later included a master's degree. This Masters of Arts in Art Therapy degree remains unique in Canada. Edwards' efforts to preserve and bring order to the archive of patient art collected by Jung and his followers was deeply related to his understanding of the importance Jung placed on his own art making and that of his patients. Edwards observed that Jung made art about his inner experiences as a \\"vivid source of personal insight into his situation; this, in turn, informed the development of his psychological theories. No other major psychologist has attended to his own inner life through imagery in this way\\". As a Jungian teacher and practitioner, Edwards influenced the field of art therapy internationally to appreciate the potential of symbols and images to carry multiple and ambiguous meanings. He taught that approaching a painting or a drawing as if it were \\"independent and semi-autonomous\\"Edwards, M. (1987). Jungian analytic art therapy. In Judith A. Rubin (Ed.), Approaches to art therapy: Theory and technique (pp. 92-113).

Originally named Lewis Joseph Bedinsky, he also used the pseudonyms Louis Bideu and Billy Joe Hunter, among others. Early life Lewis Bedinsky was born in El Paso, Texas, the son of Joseph Bedinsky, a Jewish immigrant from Odessa, Ukraine, who owned a small garment factory in the town, and his wife Sara (n√©e Newman) who had been born in New York City. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he moved with his mother and uncle, Max Newman, to Boyle Heights in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City College and then Santa Barbara State College. West Texas Music Hall of Fame: Billy Joe & The Checkmates . Retrieved 14 February 2013 In 1941, he and his mother changed their surname by decree to Bedell. Rob Finnis, Liner notes: The Dore Story Vol.1, 2011, reprinted at LinerNotes.com. Retrieved 14 February 2013 During World War II, he worked in an aircraft factory, but in 1946 he teamed up with college friend Doug Mattson to form a comedy duo. Bedell and Mattson appeared together in clubs in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, New York City and elsewhere, performing an act that involved them miming and clowning around on stage to current pop hits and comedy records such as those by Spike Jones. By the early 1950s, the pair had become resident comedians at Billy Gray's Band Box, a supper club on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. The pair split up in 1953, and Bedell began working as a solo comedian on Los Angeles TV station KTLA, as well as continuing in clubs. He also had a short-lived TV show, The Lew Bedell Show, on WOR-TV in New York City in the early 1950s. By 1955 Bedell had started work for a music publisher, Meadowlark Music. That year he set up a new record label, Era, with his uncle Max Newman and cousin Herb Newman, and became its comptroller. The company soon appointed Buddy Bregman as musical director, and he in turn brought singer Gogi Grant to the label. Grant's successes with songs like \\"Suddenly There's a Valley\\" and \\"The Wayward Wind\\", co-written by Herb Newman, established the Era label. This was consolidated after the label won an action against Grant for breach of contract when she signed with RCA in 1957. Era signed several singers, such as Glen Glenn, in an attempt to break into the rock and roll market, but had little success. However, in 1958 the label had another major hit with \\"Chanson d'Amour\\", by Art and Dotty Todd. Bedell married Dolores Ethel Mae \\"DeDe\\" Barrymore (born 1930) in 1956. She was the divorced daughter of actors John Barrymore and Dolores Costello. The couple had two children: a son, Dor√© Lewis Bedell (born 1957), who was named for Lew Bedell's grandmother Dora; and a daughter Stephanie Mae Bedell (born 1966). DeDe also had two children from her first marriage.

The label's first hit was \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" by The Teddy Bears, written by and featuring the young Phil Spector. Bedell and Newman decided to end their partnership in 1959, with Newman retaining control of Era and Bedell running the Dor√© label. Billboard, Sister labels split to go it on own, 8 June 1959.

Retrieved 14 February 2013 In 1961, Bedell suggested to session leader Ernie Freeman that he and fellow musicians - including drummer Earl Palmer, guitarist Ren√© Hall, bassist Red Callender and marimba player Julius Wechter - record a version of a Maxwell House advertising jingle. The record, \\"Percolator (Twist)\\", was credited to Billy Joe & the Checkmates and rose to no.10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1962. Bedell claimed a co- writing credit using the pseudonym \\"Louis Bideu\\", and, to help promote the record, used an old college photo of himself, as \\"Billy Joe Hunter\\". The label released a further 18 singles credited to Billy Joe & The Checkmates but recorded by studio musicians over the following years.

Detroit: Gale, 2003. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 14 Feb. 2013. was an American author, poet, and librarian. Barker was born in Farmington, New Hampshire, a descendant of early settlers of Massachusetts. She attended the University of New Hampshire, graduating with a B.A. in 1934 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. While still an undergraduate, she won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition with her poetry collection The Dark Hills Under (1933). It was published with a foreword by Stephen Vincent Benet and was well reviewed. One of the judges had detected some literary affinities between her work and that of Robert Frost, so UNH President Edward M. Lewis asked Barker to send a copy of the collection to Frost, Lewis' friend and correspondent. Frost was enraged by what he perceived as anti-Puritan and anti-theistic sentiments in Barker's poetry and bizarrely insisted that Barker was the illegitimate descendant of a person described in her poem \\"Portrait\\". In what his biographer described as \\"a characteristic act of poetic retaliation\\", Frost penned the ribald poem \\"Pride of Ancestry\\" and the religious poem \\"Not All There\\". He did not tell Lewis of his objections to Barker's work and there is no record that there was any correspondence between Frost and Barker. Barker did not publish another book for sixteen years. She graduated with an A.M. in English from Radcliffe College in 1938 and a degree in library science from the Pratt Institute School of Information and Library Science in 1941. Beginning in 1940, she worked as a librarian at the New York Public Library, primarily in the American history section. In 1949, she published her debut novel, Peace My Daughters, about the Salem witch trials, which she believed her ancestors had attended. She wrote a series of successful formula historical novels, most of them set in her native New England and some with supernatural elements. Two of her novels, Rivers Parting (1952) and Swear by Apollo (1959), were Literary Guild selections. The success of these novels enabled her to leave the New York Public Library in 1953 and she moved to Concord, New Hampshire. Barker was found inside a car in her garage in Penacook, New Hampshire, dead of carbon monoxide poisoning. The car windows were up and the gas tank was empty. Her death was ruled a suicide. When Frost biographer Lawrance Thompson attempted to access her papers, he was told by her executor that they all \\"had disappeared under mysterious circumstances\\". However, typescripts, galleys, and plate proofs of the novels Liza Bowe, Swear by Apollo, and The Last Gentleman are in the University of New Hampshire Library.

Bad√® examining an artifact, circa 1933 William Frederic Bad√® (January 22, 1871 ‚Äì March 4, 1936), perhaps best known as the literary executor and biographer of John Muir, was a versatile scholar of wide interests. As an archaeologist, he led the excavation of Tell en-Nasbeh in Palestine, now believed on the basis of his work to be the biblical city of Mizpah in Benjamin. He was also an ordained Moravian minister, a professor of ancient languages, a theologian and bible scholar, a mountaineer, a conservationist and a naturalist. Born and raised in Minnesota, he studied at Moravian College and its seminary as well as other universities. He served on the faculties of Moravian Theological Seminary and then the Pacific School of Religion. He also served as interim president and subsequently as dean of the Pacific School of Religion and was founding director of the school's Palestine Institute. He was president of the Sierra Club 1919-1922 and edited the Sierra Club Bulletin for 12 years. Early life and education Zoar Moravian Church, Carver County, Minnesota, on the National Register of Historic Places and at the core of the community where Bad√® grew up. Bad√®'s parents are buried here. Bad√® was born in Carver, Minnesota, and grew up a few miles northwest of there on a farm near Waconia, Minnesota, in the rural community associated with Zoar Moravian Church. He was the first of ten surviving children of William Bruns (1831-1902) and Anna Voigt Bad√® (1850-1910), immigrants from Germany. His father was a scholar who left Hanover for political reasons; on arriving in the United States in 1858 he worked on riverboats and later farmed. Anna Voigt immigrated from Prussia in 1868; they married at Carver in 1870.Colby, Yale, Lockley, Census, Hamersly, Zorn (a) Bad√® attended public schools but also studied with a private tutor. He grew up speaking English and German and learned Greek and Latin as a boy. He attended Moravian College and the associated seminary, earning his way by playing organ and giving music lessons, attaining AB and BD degrees. He was ordained at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1894, and went on to Yale Divinity School to study ancient languages and Arabic, earning a second BD in 1895. After short pastoral appointments at Unionville, Michigan, and Chaska, Minnesota, he returned to Moravian College as instructor of Greek and German, earning his PhD from that institution in 1898 with a thesis on the Assyrian flood legends. He studied geology at Lehigh University (1901-1902). He also studied in Berlin (1905) and in Paris (1909). In adulthood, he could read 14 languages and converse fluently in seven.Colby, Yale, Lockley, Bad√® Museum, The Pacific, Schwartze, Hamersly Academic appointments Bad√® as a young professor, 1917 or earlier Bad√® was appointed professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Literature at Moravian Theological Seminary, serving 1898-1902. He was appointed professor of Old Testament Literature and Semitic Languages, Pacific Theological Seminary (later Pacific School of Religion), Berkeley, California, in 1902, holding that position the rest of his life.Colby, Bad√® Museum Bad√® was dean of the Federated Summer School of Theology at Berkeley, 1907. He served as interim president of the Pacific School of Religion 1920-1922, subsequently serving as dean 1922-1928 and as director of the school's Palestine Institute (which he founded) from 1926 until his death. As a professor, Bad√® was among the first in the United States to teach the then-new and controversial Documentary Hypothesis concerning the origins and authorship of the Pentateuch. In 1915, he published The Old Testament in the Light of Today, A Study in Moral Development, developing themes he had presented eight years earlier in a series of lectures \\"The Idea of God in the Old Testament\\" at the Berkeley Summer School of Theology.Zorn (b), Bad√® The Old Testament in the Light of Today Editor and biographer of John Muir An avid outdoorsman with strong interests in ornithology and botany, Bad√® first met John Muir through the Sierra Club, which he joined in 1903. After Muir's death in 1914, Muir's daughters asked Bad√® to serve as literary executor and prepare Muir's unpublished writings for publication. Bad√® compiled and edited materials from Muir's journals and other unpublished writings as well as short published pieces, resulting in publication of A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf, The Cruise of the Corwin, and Steep Trails. Bade also wrote the preface for Muir's Travels in Alaska and edited new versions of Muir's earlier books, leading to an 8-volume set The Writings of John Muir, and the two-volume biography Life and Letters of John Muir.Colby, Sierra Club, William F.Bad√® Introduction to The Cruise of the Corwin and Editor's Note for Steep Trails For the Life and Letters of John Muir Bad√® collected over 2000 letters from Muir's correspondents. He also worked out Muir's itinerary in Canada from the dates and locations in a collection of Muir's botanical specimens discovered in an attic in Wisconsin.Colby, Sierra Club Archaeological investigation of Tell en-Nasbeh Expedition note card with drawing of a jug found at Tell en- Nasbeh, illustrating the manner of recordkeeping Wax impression of the Seal of Jaazaniah, discovered by Bad√® at Tell en-Nasbeh Bad√® had a long-standing interest in archaeology. He traveled in the Middle East in 1909 and had planned to start fieldwork in Syria in 1914, but World War I and his appointment as Muir's executor intervened. He continued to study archaeology, including the methods employed in desert areas of the American Southwest. In 1925 he went to Palestine to organize an excavation, having corresponded with William F. Albright to identify suitable locations for excavation. Albright considered Tell en-Nasbeh, (about 7 miles north of Jerusalem) a possible location of the biblical city of Mizpah in Benjamin but favored Nabi Samwil as the most likely. Bad√® chose to excavate Tell en-Nasbeh which proved to be the correct location. The site was initially identified in part based on a German World War I aerial photograph showing evidence of walls and alteration of vegetation over buildings. Bad√® brought his characteristic thoroughness and organizational talent to bear, seeking advice from prominent archaeologists including Albright and Clarence S. Fisher. Bad√® led five seasons of excavation (1926, 1927, 1929, 1932, 1935), meticulously documenting artifacts and mapping the site. Among the artifacts was the onyx seal of Ja'azanaiah, Servant of the King, plausibly identified with a Judean officer of that name mentioned twice in the Bible. Bad√® funded the excavation in part with royalties from the Muir books and with gifts from friends. The identification of Tell En-Nasbeh with Mizpah is now generally accepted. As of 1988, no other Palestinian site of comparable size had been excavated as thoroughly.Zorn (b), Colby, Hamersly, Bad√® Museum In this investigation, Bad√® employed and refined the Reisner- Fisher method, dividing the site into 10-meter squares and excavating these in strips. All artifacts including potshards were drawn to scale on millimeter- gridded file cards. The excavation was meticulously mapped and the site, operations, and artifacts were extensively photographed. Bad√® documented his methods in A Manual of Excavation in the Near East, published in 1934. This was the first book dedicated to documenting the work of an excavation and the development of its methodology. It served as a guide for field workers for many years.Zorn (b), Colby, Bad√® 1934, Bad√® Museum Bad√® was the first archaeologist to document and record fingerprints on pottery as a means to track the work of individual potters.Bad√® 1934 p 45, Branigan Bad√® died of a stroke 4 March 1936, before the analysis of the excavation was complete. The full reports were completed by his associates and published in 1947. The collection remains in the Bad√® Museum at the Pacific School of Religion.New York Post, Yale, Zorn (b), Bad√® Museum Civic and professional activities While in Pennsylvania, Bad√® edited The Moravian for one year. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Chautauqua faculty in charge of botany. He sang bass and chaired the program committee for the Bethlehem Bach Choir in its early years.Schwartze, Colby, Walters, The Pacific Bad√® served on the board of the Sierra Club from 1907-1936. He worked prominently with Muir and other members on the Hetch Hetchy Valley campaign, including serving as vice president of the Society for Preservation of National Parks. He edited the Sierra Club Bulletin 1910-1922 and served as the fourth president of the club, 1919-1922. As part of his work with the Sierra Club he headed the California Associated Societies for the Preservation of Wild Life for many years. He was California state chairman of the Commission for Relief in Belgium and Northern France 1915-1917, vice president of the American Alpine Club 1920-1922, and a trustee of Mills College 1918-1931.Colby, Yale, Sierra Club He served on the board of the School of American Research of the Archaeological Institute of America at Santa Fe 1929-1936, and was president of the Society for Biblical Literature and Exegesis in 1930.Colby, Yale, Society of Biblical Literature Family In 1906, Bad√® married Evelyn Marianne (Mary) Ratcliff (b. 1879), a clergyman's daughter and a 1901 mathematics and physics graduate of the University of California, whom he had met on a Sierra Club outing. She died the following year. They had one daughter, Evelyn Mary (1907-2000) who in 1931 married Sidney L. Gulick Jr. (1902-1988). He was a son of Japan scholar and peace activist Sidney Gulick and later served as professor of English and Dean of Arts and Sciences at San Diego State University.Hamersly, Colby, Yale, College of Arms, University of California, Sierra Club Bulletin, Berkeley Daily Gazette, Social Security Death Index, San Diego State University Library In 1917 Bad√® married another Sierra Club member, Elizabeth Le Breton Marston (1884-1987), daughter of George Marston of San Diego, whom he had met in the course of his war-relief work. Part of their honeymoon was spent retracing John Muir's \\"Thousand-mile Walk\\", and some of his Alaska travels. They had two children, Elizabeth Le Breton (Betsy, 1922-2008) and William George (1924-2012). Betsy, who in 1968 married Korea scholar Wilbur D. Bacon (1926-1971), was for many years residence director of International House, Berkeley.

His work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, the James A. Michener Art Museum, the Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, New Jersey, and the Delaware Art Museum, among other places. Stirner also participated in exhibitions in Taiwan, Hungary, and Italy. Stirner was born in Bad Wildbad, Germany before his family immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He started his career in Philadelphia, opening several shops and working as an art professor at the Moore College of Art, Swarthmore College, Temple University, and the Tyler School of Art. In 1983, Stirner moved to Easton, Pennsylvania. Stirner spent most of his later life revitalizing the arts scene in Easton and the city of Easton honored him by creating the \\"Karl Stirner Arts Trail.\\" Biography=Early life= Karl Stirner was born in Bad Wildbad, Germany in 1923 to Pauline (n√©e Gunn) and Karl Stirner. He was the youngest of five children. His family immigrated to the United States in 1927 where they settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a child, Stirner considered himself an enthusiastic naturalist: > As a child I had‚Äîand still have‚Äîa great love of nature. Every frog, bird, > insect‚Äîany living creature‚Äîwas of extraordinary interest. Minerals, crystals > of quartz and garnet, shells called me. I loved it all, and engaged in a > constant quest for every facet of the natural world. Stirner attended Dobbins Vocational School from grades 6 to 8 (1934 to 1936). In 1941, Stirner enrolled in the Drexel Institute of Art to study mechanical engineering. However, Stirner dropped out after only six months, not lasting a full year at this school. Stirner then worked as an industrial designer before entering the military. Stirner served in the Army during World War II in the Philippines and New Guinea from 1943 to 1946. =Career= Stirner's interest in metalworking stemmed from his father, who was a fine jeweler. After returning from the military, Stirner opened an experimental machine shop in Germantown Philadelphia in 1946. There he designed precision mechanical devices. Some of his prototypes included a capsule loading machine for pharmacists and a fishing reel. In 1948, Stirner opened a metal arts studio that he ran until 1957. Stirner created metal furniture and ecclesiastical items in this studio. In 1956, Stirner opened his own metal-working shop, Karl Stirner Ornamental Ironworks, in Germantown, Philadelphia. He sold iron furniture and sculptures at this shop, as well as led lessons on welding and other sculptural processes. Students from the Tyler School of Art visited the shop to learn welding and other skills. Karl Stirner continued teaching at the Moore College of Art and Design where he taught classes in 1955, despite having little formal education and no real artistic background. He then became the director of the Metal Sculpture Department at the Tyler School of Art in 1957 and later taught courses there, including basic design and art history at Temple University, Moore College of Art and Design, and Swarthmore College. Between 1957 and 1975, Stirner's work was shown at the Delaware Museum of Art (1959), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1960 and 1963), the Philadelphia Print Club (1963), the Museum of Modern Art (1963), the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts (1963 and 1975), the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1975), the Fort Worth Museum of Art (1975), the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art (1975), and the Pratt Graphics Center (1975). Stirner was also involved in architectural design and construction. Between 1969 and 1971, Stirner built houses in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He also designed and built Hartford Square, a residential zone in West Chester, Pennsylvania that was a former industrial zone. In 1982, Stirner moved to Brooklyn, New York and opened the Stirner- Unangst Gallery in New York City. Stirner then relocated to Easton, Pennsylvania in 1983 where he spent the rest of his life. Stirner moved into a former warehouse and sewing factory at 230 Ferry Street, Easton, Pennsylvania and went on to open the Karl Stirner Gallery, art and dance studios, and commercial spaces. His purchase of an old industrial building on Ferry Street marked the beginning of the \\"Easton Experiment\\" in 1982, which then turned into \\"The Easton Arts Building\\". Over the next 17 years, Stirner dedicated his time to revitalizing the arts scene in Easton. Between 1985 and 2013, Stirner's work was shown in Cedar Crest College (1985), the University of Connecticut Health Center (1987), Fairleigh Dickinson University (1900), The Gallery at the State Theater Center for the Arts in Easton, Pennsylvania (1993), the Grounds for Sculpture show in Hamilton, New Jersey (1995), the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania (1999), the Allentown Art Museum (2000 and 2006), James A. Michener Art Museum (2001 and 2013), First International Steel and Iron Sculpture Festival in Kaohsiung (2002), the Janos Pannonius Museum in P√©cs, Hungary (2002), the Pratt Institute Sculpture Park (2004), the Tufts University Art Gallery (2005), the American Art Festival in Genoa, Italy (2008), and the Payne Gallery at Moravian College (2013). =Personal life= Stirner had three marriages throughout his lifetime. He married his first wife, Barbara Lund (1936-1957), in 1955 and they were together until she took her own life at 21 years old. Stirner was deeply affected by her death and created \\"Barbara in a Box,\\" a steel-framed black- and-white portrait from their wedding, as a way to honor her memory. He then married Heather Harland and had three children: Heather (born 1962), Noelle (born 1967), and Jonas (born 1970). His son, Jonas Stirner, became a sculptor. In 2010, Karl Stirner married Gay Elwell (1958-2012). She died only two years later at the age of 54. Karl Stirner also enjoyed traveling to various places around the world to study and display his art. He traveled to Mexico between 1969 and 1971 to study pre-Columbian art. He also spent time from 1971 until his death traveling to Guatemala, Mexico, Italy, France, England, and Turkey. Stirner died at age 92 on February 18, 2016 at his home in Easton. Art=Metalwork= Stirner was a self-taught artist whose main focus was metalwork. He produced metal sculptures and engravings with metal, typically iron and steel, from Bethlehem Steel, shipwrecks, and junkyards. In his work, Stirner would bend, shape, and weld the metal into various forms in order to test the various ways he could manipulate it for his art. Stirner was praised for his ability to transform metal and give it new life. > Karl Stirner, when sculpting, fuses natural materials with man-made ones. He > contracts smooth surfaces with rough and pitted ones to form organic shapes. > Karl Stirner's career with steel sculpture began in 1928, after Catalan > sculptor and painter, Julio Gonz√°lez taught him welding. Stirner's artistic focus was exploring how to put his knowledge, experience, and dreams into a sculpture. While the piece of metal may vaguely resemble a bucket, step ladder, or stick figure, the piece typically represents one of Stirner's dreams. Most of the pieces of Stirner's metalwork were untitled. =Style= Much of Karl Stirner's work is considered to embody an abstract style. Stirner used his metalwork and steel sculptures to translate and express many of his inner feelings and thoughts. Stirner's sculptures typically fall into two subcategories of the abstract: expressionism and constructivist. His expressionist sculptures have been described as \\"anxiety- ridden\\" while his constructivist sculptures have been described as \\"depressive\\". This is because they appear to elicit depressive emotions and feelings of internal conflict. The \\"dream-like\\" aspect of his work is supposedly inspired by Stirner's unconscious state. A work of his that is most notable for being dream-like is Head of a Woman and Woman in the Garden. =Exhibitions and awards= *1859: Solo show at the Delaware Museum of Art. *1956: Group show held in The Print Club, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stirner was awarded the Lessing J. Resenwald Prize for his woodcut, The Forces of Time. *1959: Solo show in the Delaware Museum of Art in Wilmington, Delaware. *1963: **Solo show of 52 engravings at the Philadelphia Print Club. **Group show held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. *2015: Stirner received an Honorary Degree from Lafayette College. Stirner and his work greatly influenced Steve Tobin, causing Tobin to organize exhibitions at the Payne Gallery of Moravian College and the James A. Michener Art Museum to present Stirner's life work. Stirner and Tobin met each other in 1990 after Tobin heard Stirner on National Public Radio (NPR) promoting Easton, Pennsylvania's up-and-coming art scene. The Karl Stirner Arts Trail Stirner is memorialized in Easton, Pennsylvania by the Karl Stirner Arts Trail (formerly the Bushkill Trail) that opened along the Bushkill Creek in 2011. The trail extends from the Delaware River, through historic downtown Easton, and along the banks of the Bushkill Creek. The 2.5-mile-long trail connects Third Street with the Lehigh Valley Silk Mills redevelopment project along 13th Street. The arts trail contains works by Karl Stirner and other local and international artists, including Willie Cole, David Kimball Anderson, and Patricia Meyerowitz. It has been stated that the philosophy of the Arts Trail includes environmental sustainability as well as public stewardship of an urban \\"green infrastructure.\\"http://karlstirnerartstrail.org/about-us/ Currently, Jim Toia, an artist and Lafayette College professor, is lead administrator of the trail. The ribbon cutting ceremony was held on November 3, 2011. The trail now includes the \\"Young Masters Wall\\" which exhibits the paintings of area youth on a rotating basis.https://karlstirnerartstrail.org/art/the-young-masters- wall/ =Artwork= The trail has fifteen sculptures that were chosen by the Board of Governance of the Karl Stirner Arts Trail, a nonprofit organization that includes members of Lafayette College, art experts, and city officials. The first sculpture on the trail is Stirner's red steel arch. The arch represents not only Stirner's style, but also his contribution to the art scene of Easton. The other seven sculptures include three pieces of Willie Cole's Grace Gate, Jack & Jill and The Jungle; Loren Madsen's Nobori; David Kimball Andersen's Nitrogen & Hydrogen; Patricia Weyerowiz's Ellipse; Paul Deery's Water Way. Also, at the end of the trail there is an ongoing community project between the youth of Easton schools and organizations called \\"The Young Master's Wall\\". This wall features paintings directly on a rock wall. In 2017, the city added more sculptures by Steve Tobin. Possible Realities Two Possible Realities Two is the result of a call for environmentally- focused entries in 2015. Each year over twenty-five local artists and public vote for the ideas that they consider the best. The artwork that receives the most votes will become a \\"reality\\". The winning artist will receive a stipend of 4,000 dollars to produce and install their work. Water Way by Paul Deery was chosen in 2015 as the first piece of Possible Realities Two artwork. It is a stone-line trail that follows the Bushkill Creek. The artist intended for people to feel the flow of water while they walk along the path. The installation of Water Way was executed from July 11 to August 15, 2015.

He is the author of the book \\"The Forgotten Talent\\" which is an autobiographical work with emphasis on the Biblical practice of \\"Laying on of hands\\" to obtain healing for the afflicted.  Early years  Peddie‚Äôs desire to be a preacher began when he was just seven years of age. He and some of his young friends would play at \\"Gospel Meetings\\", a game in which one boy would kneel encircled by the others and act as the preacher. During one of these games, Peddie made an appeal to God in what he later referred to as his \\"First original prayer\\". The appeal was that God would make him a preacher of the Gospel.  Education  In 1901 at the age of 14, Peddie reached the stage where he had to decide whether to continue his studies or go out into the world and earn a living. He managed to secure a County Council Bursary for ¬£20 ‚Äì approx. ¬£860 in today‚Äôs money ‚Äì which made further education possible. At this point, Peddie felt daunted at the prospect of leaving the security of his home area for the city of Aberdeen. He would state later that prayer brought him the necessary courage to go forward. Peddie not only completed 3 years at Aberdeen‚Äôs Gordon's College but then won 2 other bursaries that enabled him to enter the University of Aberdeen, from which he graduated 4 years later. In 1910 he entered Divinity Hall, becoming ordained to the ministry on 17 May 1917. Peddie was Minister of Kennoway United Free Church and then the High United Free Church in Aberdeen followed by 6 years as Minister of Westbourne Church, Barrhead, Glasgow.  Ministry begins and the Gorbals  Peddie stated in \\"The Forgotten Talent\\" that it was in the Gorbals area of Glasgow that he realised his real life work had begun. He stated that his day-to-day life with its duties covered three worlds. The \\"Ordinary Congregational World\\" of church members, the \\"Home Mission World\\" where he and fellow workers would minister to poorer people, encouraging them to come to church, and lastly the world Peddie described as \\"The most wonderful and fascinating world of all\\", the criminal underworld, which was made up of gangs of youths.  Peddie and the gangs  In his book, Peddie stated that at that time in the Gorbals of Glasgow there were thirty gangs, each consisting of some two hundred members. Confrontations between the gangs often erupted into violent street battles, with innocent passers-by getting caught up and injured. Peddie saw that a major cause of the gang problem was unemployment coupled with American gangster films that glamorised the violent and sometimes fatal lifestyle. Completely undaunted by their fearsome reputation, Peddie reasoned that \\"... if these lads would not come to church, it was the Church‚Äôs duty to go to them.\\" In the two years that followed, Peddie transformed the thirty gangs into thirty \\"Clubs\\" which gave the previous gang members a sense of purpose and fulfilment through work schemes such as a firewood factory and an advertising agency among others, all organised by Peddie. Thirty years later, Peddie stated that over seventy five percent of those former gang members went on to be decent, respectable citizens.  Healing ministry and \\"The Forgotten Talent\\"  Peddie‚Äôs desire to incorporate healing into his ministry came about in 1942 when he himself became ill after conducting a wedding. While recovering in hospital, he befriended a young man who was terminally ill and was being sent home to die. Peddie lamented the fact that the Church world could do little for the ill man except \\"... pray with him, comfort and help him to accept his fate.\\" Upon leaving hospital, Peddie determined to change this powerless situation by studying his Bible on the subject of healing. Having studied the scriptures, he became convinced that a minister of the Gospel could and should be able to lay hands on the sick to procure a healing. Peddie determined to wait before God in prayer for a sign that he was to begin praying for the sick. He states in \\"The Forgotten Talent\\" that he received a vision of a large nail driven into the palm of one of his hands. This was the confirmation Peddie had been waiting for, and his healing ministry had begun. In \\"The Forgotten Talent\\" there are several chapters devoted to the healings that allegedly took place under Peddie‚Äôs ministry. He also saw the need to share his experiences with the aim of training other ministers to take up the ministry of healing. Peddie made it quite clear that he was in no way against the world of medicine, but rather looked on his ministry as a way of helping a patient after doctors had done all they could. He also stated that praying for a person could help them respond more quickly and effectively to the doctors treatment. At all times Peddie maintained the greatest respect for the world of Medicine, having himself been hospitalised at one point. He stated that during his time in hospital \\"... the doctors and nurses gave me the kindest possible treatment and constant attention.\\" Peddie‚Äôs book \\"The Forgotten Talent\\" was published in 1961 by Oldbourne Books and has gone through several editions since. It is currently out of print. Peddie died on 14 January 1968 in Kilsyth, Dunbartonshire.

It follows the adventures of eight-year-old Winchell Adams in the extraordinary world of Mischief City. While in this fantasy world, Winchell is accompanied by Maxine, another eight-year-old, and her two monsters Hey Hey and Mr. Cube. The group often faces odd and unusual problems (such as bathtub races and stopping a meteor of solid peas from hitting the planet) most of which are a direct result of Maxine's troublesome older brother Duane. The series first aired on January 4, 2005. Storyline Each episode follows a fairly consistent plot. The episodes begin in Wichell's house where Winchell is confronted with a real-world problem (such as his younger sister stealing his sea chimps or realizing how small he is) but before he can solve it he is whisked away to the fantasy world of Mischief City. There he is immediately greeted by Maxine and her two monsters Hey Hey and Mr. Cube. Maxine usually informs Winchell of some trouble or event occurring in Mischief City which the group attends to, resulting in an adventure. Once the adventure in Mischief City is concluded, Winchell returns to the real world and is able to deal with the initial problem. Characters=Winchell Adams= Voiced by Austin di Lulio An eight-year-old child with red hair, freckles and a yellow striped shirt. As the main character, Winchell constantly switches between the real world and the fantasy world of Mischief City and must deal with problems in both worlds as a result. He often provides imaginative solutions to the Mischief City problems and has demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of how this fantasy world works. Often, Winchell even surpasses the knowledge that Mischief City's own inhabitants have of their world. =Maxine= Voiced by Annick Obonsawin An eight-year-old inhabitant of Mischief City. She wears large purple glasses and an orange shirt with striped sleeves. Her hair is tied into pony tails which also function as helicopter blades allowing Maxine to fly. She is Winchell's primary friend in the series and often provides Winchell with the current events of Mischief City when he arrives. She is the owner and caretaker of the two monsters Hey Hey and Mr. Cube. She has a villainous older brother named Duane. =Hey Hey= Voiced by Adrian Truss A green monster with a pear-shaped body, downward-facing horns and large nose. Dimwitted and inarticulate, Hey Hey provides hilarity through stupidity and often does so with his close companion Mr. Cube. Both have a pet/friend relationship with Maxine, as she is their owner but treats them as equals. =Mr. Cube= Voiced by John Stocker A red monster with a cube-shaped body, upward-facing horns and no nose. As dimwitted as Hey Hey but with a more refined dialect, Mr. Cube also provides humour through stupidity and is a close companion of Hey Hey. The two are nearly always together and have a brother-like relationship though it is unclear if they are indeed related. =Duane= Voiced by Peter Oldring The recurring antagonist of the series, Duane is the older brother of Maxine. Greedy, selfish and power-hungry Duan has been a constant cause of dismay in Mischief City. As a result, he hasn't many friends and has earned the dislike of both Maxine and her monsters as well as Winchell. =Minor characters= * Clio (voiced by Annick Obonsawin) ‚Äì Winchell's baby sister * Mrs. Adams (voiced by Linda Ballantyne) ‚Äì Winchell's mother * Mr. Adams (voiced by Peter Keleghan) ‚Äì Winchell's father * Mr. Square (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì Duane's Monster Dog Episodes=Season 1= { |- ! # !

At around this time, she won a photography prize in the Chicago Tribune with a portrait of a young man in a tunnel. The $500 prize allowed her to begin her work as a freelance photographer. During the 1950s, Diaz became resident photographer at Chicago's famous cultural hub The Tavern Club. The club was founded in 1927 \\"to encourage the arts, intellectual recreation and good humored interest in life.\\" Diaz captured images of patrons, dancers and many Jazz greats including the Ramsey Lewis Trio. She also produced pictorial yearbooks for The Tavern Club in 1957 and 1958. While at the Tavern Club, Diaz was mentor to young dancer Dallas Kinney‚Äînow Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist. Dallas Kinney thanked Diaz for her part in launching his photo journalism career on YouTube. Between 1956 and 1959 and in a juxtaposition of wealth and poverty that was to mark her later work, Diaz documented Lower North Center for the City of Chicago ‚Äì a \\"mixed\\" housing development for the underprivileged to promote the creation of community structure and educational programs including sewing classes, a ballet school, dances and religious ceremonies. This project was part of Francis Cabrini Homes and later known as \\"Cabrini Green\\". By the 1970s it was notorious for its gang wars and violence and was demolished in 2011. In the late 1950s Diaz married Australian graphic artist, Clement Fraser and was intrigued by his stories of Australia. The marriage did not last but Diaz' fascination with Australia did.  Diaz arrives in Melbourne ‚Äì 1960s  Peter James, 3AW Breakfast RadioKnown as \\"Maggie Besson Fraser\\", Diaz arrived in Melbourne in 1961 on a one-way ticket (a divorce gift from her ex-husband Clement Fraser), and soon established herself has one of the city's leading commercial photographers.Maggie Diaz: Into the Light A Retrospective curated by Gwendolen De Lacy Diaz depicted Melbourne \\"battlers\\" in a The Brotherhood of St Laurence Annual Report 1962-63 and was commissioned by the City of Melbourne to produce some night shots to promote the city. She worked on many commercial campaigns, always shooting for herself. Many of these photographs were never seen by the client and not printed until 40 years later. One of these photographs, \\"Girl Hero\\", an image taken for Paddle Shoes, is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. Diaz was resident photographer for 3AW in the mid 1960s and an article in The Age newspaper of 6 March 1964 notes that \\"A series of photographs which form part of the interior design of the new 3AW studios in the Southern Cross Plaza are the work of a woman.\\" Diaz also took portraits of radio personalities, and followed the mobile studio to special events and beach carnivals. A breakfast advertisement featuring Diaz‚Äô portrait of Peter James was featured in the Broadcasting and Television News of 23 July 1965. Diaz contributed to Group M's Photovision in 1964 exhibiting at John Reed's Museum of Modern Art with well-known contemporaries Wolfgang Sievers and Mark Strizic. During the mid-1960s Diaz' photographs were used in a Nilsen Company publication titled Printing is People c1966. Diaz' work was as an \\"example of excellence\\" and used to teach photography students at RMIT the use of available light. In 1964, while living in her Nicholson Street Fitzroy Studio, Diaz was introduced to the Spanish scene and recorded various troupes, well represented in the Diaz collection. This was a place where she felt truly comfortable for the first time since arriving in Melbourne. It had the vibrancy and diversity that she missed from her Chicago home. Here she met her future partner, Jose Diaz, with whom she had a son, Stevan, in 1967. In 1968, Diaz, Jose and Stevan moved into a commercial studio in Martin Street Gardenvale with her ex-husband Clement Fraser. He had produced a map for the Liberal Government, titled, 'Australia the Awakening Giant'Clem Fraser map of Australia http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22041474 and was making a good living selling it all over the country. When the Whitlam government won the election in 1972, the map was discontinued as a promotional tool and Clem left the studio lease to Diaz and Jose. Two photographs included in Walkabout magazine (c1966) and taken under the name of Maggie Besson Fraser, are included in the State Library of NSW Library photography collection.State Library of NSW ‚Äì Manuscript Oral History and Pictures  The middle years ‚Äì 1970s‚Äì1980s  Although they didn't marry, Diaz decided to take Jose's name and from thenceforth was known as \\"Maggie Diaz\\". During the 1970s, Diaz continued as a commercial photographer, with work from advertising agencies, such as Clemenger and Klempke. In 1975, The Toorak Times noted that Diaz \\"excels in art photography\\" while their front cover featured one of her photos Reticulated Lady. She was also commissioned to take a portrait of Sidney Nolan's mother in St Kilda at Edgewater Towers, Marine Parade in 1977.Dora Irene Nolan (Mother of Artist Sidney Nolan) was photographed by Maggie Diaz at Edgewater Towers in 1977. State Library Victoria; Maggie Diaz; incorrectly entitled 'Mrs Landells (mother of Sidney Nolan) taken at Edgewater Towers, Marine Parade, St.Kilda'; The subject is not the image of Flora Annie Margaret Landells (Painter and Potter); Dora Irene Nolan is the subject (confirmed as same person photographed in 'Dora Irene Nolan and Son Artist Sidney Nolan'; Fairfax Photos; Taken Art Gallery NSW 12 September 1967; by G. Henderson); daughter Lorna (Gosling) is seated behind right (confirmed by longtime resident building manager Johannes (Jonas) Le Ferink) and possibly other daughter (not confirmed) Marj. seated left. The paintings in the two photos include a Sidney Nolan from the Ned Kelly series and there are two Sidney Nolan books in the book case. The raised flooring platform (which covers a concrete upstand) on which the three subjects are seated improves the views out from the flat and is very typical of one bedroom Edgewater Towers flats that have enclosed their once open balconies. Diaz spent two years as staff photographer of Southern Cross News during this time ‚Äì recording a huge range of events and personalities, including Tommy Hanlon from Ashton's Circus. In the 1980s, Diaz continued to operate a commercial studio in Martin Street, Gardenvale and became known for portraiture and actors' composites, forming alliances with Sascha Agency and JM Casting. One of Diaz' subjects, sixteen- year-old actor Gwendolen De Lacy, became a lifelong friend and would later be instrumental in archiving, curating and promoting Diaz' work. Diaz moved from her Gardenvale studio in the late 1980s and operated from a flat on Grosvenor Street, Balaclava, where she made a darkroom in a rundown shed and became known for photographing actors in doorways and laneways ‚Äì always using available light.  1990s ‚Äì The later years  Diaz had to move again and this time, she took an apartment around the corner in Gourlay Street, which had no darkroom; however, she continued with her work. Her knack for capturing the soul of the artist saw her portraiture of actors becoming a major interest. She photographed scores of plays at La Mama, The Courthouse and Playbox theatres in the 1990s. In the late 90s, partner Jose suffered a heart attack and Diaz' work started to wind down. In 2003, Diaz had a bad fall, which resulted in two months in Caulfield Hospital. Later that year, Jose died suddenly of a second heart attack.  Collaboration with Gwendolen De Lacy  Gwen in Veil at Midnight, Art Centre Melbourne, c1985 In 2004, Diaz' friend Gwendolen De Lacy, began archiving Diaz' collection. In 2005, some highlights from the extensive collection were presented as a slide show to two packed audiences at La Mama Theatre's Courthouse, to celebrate Diaz' 80th birthday. It was a sell-out event, which generated long-overdue interest in Diaz's life and career, and prompted a mention in the Victorian State Parliament in a speech by Johan Scheffer; \\"Her life has been hard and this has been a rich treasure house of insight and inspiration for a great art.\\" Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) Legislative Council Fifty-Fifth Parliament First session 23 March 2005 http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Council/Autumn%202005/Council%20Extract%2023%20March%202005%20from%20Book%202.pdf This led to her first retrospective exhibition ‚Äì Into the Light, which opened at City of Melbourne Museum at Old Treasury in 2007. The exhibition was printed by photographic artist and printer Tiffaney Bishop.Tiffany Bishop http://www.tiffaneybishop.com/about.htm An Australian tour commenced and in 2008, Diaz featured on ABC 'Sunday Arts' television program. In 2010, the State Library of Victoria purchased Into the Light, the exhibition and the entire Diaz archive spanning 50 years of Diaz' work. Some of these images were included in a group show from the library collection. Called As Modern as Tomorrow: photographs in Post War Melbourne, The exhibition was held from 1 July 2011 to 5 February 2012 and included works by immigrant peers Mark Strizic and Wolfgang Sievers. Historian of photography Gael Newton commented in the State Library News that: \\"The sole woman working in commercial illustration included in As Modern as Tomorrow is previously overlooked American immigrant Maggie Diaz, whose distinctively moody work has only quite recently been reintroduced to Melbourne viewers and acquired by the Library.\\"Gael Newton, State Library News Edition # 47 July ‚Äì October 2011 In 2011, Diaz was selected as a Core Program Artist with the Ballarat International Foto Biennale and her exhibition One-way Ticket featured more than 35 images from the Diaz Collection that had never been seen before. This exhibition celebrated the first 25 of Diaz' life as an artist and commercial photographer. In 2012, the National Library of Australia purchased 18 of Diaz' photographs, catalogued under Australian life, 1960‚Äì1990 / Maggie Diaz. Diaz was subjected to extensive surgery for the removal of her left eye due to skin cancer. Following a fire in her home, she moved into long-term accommodation at Sacred Heart Mission in St Kilda ‚Äì her local stomping ground. She lived at Sacred Heart Mission until her death in October 2016. The Maggie Diaz Photography Prize for Women Maggie Diaz Photography Prize for Women has been awarded biennially since 2015, celebrating her life and contributions. It is open to women photographers of all ages, and the media release requests that the artists \\"should use available light\\", a feature of much of her work.https://www.brightspace.com.au/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/MR_final_MaggieDiazPrize.pdf  Exhibitions  * As Modern as Tomorrow ‚Äì Photographers in Post-war Melbourne (Group exhibition), State Library of Victoria, ] 1 July 2011 ‚Äì 5 February 2012 * Maggie Diaz, One- way Ticket Ballarat International Foto Biennale, Mining Exchange, 12 Lydiard St North, Ballarat, 20 August ‚Äì 18 September 2011 * Maggie Diaz ‚Äì Into the Light:, Kingston Arts Centre, 979 Nepean Highway, Moorabbin, Victoria, 20 March ‚Äì 6 April 2009 * The Drum Theatre, Dandenong Town Hall, City of Greater Dandenong, 16 April ‚Äì 12 June 2009 * Portland Arts Centre, Cnr Glenelg and Bentinck St, Portland, Victoria, 19 January ‚Äì 27 February 2009 * Carnegie Gallery, Hobart, 16 Argyle St, Hobart, Tasmania, 2 July ‚Äì 9 August 2009 * Burrinja Gallery, 351 Glenfern Road, Upwey, Victoria, 11 April ‚Äì 13 July 2008 * Colac Otway Performing Arts & Cultural Centre, Cnr Gellibrand & Rae St, Colac, Victoria, 25 July ‚Äì 14 September 2008 * City Museum at Old Treasury, Spring Street, Melbourne, 10 March ‚Äì 24 June 2007  Collections = State Library of Victoria = In 2010, The State Library of Victoria purchased Into the Light, the exhibition and the entire Diaz archive ‚Äì spanning 50 years of photography.

A. Applegate and illustrated by Patricia Castelao. The book is about a silverback gorilla named Ivan who lived in a cage at a mall. The novel is written in first person from the point of view of Ivan, a gorilla. In 2013, it was named the winner of the Newbery Medal. It has won several other awards and is currently nominated to several reading lists. The title was followed in 2020 by The One and Only Bob, which is presented from the point of view of Ivan's best friend, the dog Bob. Plot The story is placed at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall by the Video Arcade. Ivan, the gorilla, has lived in captivity at the Big Top Mall for 9,855 days by his own tally. He lives in his domain, and is generally content with his life. He watches television, eats bananas, and makes artwork that is sold by the owner. Along with Ivan, Stella, an elephant, and Bob, a stray dog, live at the mall. Stella is an older elephant who has a chronic injury in one leg and regularly performs in the daily shows. Unlike Ivan, Stella has a long memory and can remember living in other places, like the circus where she was taught many of her tricks. However, Stella wanted to live in a zoo, because they have much wider spaces for their domains. Stella believes that good zoos are how humans make amends. When Ruby, a baby elephant, is brought to the Big Top Mall to live with Stella and learn new tricks, things begin to change. Stella's old injury causes her to get sick. Just before Stella succumbs to her illness and passes away, she asks Ivan to take care of Ruby and find her a better place. Ivan promises he will take care of Ruby, even though he does not know how he will manage to do it. After Stella's death, Ivan begins to remember his life before the Big Top Mall and what it was like to have freedom if only to have stories to tell to Ruby. While Mack, the owner of the Big Top Mall is trying to train Ruby to do tricks, Ivan witnessed first-hand the abuse to which she is subjected and starts to decide how to keep his promise to Stella. When Julia, the custodian George's daughter, gives Ivan some finger paints, he begins to get an idea of how to help Ruby. He also changes his opinion of the Big Top Mall. He no longer thinks of his area as his domain but as a cage. Ivan uses his art to make a large picture of a zoo. George and Julia help him by putting it on the billboard outside of the Big Top Mall. When people see the new signs, they begin to protest the treatment of the animals. Investigators are sent to the Big Top Mall and eventually, it is closed down. Ivan, Ruby, and the other animals are taken away to a zoo. Ivan and Ruby are both adopted by the same zoo, where they begin adapting to their new habitats and the other animals they now live with.

Ivan has spent most of his life in captivity, either living in a human home or at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. He remembers only a little about his life before captivity and has grown content with his life at the mall. As the story progresses, Ivan determines that his life is not satisfactory and he works to save Ruby and himself by having them both brought to a zoo, where they will spend the rest of their life. *Stella: a senior elephant who used to live in a traveling circus before she suffered an injury and was sold to Mack. Stella has a long memory, and would much prefer to live in a zoo. She extracts a promise from Ivan to take care of Ruby if she cannot. *Bob: a stray dog who lives with Ivan in his domain. Bob is satisfied to be a stray dog and has no desire to be adopted into a human home. *Mack: the owner of the small circus and part-time circus clown; he purchased Ivan from poachers who captured him in his home in Africa. Mack is not seen often in the book. He appears to be a generally good man. However, his business is failing and he cannot afford to keep up the mall the way he used to. His actions regarding Stella and Ruby are what finally spur Ivan to try to have Ruby moved to a zoo. *George: The mall custodian. George is a good man who cares for the animals and the mall. However, he is conflicted about helping them because he is afraid of losing his job. *Julia: George's daughter, who inspires Ivan to love drawing. Julia works to help Ivan in his quest to move Ruby and the other animals to a zoo. *Ruby: a baby elephant who is new to the mall. Ruby has only recently lost her mother and has never previously been trained in circus tricks. Ruby's treatment at the hands of Mack is what ultimately drives Ivan to try to find a way to save her. She can also tell if people are lying. *Kinyani: a female gorilla whom Ivan meets at the zoo. *Maya: the zoo owner who brings Ivan and Ruby and all the animals from the Big Top Mall to the zoo.  Inspiration  Although The One and Only Ivan is an entirely fictional story, it is inspired by the true story of Ivan, who lived in a similar situation for 27 years. Eventually Ivan was adopted by Zoo Atlanta in 1994.  Reception  The book had a positive response with a 4.25 review on Goodreads. According to Kirkus Reviews, \\"Fittingly, Ivan narrates his tale in short, image-rich sentences and acute, sometimes humorous observations that are all the more heartbreaking for their simple delivery... Utterly believable, this bittersweet story... will inspire a new generation of advocates.\\" Jonathan Hunt wrote in The Horn Book Magazine, \\"The choice to tell this story in the first person and to personify the gorilla with an entire range of human thoughts, feelings, and emotions poses important questions to the reader, not only about what it means to be human but also about what it means to be a living creature, and what kind of kinship we all share.\\" Carolyn Phelan wrote in Booklist that \\"The text, written in first person from Ivan's point of view, does a good job of vividly conveying his personality, emotions, and intelligence as well as creating a sense of otherness in his point of view.\\" Writing for School Library Journal, Elizabeth Bird said, \\"There's nothing twee or precious about it. Just good crisp writing, complex characters, and a story that will make animal rights activists out of the most lethargic of readers. Applegate has penned a real doozy of a book that speaks to the best and worst in all of us.\\" Film adaptation On April 9, 2014, it was announced that Disney may adapt the book with Allison Shearmur to produce.

In the year after V-J Day, more than five million American workers were involved in strikes, which lasted on average four times longer than those during the war. They were the largest strikes in American labor history.\\"From Class War to Cold War\\",John Newsinger Background Throughout the Second World War, the National War Labor Board gave trade unions the responsibility for maintaining labor discipline in exchange for closed membership. This led to acquiescence on the part of labor leaders to businesses and various wildcat strikes on the part of the workers. The strikes were largely a result of tumultuous postwar economic adjustments. With 10 million soldiers returning home and the transfer of people from wartime sectors to traditional sectors, inflation was 8% in 1945, 14% in 1946, and 8% in 1947. Much of the protests from 1945 to 1946 were for better pay and working hours, but a study done by Jerome F. Scott and George C. Homans of 118 strikes in Detroit from 1944‚Äì45, found that only four were for wages, with the rest being for discipline, company policies or firings. The strikes After the war, wages fell across the board, leading to large strikes. Strikes in 1945 included: * 10,500 film crew workers (March 1945) * 43,000 oil workers (October 1945) * 225,000 United Auto Workers (November 1945) In 1946, strikes increased: * 174,000 electric workers (January 1946) * 93,000 meatpackers (January 1946) * 750,000 steel workers (January 1946) * 340,000 coal miners (April 1946) * 250,000 railroad engineers and trainmen nationwide (May 1946) * 120,000 miners, rail and steel workers in the Pittsburgh region. (December 1946)http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi- bin/chronology/chronology_driver.pl?searchtype=ybrowse;year=1946;start_line=45 Others included strikes of railroad workers and \\"general strikes in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Stamford, Connecticut; Rochester, New York; and Oakland, California. In total, 4.3 million workers participated in the strikes. According to Jeremy Brecher, they were \\"the closest thing to a national general strike of industry in the twentieth century.\\" Aftermath In 1947, Congress responded to the strike wave by passing, over President Truman's veto, the Taft-Hartley Act, restricting the powers and activities of labor unions.

The schooner was long, with a beam that reached .Easton, Alan Codseeker had a net gross ton of 42 and registered ton of 29.5.Easton, Alan The elegant vessel sailed with the standard rigging and gaf topsail. A schooner with her dimensions would have required a certain amount of ballast to combat lateral forces against the sail. However, Codseeker was not built with the customary amount of counterbalance, most likely due to the schooner's depth.Murphy, William M. The Wreck  On 9 May 1877, while on her very first fishing outing, the brand new schooner capsized just east of Cape Sable Island. Eastern wind had been increasing the entire day and had turned into a storm, which caused strain on the slender vessel. Once the wind increased, the schooner started rolling heavily to its leeward side, often taking its time to recover. At this time, Captain Phillip Brown ordered the mainsail down, and headed for land.Murphy, William M. According to Brown, sailing towards the Shoal of the Rock would mean a shorter and steeper run of sea, and therefore no need to reef the foresail.Murphy, William M. However, the lightness of the vessel, being empty in the hold, caused severe and unnatural rocking and she gradually careened over until Codseeker was flat on the beam-ends. Half of the schooners deck became submerged in frigid Atlantic water. Quickly after Codseeker keeled over, Brown, as well as a cook and another young fisherman, were able to locate a fishing dory, which sat between the foremast and the mainmast of Codseeker. Once the three men dislodged the small dory, they attempted to rescue the remaining men, but had drifted out too far while bailing the excess water out of the dory.Easton, Alan There were a total of thirteen crewmen on Codseeker. Nine of the men were on deck when the vessel capsized and four were below. Of the thirteen men, nine survived the wreck of Codseeker, two of which spent three days trapped in the hulk of the overturned ship.Easton, Alan On May 10, the two-masted schooner Matchless set to rescue any living men left behind in the wreckage, unfortunately leaving two men, who, unknown to Brown and the rest of Matchless crew, were trapped alive under Codseeker.Easton, Alan On May 12, the schooner Ohio was passing by the wreckage, when the crew realized that two members of Codseeker were still on the ship.Easton, Alan After the rescue, Codseeker was towed into Green Cove, Yarmouth County by the two schooners Condor and Dove.Easton, Alan  The Aftermath  Only two months after the disaster of Codseeker, she was back in the water, fully repaired.Easton, Alan She continued on the registry books until 1953, when her registration showed a closure reason of \\"no longer exists\\".Vessel Registry References *Easton, Alan (1992).

It is the largest food processing plant in Europe and the largest H. J. Heinz facility in the world. Background H. J. Heinz varieties first went on sale in Fortnum & Mason in 1886. After World War I, with a headquarters established in Hayes, London, Heinz started exporting Baked Beans, Spaghetti and Tomato Ketchup to the United Kingdom. Heinz opened its first UK production facility in Harlesden in the 1920s. During World War II this facility was bombed twice, resulting in the takeover after the war of the former munitions factory at Standish near Wigan in 1946 to allow the restart of food production. Opening Needing a new consolidated factory outside London, the site in Northwest England was chosen due to its ease of access to both the UK agricultural industry, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (Liverpool Docks) and Europe via the North Sea, to allow for easy and low-cost access of both raw product and the export of manufactured processed food. The Kitt Green factory was opened on 21 May 1959 by the Lord Chancellor, the Rt. Hon. David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir. A few weeks later it was visited by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 24 June 1959. Operations The factory from Gathurst Road As the chosen site allowed easy expansion. By the 1980s, the factory employed around 3,000 people, and had taken over the production of all UK products from Harlesden except Heinz Tomato Ketchup. After Harlesden closed in 2000, this has since also been produced at Kitt Green. A steam plant with a capacity of 140 tonnes per hour was installed in 2005. The factory celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, with a visit by HM Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh who also opened a new packaging hall.

The company is known to have built and repaired over 220 boats and vessels, most notable being the Bluenose II schooner and Theodore Too. History The shipyard was initially started under the name of Leary's, with records dating back to 1871, a time when establishing owner Stephen Leary and sons Melbourne and Maurice Leary were building large-scale ships with keels up to 74 ft. in length, using iron work. The shipyard was purchased by Reginald \\"Teddy\\" Snyder in 1944, who designed and built vessels as well as parts of the shipyard facilities. After working 53 years as a shipwright and 10 years spent as the owner of Snyder's, Snyder retired from the business in 1987, passing ownership to his son Phillip. Details of the shipyard The first permanent boat-building shed to be built was constructed in 1969 and measuring 100 feet by 40 feet. Before the erection of this building vessels were constructed outside. In 1992, a second building was constructed to build its first 67-foot vessel indoors. The third building constructed by Acadian Construction of Bridgewater brings a total of 10,000 square-feet of working space to the shipyard. In 1988, many boatyards were reducing their amount of productivity and number of staff. Snyder's underwent expansion of their facilities with the construction a third new 3000-square- foot building and increased their staff to 35 full-time employees in order to build larger vessels to meet current demands. Cost of this expansion estimated $135,000.

She played for USC Munich in the German wheelchair basketball league, and for the national team that won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, after which President Joachim Gauck awarded the team with the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf). Biography Johanna Welin was born on 24 June 1984 in Pajala, Sweden, a small town near the border between Sweden and Finland about north of the Arctic Circle. She has played football for T√∂reboda IK in the Swedish league. In the winter, her passion was snowboarding, until a bad fall in a snowboarding competition at Gothenburg in January 2004 left her paralysed from the waist down. She then took up wheelchair basketball, playing for GRBK Gothenburg in the Swedish league, but Sweden had no national women's team. She spent two semesters studying German in Insbruck, but there was no wheelchair basketball team there, and she began playing for USC Munich, initially for their second team. There, she caught the attention of Holger Glinicki, the coach of the German national team, who asked her if she would like to play for the German national team. She took German citizenship, a relatively painless procedure for an athlete, and made the German national team, which went on to win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48-42. In June 2012 she was named as part of the team that competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London, where they faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, a team that had defeated them 48-46 in Sydney just a few months before. They defeated the Australians 44-58 in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics since 1984. They were awarded another Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012 and were again named Team of the Year for 2012. In February 2013, Welin's name was entered in the Golden Book of Munich. The German team claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States. She has modelled for the advertising campaigns of team sponsors ING DiBa and LoFric, and is currently studying medicine in Munich.

Although the emerging acts who played there included Mission of Burma, The Cure and New Order, its lifespan was short, from February 1980 until June 1981.Simmons, Doug, \\"Cellars by Starlight: Notes from the Underground,\\" The Boston Phoenix, June 23, 1981; Morse, Steve, \\"Nightlife: Short Cuts,\\" The Boston Globe, Calendar p.1, June 18, 1981. Jim Coffman, a Boston University sophomore who was waiting tables at the nearby restaurant Our House, started the club after convincing the same owners of the pub Sweet Virginia's (whose boss was the infamous Boston club owner Henry Vara) to turn over the dying business at 1110 Commonwealth Avenue, an L-shaped wood-paneled venue (one-time home of music club Brandy's II.)Simmons, Boston Phoenix, 1981; Morse, Steve, \\"Nightlife: Come as You Are,\\" The Boston Globe, Calendar p. 1, March 13, 1980. As Doug Simmons wrote in his 1981 Boston Phoenix postmortem for the club, The Underground's opening launched \\"the city's most far-ranging search for underground talent,\\" adding that \\"never had so many bands traveled so far to play in front of so few for so little.\\"Simmons, Boston Phoenix, 1981. As but one memorable example, The Cure performed their first time in Boston at the venue, playing virtually the entire Boys Don't Cry album before little more than a hundred people the night of Robert Smith's 21st birthday which MIT film and video student Jan Crocker recorded along with warmup Mission of Burma. \\"The effect on the local Boston scene was even more dramatic,\\" Simmons also wrote. The Underground provided support for a mix of Boston bands: among others, the teen rock of Boys Life and The Outlets, the punk-funk of the Suade Cowboys and Prince Charles and the City Beat Band, the new wave of Peter Dayton and The Neats and, most of all, the art-rock of Mission of Burma (whom Coffman would later manage), the all female group Bound and Gagged, and Someone and the Somebodies. In addition to nurturing homegrown talent, honed by the soundwork of Michael Whittaker, who later worked for many of the clubs headliners like Bush Tetras, Raybeats, and later toured with The Raincoats, Fad Gadget, Wah and others, the Underground booked many bands from across the U.S. and abroad. Whittaker later moved to Los Angeles and under the 'non-de-plume' \\"Spaceman\\" worked at SST, furthering the sounds of Black Flag, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Slovenly and many others. Besides The Cure and New Order making their Boston debuts there, other out-of-towners headlining the club included such American indie acts as The Bongos, Lydia Lunch and 8-Eyed Spy, Shrapnel, Bush Tetras, Los Microwaves, The dB's, The Suburbs and Pylon. Brian Brain, Delta 5, Bauhaus, Au Pairs, Blurt, A Certain Ratio and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were among the British acts to play there, as did Canada's DOA and Northern Ireland's Protex. Although accounts vary on the specific reasons for the club's demise, all cite ongoing tension between the club, whose lease had an option through 1990, and Boston University, which had purchased the building housing The Underground shortly before it opened and turned the above-ground floors into a dormitory.

Talking Electronics or TE was an Australian electronics magazine from the 1980s aimed at beginners and hobbyists, founded and produced by Colin Mitchell in Cheltenham, Australia. The magazine, and its associated mail-order kit business, operated for its entirety out of Mitchell's home. Competing magazines at the time were Electronics Australia, Electronics Today International, and Australian Electronics Monthly. The general magazine lasted 15 official issues, but there were many one-off publications produced in addition to the issue-based magazine. Some of these included the FM Bugs series of books, The Electronics Notebook series, and model railway projects. The first issue was in 1981, with the last issue being #15 in May 1989. Mitchell has since released all material, books, and issues of the magazine as public domain on his websites ‚Äì \\"Not Copyright 2003 Colin Mitchell - you can copy anything - in fact you should copy all the projects and data sheets.\\" There was no regular publishing schedule; an issue would come out when it was completed. It is known as the first electronics magazine in the world to include a printed circuit board on the front cover. Talking Electronics also sold electronics kits to go along with its published construction projects. This business proved very popular, with hundreds of thousands of kits being sold. Payment for the kits could be made using postage stamps, to make it easier for young hobbyists to afford and pay for the kits. Talking Electronics produced several bare-bones Z80-based learning computers, including the MicroComp and the TEC-1. Towards the height of the magazine, Mitchell tried to take Talking Electronics to the United States, but was ultimately unsuccessful at distribution after printing 100,000 copies. These copies were eventually repackaged and sold once he returned to Australia.

Brown and starring Mary Astor and Jack Holt, with major supporting roles by Ricardo Cortez and Sidney Toler.The American Film Institute Catalog Films: 1931-40 by The American Film Institute, c. 1993 The film was produced and distributed by RKO Pictures. The screenplay by Jane Murfin and J. Walter Ruben was adapted from Rex Beach's short story, The Recoil. The film touched on the topics of gold-digging, adultery, bigamy, gigolos, and theft. The rights to the story were optioned in late 1930, and the film went into production in March 1931. After approximately four weeks of filming, the film was screened in May. A remake of the 1924 silent film entitled The Recoil, RKO released the film on June 6, 1931, and it did not perform well at the box office, making it yet another film by RKO to suffer a similar fate. Critically, it was a mixed batch of opinions, ranging from poor to very good. Most reviewers enjoyed at least some of the acting, but virtually all thought the plot was either too convoluted or simply implausible, although some at least gave it credit for its originality. Plot Norma Selbee is a chorus girl trying to make it in New York City. Her fortunes are not going well, and she is flat broke and on the verge of starvation when she meets Gordon Kent. Kent has spent the last several years in the back woods, utilizing his mining engineering acumen to accumulate a large fortune of approximately $20 million. He has come to the big city looking for a good time, hopefully among the \\"white shoulders\\" of the fair damsels of the Big Apple. Upon meeting Norma, he falls head over heels for her and proposes on their first evening together. Norma is reluctant to agree, for she is not a gold-digger, and she is not in love with Kent. But she has no prospects, and she feels that she may come to love him in time, so she agrees, and the two are immediately married. Holt, Astor and Cortez In a whirlwind of activity, Kent books them on a ship to Europe for their honeymoon which is leaving shortly. On the trans-Atlantic crossing, and upon their arrival on the continent, Kent showers Norma with gifts and fine living. Somehow, she still finds a way to feel unwanted by him. While she wishes that he would spend more time with her, rather than money on her, he also has a business he still has to run. When they travel to Paris, they run into an old acquaintance of Norma's, Lawrence Marchmont, who instantly understands a meal ticket when he sees one. As Kent is distracted by his business dealings, he begins to woo the lonely Norma. She at first resists his advances, but eventually succumbs to Marchmont's attentions, and the two run off together. Devastated, Kent hires investigators to look into the background of the pair. It is discovered that Marchmont's real name is Tommy Pierce, a two-bit con artist who is wanted by the police in several countries. Kent also finds out that Norma's first husband, who Kent knew about, never legally divorced Norma, so technically she is a bigamist. Deciding to teach the pair a lesson, he pairs the private investigators to follow them and ensure that they cannot part from one another. It soon becomes apparent to Norma that the only thing that Marchmont/Pierce was interested in was her jewels, and she has to resume her chorus girl activities in order to support Marchmont/Pierce's drinking habit. However, when either of the two attempts to leave, they are returned to each other, under threat of turning them over to the police for arrest. There are only two problems with this plan: Kent is love Norma; and Norma has fallen in love with Kent. Marchmont/Pierce thinks he has figured a way out of the unpleasant situation when Norma's first husband, Jim Selbee, turns up. The two plan a blackmail scheme to be hatched on Kent, only to have it foiled by Norma. With that plan spoiled, the two con-men turn to plan \\"B\\", deciding to abscond with Norma's jewels. The night of the robbery, as they are breaking into the safe, the pair argue, resulting in Marchmont/Pierce shooting Selbee, and killing him. Marchmont/Pierce is arrested for the murder, and with Selbee out of the way, Norma is free to return to Kent. She is reticent, due to her guilt over her relationship with Marchmont, but Kent convinces her to return, and the pair is reunited. Cast (Cast list as per AFI database, and The RKO Story) *Mary Astor - Norma Selbee *Jack Holt - Gordon Kent *Ricardo Cortez - Lawrence Marchmont *Sidney Toler - William Sothern *Kitty Kelly - Maria Fontaine *Robert Keith - Jim Selbee *Nicholas Soussanin - Head waiter =Notes= This would be the transition role for Mary Astor, who up until this time had only been cast in \\"featured\\" roles, which technically her role in this film was as well. Starting with her next picture, Nancy's Private Affair, she would be moved up to starring status. Lita Chevret had a minor role in the film. Production Rex Beach wrote a short story, \\"The Recoil\\", which appeared in the November 1922 issue of Cosmopolitan. It was optioned by Goldwyn Pictures, which produced a silent film of the same name in 1924. RKO acquired the rights for the story, along with two other Beach stories, The Slander Girl and Young Donovan's Kid, and in October 1930 it was added to their production schedule. At the same time Melville Brown was picked to direct by producer William LeBaron, and Evelyn Brent was announced as the lead. By February 1931, Brent had been replaced by Mary Astor in the cast, and joined by Jack Holt and Ricardo Cortez. In mid-February Kitty Kelly was added to the performers, with Sidney Toler joining the cast less than a week later. By the beginning of March, Brown had finalized the main members of his cast. He asked fellow director and screenwriter Howard Estabrook to take the script and clean and tighten it, although he was given no screen credit for his efforts. By the middle of the month, Brown had the cast in rehearsals, and began filming by March 22. After filming had commenced, Brown added the final two cast members, Nicholas Soussanin and Robert Keith. The new technology of the \\"Dunning Process\\" (to adapt the film into foreign languages) was used in filming, but there is no record of the film ever being produced in a foreign language. Principal photography on the film was completed by the middle of April, and the film was being screened by industry professionals by the end of the month. The film began receiving reviews on May 17, 1931, which has led some modern sources to incorrectly date this as the film's release date. The film premiered in New York City at the Mayfair Theater on June 6, 1931. Reception The film did not perform well at the box office, and was not one of the few films released by RKO that year which posted a profit. Mordaunt Hall, critic for The New York Times was less than impressed by the film, calling it \\"unbelievable\\", and stating that both the script and the acting were \\"crude\\". He did, however, give credit to the performance of Sidney Toler, as the one bright spot for the film. Modern Screen only rated the film \\"fair\\", making the comment that the actors tried their best with the material given them, but they could only do so much with the improbable plot. Motion Picture Daily also referenced the improbable plot, while giving credit to the attempts by the acting crew to overcome the material. They went on to call Brown's direction, \\"ineffectual\\". Screenland called it a \\"weak melodrama\\", and gave credit to the cast for attempting to overcome the implausible script. The film did receive several positive reviews. The Film Daily called the film a \\"... good number for sophisticated audiences ...\\", giving good marks to the direction and photography, but criticizing the script for creating \\"artificial\\" situations. Other publications which had some positive comments about the film included: the Boston Globe, which applauded the acting; the Boston Traveler, which said the plot was novel; the Portland Evening News which thought the film was \\"Interesting and original\\"; and the Detroit Daily Mirror which said, \\"Vivid drama ... good audience stuff\\". The Motion Picture Herald enjoyed the film, calling it \\"... better than average screen entertainment,\\" and \\"... adult and thought-provoking drama.\\" They singled out the acting abilities of Astor, Cortez and Kelly, particularly Astor, of whom they said, \\"It should do much in establishing the talents of the charming Mary Astor as a stellar personality.\\" They were less kind to Holt's performance, and felt that overall the film did not go far enough in exploring the fall from grace of Astor and Cortez characters when they are forced to live together. While not a stellar review, Silver Screen magazine said White Shoulders was a \\"good\\" film, complimenting the novel plot twists, and the performances of Astor, Holt and Cortez.

Forming from a tropical wave in the central Atlantic, Isaac traversed across many of the Lesser and Greater Antilles, before reaching peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on August 28, 2012 while in the Gulf of Mexico. Nearing the coast of Louisiana, the Category 1 hurricane slowly moved towards the west, making two landfalls in the state with little change of intensity prior to moving inland for a final time. The hurricane weakened and later dissipated on September 1 while over Missouri. Before landfall, Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency to the state, as well as ordering the mandatory evacuation of 60,000 residents in low-lying areas of Louisiana along the Tangipahoa River in Tangipahoa Parish. Isaac's large wind field contributed to a strong storm surge peaking at at a buoy offshore of Shell Beach. The strong waves inundated large areas of the state's coastal regions, particularly in Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane also brought heavy rainfall, leading to severe inland flooding. Rainfall amounts peaked statewide at in Hammond. Including adjacent states, the storm surge and inland flooding alone caused $407 million in insured losses. Isaac's strong winds caused infrastructural and crop damage, in addition to storm surge and heavy rains. A WeatherBug weather station in Poydras reported a 97 mph (156 km/h) wind gust, the fastest measured in association with the storm. The strong winds also caused a widespread power outage, with 901,000 electricity customers losing power. In the aftermath of the hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted $204.8 million in public assistance funds and $129.3 million in individual assistance funding. Background alt=The path of a tropical cyclone on a map in six-hour intervals. Colored dots represent differentiating intensities. The track begins at the bottom right, moves generally to the left and then towards the upper-left corner. In its path it crosses multiple islands. Hurricane Isaac originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 17\\\\. Moving generally westward, the low-pressure area initially did not have a well-defined center until three days later. As a result, convection associated with the system organized and intensified, and the tropical wave quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. In favorable conditions, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Isaac by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on August 21. Quickly accelerating westward due to a subtropical ridge, Isaac later moved past the Lesser Antilles between Guadeloupe and Dominica by August 23, where it caused numerous mudslides and power outages. Maintaining tropical storm intensity, Isaac later made its first landfall on the southern coast of Haiti early on August 25 as a result of curving around the ridge of high-pressure. There the storm directly killed 24 people, worsening conditions still remaining after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Isaac later began to curve westwards due to wind patterns which brought it between two opposingly rotating cyclonic systems. After briefly moving into the Gulf of Gon√¢ve, the tropical storm made a second landfall near Cajobabo, Guant√°namo in Cuba at 1500 UTC later on August 25, where damages were comparatively less severe than in Haiti. The storm paralleled the northern coast of the island prior to making a close pass of Key West, Florida, where it caused minor flood damage across the Florida Keys and South Florida upon entry into the Gulf of Mexico. The threat of tropical cyclone impacts in Tampa, Florida forced the postponing of the 2012 Republican National Convention. In the gulf, the tropical storm curved to the northwest and attained hurricane strength on August 27 near the southern Louisiana coast. Another ridge of high pressure caused Isaac to move towards the west and slow down as it made two landfalls on the state. Once it moved inland, the hurricane weakened before dissipating over Missouri on September 1. Preparations alt=Entrance of a bar with its decorated glass windows boarded with two wooden boards. The first board on the left reads, \\"Another quality board job by Cir√≥s\\" and the second board reads, \\"Food beer and wine on Wednesday\\" with a smiley emoticon The National Hurricane Center first began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for areas of Louisiana at 0900 UTC on August 26, when a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas of the state from the Mississippi River Delta eastward. The watch zone was later extended westward to Morgan City at 1500 UTC later that day. A second, unconnected hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain at the same time. As Isaac moved closer to the coast, both watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings at 2100 UTC. Another hurricane warning was issued for Lake Maurepas at the same time. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas of Louisiana from Intracoastal City to Morgan City at 0900 UTC on August 27, with the watch later being upgraded to a warning. All tropical cyclone-related warnings remained in affect for the entire state coast for the duration of Isaac's passage. After the hurricane degenerated to a tropical storm at 1900 UTC on August 29, all hurricane warnings were discontinued. As Isaac moved further inland, active tropical storm warnings progressively began to cover a smaller region of the Louisiana coast before all tropical cyclone warnings were discontinued at 2100 UTC on August 30. Upon the issuing of hurricane watches warnings, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency for the entirety Louisiana, recommending evacuation of areas unprotected by levees or areas south of the Intracoastal Waterway. Mayor of New Orleans Mitch Landrieu took the same course of action for his city. However, he stated that the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, convention center, and Mercedes-Benz Superdome would not be emergency shelters. Residents of Plaquemines Parish's eastern bank were ordered a mandatory evacuation on August 26, while a voluntary evacuation was ordered for southern areas of the parish from Ironton to Venice. In other regions of the parish, levees were lined with visqueen to protect exposed dirt, with sandbags being added to levees in other locations including Pointe √† la Hache. Evacuation orders were also placed for visitors and tourists in Grand Isle on the same day, with residents ordered to evacuate on August 27. In St. Charles Parish and Terrebonne Parish, 73,000 residents were ordered to evacuate. FEMA began to deliver meals and tarpaulins to the state on August 28. Impact alt=Aerial view of a flooded town. Nearly all roads are flooded, and only buildings, trees, and elevated areas of land can be seen above water. In the background is an ocean. Moving slowly towards the Louisiana coast in late-August, Isaac made its first landfall on the Mississippi River's Southwest Pass at 0000 UTC on August 29 with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 967 mbar (hPa; 28.56 inHg). Shortly after the hurricane moved back over the Gulf of Mexico, prior to making a second landfall near Port Fourchon with little change in intensity. Afterwards, Isaac weakened over land, moving to the northwest across the state before exiting Louisiana at the state border with Arkansas. =Storm surge= alt=Image of a fallen tree fully blocking a grey road. To the left is a heavily-treed area and on the right is a white house with a porch. At the coast, the system's large size generated a strong storm surge that caused extensive damage to low-lying areas of the state. A National Ocean Service (NOS) tide gauge located on the southern end of Lake Borgne near Shell Beach registered a storm surge height of , the highest in association with the storm. The strong storm surge inundated areas of lower Louisiana. Areas of Plaquemines Parish were estimated to have been submerged under as much as of water, based on pressure sensors from the United States Geological Survey. In eastern areas of the parish, water had accumulated from Breton Sound against a levee. The rising water levels later overtopped the levee height, causing it to overflow and inundate primarily uninhabited areas between Braithwaite and Belair. The strong storm surge, in combination with strong winds forced the Mississippi River to flow upstream for nearly a day, rising as much as in Belle Chasse and in New Orleans. In nearby LaPlace, 5,000 homes were flooded by the surge. In contrast to the river's average flow rate downstream of per second, during the hurricane the river flowed upstream at a rate of per second. Isaac's storm surged flowed upstream along the Mississippi River as far north as Red River Landing, located from the river's mouth. In Louisiana, storm surge and storm tide- related impacts caused $493.5 million in damages and three deaths. =Rainfall= Radar loop of Hurricane Isaac making landfall in the Mississippi River Mouth on August 29 Hurricane Isaac dropped heavy rainfall across the state, particularly in eastern areas of Louisiana, which caused flash flooding and river flooding. Rainfall peaked at in Hammond. Near Caesar, the East Hobolochitto Creek rose to a record crest above its flood stage due to the heavy rain. Runoff caused by heavy rainfall at the Tangipahoa River caused it to rise above its flood stage. In La Salle Parish, the heavy rains forced several road closures. Street flooding also occurred in New Orleans. A strong rainband remained stationary over Rapides Parish, flooding several structures and causing $10,000 in damages. Aftermath alt=Image of a large number of primarily elderly people sitting at long tables within a building, with the United States flag in the background. Although only a category 1 hurricane, Isaac still caused an estimated $3.11 billion worth of damage along with a death toll of five people in the United States.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. National Hurricane Center. By Robbie Berg. N.p., 28 Jan. 2013. Web. 15 Oct. 2013. <> A category 1 hurricane, like Isaac, has sustained winds of at least 74 mph and no more than 95 mph. However, with increasing development in coastal areas, the more deadly effect from hurricanes has been storm surge. Storm surge is the rise in water level caused by the winds forcing the water forward. In many parts of the Gulf Coast, it does not take very strong winds to create a potentially dangerous storm surge. Isaac made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 70kt (81 mph). This was enough to cause flooding in large areas of south Louisiana especially in St. Bernard, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Tammany Parishes where water height was as much as 10 to 12 feet above sea level. Besides for effects on populated areas, Isaac also had a dramatic effect on the wetlands and barrier islands of southern Louisiana which provide large amounts of biodiversity and offer numerous advantages to humans. The United States Geological Survey conducted multiple aerial surveys of landmasses specifically vulnerable to hurricanes. These surveys were done before and after Hurricane Isaac in order to provide a comparison. Photos of the Chandeleur Islands, a series of barrier islands off of the eastern coast of southern Louisiana, show significant erosion caused by wind and storm surge. Additionally, almost all of the pre-storm vegetation was lost.US Army Corps of Engineers. Hurricane Isaac With and Without 2012 100-Year HSDRRS Evaluation. Rep, Feb. 2013. Web. 15 Oct. 2013. . Wetlands Today, a common problem associated with wetlands and barrier islands is that once they have been eroded and reclaimed by the Gulf of Mexico, they are likely to permanently remain open water.Morton, Robert A., and John A. Barras. \\"Hurricane Impacts on Coastal Wetlands: A Half-Century Record of Storm- Generated Features from Southern Louisiana.\\" Journal of Coastal Research 27.6A (n.d.): 27-43. Nov. 2011. Web. 15 Oct. 2013. . Wetlands and barrier islands originally formed from sediment deposition from the southern Mississippi River system beginning approximately 5,000 years ago. The river would carry sediment down its path, and seasonal flooding of the river would allow sediment to be deposited in adjacent areas. Additionally, forming distributaries would let the Mississippi River branch off, reaching new areas, and thus form large amounts of wetlands.\\"The Mississippi River Delta Basin.\\" CWPPRA. Louisiana State Government, n.d. Web. 15 Oct. 2013. . However, humans have modified the natural paths of rivers. This process, known as channelization, has serious consequences for wetland ecosystems which include drainage of wetlands, degradation of natural habitats, and elimination of natural flow patterns.Keller, Edward A. \\"Flooding.\\" Natural Hazards. Ed. Duane E. DeVecchio. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2012. 191-92. Print. With levees, canals, and set channels for water to flow through, the river no longer floods and reroutes naturally and seasonally. The river is not able to deposit sediment in diverse areas to help create wetlands. Instead, the river flows through its artificially determined path and deposits the valuable sediment off the edge of the continental shelf. This lack of natural wetland restoration combined with the continued erosion from hurricanes causes a rapid loss in wetland area. Before human channelization of waterways, the river's natural process of sediment deposition was enough to sustain the wetland habitat, but currently wetland area is on a downward trend. Since 1932, the Mississippi River Delta Basin has lost 70 percent of its land area. At this rate, it is predicted that less than 5 percent of the original land area from 1932 will exist in 2064. Additionally, levees and waterway barriers can trap storm surge and prevent proper draining.Meeder, J.F., 1987. Variable effects of hurricanes on the coast and adjacent marshes: a problem for land managers. In: Brodtmann, N.V. (ed.), Fourth Water Quality and Wetlands Conference Proceedings. New Orleans, Louisiana: XXXX, pp. 337‚Äì374. This oftentimes will cause long periods of severe flooding that has its own consequences for wetlands. For example, after Hurricane Rita in 2005, the enclosed marshes of Chenier plain were flooded for over nine months following the storm.Barras, J.A., 2007b. Satellite images and aerial photographs of the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on coastal Louisiana. U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 281. http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/2007/281. Recent levee systems The Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System(HSDRRS) was implemented by the Army Corps of Engineers after the devastation from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The HSDRRS is a project aimed at completely re- engineering the levee system in New Orleans and surrounding areas in order to withstand effects from a \\"100 year storm,\\" or a storm that has a one percent chance of occurring each year.US Army Corps of Engineers. Greater New Orleans HSDRRS Facts and Figures. New Orleans, June, 2013. Print. The project includes construction of multiple floodgates around the city, redesigning pumping stations to pump water out of the city, and raising levees while constructing seawalls on top of them. The system's first real test came with the impact of Hurricane Isaac in late August 2012. Although Isaac was only a category 1 storm, the speed of Isaac's movement was considerably slower than most hurricanes, allowing more time for storm surge and damage to compile. Isaac produced tropical storm force winds for up to 45 hours while the effects of storms like Katrina and Rita only lasted for 21 and 16 hours, respectively. This suggests that even though Isaac was of lower intensity, the severity may have rivaled Katrina and Rita in certain locations. An analysis conducted by the US Army Corps of Engineers stated that the post-Katrina HSDRRS prevented potential flooding in areas within the strengthened levee, but potentially caused up to one foot of additional flooding in areas immediately outside of the HSDDRS.

Farquhar, Havana sank at anchor on 26 April 1906 after colliding with .  History  Havana was used in both salvage and seal hunting. Original intentions for the vessel included chartering American parties looking to tour around Greenland. These expeditions were prohibited by Norwegian authorities. In 1905, under the command of Farquhar, Havana was on a salvage mission to rescue Colonial, a cable ship that had stranded off of the coast of Canso, NS. Outfitted with a boiler, steam pumps, and wrecking apparatus, Havana successfully recovered Colonial. Colonial was harboured at the Halifax dry-dock, which was managed by S.M. Brockfield, the ship was docked and permanently repaired. In the following winter of 1906, Havana was outfitted for seal hunting in the Gulf of Port aux Basques. By 9 April, Havana successfully returned to Halifax with a cargo of 6286 seals. From the expedition, Havana only suffered minor damage to the ship‚Äôs rudder as a result of ice flow. Shortly after arriving in Halifax, Farquhar purchased the wrecked remains of the sunken schooner Alexander R. The wreck contained a cargo of coal that proved less than profitable.  Sinking of the ship, and aftermath  Anchored in Halifax harbour on the night of 26 April 1906, the wooden Havana was struck along the broadside by ; a steel steamship. Sinking quickly, the crew of Havana quickly climbed aboard the deck of Strathcona. Eyewitness accounts compare the resulting damage to Havana as ‚Äúif she were of matchwood.‚Äù The ship sank in approximately 10 minutes, and no casualties were suffered. The event was blamed on the results of a dark night. Havana was insured at Lloyd‚Äôs, and was valued at $11,000. In his memoirs, Farquhar mentions that he regretted losing a sextant on board the sinking Havana. The sextant was a gift from the British Admiralty for retrieving the lost guns of in 1874.

It was released in 2012 and is available via Steam and DRM free on GOG.com. Plot Ed (voiced by Edward Bauer) is the assistant to Professor Javier Morales, a brilliant particle physicist. He encounters Anna (Sarah Elmaleh) on a train, and they become friendly. When he arrives at the laboratory, he meets Detective Bennett (Logan Cunningham), who is responding to an emergency call. Some sort of disaster has taken place; the lab has been destroyed, and Professor Morales is dead. Meanwhile, political blogger Ray (Daryl Lathon) is investigating a mysterious organisation known as Antevorta at the behest of a shadowy source, and uncovers a database of the DNA sequences of everyone in the country hidden in a hospital. While taking Morales to the hospital, Ed and Bennett encounter both Ray and Anna, who is a doctor and Morales's niece. Ed reveals that Morales was working on a technology called Resonance, which could be used as a deadly weapon in the wrong hands, and the four of them set out to discover who is responsible for Morales's death and ensure that they do not take hold of his research. That night, Anna is attacked by an intruder in her apartment and flees for her life, escaping her attacker and reuniting with Ed and Bennett. The four of them discover that Morales had a secret vault somewhere in the city, and surmise that his research must be stored there. Bennet steals the blueprints of the laboratory from the police archives and Ray secures Morales's credit history from a contact of his. The exact details of the vault have been stolen from the security firm who designed it, but they are able to locate it regardless. The four protagonists break into the vault, which is in the tunnels below the laboratory. As they reach the vault, Bennett is held at gunpoint with Ed accusing him of being bribed by Antevorta. When Anna accesses the vault computer, she discovers that Morales was not her uncle, but her father. She has the opportunity to download or delete the Resonance research, but before she acts, Bennett suddenly realizes that Ed had been traveling far out of his way on the metro in order to be on the line Anna rode at the start of the game, and that he is the Antevorta plant. Ed shoots Anna, steals the Resonance devices, and flees. Upon leaving the vault, Bennett and Ray discover that they have been blamed for both Anna and Morales's murders, and are now wanted men. They are summoned to a meeting with the man who stole the vault plans, who is also Ray's source, and who works for Antevorta. From there they are able to track Ed down to the hospital, where he is attempting to destroy the Antevorta database. He has placed the Resonance devices, taken from the vault, in the basement and on the roof so that the database lies between them. After finding and taking the one in the basement, Ray and Bennett see a television broadcast revealing a series of terrible Resonance attacks is occurring all over the world. They rush to the rooftop to confront Ed, who holds them at gunpoint and sets the timer to fire the Resonance devices in a few minutes. He reveals that he was once the pawn of Antevorta, who compelled him to become close to Anna under false pretenses and aid them in stealing Resonance. He explains that Antevorta is responsible for the global attacks, intending them as a false flag with the aim of securing political power. From here, there are two possible endings: Anna, Ed, Bennett and Ray. *Ending 1: Ray positions himself so that when the Resonance devices fire, Ed is unknowingly standing directly in between them, and is vaporized. They are unable to prevent the President from enacting legislation giving Antevorta sweeping political power. Later, Ray has written a news article revealing the truth behind what has happened, but he and Bennett have been offered a full pardon in exchange for their silence. The game ends with the player deciding whether or not to publish the article. *Ending 2: Ray agrees with Ed that Antevorta must be stopped, and shows him the device Ed presumed to be in the basement. Ed subsequently halts the timer. Bennett protests, refusing to aid a murderer, and Ed shoots and kills him in response. Ed and Ray exit the rooftop, and the scene fades to black. The resonance explosion is then shown, vaporizing a crater in the side of the hospital (presumably where Antevorta is located). Later, Ray has written a news article revealing the truth behind what has happened, but Ed urges him not to publish it, as world powers have united against the attacks, and he fears their knowing the truth will ruin the peace. Despite his protestations, Ray publishes the article. *Finale: The aftermath of the player's choices plays out in the form of newspaper headlines behind the closing credits. Gameplay The game's graphics have what IGN called a \\"retro, low-res pixel art aesthetic\\". After a series of brief vignettes in which the player controls one character at a time, they are able to switch between any of the four characters at will, using the menu at the top of the screen. They are controlled through a simplified point and click interface, in the style of traditional adventure games from LucasArts and Sierra Entertainment. Many puzzles require multiple characters in order to solve them, such as one in which Ed must crawl into a ventilation shaft while Bennett controls the flow of water through a series of pipes. All four protagonists have areas only they can access or characters who only they can speak to, though most actions can be performed by any of them. All four will offer slightly different descriptions of objects or characters when looking at them. In addition to a traditional inventory, the player is able to drag objects from the gameworld into a menu which represents the character's memory, which allows them to ask about the object in question when talking to NPCs or one another. The game also consists of several puzzles which the player must solve, including a block-moving puzzle box and a hallucinatory maze. Resonance features a creator's commentary mode. When this is active, hotspots are inserted into the gameworld which, when clicked, will trigger an audio commentary from either Vince Twelve or Dave and Janet Gilbert, describing various elements of the background and making of the game. Development Vince Twelve worked on the game in his spare time for five years, writing, designing, programming, and creating the special effects for the game. Towards the end of that period the game was taken on by Wadjet Eye Games, with Dave Gilbert taking on the role of executive producer and voice director, and Janet Gilbert the role of full-time programmer, the only person to work full-time on the project at any point. Vince Twelve continued on as project manager and writer. Working together, they were able to complete and publish the game.Resonance in-game creator's commentary The game was on Kickstarter in late 2009. Reception Resonance received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewing it for Kotaku, Kate Cox said, \\"Resonance is the best classic-style adventure game I've played in ages. Go get it now,\\" and a Destructoid review called it \\"a fresh, modern mystery (which has) set the bar rather high for other adventure game developers, and not just indies...it might have been over all too quickly, but it was undoubtedly worth the five year wait.\\" The GameSpot review was more critical, stating that the \\"script relies on cliches to fill in for real characterization and personal development (and) the dialogue is also weak, both in and of itself and with regard to how it fits in with Resonances scenes.\\" Resonance was awarded several AGS Awards, it was awarded Best Gameplay, Best Independent Adventure, and Best Traditional Adventure as selected by both the staff and readers of the site. Resonance was also named the best indie adventure game of 2012 by Indie Games Plus. The site also listed Resonance at #9 among the top 12 indie games of 2012.

Programs concentrate on science, education and adventure (research expeditions for citizen-scientists). Since 2017, 5 Gyres has been in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The organization's 2015 Expedition was featured in the 2017 documentary \\"Smog of the Sea,\\" produced by Jack Johnson, who participated in the voyage. 5 Gyres was founded by Anna Cummins and Marcus Eriksen. Eriksen and Cummins have been featured speakers at universities and in news stories. Anna Cummins has also been awarded the Golden Goody Award, during a meeting of the Los Angeles chapter of the USNC for UN WOMEN First Annual Special Assembly. Before founding 5 Gyres, Cummins and Eriksen had worked at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, with founder Charles J. Moore, who is currently a scientific advisor for 5 Gyres. 5 Gyres was one of two organizations that sent Expeditions to research the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. 5 Gyres presented their results at the Aquarium of the Pacific and were cited as a source for estimating the size of the gyres. 5 Gyres explained their activities at a National Aquarium radio broadcast, were featured at the Two Oceans Aquarium website, and prepared tips on how to reduce plastic consumption. 5 Gyres also worked with environmental artist Marina DeBris in using trashion to help raise awareness of ocean trash. 5 Gyres was the first organization to research plastic pollution in all five main subtropical gyres and first to determine how much plastic is on the surface of the world's oceans: Nearly 270,000 metric tons and 5.25 trillion pieces. They published this research as the Global Estimate of Plastic Pollution in 2014, which will update again in 2018. Historically, the group has presented traveling exhibits, including stops at universities and educational discussions; in 2016 their education presentations reached 3,000 students through the \\"Every Kid in a Park\\" program. In 2012, 5 Gyres was first to discover that plastic microbeads (commonly found in personal care products like toothpaste and exfoliating soaps) were polluting our waterways. 5 Gyres used that study to help forge a coalition that convinced companies like Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and L‚ÄôOreal to phase out plastic microbeads. After only two years, the campaign scaled into a national movement, culminating in a watershed victory when President Obama signed the Microbead-Free Waters Act into law at the end of 2015. This win underscored 5 Gyres‚Äô model of using science to drive solutions, and informed the organization's approach to raising awareness about polystyrene and Styrofoam plastic pollution through their 2017 Action Campaign, which: * Encourages a pledge to refuse single-use polystyrene and expanded polystyrene foam (better known as Styrofoam) products. * Connects visitors with local bans (or the resources to start one). * Gives them the ability to tweet, email or call their representatives for support. * Informs supporters about preemptive ‚Äúban on bans‚Äù developments. * Commissions the first-ever study to assess the toxicity of hard polystyrene plastic. With more than 100 communities in California recently enacting polystyrene bans, and a statewide ban on the ballot for 2018, 5 Gyres sees polystyrene as a natural extension of the momentum that began with microbeads.

This summit was a Group of 20 conference held at the level of governance of the finance ministers and central bank governors (as opposed to the 6th G20 summit later that year, held in Cannes and involving the heads of government). Unlike other well-known cyberattacks, such as the 2009 attacks affecting South Korean/American government, news media and financial websites, or the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia, the attack that took place during the Paris G20 Summit was not a DDoS style attack. Instead, these attacks involved the proliferation of an email with a malware attachment, which permitted access to the infected computer. Cyber attacks in France generally include attacks on websites by DDoS attacks as well as malware. Attacks have so far been to the civil and private sectors instead of the military. Like the UK, Germany and many other European nations, France has been proactive in cyber defence and cyber security in recent years. The White Paper on Defence and National Security proclaimed cyberattacks as \\"one of the main threats to the national territory\\" and \\"made prevention and reaction to cyberattacks a major priority in the organisation of national security\\". This led to the creation of the French Agency for National Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) in 2009. ANSSI's workforce will be increased to a workforce of 350 by the end of 2013. In comparison, the equivalent English and German departments boast between 500 and 700 people. Attacks in December 2010-January 2011 The attacks began in December with an email sent around the French Ministry of Finance. The email's attachment was a 'Trojan Horse' type consisting of a pdf document with embedded malware. Once accessed, the virus infected the computers of some of the government's senior officials as well as forwarding the offensive email on to others. The attack infected approximately 150 of the finance ministry's 170,000 computers. While access to the computers at the highest levels of office of infiltrated departments was successfully blocked, most of the owners of infiltrated computers worked on the G20. The attack was noticed when \\"strange movements were detected in the e-mail system\\". Following this, ANSSI monitored the situation for a further several weeks. Reportedly, the intrusion only targeted the exfiltration of G20 documents. Tax and financial information and other sensitive information for individuals, which is also located in the Ministry of Finance's servers, was left alone as it circulates only on an intranet accessible only within the ministry. The attack was reported in news media only after the conclusion of the summit in February 2011, but was discovered a month prior in January. Perpetrators While the nationalities of the hackers are unknown, the operation was \\"probably led by an Asian country\\". The head of ANSSI, Patrick Pailloux, said the perpetrators were \\"determined professionals and organised\\" although no further identification of the hackers was made.

She was confirmed to this position in June 2011. Career Chen was a judge in Taiwan, but resigned from her position in 1983 and emigrated to the United States. She returned to Taiwan and was reinstated as a judge in 1996 by the Judicial Yuan. She went on to become a justice of the Supreme Court and later head of the Judicial Personnel Study Center. She stated that she is most proud of her work in translating judicial rulings and expanding the role of women in the judiciary. Chen was nominated to the Council of Grand Justices in April 2011 by President Ma Ying-jeou. Members of the Legislative Yuan questioned Ma's decision, as Chen had previously been a U.S. citizen and had also obtained a U.S. green card again for a short period while serving on the Supreme Court. The controversy over Chen's green card led opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators to propose amendments to previously tabled legislation to disallow public servants from holding permanent residency in foreign countries. However, lawmakers eventually confirmed Chen along with Ma's three other judicial nominees on 14 June 2011. Chen will step down from the Constitutional Court on 30 September 2019. Also published as: Personal life Chen attended National Chengchi University in Taipei, where she earned an LL.B. degree in 1971 and an LL.M. in 1976. She emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in 1983; while living there, she completed an MBA at Georgia's Augusta College (the predecessor of Augusta State University) in 1989. She naturalised as a U.S. citizen in 1992. She later returned to Taiwan, and relinquished U.S. citizenship in 1996 upon her reinstatement as a judge there. Her daughter continues to reside in the United States; Chen later obtained permanent residence status again in the United States in January 2008, so she could aid in raising her newborn granddaughter without worrying about visa issues (as Taiwan was not a member of the U.S.' Visa Waiver Program at that point); however, she cancelled her permanent resident status in September 2009.

In fact, it's common for a buyer to exclude certain assets in an APA. Provisions of an APA may include payment of purchase price, monthly installments, liens and encumbrances on the assets, condition precedent for the closing, etc.https://web.archive.org/web/20110824034734/http://www.inc.com/tools/asset- purchase-agreement.html An APA differs from a stock purchase agreement (SPA) where company shares, title to assets, and title to liabilities are also sold. In an APA, the buyer must select specific assets and avoid redundant assets. These assets are itemized in a schedule to the APA. The buyer in a SPA is purchasing shares of the company. In this case, itemization is not necessary due to transfer of company's ownership occurs as is. The APA is the legal mechanism for executing a corporate merger or acquisition. The oil and gas industry does not distinguish between an asset and stock purchase in naming its related purchase agreement. In this industry, whether purchasing assets or stock, the definitive agreement is referred to as the purchase and sale agreement (PSA). Purpose Defining and controlling behavior is a major objective of the APA. The buyer must represent its authority to purchase the asset. The seller must represent its authority to sell the asset. Additionally, the seller represents that the purchase price of the asset is equal to its value, and that the seller is not in financial or legal trouble. In the context of a merger or acquisition transaction, asset purchase agreements have a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages compared to using an equity (or stock) purchase agreement or a merger agreement. In an equity or merger acquisition, the purchaser is guaranteed to receive all of the target's assets without exception, but also automatically assumes all of the target's liabilities. An asset purchase agreement, alternatively, allows not only for a transaction where only some of the assets are transferred (which is sometimes desired) but also allows the parties to negotiate which liabilities of the target are expressly assumed by the purchaser, and allows the purchaser to leave behind those liabilities it does not wish to accept (or does not know about). A disadvantage of an asset purchase agreement is that it can often result in a greater number of change of control issues. For example, contracts held by a target, and acquired by a purchaser, will often require the consent of the counterparty in the context of an asset deal, whereas it is less common that such consent will be needed in connection with an equity sale or merger agreement. Other than having the flexibility to sell only certain assets, rather than the entire company, asset purchase agreements typically also include detailed provisions regarding the transfer of liabilities from the seller.

The novel and its sequels are published by Hyperion Books as a tie-in to the U.S. crime series Castle, and are attributed to that show's lead character Richard Castle. Heat Wave was published in 2009 and has been followed by Naked Heat (2010), Heat Rises (2011), Frozen Heat (2012), Deadly Heat (2013), Raging Heat (2014) and Driving Heat (2015). Premise Richard Castle is a best-selling author who has published the final book in his successful series, in which he killed off the main character after writing the books became too much \\"like work\\". He is desperately searching for a new muse. When a copy-cat killer stages the crime scenes right from the pages of his books, he is called in to assist Detective Kate Beckett and her team. At the end of the pilot episode, he becomes Beckett's partner in order to do \\"research\\". Heat Wave is released at the start of the second season which aired just before the actual release of the book. Because of its success, ABC has released even more books, including a Derrick Storm trilogy and Derrick Storm graphic novels. Plot summary The title of the book refers to a heat wave that gripped the city, the heat that is inside the characters‚Äô attraction for each other, and the character‚Äôs surname.

Formed in December 1942 from three airborne brigades, the division spent the next few months training for airborne operations. However, it first saw combat as an infantry unit in the Demyansk Offensive in late February 1943, then helped defend Ponyri during the Battle of Kursk. The division fought in Operation Kutuzov and advanced west in the Battle of the Dnieper, during which it captured Pryluky and crossed the Dnieper. It received the Ovruch honorific for the capture of the key rail junction during the Battle of Kiev. The division then fought in the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive and the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive in late 1943 and early 1944. The 4th Guards received the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky for actions during the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive, then fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive and received the Order of Suvorov. The division advanced westward into Hungary, fighting in the Battle of Debrecen and the Budapest Offensive in late 1944. In the last months of the war it fought in the Bratislava‚ÄìBrno Offensive and ended the war fighting in the Prague Offensive. Shortly after the end of the war, the division was redesignated as the 111th Guards Rifle Division, and disbanded in 1946‚Äì1947.  History  The 4th Guards Airborne Division was formed by an order of 8 December 1942 at Stupino, Moscow Oblast from the 1st Airborne Brigade of the 1st Airborne Corps and the independent 2nd and 5th Maneuver Airborne Brigades, one of eight new airborne divisions. It was commanded by Major General Pyotr Alexandrov, the former commander of the 1st Airborne Corps, whose headquarters became the division headquarters. The division included the 9th, 12th, and 15th Guards Airborne Regiments, as well as the 1st Guards Airborne Artillery Regiment. For the rest of December and January 1943, the division conducted parachute jumps and trained in tactics, preparing for operations in the German rear. In February 1943, it was transferred from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) to the Northwestern Front, joining the 1st Shock Army. The 4th Guards were alerted for the movement on 5 February and were transported by truck towards Staraya Russa. The division entered combat on 26 February during the Demyansk Offensive, and in the second half of March transferred to the 53rd Army of the RVGK on the Kursk direction. In mid- April the army became part of the Steppe Military District. The 4th Guards Airborne fought in the Battle of Kursk as part of the 13th Army of the Central Front, distinguishing itself in the repulse of the German attack at Ponyri. It then fought in the Operation Kutuzov. During the advance into left-bank Ukraine, the division fought as part of the 60th Army of the Central Front. During the Chernigov‚ÄìPripyat Offensive, it participated alongside other units in the recapture of Pryluky on 18 September. Elements of the division crossed the Dnieper on 1 October, and fought fiercely to hold and expand the bridgehead in the area of Horodyshche, Gubin, and Dytiatky, 20 kilometers south of Chernobyl. At the end of October it transferred back to the 13th Army, now part of the 1st Ukrainian Front. With the 13th Army, the division fought in the Battle of Kiev, distinguishing itself when it captured Ovruch and the significant rail junction towards Polesia on the night of 19 November, for which it received the Ovruch honorific on the same day. Subsequently, the division fought in the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive, and was transferred to the 40th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front (transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front on 21 February) in the second half of January 1944, with which it fought in the Korsun‚ÄìShevchenkovsky Offensive. During the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive, the division broke through the Axis defenses at Oratovka and Yushkovtsy, 15 to 20 kilometers northwest of Tsybuliv on 10 March, then crossed the Southern Bug and took Bratslav on 17 March. It crossed the Dniester southwest of Mohyliv- Podilskyi on 25 March, then developed the offensive alongside the rest of the 40th Army and the 11th Guards Tank Corps of the 1st Ukrainian Front to capture Khotyn on 3 April. For its \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks, valor, and courage\\" the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 April, and for its actions in the capture of Khotyn it received the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class, on 18 April. During the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in mid-1944, the division fought with the 27th Army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front. For its \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks, valor, and courage\\" during the offensive, the division was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class, on 15 September. Between October and January 1945 it fought in the Battle of Debrecen and the Budapest Offensive. From 17 February to the end of the war, it operated as part of the 7th Guards Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front. During the Bratislava‚ÄìBrno Offensive, it fought on Czechoslovakian territory, and captured Bratislava on 4 April. The division ended the war fighting in the Prague Offensive in early May. For their actions during the war, several thousand of its soldiers received orders and medals, and nine were made Heroes of the Soviet Union. On 28 June, the division was redesignated as the 111th Guards Rifle Division when several airborne divisions formed in 1942 that had fought as infantry for the rest of the war were redesignated as rifle divisions. Its regiments became the 2nd, 7th, and 16th Guards Rifle Regiments, and the 466th Guards and 471st Guards Artillery Regiments. Around this time, it transferred to the 4th Guards Army of the Central Group of Forces. The division was disbanded in 1946‚Äì1947 shortly after the army was withdrawn to the Odessa Military District.  Commanders  The following officers commanded the division: * Major General Pyotr Alexandrov (8 December 1942‚Äì18 April 1943) * Major General Alexander Rumyantsev (19 April 1943‚Äì20 September 1944) * Colonel Alexey Kostrikin (21 September‚Äì28 October 1944) * Colonel Nikolay Yeryomin (promoted to Major General 20 April 1945; 29 October 1944‚ÄìMay 1946)  References = Citations  Bibliography =     Further reading  * ‚Äì Litvin served with the division from its formation to his wounding during the Battle of Kiev Military units and formations awarded the Order of the Red Banner Military units and formations established in 1942 Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ","title":"4th Guards Airborne Division"},{"id":"38527533","text":"Barwala is a sub-tehsil in the Panchkula district of Haryana, India.Panchkula: Statistical Information The name \\"Barwala\\" is derived from \\"Bar\\", the Hindi word for Ficus benghalensis.

He also served as Professor of Theology at Highland Theological College, Scotland, from 2007-10. Education Helm was educated (BA, MA) at Worcester College, Oxford, and began his teaching career at the University of Liverpool, where he rose from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer to Reader in Philosophy (1964‚Äì93). He was subsequently appointed as Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion at King's College London (1993-2000). Writings His voluminous writings range over philosophy of religion, philosophical theology, historical theology and apologetics. The bulk of his work, however, has been on the doctrine of God (Eternal God, Clarendon, 1988; The Providence of God, IVP, 1993), religious belief (Belief Policies, Cambridge, 1994; Faith and Understanding, Eerdmans, 1997; Faith with Reason, Oxford, 2000), and the thought of John Calvin (Calvin and the Calvinists, Banner of Truth, 1982; John Calvin's Ideas, Oxford, 2004; Calvin: A Guide for the Perplexed, T & T Clark, 2008; Calvin at the Centre, Oxford, 2010). Helm has debated Christian apologist William Lane Craig on Calvinism and Molinism. Among his smaller works is The Callings: The Gospel in the World, Banner of Truth, 1987, which shows that instead of dividing life into 'spiritual' and 'secular' compartments every moment of it can be lived fully to the glory of God.

The sport was developed in France during the early 1980s and is currently practiced mainly in Europe. It is known as Tir sur cible subaquatique in French and as Tiro al Blanco Subacu√°tico in Spanish.  Competitor admission requirements  Competitors must be 18 years of age in order to participate in International events while National competitions in some countries such as France include age classifications for juniors and masters. The sport allows completion by both men and women. Individual events while conducted as mixed gender activities do have distinct men's and women's titles.  Equipment =Personal= Each competitor is required to have the following equipment: diving mask, fins, snorkel, speargun, diving weighting system and an exposure suit such as a wetsuit. Use of the following equipment is permitted during the competition: replacement gun and replacement spear (including line), positioning items; any other equipment is not permitted. In lieu of supporting themselves with an arm on the pool bottom when shooting, competitors may provide or use a ballast device provided by the competition organisation. This may consist of a weight or a suction cup both fitted with a handle. While corrective lenses and contact lenses are permitted to be used, the use of aiming systems such as underwater torches, telescopic sights, laser sights and holographic weapon sights is forbidden. =Targets= A target consists of 33 cm (13 in) by 35 cm (13.8 in) panel whose centre is located 80 cm (31.5 in) above the pool bottom and is supported by a frame. The panel is made of a plastic foam sufficiently rigid enough to allow a spear to remain impaled. A target sheet is fixed to the face of the panel - the sheet for the individual events have 5 targets printed on it while the sheet for the team event has 9 targets laid out in 3 rows of 3 targets.  Competition area  The sport is conducted in a swimming pool with a minimum pool size of 25 m (82 ft) x 10 m (33 ft), a depth between 1.8 m (6 ft) and 5.0 m (16 ft), and with a water temperature of 23¬∞C +/-5¬∞C (73¬∞F +/-9¬∞F). In absence of a suitable swimming pool, the French national rules permit the use of confined water sites containing non-moving water such as water-filled quarries. The pool space divided up as follows. The targets are located about 1 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft), from the back wall of the pool and are centred 2.5 m (8 ft) apart to create a number of specific shooting ranges. The following lines are marked on the pool bottom - a line known as the shooting line is located 4 m (13 ft) from the face of the targets, a line known as the starting line is located 10 m (32 ft) from the shooting line and a line is located 3 m (10 ft) from the starting line to demarcate space for in-water preparation by competitors from the remainder of the pool which is used for warming up by competitors.  Events  The sport currently has 2 individual events and 1 team events currently described in the International Rules. However, F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise d'√âtudes et de Sports Sous-Marins (FFESSM), has an additional individual event known as Super Biathlon or Great Biathlon described in its national rules. = Individual events = Precision (also called marksmanship) - the competitor dives at the starting line, swims underwater to the shooting line where he/she stops to obtain support from the pool bottom or from a ballasted object, fires at the target, swims to the target to retrieve the spear, surfaces, and swims back to the starting line whilst reloading the speargun. This cycle is repeated within a time frame of 5 minutes until 10 shots are fired, usually in 2 rounds of 5 to allow competition officials to replace the target sheet. Biathlon is identical in conduct to that of the Precision event, however the competitor is required to return to the starting line after retrieving the spear before surfacing to take a breath. This cycle is repeated within a time frame of 2 minutes 30 seconds for men and 3 minutes for women until 5 shots are fired. = Team events = Relay is a team event is identical to the Biathlon event but is conducted with 2 or 3 competitors. Each competitor takes turns in firing at the target until 9 shots are fired within a time frame of 4 minutes 30 seconds.  Governing body  The governing body is the Target Shooting Commission of the Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques (CMAS) Sports Committee.  Origins and history  The sport was developed in France during the early 1980s as part of a winter season training regime for spearfishing. In 1987, FFESSM created a commission to oversee the development and the administration of the new sport. The first French national championship was held in 1990 followed by European championships in 1998 and world championships in 1999.

The company is specialized in trading of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in the United States.  History  Michael Flett, who has been a member of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1996, began his career as an energy broker. He was subject to a disciplinary action concerned an allegation that in October, 2004 and November, 2004 he traded ahead of customer Market on Close orders. He submitted a Joint Offer of Settlement without admitting or denying the allegations against him. The Offer, consisting of a fine of $25,000, restitution in the amount of $74,700, and an order to cease and desist from future similar rule violations, was accepted by the Exchange‚Äôs Board of Directors at its meeting held on September 19, 2007. He founded his own company, Flett Futures, Inc., as a broker on the exchange and transitioned it into a proprietary trading firm in 2000. In 2006, Flett founded Flett Exchange to provide price discovery, and liquidity to environmental markets.  Solar Renewable Energy Certificates = Exchange = Flett Exchange operates an all-electronic exchange to allow participants to buy and sell SRECs online as 24/7 service. The exchange trades SRECs in the states which are in the area of PJM Interconnection which include New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Washington, DC, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Flett Exchange is one of the three major auction and exchange platforms in PJM area beside SREC Marketplace and SRECTrade. As of November 2010, a report to the Prince George‚Äôs County Solar Water Heating Task Force indicated that Flett Exchange is the only exchange-based marketplace for Maryland SRECs. However, the value had still been limited due to low transaction levels. = Spot Market = Flett Exchanges' most active market for the sale of SRECs is the Spot Market. Flett Exchange customers utilize its online exchange in which its solar owners log on and sell their SRECs in a transparent and competitive manner. Sales are immediate. Sellers lock in prices and transfer SRECs from their GATs account to the Flett Exchange, LLC GATS account. The Exchange software provides the seller with a contract immediately and the seller is paid via check or electronic bank transfer the same day. Over 7,000 solar owners utilize the Flett Exchange Spot Market to sell their SRECs on a monthly basis. = Auctions = In the SREC market, there are a couple of methods to conduct SREC auctions. One method is for electric utility companies which are the buyers of SRECs to conduct auctions and solicit sellers. An example is the \\"SREC Based Financing Program\\" which requires some utility companies in New Jersey to conduct quarterly SREC auctions from new solar projects. Another method is to conduct auctions once a month on specific dates to allow sellers and buyers to get together to transact. Flett Exchange provides an auction for its public entity clients. The company facilitates the sales directly by conducting public auctions based on the date scheduled in each contract for each seller. This is a format used by government agencies, municipalities, townships, universities, and school districts to sell their SRECs. = Long-term contracts = The company also acts as a broker to bring counterparties together to negotiate long-term SREC contracts. = Price transparency = In 2009, National Renewable Energy Laboratory reviewed the status of green power marketing in the United States. A concern on price transparency was discussed in the report. Flett Exchange is one of the participants that publicly disclose pricing data to provide market transparency. The company posts results from its Renewable Energy Certificate auctions on its web site and monthly newsletter. It also posts price and volume information on its voluntary transactions. The publicly disclosed prices voluntarily by the participants have allowed analysis into the status of the markets. Flett Exchange provides daily SREC settlement prices to the public on its website for New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington DC and Ohio SRECs.  Other markets  Flett Exchange launched physical markets to bring price transparency to seafood, precious metals and New York City Taxi Medallions but had its most success in environmental commodities. In 2007, Flett Exchange filed an application with the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become an Exempt Commercial Markets with a plan to trade in energy products and uranium. It maintained the status of Exempt Commercial Markets between 2007 and 2009 but did not continue after 2009. In 2008, the company launched a platform to get into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap and trade market. However, RGGI trading activities on Flett Exchange had lasted only less than two years. The last trading was in January 2010.

He used the same staircase that led to a rabbit-warren of studios including those of Filippo Bartolini, Enrico Tarenghi, Nazzareno Cipriani, all considered to be among Rome's master Orientalists and the illustrator, Ettore Ximenes. With those influences, Aureli began painting more works with Oriental subject matter such as harem scenes and exotic beauties.Juler, C., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Italienne, [French edition], Paris, ARC, 1994, pp 20-21 He died in 1929 in Anzio.

The adoption of heraldic arms was a procedure used solely in Polish heraldry and was one of the earlier \\"old way\\" forms of ennoblement in Poland. It became particularly popular in the 15th century, especially with prosperous or prestigious city burghers and patricians aspiring to attain noble status, but was abolished by the first half of the 17th century. History Nobles were either born into a noble family, adopted by a noble family, or achieved noble rank through ennoblement (nobilitacja) by Poland's king. Ennoblement, i.e. the transition to the nobility of a person, who had not been knighted yet, existed in Poland as early as the 14th century. A well-known early example of ennoblement by 'heraldic adoption' occurred during the Polish-Lithuanian union in connection with the Union of Horod≈Ço in 1413. In Poland, ennoblement of individuals was originally not entirely exclusive to the monarch, but could also be conferred to an individual upon being adopted under the heraldic coat of arms of Poland's influential knightly families and magnates and acknowledged by the King or Polish Crown. = Union of Horod≈Ço = A well- known act of heraldic adoption, as a symbolic gesture by Poland, was the admission into Poland's nobility of Catholic boyar nobles from Lithuania and Ruthenia in connection with the Union of Horod≈Ço in 1413. Whereby, forty-seven selected Lithuanian/Ruthenian nobles were adopted into Poland's nobility and granted Polish coats of arms.http://histmag.org/Unia-w-Horodle-1413-8494 = Early modern period = Heraldic adoptions were part of a broad plan devised by the Polish nobility to pander to the aspirations of ambitious city burghers and patricians, thus securing political allies for themselves. Heraldic adoptions became particularly popular in the 15th century and the Polish nobility willingly adopted new members into their heraldic clans as they knew this would not entail any claims on their estates, for instance, from inheritance rights. Ennoblement involved specific diplomatic procedures and required aspiring city burghers and patricians to make various financial contributions on behalf of Poland's monarchy and nobility, for example through taxes, loans, endowments or gifts. Over time, Poland's nobles became increasingly reluctant to over-expand the nobility (or rather saw need to prevent it), since heraldic adoption was open to the possibility of abuse, adoption for a fee, buying nobility (especially by wealthy city burghers) and uncontrolled expansion of the nobility. This caused the disappearance of ennoblement by heraldic adoption by the end of the 16th century, and also limited ennoblement in favour of the King by requiring parliamentary consent from Poland's general sejm. By 1578, royal prerogative was widely vested in Poland's general sejm and each ennoblement required parliamentary consent. From 1601, only Poland's parliament‚Äîthe general sejm, was privileged by an act of law to approve and confer ennoblement. By 1633, heraldic adoption was abolished. From 1669, the ennobled who came mainly by then from the burgher class would only receive skartabellat (similar to the German Briefadel, or Letters patent), a specific form of institution and ennoblement introduced by pacta conventa, a lower class of nobility where newly created nobles could only hold public offices and perform legations not until after the third generation; from 1775 an obligation was imposed on newly created nobles possessing (purchasing) land estate. During the reign of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (r. 1764 to 1795), almost half of the total number of Polish ennoblements was made. Under the reigns of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski and Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, both were also known for circumventing the restrictions placed on conferring ennoblement, applying the so-called 'secret ennoblements', without parliamentary confirmation. Such ennoblement in fact did not give any prerogatives to Polish nobility and was mainly applied to foreigners. Without the consent of the general sejm, some Polish kings also granted personal nobility, without the right of inheritance, giving the title of Knight of the Golden Spur. Ennoblements, including secret ones, were often a way to fund the royal treasury or to reconcile supporters. Therefore, among others the right to ennoblement has also been usurped, for example, by the bishops of Krak√≥w as the Dukes of Siewierz.

In time, all those families were integrated into the Polish nobility, the szlachta.Maurycy Orgelbrand - (praca zbiorowa): S≈Çownik Jƒôzyka Polskiego (A Dictionary of the Polish Language), Wilno, 1861: reprint, Warsaw, Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe, 1986, p. 398.

Entire noble classes from other nations, for example from Lithuania, were incorporated by adoption‚Äîgranted an indygenat‚Äîinto the Polish nobility and its heraldic system.

The battle-cry derivation of many Polish heraldic family names has given rise to the now outdated term \\"proclamatio arms\\", referring to the names' hortatory nature. From the 17th to the 20th centuries, belonging to a distinguished house and a shared armorial lineage mattered to members of the szlachta.

Due to the absence of formalized heraldry laws and lineage in early Poland, nobility of a person was tested in a regular court. The confirmation of nobility was based on calling for a certain number of witnesses. In Poland this was in accordance with a 1633 statute, in Lithuania by Chapter 3, Article 22 of a 1588 Statute. The latter demanded two witnesses each from the maternal and paternal side. The penalty for perjury was being stripped of own szlachta status, by the Constitution of 1601. In case of the successful nagana, the accuser earned up to half of the property of the accused, with the other half going to the state. The justice was highly prone to miscarriage, in particular, to abusive ennoblement Therefore, this procedure was gradually restricted in various ways. After 1581, the procedures took place before either the Crown Tribunal or the Lithuanian Tribunal. Norman Davies conjectures that this practice was among the factors leading to the establishment of a unique Polish practice of heraldic families (, \\"heraldic clans\\", by Davies). It is also asserted that this practice led to development of extensive personal archiving and archive research among Polish nobility.

It is also the most frequently used port of entry and departure for international flights. In 2011, more than 104 million passengers used the airports under the auspices of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). The number increased to 117 million in 2014.http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150128/TRANSPORTATION/150129824/local- airport-traffic-hits-record-high The metro area is served by three major airports, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA), which have been operated by PANYNJ since 1947. The International Air Transport Association airport code (IATA code) \\"NYC\\" is reserved to refer to these three airports. JFK and Newark are connected to regional rail systems by AirTrain JFK and AirTrain Newark respectively. The class B airspace used by the three airports is extremely congested. Despite caps placed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) limiting the number of flights per hour, they rank among the top five in the United States for delays.Newark Airport just set two records. One stinks for travelers. In 2012, travel guide Frommer's rated three terminals in the region as the worst in the world: JFK Terminal 3, Newark Terminal B, and LGA's US Airways terminal. It rated Terminal 5 at JFK as the best in the US. The metro area airports also ranked low in 2017 consumer surveys. In addition to JFK, EWR, and LGA, there are satellite or reliever airports in the metro area which provide additional commercial air carrier service, albeit on a much smaller scale, as well as numerous general aviation airports, heliports, and seaplane bases. History While other localities had municipal airports, New York City had a multitude of private airfields, and thus did not see the need for a municipal airport until the late 1920s. Flushing Airport opened in 1927, quickly becoming the city's busiest airport; it closed in 1984. Newark Liberty International Airport opened in 1928. It was followed by Floyd Bennett Field in 1930; New York City's first municipal airport, it built largely in response to the growth of commercial aviation after World War I. LaGuardia Airport was opened in 1939, and Floyd Bennett Field was closed for general aviation two years later. John F. Kennedy International Airport opened as Idlewild Airport in 1948. Airspace The New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) is the busiest of 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) in the United States. It is responsible for traffic for the Class B airspace in the entire New York Metropolitan Area and the Delaware Valley as well as of oceanic airspace.New York area aviation chart (VFR Terminal Area Chart) (high-resolution TIFF, ~31 MB) Regulations are in effect in the airspace where flight is permitted under visual flight rules (VFR), the East River VFR corridor and the Hudson River VFR corridor. The southern end of both begins at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The corridor along the Hudson River allows VFR flight along the entire length between Manhattan and the New Jersey Hudson Waterfront north to the Alpine Tower, while that along the East River ends southwest of LGA airspace at the northern end of Roosevelt Island. As of 2014, about 1% of flights to the Port Authority-controlled airports use the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which relies on the Global Positioning System instead of radar. Major commercial airports=John F. Kennedy International Airport= John F. Kennedy 2) LaGuardia 3) Newark Liberty John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is the major entry point for international arrivals in the United States, and it is the largest international air freight gateway in the nation by value of shipments. Sections of the airport have been a foreign trade zone since 1984. About 100 airlines from more than 50 countries operate flights to JFK. The JFK‚ÄìLondon Heathrow route is the leading U.S. international airport pair with over 2.9 million passengers in 2000. Other top international destinations from JFK are Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, Incheon International Airport in Seoul, Barajas International Airport in Madrid, Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Cibao International Airport in Santiago de los Caballeros, Las Am√©ricas International Airport in Santo Domingo, Frankfurt International Airport in Frankfurt, Narita International Airport in Tokyo, and Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo. The airport is located along Jamaica Bay near Howard Beach, Queens. The elevated AirTrain JFK people mover system connects JFK to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road. =Newark Liberty International Airport= Opened in 1928, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is considered the first major commercial airport in North America. Amelia Earhart dedicated the Newark Metropolitan Airport Administration Building in 1935. It is the fifth busiest international air gateway. and the busiest in the region in number of flights. In 2003, Newark became the terminus of the world's longest non-stop scheduled airline route, Continental's service to Hong Kong. In 2004, Singapore Airlines broke Continental's record by starting direct 18-hour flights to Singapore. The airport is located in Newark, New Jersey, about west of downtown Manhattan. The top three international destinations from Newark are London, Toronto and Tel Aviv. It connects to NJ Transit commuter trains and Amtrak intercity trains via the AirTrain Newark monorail. =LaGuardia Airport= LaGuardia Airport (LGA), the smallest of New York area's primary airports, handles domestic air service and flights to Canada. It is named for Fiorello H. La Guardia, the city's Depression-era mayor known as a reformist and strong supporter of the New Deal. The airport is located in northern Queens, about from downtown Manhattan. In 1984, a \\"perimeter rule\\" was introduced to reduce congestion, which prohibits incoming and outgoing flights that exceed 1,500 miles (2,400 km) except on Saturdays, when the ban is lifted, and to Denver, Colorado, which has a grandfathered exemption. As a result, most transcontinental and international flights use JFK and Newark (although there are short-haul international flights to the Canadian cities of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa). Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport itself in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities, and this project would accommodate a new AirTrain LaGuardia connection. Other commercial airports=Long Island MacArthur Airport= Long Island MacArthur Airport (ISP) is located in the town of Islip in Suffolk County, New York, about east of Manhattan. It is owned by the Town of Islip, and has been designated by the FAA an official New York airport. =Stewart International Airport= Stewart International Airport (SWF) is located about northwest of the city in Orange County, New York. In 2007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took control of operations at Stewart and has committed $500 million to its upgrade and expansion. From June 2017 to September 2019 Stewart was the only secondary airport in the New York metro area offering flights to Europe. This was enabled by a main runway of over 11,000 feet. =Trenton‚ÄìMercer Airport= Trenton‚ÄìMercer Airport (TTN) is located in and owned by Mercer County, New Jersey, near Trenton. It began to see a return of scheduled passenger service in 2013, which has been inconsistent over the airport's history. =Westchester County Airport= Westchester County Airport (HPN) is located in and owned by Westchester County, New York, about north of the city, along the border with Connecticut. It sees service to a dozen destinations, and has seen increases of nearly 100,000 enplanements in the period from 2008 to 2010. General aviation airports=Teterboro Airport= Teterboro Airport (TEB) is a general aviation reliever airport located in the Boroughs of Teterboro, Moonachie, and Hasbrouck Heights in Bergen County, New Jersey. It is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The airport is from midtown Manhattan in the New Jersey Meadowlands, which makes it very popular for private and corporate aircraft. =Additional general aviation airports= In addition, there are many smaller general aviation airports, as well as several seaplane bases in the port district and the adjoining region. Among them are: * Brookhaven Airport (HWV) * Central Jersey Regional Airport (JVI) * Danbury Municipal Airport (DXR) * Essex County Airport (CDW) * Greenwood Lake Airport (4N1) * Hackettstown Airport (N05) * Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport (BDR) * Lincoln Park Airport (N07) * Linden Airport (LDJ) * Little Ferry Seaplane Base (2N7) * Monmouth Executive Airport (BLM) * Morristown Municipal Airport (MMU) * New York Skyports Inc.

Three of the busiest are located in Manhattan: *Downtown Manhattan Heliport, located at the eastern end of Wall Street on Pier 6, on the East River, was the first heliport in the United States to be certified for scheduled passenger helicopter service by the FAA. The heliport was the normal landing spot for US Presidents visiting New York. The soundproof terminal contains gift shops, administrative offices, a VIP lounge and general passenger waiting area, as well as X-ray and bomb-detection machines at a security checkpoint. *East 34th Street Heliport, which consists of a terminal building and fuel filling station and averages 20,000 take-offs and landings each year. *West 30th Street Heliport opened on September 26, 1956. In December of that year, New York Airways began scheduled passenger flights, the first airline flights to Manhattan. Capacity and delays An average of 40% of passenger aircraft delays in the U.S. originated in the New York metropolitan area, some in the area and others due to cascading effects.GAO report, p. 10 One-third of aircraft in the national airspace system move through the New York area at some point during a typical day.GAO-08-934T, Statement of Susan Fleming, Director Physical Infrastructure Issues, in Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate. \\"NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM: DOT and FAA Actions Will Likely Have a Limited Effect on Reducing Delays during Summer 2008 Travel Season. July 15, 2008 The three major airports rank among the worst airports for delays the USA despite FAA caps limiting the number of takeoffs and landings per hour to 83 at both JFK and EWR and 71 at LGA. While an increased demand for passengers and freight is foreseen limited land availability in the heavily urbanized area and prohibitive costs constrict expansion of JFK, EWR, and LGA. Approaches to mitigate delays and increase capacity include costly runway expansion projects and greater use of reliever airports. Before the establishment of the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in 1960 the PANYNJ had proposed to build an airport at the location in Morris County, New Jersey but was widely opposed. Studies conducted by the Federal Aviation Authority, the Regional Plan Association, the PANYNJ, and others have identified few sites within the region which would satisfy the requirements for a major airport and evaluated potential dispersion of flights to outlying commercial airports, including Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE), Bradley International Airport (BDL), and Tweed New Haven Regional Airport (HVN). In July 2013, the PANYNJ took control of ACY. Defunct airports The first municipal airport in New York City was Floyd Bennett Field, developed to lure business away from Newark, but it was ultimately unsuccessful as a general aviation airport and closed in 1941. It is now a historic, recreational, and sporting area and part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which is in turn part of the National Park System (NPS). The New York City Police Department leases facilities for their helicopter operations from the NPS there. Flushing Airport was another early airport in New York City. It opened in 1927 and was the busiest airport in New York for a time. A decade later it was overshadowed by the larger LaGuardia Airport located nearby. The airport was decommissioned in 1984 after a fatal accident in 1977. Now the area is wetlands owned by the New York City Economic Development Corporation.

As the economies of Europe evolved in the latter 17th century and the 18th century, the strictures of d√©rogeance increasingly came under criticism as being not only an obstacle to the prosperity of the nobility but contrary to the overall interests of the state. In particular, the 1756 book La noblesse commer√ßante by the Abb√© Gabriel Fran√ßois Coyer, first published anonymously in London and then translated into German by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi, proved influential.

It impacted a few kilometres from the present-day town of Chicxulub in Mexico, after which the impactor and its crater are named. Because the estimated date of the object's impact and the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary) coincide, there is a scientific consensus that its impact was the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event which caused the sudden mass extinction of three-quarters of all plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs. In October 2019, researchers reported that the event rapidly acidified the oceans producing ecological collapse and long- lasting effects on the climate, and, accordingly, was a key reason for the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The impactor's crater is over in diameter making it one of the largest known impact craters on Earth. Parent body Several competing models for the impactor's origin exist, and for its relationship to other asteroids that continue to exist in the Solar System. In September 2007, William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlick√Ω, and David Nesvorn√Ω proposed an origin for the impactor in an article published in Nature. They argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina. They proposed that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid member of this group, referring to the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments at the site, suggesting that it was a member of a rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites, like Baptistina. According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about across, with the impacting body being around 6 km (4 mi) in diameter. However, in 2011 new data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago, casting doubt on the hypothesis, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.Tammy Plotner, Did Asteroid Baptistina Kill the Dinosaurs?

It was caused by an approximately near-Earth asteroid with a speed of 19.16 ¬± 0.15 kilometres per second (60,000‚Äì69,000 km/h or 40,000‚Äì42,900 mph). It quickly became a brilliant superbolide meteor over the southern Ural region. The light from the meteor was brighter than the Sun, visible up to away. It was observed over a wide area of the region and in neighbouring republics. Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball. Due to its high velocity and shallow angle of atmospheric entry, the object exploded in an air burst over Chelyabinsk Oblast, at a height of around . The explosion generated a bright flash, producing a hot cloud of dust and gas that penetrated to , and many surviving small fragmentary meteorites, as well as a large shock wave. The bulk of the object's energy was absorbed by the atmosphere, with a total kinetic energy before atmospheric impact estimated from infrasound and seismic measurements to be equivalent to the blast yield of 400‚Äì500 kilotons of TNT (about 1.4‚Äì1.8 PJ) range ‚Äì 26 to 33 times as much energy as that released from the atomic bomb detonated at Hiroshima.best estimate of the equivalent nuclear blast yield of the Chelyabinsk explosion The object was undetected before its atmospheric entry, in part because its radiant (source direction) was close to the Sun. Its explosion created panic among local residents, and about 1,500 people were injured seriously enough to seek medical treatment. All of the injuries were due to indirect effects rather than the meteor itself, mainly from broken glass from windows that were blown in when the shock wave arrived, minutes after the superbolide's flash. Some 7,200 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion's shock wave, and authorities scrambled to help repair the structures in sub-freezing temperatures. With an estimated initial mass of about 12,000‚Äì13,000 tonnes (13,000‚Äì14,000 short tons, heavier than the Eiffel Tower), and measuring about in diameter, it is the largest known natural object to have entered Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a wide, remote, forested, and very sparsely populated area of Siberia. The Chelyabinsk meteor is also the only meteor confirmed to have resulted in many injuries. No deaths were reported. The earlier-predicted and well-publicized close approach of a larger asteroid on the same day, the roughly 367943 Duende, occurred about 16 hours later; the very different orbits of the two objects showed they were unrelated to each other.  Initial reports  The meteor's path in relation to the ground. Tunguska meteoroids to the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building. Local residents witnessed extremely bright burning objects in the sky in Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, and Orenburg Oblasts, the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in neighbouring regions in Kazakhstan, when the asteroid entered the Earth's atmosphere over Russia. Amateur videos showed a fireball streaking across the sky and a loud boom several minutes afterwards. Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball. The event began at 09:20:21 Yekaterinburg time, several minutes after sunrise in Chelyabinsk, and minutes before sunrise in Yekaterinburg. According to eyewitnesses, the bolide appeared brighter than the sun, as was later confirmed by NASA. An image of the object was also taken shortly after it entered the atmosphere by the weather satellite Meteosat 9. Witnesses in Chelyabinsk said that the air of the city smelled like \\"gunpowder\\", \\"sulfur\\" and \\"burning odors\\" starting about 1 hour after the fireball and lasting all day.  Atmospheric entry  atmospheric entry to explosion. The visible phenomenon due to the passage of an asteroid or meteoroid through the atmosphere is called a meteor. If the object reaches the ground, then it is called a meteorite. During the Chelyabinsk meteoroid's traversal, there was a bright object trailing smoke, then an air burst (explosion) that caused a powerful blast wave. The latter was the only cause of the damage to thousands of buildings in Chelyabinsk and its neighbouring towns. The fragments then entered dark flight (without the emission of light) and created a strewn field of numerous meteorites on the snow-covered ground (officially named Chelyabinsk meteorites). The last time a similar phenomenon was observed in the Chelyabinsk region was the Kunashak meteor shower of 1949, after which scientists recovered about weighing over in total. The Chelyabinsk meteor is thought to be the biggest natural space object to enter Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, and the only one confirmed to have resulted in many injuries,Historical, normally accurate, Chinese records of the 1490 Ch'ing-yang event describe over 10,000 deaths, but have never been confirmed. although a small number of panic-related injuries occurred during the Great Madrid Meteor Event of 10 February 1896. Preliminary estimates released by the Russian Federal Space Agency indicated the object was an asteroid moving at about in a \\"low trajectory\\" when it entered Earth's atmosphere. According to the Russian Academy of Sciences, the meteor then pushed through the atmosphere at a velocity of The radiant (the apparent position of origin of the meteor in the sky) appears from video recordings to have been above and to the left of the rising Sun. Early analysis of CCTV and dashcam video posted online indicated that the meteor approached from the southeast, and exploded about 40 km south of central Chelyabinsk above Korkino at a height of 23.3 km (14.5 miles, 76,000 feet), with fragments continuing in the direction of Lake Chebarkul. On 1 March 2013 NASA published a detailed synopsis of the event, stating that at peak brightness (at 09:20:33 local time), the meteor was 23.3 km (14.5 miles, 76,000 feet) high, located at 54.8¬∞N, 61.1¬∞E. At that time it was travelling at about 18.6 km/s (11.6 mi/s), (about 67,000 km/h, or about 41,750 mph) ‚Äîalmost 60 times the speed of sound. NASA's webpage in turn acknowledges credit for its data and visual diagrams to: :Peter Brown (University of Western Ontario); William Cooke (Marshall Space Flight Center); Paul Chodas, Steve Chesley and Ron Baalke (JPL); Richard Binzel (MIT); and Dan Adamo. In November 2013, results were published based on a more careful calibration of dashcam videos in the field weeks after the event during a Russian Academy of Sciences field study, which put the point of peak brightness at 29.7 km altitude and the final disruption of the thermal debris cloud at 27.0 km, settling to 26.2 km, all with a possible systematic uncertainty of ¬±0.7 km. A sample found by Ural Federal University scientists at Lake Chebarkul. The object is part of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. The United States space agency NASA estimated the diameter of the bolide at about 17‚Äì20 m and has revised the mass several times from an initial , until reaching a final estimate of 10,000 tonnes (11,000 short tons, greater than the total weight of the Eiffel Tower). The air burst's blast wave, when it hit the ground, produced a seismic wave which registered on seismographs at magnitude 2.7. The Russian Geographical Society said the passing of the meteor over Chelyabinsk caused three blasts of different energy. The first explosion was the most powerful, and was preceded by a bright flash, which lasted about five seconds. Initial newspaper altitude estimates ranged from with an explosive equivalent, according to NASA, of roughly , although there is some debate on this yield (500 kt is exactly the same energy released by the Ivy King nuclear explosion in 1952). According to a paper in 2013, all these ~500 kiloton yield estimates for the meteor airburst are \\"uncertain by a factor of two because of a lack of calibration data at those high energies and altitudes\\". The hypocentre of the explosion was to the south of Chelyabinsk, in Yemanzhelinsk and Yuzhnouralsk. Due to the height of the air burst, the atmosphere absorbed most of the explosion's energy. The explosion's blast wave first reached Chelyabinsk and environs between less than 2 minutes 23 seconds and 2 minutes 57 seconds later. The object did not release all of its kinetic energy in the form of a blast wave as some 90 kilotons of TNT of the total energy of the main airburst's fireball was emitted as visible light according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and two main fragments survived the primary airburst disruption at ; they flared around , with one falling apart at and the other remaining luminous down to , with part of the meteoroid continuing on its general trajectory to punch a hole in the frozen Lake Chebarkul, an impact that was fortuitously captured on camera and released in November 2013. This visualization shows the aftermath observations by NASA satellites and computer models projections of the plume and meteor debris trajectory around the atmosphere. The plume rose to an altitude of 35 km and once there, it was rapidly blown around the globe by the polar night jet. The infrasound waves given off by the explosions were detected by 20 monitoring stations designed to detect nuclear weapons testing run by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) Preparatory Commission, including the distant Antarctic station, some away. The blast of the explosion was large enough to generate infrasound returns, after circling the globe, at distances up to about . Multiple arrivals involving waves that travelled twice around the globe have been identified. The meteor explosion produced the largest infrasounds ever to be recorded by the CTBTO infrasound monitoring system, which began recording in 2001, so great that they reverberated around the world several times, taking over a day to dissipate. Additional scientific analysis of US military infrasound data was aided by an agreement reached with US authorities to allow its use by civilian scientists, implemented only about a month before the Chelyabinsk meteor event. A full view of the smoke trail with the bulbous section corresponding to a mushroom cloud's cap. A preliminary estimate of the explosive energy by Astronomer Boris Shustov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Astronomy, was ,http://atominfo.ru/newsd/k0520.htm another using empirical period-yield scaling relations and the infrasound records, by Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario gave a value of and represents a best estimate for the yield of this airburst; there remains a potential \\"uncertainty [in the order of] a factor of two in this yield value\\". Brown and his colleagues also went on to publish a paper in November 2013 which stated that the \\"widely referenced technique of estimating airburst damage does not reproduce the [Chelyabinsk] observations, and that the mathematical relations found in the book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons which are based on the effects of nuclear weapons‚Äî[which is] almost always used with this technique‚Äîoverestimate blast damage [when applied to meteor airbursts]\\". A similar overestimate of the explosive yield of the Tunguska airburst also exists; as incoming celestial objects have rapid directional motion, the object causes stronger blast wave and thermal radiation pulses at the ground surface than would be predicted by a stationary object exploding, limited to the height at which the blast was initiated-where the object's \\"momentum is ignored\\". Thus a meteor airburst of a given energy is \\"much more damaging than an equivalent [energy] nuclear explosion at the same altitude\\". The seismic wave produced when the primary airburst's blast struck the ground yields a rather uncertain \\"best estimate\\" of 430 kilotons (momentum ignored), corresponding to the seismic wave which registered on seismographs at magnitude 2.7. A picture taken of the smoke trail with the double plumes visible either side of the bulbous \\"mushroom cloud\\" cap. Brown also states that the double smoke plume formation, as seen in photographs, is believed to have coincided near the primary airburst section of the dust trail (as also pictured following the Tagish Lake fireball), and it likely indicates where rising air quickly flowed into the center of the trail, essentially in the same manner as a moving 3D version of a mushroom cloud. Photographs of this smoke trail portion, before it split into two plumes, show this cigar-shaped region glowing incandescently for a few seconds. This region is the area in which the maximum of material ablation occurred, with the double plume persisting for a time and then appearing to rejoin or close up.  Injuries and damage  Shattered windows in the foyer of the Chelyabinsk Drama Theatre The blast created by the meteor's air burst produced extensive ground damage over an irregular elliptical area around a hundred kilometres wide, and a few tens of kilometres long, with the secondary effects of the blast being the main cause of the considerable number of injuries. Russian authorities stated that 1,491 people sought medical attention in Chelyabinsk Oblast within the first few days. Health officials said 112 people had been hospitalised, with two in serious condition. A woman with a broken spine was flown to Moscow for treatment. Most of the injured were hurt by the secondary blast effects of shattered, falling or blown-in glass. The intense light from the meteor, momentarily 30 times brighter than the Sun, also produced injuries, leading to over 180 cases of eye pain, and 70 people subsequently reported temporary flash blindness. Twenty people reported ultraviolet burns similar to sunburn, possibly intensified by the presence of snow on the ground. Vladimir Petrov, when meeting with scientists to assess the damage, reported that he sustained so much sunburn from the meteor that the skin flaked only days later. A fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, was hailed as a hero after saving 44 children from imploding window glass cuts. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, Karbysheva thought it prudent to take precautionary measures by ordering her students to stay away from the room's windows and to perform a duck and cover maneuver and then to leave a building. Karbysheva, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the blast arrived and window glass severed a tendon in one of her arms and left thigh; none of her students, whom she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered cuts. The teacher was taken to a hospital which received 112 people that day. The majority of the patients were suffering from cuts. The collapsed roof over the warehouse section of a zinc factory in Chelyabinsk After the air blast, car alarms went off and mobile phone networks were overloaded with calls. Office buildings in Chelyabinsk were evacuated. Classes for all Chelyabinsk schools were cancelled, mainly due to broken windows. At least 20 children were injured when the windows of a school and kindergarten were blown in at 09:22. Following the event, government officials in Chelyabinsk asked parents to take their children home from schools. Approximately of a roof at a zinc factory collapsed during the incident. Residents in Chelyabinsk whose windows were smashed quickly sought to cover the openings with anything available, to protect themselves against temperatures of . Approximately 100,000 home-owners were affected, according to Chelyabinsk Oblast Governor Mikhail Yurevich. He also said that preserving the water pipes of the city's district heating was the primary goal of the authorities as they scrambled to contain further post-explosion damage. By 5 March 2013 the number of damaged buildings was tallied at over 7,200, which included some 6,040 apartment blocks, 293 medical facilities, 718 schools and universities, 100 cultural organizations, and 43 sport facilities, of which only about 1.5% had not yet been repaired. The oblast governor estimated the damage to buildings at more than 1 billion rubles (approximately Chelyabinsk authorities said that broken windows of apartment homes, but not the glazing of enclosed balconies, would be replaced at the state's expense. One of the buildings damaged in the blast was the Traktor Sport Palace, home arena of Traktor Chelyabinsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). The arena was closed for inspection, affecting various scheduled events, and possibly the postseason of the KHL. The irregular elliptical disk shape/\\"spread-eagled butterfly\\" ground blast damage area, produced by the airburst, is a phenomenon first noticed upon studying the other larger airburst event: Tunguska.Boyarkina, A. P., Demin, D. V., Zotkin, I. T., Fast, W. G. Estimation of the blast wave of the Tunguska meteorite from the forest destruction. ‚Äì Meteoritika, Vol. 24, 1964, pp. 112‚Äì128 (in Russian).  Reactions  The Chelyabinsk meteor struck without warning. Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister of Russia, confirmed a meteor had struck Russia and said it proved that the \\"entire planet\\" is vulnerable to meteors and a spaceguard system is needed to protect the planet from similar objects in the future. Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister, proposed that there should be an international program that would alert countries to \\"objects of an extraterrestrial origin\\", also called potentially hazardous objects. Colonel General Nikolay Bogdanov, commander of the Central Military District, created task forces that were directed to the probable impact areas to search for fragments of the asteroid and to monitor the situation. Meteorites (fragments) measuring were found from Chebarkul in the Chelyabinsk region. On the day of the impact, Bloomberg News reported that the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs had suggested the investigation of creating an \\"Action Team on Near-Earth Objects\\", a proposed global asteroid warning network system, in face of 's approach. As a result of the impact, two scientists in California proposed directed-energy weapon technology development as a possible means to protect Earth from asteroids. Furthermore, the NEOWISE satellite was brought out of hibernation for its second mission extension to scan for near-earth objects.https://hackaday.com/2020/07/22/the- wise-in-neowise-how-a-hibernating-satellite-awoke-to-discover-the-comet/  Frequency  It is estimated that the frequency of airbursts from objects 20 metres across is about once in every 60 years. (solution using 2600kg/m^3, 17 km/s, 45 degrees) There have been three incidents in the previous century involving a comparable energy yield or higher: the 1908 Tunguska event, the 1930 Curu√ß√° River event, and in 1963 off the coast of Prince Edward Islands in the Indian Ocean. Two of those were over unpopulated areas. Centuries before, the 1490 Ch'ing-yang event, of an unknown magnitude, apparently caused 10,000 deaths.Yau, K., Weissman, P., & Yeomans, D. Meteorite Falls In China And Some Related Human Casualty Events, Meteoritics, Vol. 29, No. 6, pp. 864‚Äì871, , bibliographic code: 1994Metic..29..864Y. While modern researchers are skeptical about that 10,000 deaths figure, the Tunguska event would have been devastating over a highly populous district.  Origin  Based on its entry direction and speed of 19 kilometres/second, the Chelyabinsk meteor apparently originated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was probably a fragmented asteroid. The meteorite has veins of black material which had experienced high-pressure shock and were once partly melted, due to a previous collision. The metamorphism in the chondrules in the meteorite samples indicates the rock making up the meteor had a history of collisions and was once several kilometres below the surface of a much larger LL-chondrite asteroid. The Chelyabinsk asteroid probably entered an orbital resonance with Jupiter (a common way for material to be ejected from the asteroid belt) which increased its orbital eccentricity until its perihelion was reduced enough for it to be able to collide with the Earth.  Meteorites  Strewnfield map of recovered meteorites (253 documented find locations, status of 18 July 2013). In the aftermath of the air burst of the body, many small meteorites fell on areas west of Chelyabinsk, generally at terminal velocity, about the speed of a piece of gravel dropped from a skyscraper. Analysis of the meteor showed that all resulted from the main breakup at 27‚Äì34 km altitude. Local residents and schoolchildren located and picked up some of the meteorites, many located in snowdrifts, by following a visible hole that had been left in the outer surface of the snow. Speculators were active in the informal market that emerged for meteorite fragments. A 112.2 gram (3.96 oz) Chelyabinsk meteorite specimen, one of many found within days of the airburst, this one between the villages of Deputatsky and Emanzhelinsk. The broken fragment displays a thick primary fusion crust with flow lines and a heavily shocked matrix with melt veins and planar fractures. Scale cube is 1 cm (0.39 in). In the hours following the visual meteor sighting, a wide hole was discovered on Lake Chebarkul's frozen surface. It was not immediately clear whether this was the result of an impact; scientists from the Ural Federal University collected 53 samples from around the hole the same day it was discovered. The early specimens recovered were all under in size and initial laboratory analysis confirmed their meteoric origin. They are ordinary chondrite meteorites and contain 10% iron. The fall is officially designated as the Chelyabinsk meteorite. The Chelyabinsk meteor was later determined to come from the LL chondrite group. The meteorites were LL5 chondrites having a shock stage of S4, and had a variable appearance between light and dark types. Petrographic changes during the fall allowed estimates that the body was heated between 65 and 135 degrees during its atmospheric entry. In June 2013, Russian scientists reported that further investigation by magnetic imaging below the location of the ice hole in Lake Chebarkul had identified a -size meteorite buried in the mud at the bottom of the lake. Before recovery began, the chunk was estimated to weigh roughly . Following an operation lasting a number of weeks, it was raised from the bottom of the Chebarkul lake on 16 October 2013. With a total mass of , this is the largest found fragment of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. Initially, it tipped and broke the scales used to weigh it, splitting into three pieces. In November 2013, a video from a security camera was released showing the impact of the fragment at the Chebarkul lake. This is the first recorded impact of a meteorite on video. From the measured time difference between the shadow generating meteor to the moment of impact, scientists calculated that this meteorite hit the ice at about 225 metres per second, 64 percent of the speed of sound. = Media coverage = The Russian government put out a brief statement within an hour of the event. Serendipitously the news in English was first reported by the hockey site Russian Machine Never Breaks before heavy coverage by the international media and the Associated Press ensued, with the Russian government's confirmation less than two hours afterwards. Less than 15 hours after the meteor impact, videos of the meteor and its aftermath had been viewed millions of times. The number of injuries caused by the asteroid led the Internet-search giant Google to remove a Google Doodle from their website, created for the predicted pending arrival of another asteroid, . New York City planetarium director Neil deGrasse Tyson stated the Chelyabinsk meteor was unpredicted because no attempt had been made to find and catalogue every near-Earth object. Doing so would be very difficult, and current efforts only aim at a complete inventory of near-Earth objects. The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, on the other hand, could now predict some Chelyabinsk-like events a day or so in advance, if and only if their radiant is not close to the Sun. On 27 March 2013, a broadcast episode of the NOVA science television series titled \\"Meteor Strike\\" documented the Chelyabinsk meteor, including the significant contribution to meteoritic science made by the numerous videos of the airburst posted online by ordinary citizens. The NOVA program called the video documentation and the related scientific discoveries of the airburst \\"unprecedented\\". The documentary also discussed the much greater tragedy \\"that could have been\\" had the asteroid entered the Earth's atmosphere more steeply.

Sophisticated analysis techniques included the subsequent superposition of nighttime starfield views over recorded daytime images, as well as the plotting of the daytime shadow vectors shown in several online videos. The radiant of the impacting asteroid was located in the constellation Pegasus in the Northern hemisphere. The radiant was close to the Eastern horizon where the Sun was starting to rise. The asteroid belonged to the Apollo group of near-Earth asteroids, and was roughly 40 days past perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and had aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun) in the asteroid belt. Several groups independently derived similar orbits for the object, but with sufficient variance to point to different potential parent bodies of this meteoroid. The Apollo asteroid is one of the candidates proposed for the role of the parent body of the Chelyabinsk superbolide. Other published orbits are similar to the 2-kilometre-diameter asteroid to suggest they had once been part of the same object; they may not be able to reproduce the timing of the impact.  Coincidental asteroid approach  (smaller circular blue orbit), showing that they are dissimilar. Preliminary calculations rapidly showed that the object was unrelated to the long-predicted close approach of the asteroid 367943 Duende, that flew by Earth 16 hours later at a distance of 27,700 km. The Sodankyl√§ Geophysical Observatory, Russian sources, the European Space Agency, NASA and the Royal Astronomical Society all indicated the two objects could not have been related because the two asteroids had widely different trajectories.

History In 1853 the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce was founded. In 1873 the Chamber of Commerce requested and was granted land by the State Government land upon which to develop a headquarters. The name of the Chamber was altered to the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce. The first meeting of the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce was held on 29 May 1873 at Maloney's Hotel, with Mr. William Dalgety Moore serving as its first chairman (although the Chamber's own information disagrees with this, and suggests that it was William Marmion). Nothing was done with the Chamber's landholdings until the block was exchanged for a site on Phillimore Street, adjacent to the Fremantle Fire Station, which had become free when the railway yards moved to Midland. The Chamber originally met at premises in Henry Street before the Philmore Street premises were constructed. The current Chamber building was designed by Joseph Allen and reflects the type of commercial structures erected in Fremantle during the expansive gold boom years. It is a two-storey brick building with cement dressings on the front elevation. The building has a large committee room on the first floor and two suites of offices on the ground floor with access between the floors provided by a polished jarrah staircase. The total cost of the construction was A¬£1,980. The Chamber building was officially opened on 30 October 1912 by Sir Gerald Strickland (Governor of Western Australia). The Chamber is the oldest chamber of commerce in Western Australia and the second oldest chamber in Australia.

Population: History Vyritsa railway station was opened in December 1903\\\\. The lands around the station became expensive and were quickly sold for summer houses. Originally, Vyritsa was a suburban settlement and belonged to Tsarskoselsky District of Saint Petersburg Governorate (renamed in 1913 Petrograd Governorate and in 1924 Leningrad Governorate). In the 1910s, the population of Vyritsa was increasing every summer by 10,000 people. On November 20, 1918 the uyezd was renamed Detskoselsky. On February 14, 1923 Detskoselsky and Petergofsky Uyezds were abolished and merged into Gatchinsky Uyezd, with the administrative center located in Gatchina. On February 14, 1923 Gatchina was renamed Trotsk, and Gatchinsky Uyezd was renamed Trotsky Uyezd, after Leon Trotsky. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Trotsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Trotsk, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On August 2, 1929, after Trotsky was deported from Soviet Union, Trotsk was renamed Krasnogvardeysk, and the district was renamed Krasnogvardeysky. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On November 27, 1938 Vyritsa was granted urban-type settlement status. Between 1941 and 1944, Vyritsa was occupied by Romanian troops. On January 28, 1944 Krasnogvardeysk was renamed Gatchina, and the district was renamed Gatchinsky. Economy=Industry= In Vyritsa, there are enterprises of timber, textile, and food industries. =Transportation= Posyolok railway station. Vyritsa is located on the railroad connecting the Vitebsky railway station of Saint Petersburg with Novosokolniki via Dno. There are two stations on the main line, Vyritsa railway station and Mikhaylovka railway station. Additionally, a railroad branches off at Vyritsa railway station and proceeds southwest along the main axis of the settlement. There are four more railway stations at this branch, all directly served from the Vitebsky railway station: Pervaya Platforma, Vtoraya Platforma, Tretya Platforma, and Posyolok. Vyritsa is connected by roads with Gatchina, Pavlovsk, Volosovo, and Tosno. Culture and recreation House built by Ivan Churikov in 1906 Vyritsa contains four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. These are an archeological site, two monuments commemorating the events of World War II, and the birthplace of author and paleonthologist Ivan Yefremov.

It was Krishen's first film, and was an adaptation of Joyce Cary's 1939 novel Mister Johnson. It won Yadav two international acting awards. The film also stars Arundhati Roy, who was yet to write her first novel and win the Man Booker Prize, along with Barry John and Virendra Saxena. Synopsis The film is set in 1929, in a small town in Central India. Francis Massey (Raghubir Yadav) is a clerk in the District Collector's office in the colonial administration of British India. He aspires to be like the colonial rulers, and thinks of himself as different from his Indian compatriots. He falls in love with a tribal girl Saila (Arundhati Roy), and browbeats her family into agreeing to their marriage. They have a church wedding, with Saila's brother Pasa (Virendra Saxena) as the bemused witness. In his wish to help the rulers ‚Äì in particular, his immediate superior, District Collector Charles Adam (Barry John) ‚Äì Massey adopts methods that are irregular. Adam's dream project of building a road through the forest is stuck for lack of funds. Massey manages to get it completed using a mixture of manipulation, persuasion and threats. To his surprise, he is accused of corruption by the very boss whom he had meant to help, and who had condoned his earlier transgressions. His wife too is forcefully taken back by her family. He turns for help to his friend Banaji (Madan Lal) to get his wife back. Banaji refuses to help him. In an act of frustrated rage, Massey kills Banaji. He is arrested for murder, and Adam advises him to plead guilty to accidental manslaughter. However, Massey refuses, secure in the belief that his Adam Sahib will help him out, leading to the tragic denouement.

K. Bose Production= Finance = In 1980, Pradip Krishen won the first prize in a script-writing competition organised by the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). This encouraged him to make the film, which would be produced by NFDC. The budget for the film which was approved by NFDC was Rs 9.2 lakh, which was meagre for a period film. Nevertheless, Krishen went ahead with the project. = Casting = Originally, Siddhartha Basu was supposed to play the lead, and a sample scene was shot with him. Then Basu went abroad and Krishen chose Raghubir Yadav, at that time an unknown young theatre actor. NFDC urged Krishen to get \\"known names\\" for the cast, but Krishen stuck to his choices, using theatre actors from Delhi, as well as debutante Arundhati Roy. The choice of Yadav for the lead turned to be doubly beneficial. Not only would Yadav's performance win him accolades, but his knowledge of Hindi and its dialects came in handy in evolving the dialogue for the film. = Shooting = The film was shot on location in and around Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh, during the winter of 1982-83. In an interview, Raghubir Yadav said that he was very nervous about facing the camera for the first time, but was reassured by Barry John, with whom had worked on the stage. He added, \\"Till we reached Pachmarhi for the shoot, I was not clear how I would play this complex character. One week before the shooting I saw an old man on the road in an outfit similar to what Massey was expected to wear. He seemed to belong to that era. I followed his mannerisms.\\" Reception Although the film met with no commercial success, it did receive widespread critical acclaim. Apart from the two international awards won by Yadav, Krishen was honoured by the Indian Directors' Association with the Best Director Award. Subsequently, the film has achieved a kind of cult status. Looking back on it, one critic wrote:\\"Raghuvir Yadav set the screen afire with his persuasively intense performance as a clerk who is ambitious but not clever enough to manoeuvre exotic rules and regulations that land him into trouble.\\" Among younger filmmakers, Dibakar Banerjee says he has been strongly influenced by the film.

In rail terminology, portion working refers to the operational practice of coupling two or more passenger trains together over common sections of their respective routes, but otherwise operating the trains separately. This allows multiple trains to use the same path over parts of the network where limited capacity is available. Typically, the common sections will be the busiest parts of the totality of the routes covered by a portion working arrangement. History The practice of portion working has been followed for a long time on the third rail network of lines in the South East of England, and has been more widely practised in continental Europe. Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the practice has been less common, because of a general reluctance to design the necessary modern signalling systems, and because of legal constraints on competition between operators. Possible combinations Video: Coupling of two ICE T portions in Leipzig, 2017 A variety of portion working combinations is possible. For example: * two trains may each depart from separate termini, be coupled together en route, and arrive at their single destination together; ** or vice versa: a pair of trains may depart together from the same terminus, be separated en route, and then continue to separate destinations; * two trains may each depart from separate termini, be coupled together, and later separated, en route, and then continue to separate destinations; * a train may depart from a terminus, be coupled en route to another train departing from the point where the coupling occurs, and then the two trains will continue together to their single destination, thus providing a longer train for a busier portion of the route (or vice versa). * a train may depart from a terminus, and divide at a station en route, with both portions then continuing to the same destination, but the first running an express stopping pattern, and the second part stopping more frequently. In the reverse of this, the second portion is the faster of the two, catching up the slow train at the point where they join. Issues For portion working to be successful, the operator may need to address many issues. For example: * locations for (un)coupling must be identified and designed; * the best combinations of services must be carefully considered; * even with optimal operational arrangements (un)coupling takes time; * portion working can transfer disruption from one section to the wider network.

The rhizome is well known in many Asian cultures as a medicinal and culinary item. In many Asian tribal communities it is a part of the diet along with rice. It is endemic to south- east Asia including Bhutan, China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka. In India it is found mainly in the hillocks and riversides of northeastern states such as Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Description Alpinia nigra is a biennial herbaceous plant. It is morphologically characterized by the presence of a rhizome, simple, wide-brim leaves protected by showy bracts, and terminal inflorescences. It has a soft, leafy stem about 1.5-3 m high. Leaves are sessile or subsessile, elongated and pointed at the end. Its leaves are single cotyledons, shaped to look like a pike, about 7‚Äì9 cm wide, and about 20‚Äì40 cm long. The fruit is a berry having many seeds, and the pericarp is thin and green when it is young, becoming black and brittle when it gets old. Chemical constituents The major chemical contents are alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols and terpenoids. The rhizome yields 0.05% essential oil; of which the chief compounds are: 23.0% caryophyllene oxide, 19.9% geraniol, 19.4% eudesmool and 16.5% citronellyl OAc. Important compounds isolated from the seed cluster are kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin, I), kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (II), heptatriacontanoic acid 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (III), heptatriacontanoic acid 1, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (IV) and pentatriacontanoic acid 1, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester (V). In addition, two major volatile oils, Œ≤-pinene and Œ±-pinene have also been isolated from the fruits and rhizomes. From the seed clusters two bioactive flavone glycosides were isolated, astragalin and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide; and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide was found to be a dominant compound which was distributed primarily in the pulp. The chemical 1,8-cineole is the major component in the leaf essential oil (25.4%) and rhizome oil (34%). In addition, Œ≤-pinene (15.1%), camphor (15.3%), carotol (7.3%), Œ±-pinene (7.8%) and camphene (7.0%) were also present in leaf oil, whereas in the rhizome oil Œ±-fenchyl acetate (13.1%), Œ±-terpineol (9.6%), Œ≤-pinene (8.1%) and camphene (7.0%) were the other main constituents. Uses=Food= Thot man nor kala (‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏ô‡πà‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏•‡∏≤), Thai fishcakes mixed Alpinia nigra The inner portion of the aerial parts (pith) is cooked as a vegetable and used in curry for flavouring. The root is used for seasoning. In Amphoe Pak Kret (include Ko Kret), Nonthaburi province, central Thailand, it was mixed in the Thot man (Thai fishcake). It is a notable local food which only sold here. Among the Boro of Assam the pith is mixed with chicken and fried as a much relished delicacy. Its aromatic leaves are used to wrap fish for baking, roasting or steaming by them. =Medicine= The rhizome is used as an aphrodisiac, tonic, diuretic, expectorant, appetizer and analgesic. It is also used in the treatment of impotence and bronchitis. In most tribal communities the root pounded and mixed with rice whisky is applied to skin for fungal infections, such as ringworm and melasma. The boiled green root is a potent carminative to reduce flatulence or dyspepsia. A root extract is taken thrice daily for the treatment of gastric ulcers, and taken twice daily for the treatment of jaundice by the Chakmas. Its use as an antiinflammatory and analgesic agent has been supported by experiments in mice. The rhizome, cooked or raw, has been traditionally acclaimed as a remedy for intestinal infections among the Mizo tribes of north-east India. Experimentally the crude extract was shown to be highly effective against the trematode Fasciolopsis buski.

Coalmine Zwartberg was the seat of the nearby coal mine of the same name, until it closed in 1966. Riots On Monday, January 31, 1966, a group of miners from Zwartberg went to the mines at Waterschei to rally their colleagues for a strike against the closing of the mine of Zwartberg. A small group of Rijkswacht (national police) was waiting for them when they arrived at the entrance to the Waterschei mine, which was quickly surrounded by the miners. They also stopped a truck, loaded with wood for the mines, and forced the driver to leave his cargo behind. Armed with blocks of wood and other debris, the miners threw projectiles at the Rijkswacht, who at first responded by firing into the air as a warning. When the rioters refused to back down, the commanding officer ordered his men to open fire on the group, which resulted in the death of Jan Latos by several bullets in his back. Later that day, Val√®re Sclep died after being hit by a teargas grenade.http://klauwaert.blogspot.be/2006/11/de-geschiedenis-van- zwartberg.html News of the tragedy spread rapidly and the government decided to retreat the Rijkswacht officers and replace them with the Para-commandos.

The Verweyhal is an exhibition space next to the Vleeshal on the Grote Markt, Haarlem. The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a gentlemen‚Äôs society of the former drama society, later a cultural social club, Trou moet Blycken. In the second half of the 19th century the earlier building of the drama society, which was on the same spot, was too small. In 1876 the society held a competition for a new design. The Amsterdam architect A.J. van Beek won, and his plan was carried out with the help of local builder A. Raasveld.Rijksmonument report The building was occupied in 1880. The building is in the Eclectic style that was very popular at the end of the 19th century in Haarlem, but later fell out of fashion. In the first half of the 20th century, the building received a great deal of criticism. It was considered much too large and pompous. ‚ÄòAn object of general contempt,‚Äô according to the description of the distinguished gentlemen‚Äôs society. Almost immediately, the gentleman's society had financial problems. Perhaps the building project had been a bit too prestigious. The gentlemen initially tried to alleviate the situation by raising their membership contribution. That did not help, because the number of members declined. As the increased contribution did not solve the problem, the ground floor was rented out as a shop. This income did not help either, and in 1922 the gentlemen were forced to sell the building to the city, which became the new owner for 125,000 guilders, and they moved to their current premises further down the Grote Houtstraat at number 115. The society building was converted in 1924 into the Spaarnebank. The safe was on the ground floor; offices were set up on the first floor. The building was called ‚Äòan unsuccessful box of blocks‚Äô in 1947 by the engineer G. Friedhoff, who wanted to demolish the building and replace it with traditional fa√ßades. More renovations were carried out in 1978 when the first floor was remodelled to house the Department of Cultural Affairs, the local City Planning Authority and the office of the City Architect. Fourteen years later, in 1992, the building was renovated again as a future exhibition hall to house the collection of the Haarlem artist Kees Verwey. With support from his newly formed Kees Verwey Foundation, the first floor received a new name: the Verweyhal. The former city architect Wiek R√∂ling made a design for the new layout together with architect Jan Bernard. Opinions about the building changed in the 1970s, and for the first time, words of praise were heard. Today, the building is an official monument and still has a museological function. The entrance today to the upper exhibition floors is through Museum De Hallen, Haarlem on the Grote Markt and no longer through the original main entrance on the Grote Houtstraat.

It was chartered in January 2013 by then-president Mwai Kibaki.http://tukenya.ac.ke/latest_news&grqid;=NTIDeiYp&hl;=en-KE  History  Technical University of Kenya grew out of the Kenya Polytechnic. The Kenya Polytechnic was founded in 1961. Proposals for the establishment of a technical institute in Nairobi were put forward in the Willoughby Report published in 1949. This led to the creation of the Royal Technical College of East Africa (RTCEA). The objective was to establish a technical college in Nairobi which would offer education and training at the technician and semi- professional levels for the three East African territories of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. It was then important that in each of the territories there should be students sufficiently qualified to join RTCEA. While Uganda and Tanganyika established technical institutes in Kampala and Dar es Salaam to prepare candidates to join RTCEA, Kenya opted to introduce class streams under the name Kenya Technical Institute (KTI) at RTCEA. By 1960 it had been decided that the Royal Technical College of East Africa should expand its mandate to offer degrees. Thus in 1960, the RTCEA was granted the mandate to offer degrees of the University of London under a special arrangement. Under this new status, the college had its name changed to the Royal College Nairobi. As the college had its mandate expanded, it was no longer possible to continue accommodating the students of the Kenya Technical Institute due to pressure on space. Consequently, the Kenya Technical Institute needed to be moved to a site of its own. At the same time it was considered that the Diploma programmes should be moved away from RTCEA to Kenya Technical Institute. Consequently, in order to offer as well training at the level of Diploma, the Government established the Kenya Polytechnic out of the Kenya Technical Institute. The Kenya Polytechnic established itself for the training of middle level manpower in the country. It is located in the Nairobi central business district opposite the Times Tower and along Haile Selassie Avenue next to the City Square Post Office. It offers TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) programmes as well as the degree programmes. Among the programmes offered at TU-K are: DipTech, BTech, BPhil, BEng and BSc.  Launch of degrees  In July 2009, the university college had the first batch of the programmes of study approved by Senate at the University of Nairobi. The curricula are in the areas of electrical and electronic engineering and comprise the Bachelor of Engineering (B. Eng. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technology, and the Diploma in Technology (Dip. Tech.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The programmes are designed to cover respectively five, four, and three years of study for the B.Eng., B.Tech., and Dip. Tech. The first cohort of degree students joined the college in January 2009 and a section of whom has since satisfied the Board of Examiners and has been recommended for conferment of their degrees in the convocation of 2011.

She was one of the first people to be awarded the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1917. Early life She was born in Rathgar, County Dublin, and educated at home. Following her father's death in 1887, she decided to move to London in search of employment.

She supported the London Dock Strike of 1889 and helped organise laundresses. In 1891 she was appointed to the Royal Commission on Labour, set up to investigate the poor conditions faced by industrial workers, as one of 4 women assistant commissioners. Factory inspector H. H. Asquith decided to appoint women factory inspectors in 1893, and she was one of his first choices, soon superintending a team of 5 women inspectors. In this position, she was known for her good humour which helped relations with factory managers. In 1895, she joined the Departmental Committee on Dangerous Trades. She wrote a book on factory legislation in 1896, The Laws Relating to Factories and Workshops, Including Laundries and Docks. Marriage In 1896 she married Harold Tennant, brother-in-law of and parliamentary secretary to Asquith, and chairman of the Departmental Committee on Dangerous Trades. She resigned in 1897 shortly before the birth of her first son, to devote herself to her family. She went on to have five children.

She was on the Royal Commission on Divorce in 1909, and was a founder and treasurer of the Central Committee for Women's Employment. During World War I, she took on more work: she worked initially for the War Office as welfare advisor, then briefly in the Women's Department of the National Service Department, before moving to the Ministry of Munitions. After the war, she reduced her workload, but still served on committees on maternal mortality and maternal health. She was also a governor of Bedford College in London, an institution founded for the education of women that was part of the University of London. From 1941 she was closely involved in campaigning for the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund.

Background When the Ilkhanate collapsed after the death of Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, rival Mongol tribes, namely the Chopanids, Jalayirids and Injuids along with a Persian clan, the Muzaffarids, were involved in conflicts for dominance over Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. This rendered them weak and ideal targets for an invasion by Timur the Lame in 1393. He overran these territories and sacked portions of eastern Anatolia. But Timur's prolonged absence from his homeland began to worry his nobles and family members and so he sent his grandson Pir Muhammad (son of Umar Shaikh Mirza I) to Shiraz in 1395 to provide security in that part of his dominions. Pir Muhammad departed accordingly for Shiraz accompanied by Ghiyasuddin Tarkhan and Amir Shams-ud-din Abbas, who was to move on with his forces to Transoxiana. Having reached Ardabil, they received intelligence that Qara Yusuf at the head of Kara Koyunlu of superior force was encamped in the neighbourhood of Alahtauk with the design of making an attempt on Khoy. Ghiyasuddin Tarkhan and Amir Shams-ud-din Abbas continued their march for Samarkand while Pir Muhammad made the best of his way to Tabriz in order to assemble the troops of the province and he was shortly afterwards joined at that place by several officers sent by Miran Shah as reinforcements. Battle Pir Muhammad advanced without further delay to oppose the designs of Qara Yusuf and reached a particular spot without confrontation. He became aware that a detachment of the enemy sent forward by the Kara Koyunlu chief to explore and scour the country had taken post in the Qara-Derrah Pass, a strong defile in the mountains which at a subsequent period formed the boundary between the Turkish and Persian dominions. With equal promptitude and decision, the young prince resolved on an attempt to cut off this detachment and accordingly coming upon them with a suddenness which precluded resistance. All those who could escape fled to the Bendimahi river which flows into the Lake Van. Qara Yusuf immediately relocated his headquarters and withdrew in dismay on intelligence that the Timurids were approaching. Pir Muhammad came upon the fugitives the town of Bendimahi and from there dispatched a part of his force in pursuit of Qara Yusuf. Aftermath Qara Yusuf having disappeared without leaving a vestige to indicate the course of his flight, it was thought advisable to terminate the pursuit and Pir Muhammad, being at liberty to resume his march for Shiraz, now proceeded to Soltaniyeh.

Personal life In 1998, Sattam met Cohen-Ahnine in London at a nightclub while vacationing in London when she was 18 years old. In November 2001, their daughter, Haya, was born. The relationship between Sattam and Cohen-Ahnine continued, despite their differences in religion and nationality until Sattam announced in 2006 that he was obligated to marry a cousin, but that Cohen-Ahnine could remain as a second wife. Cohen- Ahnine, however, refused to become a second wife, and the two began to separate from one another . In September 2008, Prince Sattam allegedly kidnapped Haya when she and her mother visited Saudi Arabia. Cohen-Ahnine said that she had been accused by the Saudi authorities of being a Muslim who converted to Judaism, a capital crime in Saudi Arabia, and was held in the prince's palace. However, she reportedly escaped when a maid left her door open and fled to the French embassy, and subsequently returned to France. Since then, Aya has been living in a palace in Riyadh, while France's Foreign Ministry (as well as former French President Nicolas Sarkozy) attempted to bring the child back to France. Aya spoke occasionally with her mother by telephone. Sattam denied that he had kidnapped either Haya or her mother, saying that Cohen-Ahnine was allowed to \\"come and go as she pleased\\" and that she had converted to Islam and married him under Islamic law. The prince said the terms of the divorce, which were put through courts in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, required that the parents share custody of the child. Sattam also said that a protocol was created which offered Cohen-Ahnine a house (all expenses paid) and access to Haya, and the possibility of taking Haya on vacation for 1.5 months a year. Cohen-Ahnine was involved in diplomatic attempts to receive custody of Haya, and wrote a book about her struggle, titled Give My Daughter Back!. She stated that she had seen Facebook pictures of Haya in a niqab and playing with the Prince's firearms, and became concerned over her daughter. Cohen-Ahnine died on 16 August 2012 after falling to her death from a window in Paris. Following the court ruling, Cohen-Ahnine prepared to leave for Riyadh in September 2012 to visit Aya.

Technology, including social and mobile tools, are playing an important role in improving overall personal safety, with technologies such as GPS, SMS, video, alerts, alarms, and more, allowing a user in distress to alert bystanders and close friends.  Features  While most personal safety apps are offered as freeware, some are either distributed as a freemium app with paid features which can be unlocked through in-app purchases, supported through advertising, or marketed as paid applications. These include various features, including sending text messages, e-mails, IMs, or even Tweets to close friends (containing approximate location,) or emitting a loud intermittent \\"shrill whistle\\" in the manner of a rape alarm. Additional features include geofencing and preventive alerts. Some apps allow to customize the alert message sent and the ringtone that signals the reception of a new alert. They normally include different triggering mechanisms to cope with different emergency situations. Common triggering mechanisms include pressing and holding the phone's switch button for a few seconds, shaking the phone vigorously, tapping on an alert button, and even loud screaming sound which the app can detect. When the alert signal is triggered, these apps automatically go to work, sending text messages and emails with exact location of the user to emergency contacts listed on the app. In April 2016, the Indian government mandated that all cellphones sold in the country must contain a panic button function by 2017, activated through either a dedicated button or pressing the power key three times.

NACE International Standard TM0208 defines volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) as a chemical substance that acts to reduce corrosion by a combination of volatilization from a VCI material, vapor transport in the atmosphere of an enclosed environment, and condensation onto surface in the space, including absorption, dissolution, and hydrophobic effects on metal surfaces, where the rate of corrosion of metal surfaces is thereby inhibited; also called vapor-phase inhibitors, vapor-phase corrosion inhibitor, and vapor-transported corrosion inhibitor. VCIs come in various formulations that are dependent on the type of system they will be used in; for example, films, oils, coatings, cleaners, etc. There are also variety of formulations that provide protection in ferrous, nonferrous, or multi-metal applications. Other variables include the amount of vapor phase compared to contact phase inhibitors (1). Because they are volatile at ambient temperature, VCI compounds can reach inaccessible crevices in metallic structures (2). History The first widescale use of VCIs can be traced to Shell's patent for dicyclohexylammonium nitrite (DICHAN), which was eventually commercialized as VPI 260. (3) DICHAN was used extensively by the US military to protect a wide variety of metallic components from corrosion via various delivery systems, VCI powder, VCI paper, VCI solution, VCI slushing compound, etc. Safety and health concerns as well as inherent limitations has led to the abandonment of DICHAN as a VCI. (4) At present, commercial VCI compounds are typically salts of moderately strong bases and weak volatile acids. The typical bases are amines and the acids are carbonic, nitrous and carboxylic. (5) Since the late 1970s, much of the leading work in the development of VCIs and their countless practical applications has been perfected by a privately owned U.S. company, Cortec Corporation (founded in 1977 by Croatian-American immigrant, Boris Mik≈°iƒá, who outlines his classic success story in a book appropriately titled, American Dream: A Guy from Croatia [6]). Cortec has been awarded dozens of patents in VCI applied technologies in the U.S. (several in other countries) and has published an excellent discussion on the science behind VCI technology in the VpCI¬Æ Technology Handbook. (7) NACE International (formerly ‚ÄúNational Association of Corrosion Engineers‚Äù), a global authority on corrosion control, described Mik≈°iƒá‚Äôs key role in the field of VCI technology as follows in 2004 when awarding him the Frank Newman Speller Award for ‚Äúsignificant contributions to corrosion engineering‚Äù: ‚ÄúAs founder of Cortec Corporation, Miksic conceptualized, developed and engineered the principle of introduction of organic corrosion inhibitors into polymeric materials such as coatings, rubbers, sealants and adhesives. He built the world‚Äôs largest specialty chemical company dedicated to the innovative development of synthetic organic chemicals for corrosion mitigation in a vast number of industries.‚Äù (8) NACE also gave Cortec the NACE Distinguished Organization Award the same year in recognition of ‚Äúits major contributions to the field of corrosion science and engineering, specifically to the area of vapor phase corrosion inhibitors.‚Äù (9) Over the years, some noteworthy inventions in the area of VCI applied chemistry have been on the leading edge of addressing environmental concerns. In the 1990s, Cortec patented a process of incorporating recycled resin back into VCI film to reduce waste from film scrap (Australia, 1994 [10]; Europe, 1995 [11]; US, 1999 [12]) and eventually to make way for the use of post-consumer recycled content in VCI film, as well. In 2000, a US patent was granted for biodegradable VCI film technology. (13) VCI film research and development has continued on, with one of the newest VCI film technology patents being awarded in 2020 and including 100% nitrite-free film in its scope (14).  VCI corrosion protection mechanism  For steel, the first step will be the volatilization of the inhibitor into the airspace. This may entail simple evolution of the molecule or the chemical may disassociate first and then volatilize. (15) The molecules will then diffuse through the enclosed airspace until some of the molecules will reach the metallic surface to be protected. There are two likely paths once the molecules reach the metallic surface. First the molecule may adsorb onto the metal surface thereby forming a barrier to aggressive ions and to displace any condensed water. (15),(16). The second path involves the condensed water layer that has been shown to exist on the metallic surface (17). The VCI molecules will dissolve into the condensed water layer, raising the pH. An alkaline pH has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the corrosion resistance for steel. (15) The mechanism for copper begins the same as for steel, evolution of the inhibitor. Once at the copper surface however the inhibitor will form a copper benzotriazole complex which is protective. (18) Vapor pressure is critical parameter in VCI effectiveness. The most favorable range of pressure is 10-3 to 10-2 Pa at room temperature. Insufficient pressure leads to the slow establishment of the protective layer; if the pressure is too high, VCI effectiveness is limited to a short time. (19-20) Product uses VCIs have been applied across a wide variety of application areas: Packaging ‚Äì One of the first widespread uses for VCIs was VCI paper which was used to wrap parts for transportation and/or storage. The technology then evolved with the development of VCI film, where the inhibitor was incorporated into Polyethylene film. (17). This offered the advantage that parts could be stored in the VCI film without any Rust Preventative (RP) oil, which would typically have to be removed before part was placed into service. In places where the VCI film is in direct contact with the metal, VCI molecules adsorb on the metal surfaces, creating an invisible molecular barrier against corrosive elements such as oxygen, moisture, and chlorides. As VCI molecules vaporize out of the film and diffuse throughout the package, they also form a protective molecular layer on metal surfaces not in direct contact with the film. When the packaging is removed, the VCI molecules simply vaporize and float away.(21) VCI films protect metals both through direct contact and vapor action. Large Equipment/Assets are wrapped in VCI heat shrinkable film for long term outdoor storage. The use of polymer films for thorough protection of electronic equipment during shipment or storage should take into account the prevention of electrostatic discharge (ESD), corrosion, and the disposal of the film after use. A main property that makes an polymer film a viable packaging material for electronic equipment is the film‚Äôs ability to eliminate electrostatic discharge. The most recent property addition to VCI film is biodegradability.(21) Coatings - The use of VCIs as alternative corrosion inhibitor technologies in coating is not a new concept. In the last few years, however, with the growing environmental pressure to reduce the use of traditional inhibitors containing heavy metals, they have gained in popularity. Since VCI particles have a polar attraction to the metal substrate, this allows them to work in the coating without negatively impacting other components of the coating, such as defoamers, wetting agents, levelling agents, etc. VCIs are typically added to the formulation in very small amounts by weight of the overall formula. The particle size of the VCIs is very small in comparison to traditionally used inhibitors. This allows the VCIs to migrate into the smaller voids more effectively. Once the VCIs have adsorbed on the surface of the metal, they provide an effective barrier that is hydrophobic and prevents moisture from getting through to the metal surface. Consequently, this prevents the formation of a corrosion cell and renders the moisture ineffective (22). Emitter ‚Äì VCI in the form of a capsule, foam, cup, etc., is placed within an electrical cabinet, junction box, etc., to provide corrosion protection to the various components inside the box. Pipe casings ‚Äì A mixture of VCI and a swellable gel is injected into the annular space between the pipe casing and the carrier pipe as to provide corrosion protection to the carrier pipe. This application has recently been of wider interest as it has been approved by PHMSA as a means to address a shorted casing in a CP protected pipeline. (PHMSA rules dictate that a shorted casing on a PHMSA regulated pipeline be repaired or treated). Details can also be found in NACE SP-200. (23) Pipeline preservation (internal) - VCIs are seeing widespread application for the mitigation of corrosion of the internal surfaces of new and/or existing out-of-service pipelines.(18) Top-of-the-line TOL corrosion typically occurs in wet gas pipelines that have a stratified flow regime and poor thermal insulation. TOL corrosion is predominantly a problem of protection in the gas phase (24). Tests showed that the best potential for providing corrosion protection for TOL came from azoles, certain acetylene alcohols, and a \\"green\\" volatile aldehyde. (25) For new pipelines, the time period between hydrotesting and operations can be very unpredictable and may extend for months. Historical data has shown that significant corrosion issues can arise as a result of residual hydrotest water (23). For a piggable pipeline, an aqueous solution of VCI is pushed down the pipeline between two pigs after completion of the hydrotest operation. This provides corrosion mitigation until the line is put into service. (14) For a non- piggable pipeline, the low sections where residual hydrotest water may collect after draining are identified and an aqueous VCI solution is added at nearby high points such that the inhibitor solution will flow into the low sections, thereby treating the residual water with inhibitor. (23) For pipeline sections that are being idled, the low lying sections are identified, and an inhibitor solution is added at nearby high points as to fill the low lying section to a predetermined depth. (23) Aboveground storage tanks (Soilside Bottom) - The bottoms of aboveground storage tanks are typically coated on the inside (product side) to prevent corrosion. The other side of the bottom, (soilside) is not coated and the unprotected steel rests directly on a foundation. There are various styles of foundations: a concrete ringwall with a sand bed and a liner, a hard pad, such as concrete or asphalt, a double bottom and finally simple soil. (23) VCIs are applied via various methods depending the tank foundation. For tanks with a concrete ringwall, a sand bed and a liner, the VCI is typically installed as an aqueous solution. The solution is either injected at minimal pressure through the leak detection ports, (distribution of the solution through the sand is primarily via capillary action) or through a preinstalled distribution system of perforated pipes. (26) The tank can be in or out of service. Various options are available for a tank on a hard pad depending on whether the tank is in or out of service. For a tank that is in service, a ring of perforated pipes is installed at the edge of the chime sealed via a membrane that creates an enclosed space between the tank chime and the hard pad foundation. The VCI is supplied as a powder in mesh sleeves that are threaded into the perforated pipes. Upon depletion of the VCI, the mesh sleeves are removed, and new sleeves installed. (28) For a tank that is out of service with the floor removed, grooves are cut into the hard pad. A channel is also cut from the end of the groove to extend beyond the tank chime. Perforated pipe with a mesh cover is laid at the bottom of the cut grooves. The groove is then filled with sand. The tank bottom is then installed as normal. The VCI is supplied as a powder in mesh sleeves that are installed into the perforated pipe. The ends of the perforated pipes are sealed closed. Upon depletion of the VCI, the mesh sleeves are removed, and new sleeves installed. (27) For a tank that is out of service without the floor removed, the typical approach is to inject the VCI as an aqueous solution through ports that have been installed through the floor which often are the helium ports that were used to verify the tank floor integrity. (28) There are two typical geometries for double bottom tank. In the first, the space between the two floors has a liner and a sand bed and for the second, a liner and a concrete pad with radial slots. (This style of double bottom is often called an El Segundo double bottom). For a double bottom with a liner and sand bed, the VCI is supplied as an aqueous solution which is injected through the leak detection ports. For an El Segundo bottom that is in service, the VCI is again supplied as an aqueous solution that is injected through the leak detection ports. The ports are sealed closed and the solution is allowed to stand for a short period of time. The ports are then opened and the VCI solution is drained leaving a residual amount of the VCI solution within the space. This residual VCI provides the corrosion protection for the space. For an El Segundo bottom that is out of service, perforated pipes are installed into the grooves in the concrete that have leak detection ports. Mesh sleeves containing inhibitor powder is inserted into the perforated pipes and the leak detection ports are closed. Aboveground storage tanks (Roofs) ‚Äì The environment in the headspace of an aboveground storage tank can be very aggressive especially for tanks storing crude oil. The environment is aggressive as a result of the acidic species that are typically found in crude oil, (sour crude). Corrosion protection is supplied via a system of dispensers that have been attached to ports that have been installed on the tank roof. (Ports and shut-off valves are installed when the tank is out of service). Bottles containing the VCI are placed in the dispenser and the shut off valves are opened. The VCI has a high vapor pressure such that the inhibitor will saturate the airspace within the dispenser and then will diffuse through the open port into the storage tank headspace. (29,30) Oils - The most common use of VCIs in oils is for the protection of oil containing systems like an engine or hydraulics during intermittent use or during longer-term storage (mothballing). The VCI treated oil is typically added to the existing oil and the unit is run to fully circulate the treated oil throughout the system. The system is then shut off for storage. The VCI treated oil can also be fogged into void spaces within a system or enclosed space. (30) Interior of large enclosed spaces ‚Äì VCIs have been used to protect the interior of equipment such as tanks, vessels, boilers, piping, heat exchangers, etc., especially for voids and/or recessed areas of interior cavities during storage and/or transportation. The typical means are fogging/blowing the VCI powder into the interior space or applying the VCI powder in packet form. For smaller volumes, the packets are simply distributed within the space. For larger volumes, the packets are attached to leads that are then hung at the perimeter of the space. (31) Water treatment ‚Äì Aqueous VCI solutions have been used to flush/rinse pipelines, pumps, manifolds, enclosed pits, heat exchangers, etc. as preparation for mothballing/storage. Specialty covers ‚Äì VCI film covers have been used to protect flanges, valves, etc. in harsh environments such as chemical processing plants, offshore platforms, etc. (34) See also *Cosmoline *Desiccant References # Y.I.

The uptempo song‚Äîvariously described as trap, hip hop or bass music‚Äîincorporates a mechanical bassline, Dutch house synth riffs, a dance music drop, and samples of growling-lion sounds. It also samples Plastic Little's 2001 song \\"Miller Time\\", specifically the vocal \\"then do the Harlem shake\\", which is an allusion to the dance of the same name. Baauer added a variety of peculiar sounds to the song so that it would stand out. The single did not begin to sell significantly until February 2013, when a YouTube video set to its music developed into an Internet meme of the same name. The media response to the meme helped increase the single's sales, as it charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in both Australia and New Zealand. During the song's chart run, Billboard enacted a policy that included video streams as a component of their charts. \\"Harlem Shake\\" was well received by music critics, who viewed it as an appealing dance track, although some felt that it was more of a novelty song. After the song became a hit, Mad Decent label head Diplo reached an agreement with the artists of the song's samples, which had not been contractually cleared before its release. However, according to Baauer, he has not received any of the money the song made because of the legal issues from not having properly cleared the samples. American rapper Azealia Banks released a remix to \\"Harlem Shake\\" on her SoundCloud page, which was subsequently removed at Baauer's request and led to a dispute between the two.  Background  Baauer (right) performing in 2012 In 2011, Baauer rededicated himself to music after studying at City College and began to practice making beats. He recorded \\"Harlem Shake\\" in 2012 in his bedroom studio in Brooklyn, New York. With the song, he wanted to record a high-pitched, Dutch house synthesizer over a hip hop track and make it stand out by adding a variety of peculiar sounds. He later referred to it as \\"a goofy, fun song\\". Baauer posted \\"Harlem Shake\\", along with several of his other recordings, on his SoundCloud page, and in April, Scottish DJ Rustie featured the song in his Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1. Record producer and Mad Decent label head Diplo heard the song, and released it on May 22 as a free digital download through Mad Decent's imprint label Jeffree's. It was Baauer's debut single.  Music and lyrics  \\"Harlem Shake\\" features harsh snares, a mechanical bassline, samples of growling lions, and Dutch house synth riffs. It has a high tempo characteristic of hip hop and a dance music drop. According to Andrew Ryce from Resident Advisor, \\"Harlem Shake\\" is a hip hop and bass song, while both David Wagner of The Atlantic and Khal from Complex described it as trap, a musical subgenre with stylistic origins in EDM and Southern hip hop, featuring Roland TR-808 beats and drops.Khal, The 10 Best Trap Tracks of 2012, Complex, December 22, 2012 Ryce felt the song's music \\"represents the hip-hop contingent of\\" bass music, which is typified by rolling snares and jerky basslines, finding it \\"particularly symptomatic of a growing strain of music obsessed with 'trap. By contrast, Jon Caramanica from The New York Times argued that it \\"isn't a hip-hop song, but it is hip-hop- influenced.\\" \\"Harlem Shake\\" begins with a sample of a voice shouting \\"con los terroristas\\", a Spanish phrase which translates to \\"with the terrorists\\" in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song \\"Maldades\\" by H√©ctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track \\"Con Alegr√≠a\\". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to \\"do the Harlem shake\\". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song \\"Miller Time\\", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and \\"[getting it] stuck in my head for a while\\". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: \\"This was my first fight and I didn‚Äôt know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just smiled at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The other kid, I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes.\\"  Commercial performance  Harlem Shake meme, which skyrocketed the song's sales and streams. \\"Harlem Shake\\" was released commercially in June 2012. Mad Decent commissioned a music video for the single at the time, but were not satisfied with the result and shelved it. It gradually received listens online, and was re-released as a single on January 8, 2013. However, it did not begin to sell significantly until February, when a YouTube video, uploaded by Filthy Frank and featuring the song, developed into an Internet meme of the same name. The 30-second video showed people dancing to the song and was parodied more than 3,000 times in other user-submitted videos. Billboard magazine cited \\"Harlem Shake\\" as \\"the biggest viral sensation since PSY's 'Gangnam Style'\\". Baauer and Mad Decent generated income from both the user-submitted videos and Baauer's original audio post on YouTube because of the site's Content ID service, which allows artists, labels, and publishers to monetize songs. According to MSN Money, they earned $6 for every 1,000 views of the video. The late-week media response to the meme helped the single sell 12,000 units on iTunes in the week ending February 10, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It consequently entered the US Dance/Electronic Digital Songs at number nine and the Dance/Electronic Songs at number twelve. Mad Decent's manager Jasper Goggins said that \\"Harlem Shake\\" was the \\"biggest thing\\" they have released, \\"and it's happened within six days.\\" In the United Kingdom, \\"Harlem Shake\\" reached number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart during the week of the meme's phenomena. By the end of the chart week, the single had climbed nineteen spots to number three. Martin Talbot, the Official Charts Company's managing director, said that the single's climb on the chart \\"underlines just how quickly this track has turned into a bone fide phenomenon. At the start of the week, it wasn't even selling enough to make the Top 20‚Äîbut it is now one of the UK's most popular tracks.\\" The following week, \\"Harlem Shake\\" debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and climbed to number one on the Dance/Electronic Songs, while selling 262,000 units. It was the first instrumental track to top the Hot 100 since Jan Hammer's 1985 Miami Vice theme. It was also the twenty-first song in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one and was aided by 103 million weekly video streams, which was announced that week by Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan as a new component of their charts. According to Billboards editorial director Bill Werde, \\"Harlem Shake\\"'s success prompted them to enact the chart policy after two years of discussions with YouTube. However, Silvio Pietroluongo, the magazine's director of charts, said in an interview for The A.V. Club that their timing was coincidental and came after a period of negotiating the chart policy and its logistics. However, because it lacked major label promotional support, the single registered low in airplay. It also debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and became 1000th number-one song since Australia began compiling charts in 1940. \\"Harlem Shake\\" remained at number one on the Hot 100 in its second week, when it sold 297,000 digital units. It also received more airplay after being promoted to radio by Warner Bros. Records, who had agreed to a deal with Mad Decent on February 26 to distribute the song worldwide. \\"Harlem Shake\\" topped the Hot 100 for a third week and sold 228,000 units, despite a decline in YouTube streams. By March 10, it had reached sales of one million digital units. On March 12, Sean Michaels of The Guardian reported that the song had earned more than ¬£50,000 from YouTube. \\"Harlem Shake\\" remained at number one for five consecutive weeks on the Hot 100.  Copyright infringement  Neither vocal sample used on \\"Harlem Shake\\" was contractually cleared with H√©ctor Delgado or Jayson Musson, who were both shocked to hear the song after it became a hit. In February, Delgado was told by his former manager Javier G√≥mez that he heard his voice on the song and wanted to take legal action. According to G√≥mez, Diplo subsequently called Delgado and told him that he was unaware \\"Harlem Shake\\" sampled his voice when it was released as a single. G√≥mez called \\"Harlem Shake\\" \\"a clear breaking of intellectual property rights\\" and said that since Diplo's call, lawyers for Machete Music have been negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation for the sample. Musson received an enthusiastic call in late February from a past member of Plastic Little telling him that his voice was sampled on \\"Harlem Shake\\". Musson did not have a problem with Baauer using the sample without his permission and found the song's production \\"phenomenal\\". He subsequently called Baauer to thank him for \\"doing something useful with our annoying music\\". However, he felt that the allusion to the dance was \\"peculiar\\" and outdated: \\"I was like, Who the fuck is rapping about the Harlem Shake in 2012?\\" Musson said in an interview in March that he was negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation and that, although no agreement had been reached, the label had been \\"more than cooperative during this\\". In April, Diplo told The Huffington Post that he had reached an agreement to clear the samples. However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer said that he has not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: \\"I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn‚Äôt clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up [Delgado], I didn‚Äôt even know who it was who did that [sample]; I knew the Jayson Musson [sample]. So I found myself in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else...\\"  Critical reception  Pitchfork journalist Larry Fitzmaurice labelled the song \\"Best New Track\\" upon its release in May 2012 and called it a \\"disorienting banger\\" with an \\"irresistible appeal\\" that \\"owes almost everything\\" to its \\"menacing, world-smashing bassline\\". Fitzmaurice wrote in conclusion, \\"Along with this purely visceral pleasure, it's hard not to marvel at how awesome those growling-lion samples sound.\\" Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times said that he liked the song and viewed it as a \\"syrupy instrumental\\" that foreshadows \\"the convergence of hip-hop, dance and rock\\". Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor gave \\"Harlem Shake\\" a rating of three-and-a-half out of five and found its musical climax \\"admittedly satisfying‚Äîthat is, until it resumes flailing like a novelty track\\", writing that \\"it's not hard to see why the track is well-liked, but its snowballing ubiquity is a bit of a head- scratcher, simply because it's not all that interesting.\\" Similarly, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that, after hearing a minute of it being played during Power 105.1 FM's mixshow, the song \\"felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy.\\" Caramanica felt that its success, along with that of Macklemore's 2012 song \\"Thrift Shop\\", reflects a \\"centerless future\\" for hip hop and stated, \\"Depending on your lens, this reflects a tremendous cultural victory for hip-hop or the moment when hip-hop, as a construct, begins to lose meaning.\\"  Remixes  Azealia Banks, one of several rappers who remixed the song On February 14, 2013, American rapper Azealia Banks released a remix to \\"Harlem Shake\\" on SoundCloud, which was then removed at Baauer's request. Banks disparaged Baauer on Twitter in response and claimed to have e-mails sent from him giving her permission to use the song. She then said that Diplo had sent her an e-mail telling her that the remix was removed because they would rather have rapper Juicy J on it. On February 16, Banks shared a music video for her remix on Vimeo, and revealed a purported e-mail from Baauer saying he liked the remix. Baauer responded in an interview for The Daily Beast, saying that they had planned to release a version of the song with Banks, but felt that her verse did not meet their expectations: Jon Caramanica of The New York Times cited Banks' remix as one of her best songs, while Chris Martins of Spin wrote that she delivers \\"fire-hot verse after fire-hot verse\\" and facetiously remarked that \\"Banks raps all over your dumb 'Harlem Shake' meme\\". Pitbull and Jim Jones also recorded freestyle raps over the song. After releasing his version, Jones claimed in an interview that \\"Harlem Shake\\" was a song he originally recorded one year ago for an album by Pauly D, but that they ultimately scrapped it: \\"When I started to hear the 'Harlem Shake' and heard the beat, I was like damn, I had the record for a year.

Biography Carl Timoleon von Neff was born at a manor house in Neu-Isenhof (P√ºssi), Russian Empire, in what is today eastern Estonia, but was then a part of the Russian Empire as the Governorate of Estonia, in 1804. His mother was a French governess at the estate; he was an illegitimate child. He began studying art in Estonia under the tutelage of Karl von K√ºgelgen and continued at the Academy of Arts in Dresden, present-day Germany. He graduated from there in 1825. Following his graduation, he travelled and divided his time between his native Estonia, Italy and Saint Petersburg, the Imperial capital. In St. Petersburg he received a commission to paint the daughters of the emperor Nicholas I. The portrait was apparently well received as he from this time onward became tied to the court, and made a career as an artist working for the higher echelons of society. He received prestigious commissions in both St. Petersburg and abroad. In recognition for his work, especially for contributing to the artistic embellishment of several churches, he was generously awarded with different forms of official recognition, such as orders and titles. In addition, he became one of the emperor's closest advisers in questions related to art. In 1846, he was made an honorary member of the Academy of Florence and after finishing the decoration of parts of the iconostasis of St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, was nominated to become a member of the Russian Imperial Academy of Arts. Following his many successes he built an Italianate manor house to house his personal art collection in Muuga, Estonia. Works As a court artist, von Neff was appreciated as a portraitist and painter of typically academical subjects which were then popular, notably odalisque-like nude bathers and nymphs. As mentioned, he contributed to the artistic decoration of Saint Isaac's Cathedral, St. Petersburg, Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow, and Helsinki Cathedral, in present-day Finland, as well as churches outside the Russian empire - e.g. in Nice, France and Wiesbaden, present-day Germany. Several of his works are displayed in the Art Museum of Estonia today.

It was written by Neil Gaiman and directed by Stephen Woolfenden. It was watched by 6.64 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received generally positive reviews from critics. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and the nanny Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) bring Clara's charges Angie (Eve de Leon Allen) and Artie (Kassius Carey Johnson) to an extraterrestrial theme park, where an army of cyborgs called Cybermen reawaken centuries after their defeat in a war. The Cybermen discover the Doctor, and transform him into a \\"Cyber- Planner\\", which creates a split personality fighting for control of the Doctor's body with a game of chess. Plot The Eleventh Doctor takes Clara and her nanny charges Angie and Artie to an extraterrestrial theme park. They find the park is closed down and under occupation by a punishment platoon. The Doctor convinces the platoon that he is an ambassador working for their missing Emperor, and is allowed to stay. Deactivated Cybermen are harmless museum pieces at the park because Cybermen were defeated a thousand years ago. An army of Cybermen that were hiding under the park and slowly upgrading their parts wake up and steal Angie and Artie. The Doctor puts Clara in charge of the troops, warning her not to let them destroy the planet while he rescues the children. The Doctor finds Angie and Artie and is partially upgraded into a Cyberman, sharing the Cyberman super-consciousness, the \\"Cyberiad\\". This gives him a split personality as both the Doctor and the \\"Cyber-Planner\\", who names himself Mr Clever, share the same body and each control almost half of the brain. The Doctor and Mr Clever agree to play chess for the complete control of the body. Mr Clever is temporarily stopped by the Doctor placing a golden ticket on his face, explaining that the Cybermen's weakness to gold is still present in their current code; Mr Clever soon installs a patch to overcome this weakness. Clara relocates the platoon to a \\"comical castle\\", an attraction at the theme park, where they take stock of minimal arms: one large anti-Cyberman gun with a limited charge, five hand pulsers, and a planet- imploding bomb. The Doctor returns with Angie and Artie, and demands that Clara tie him up to let him finish his chess game, while the platoon hold off poorly against the Cybermen, who can quickly adapt and upgrade to overcome any obstacle. Mr Clever destroys the bomb trigger, leaving the group defenceless. The Doctor uses a hand pulser to remove Mr Clever from his mind. Angie reveals that a man called Porridge is the Emperor ‚Äî she recognised him from an imperial penny and a waxwork model. The Emperor activates the bomb verbally and signals for an imperial spaceship to teleport them away. At the Doctor's request, Porridge retrieves the Doctor's ship the TARDIS just before the planet implodes, destroying the Cyberman army, however, a single Cybermite survives, floating in the vacuum of space. Production Writer Neil Gaiman had previously written the series 6 episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", which was positively received. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat contacted Gaiman about writing for the series and asked him to make the Cybermen \\"scary again\\". Gaiman announced his return to Doctor Who during his Hugo Award acceptance speech for \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", commenting that \\"only a fool or a madman would try again ‚Äì so [he was] on his third draft now\\". Gaiman stated that the episode was planned for the second half of series 7, but could be delayed, as happened with \\"The Doctor's Wife\\". The redesigned Cybermen as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience On redesigning the Cybermen, Gaiman thought back to classic series serials The Moonbase (1967) and The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967) and decided to \\"take the 1960s Cybermen and [incorporate] everything that's happened since\\". However, Gaiman said that he \\"got completely side-tracked by a mad, strange romp\\". Moffat stated that the Cybermen were redesigned because they did so often in the classic series, and yet had been consistent in the new series. The previous design of the Cybermen also appear in this episode, but are not the primary threats. Gaiman was motivated to provide a \\"rationalisation\\" for the Cybermen in current Doctor Who continuity. The classic series had depicted the Cybermen as alien cyborgs, while the revived series depicted them as human cyborgs from a parallel Earth; Gaiman opined that his Cybermen stemmed from an encounter and amalgamation of these two types of Cybermen following \\"The Next Doctor\\". Warwick Davis stated that it was a \\"thrill\\" to be in Doctor Who, especially in an episode with the Cybermen written by Gaiman. Some location filming took place in early November 2012 at Castell Coch. =Lost script= During filming at Castell Coch, a copy of the readthrough script was found in a taxi in Cardiff. It was marked as being Eve De Leon Allen's copy and had the working title of \\"The Last Cyberman\\", which was subsequently changed. The script was found by Hannah Durham, who posted a picture of the script to Facebook with the caption: \\"found Dr Who script in the back of a taxi. Cheeky spoilers anyone?\\" It was then posted to Reddit by Dan Rowling with the caption: \\"Look what a Facebook friend found in a taxi in Cardiff on Monday\\". Arrangements were then made by Hannah Durham and Dan Rowling to return the script to the BBC. Broadcast and reception Overnight viewing figures estimate that the episode was watched by 4.7 million viewers, rising to 6.64 million after calculating the final ratings, making it the ninth most-watched programme of the week on BBC One. The episode scored 84 on the Appreciation Index, indicating that the public enjoyed it. Media critics gave generally positive reviews to the episode, and Matt Smith and Warwick Davis' performances were universally praised. Dan Martin from The Guardian stated that \\"The Cybermen are back ‚Äì and scary for the first time since the 60s, thanks to a whimsical but effective script from Neil Gaiman.\\" Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine wrote that Gaiman \\"created an amazing yet believable world here ‚Äî one that felt otherworldly and yet close to home. The designs of the amusement park captivate\\", and praised the cast, especially Davis' performance. Sarah Crompton at The Daily Telegraph gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. She felt that Gaiman succeeded in making the Cybermen scary again, though the episode \\"could have done with more variation in pace and tone\\". She also praised Smith and Davis' performances. Simon Brew of Den of Geek called it \\"a very good episode, and it's worth having a second watch to pick up some of the lovely nods to Who past that have been fused in.\\" He wrote that \\"You can't help but feel the influence of the Borg from Star Trek in here\\", and referred to their Borg-like adaptation to specific threats as something that is both \\"familiar\\" and which \\"works in making them feel less beatable\\". IGN's Mark Snow gave a positive review, saying that the episode \\"still stands up as a solid if underwhelming return for one of Who's most iconic and timeless of villains.\\" He also praised Davis' performance. Neela Debnath at The Independent called it \\"another episode which failed to live up to the hype\\", and said that \\"Gaiman is a superb writer and his dialogue for the Doctor's internal battle was written well but the other characters felt superfluous and two-dimensional\\", but praised Smith's performance, calling it \\"one of the few reasons to watch this episode\\". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was negative, describing it as an \\"almighty Cyber flop\\", and comparing it to the \\"execrable\\" Silver Nemesis.

The school consists of seven departments: Economics and Business Economics, Management, Political Science, Law, Business Communication, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences and Department of Business Development and Technology (located in the city of Herning). The main campus is located in Aarhus. Aarhus BSS is a merger from 2007 and teaches programmes at Bachelor‚Äôs, Master and PhD level along with the MBA (Master of Business Administration), EMBA (Executive MBA) programmes and Summer University and Winter school courses. In 2010 Dale T. Mortensen, a Niels Bohr Visiting Professor at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his colleagues Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides. History The history of the Aarhus BSS is both old and new. On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (ASB or in Danish: Handelsh√∏jskolen) merged with Aarhus University to become part of Aarhus University and in 2011 the Aarhus School of Business and Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business was founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences, consisting of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969. Aarhus School of Business's predecessor, The Jutland Business School (Den Jyske Handelsh√∏jskole, DJH), has a somewhat more extensive history. Already in the late 1800s, DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to follow studies within business, economics and trade. Only when Aarhus School of Business was founded in 1939 did it become the academic institution that it was known as today. Aarhus School of Business has continually grown since its founding. In 1968 Aarhus School of Business moved from the original location downtown Aarhus to the yellow and red brick buildings which since then have provided the setting for the outstanding research and teaching that Aarhus School of Business stood for. After the 2011 merger the school now has around 16,000 students, 737 academic staff, including 223 PhD students,[3] making it one of the largest business schools in Europe.

Merxm√ºller's interest in botany was noticed at an early age by his mentors, and he was encouraged to collect in the Bavarian Alps and countryside. At 17 he joined the Bavarian Botanical Society and at the end of World War II was awarded a scholarship by the Maximilian Foundation, enabling him to study biology at the University of Munich. He completed his studies with a dissertation on plant distribution in the Alps, then taking up a post as scientific assistant at the Botanische Staatsammlung. Here the institute's director, Karl Suessenguth, employed him to assist in the creation of a prodromus or introductory treatise on Namibian plants, \\"Prodromus einer Flora von S√ºdwestafrika\\". Merxm√ºller‚Äôs interests led him to the genus Hieracium, and eventually to an abiding interest in the family Compositae. He visited Namibia on five occasions, collecting mostly in the company of Willi Giess. Compositenstudien I (1950), an analysis of the collections of Sigmund Rehm from South West Africa, the Transvaal, and the Cape Province, was the first of 11 volumes, the last published in 1984. Suessenguth and Merxm√ºller produced only one joint publication \\"A contribution to the flora of the Marandellas District, Southern Rhodesia\\" (1951). Merxm√ºller was an authority on the flowering plants of Africa, and discovered more than 100 new plant species in his expeditions to that continent. He also wrote extensively on Mediterranean and Alpine flora. His publications were on general systematics, taxonomy, cytotaxonomy, and plant geography.British Museum of Natural History He is commemorated in the genus Merxmuellera Conert, and many species, including Barleria merxmuelleri P.G. Meyer, Carex merxmuelleri Podlech, Corchorus merxmuelleri Wild, Erica merxmuelleri Dulffer, Hermannia merxmuelleri Friedr. etc. Merxm√ºller headed the Botanische Staatsammlung for more than 25 years, during which time he became a recognized authority in the world of systematic botany. Heinrich Nothdurft worked at the State Institute of Applied Botany in Hamburg, and collaborated with Merxm√ºller and Kr√§usel on \\"Str√§ucher und B√§ume\\". All had a share in the success of the Kronen-Verlag and the implementation of Erich Cramer's original idea - bring together prominent natural scientists and distinguished artists to create a unique work depicting the exact form and colour of each species, while reflecting its diversity and aesthetic beauty.Cramers Gallery of Nature Publications * Alpenflora; die wichtigeren Alpenpflanzen Bayerns, √ñsterreichs und der Schweiz - Gustav Hegi, Hermann Merxmuller (3-489-90020-0) * The young specialist looks at pond-life - Wolfgang Engelhardt and Hermann Merxm√ºller; translated [from the German] by Heather J.

It is located on Penn Avenue in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. It has features works by Paul Joseph Stankard and classes taught by Dante Marioni, Davide Salvadore, and Cesare Toffolo. The origins of the Pittsburgh Glass Center date to 1991, when David Stephens, then visual-arts officer of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, approached glass artists Ron Desmett and Kathleen Mulcahy, then a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, about the idea of a center for studio glass. It was originally to have been the Elizabeth Glass Center in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. However, by 1999, the plans had changed and the center was re-oriented to Pittsburgh. It was officially opened in 2001. The current facility in Garfield is LEED-certified. Its development has aided the growth of Garfield, especially with the adjacent Glass Lofts residential development. In fall 2010, the Pittsburgh Glass Center entered into talks with Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations. In 2012, the Glass Center purchased residential housing adjacent to its main gallery space to be used as student and artist- in-residence housing. By 2012, the center had a $1 million budget, with 10 full-time employees.

Synopsis  A psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lane, is leaving a military hospital after spending two weeks working with patients there. Before she leaves, she encounters a patient reading a comic strip by Michael Kent. The comic's character, the Nixie, encourages people to act on their impulses by whistling in their ear. Dr. Lane explains to the patient that it's not good to act on their impulses. Colonel Brady, another psychiatrist, mentions to Dr. Lane that her confidence as a professional comes from some problem that she has repressed. Later, at Grand Central Station, Dr. Lane picks up her train ticket and gets knocked down by another customer who apologizes. Several bumps and bruises later, she leaves and the customer‚Äîwho turns out to be comic writer Michael Kent‚Äîpicks up his ticket. At the last minute, the clerk‚Äîacting on his impulse because of the Nixie‚Äîswitches Kent's ticket to be the same compartment as Dr. Lane's ticket. On the train, Kent and Dr. Lane bump into each other again while at the bar. He continues to get on her nerves as the days pass. One day, he tricks her into marrying him.  Cast  The Feminine Touch 1941 Rosalind Russell was cast in the part of Dr. Susan Lane, an unmarried psychiatrist, happy to be single. Russell had a prolific film career with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starting in 1934, when she signed a seven-year contract with them. She had been nominated for an Academy Award three years earlier as Best Actress in a Leading Role for her part in My Sister Eileen. Lee Bowman played the part of Michael Kent, a cartoonist in the military that pens a comic strip, The Nixie, which encourages people to follow their impulses. *Rosalind Russell as Dr. Susan A.

Production for the film began on May 8, 1945 and went through July 14. 1945. Rosalind Russell had previously worked with director Alexander Hall on several films including My Sister Eileen from 1942 and This Thing Called Love from 1940. The release date of the film caused an anachronism in the plot: the traveling Kent character is en route to Japan, via San Francisco, and mentions at least three times he is \\"off to war\\"‚Äîbut the war ended three months earlier.  Release  She Wouldn't Say Yes was released to theatres on November 29, 1945. The film was adapted as a radio play for Screen Directors Playhouse and broadcast on June 2, 1950. The radio play was released as an audiobook on cassette in 1977. = Home media = She Wouldn't Say Yes was first released to the home video market on video cassette. The movie was released to DVD on August 4, 2009 as part of the Icons of Screwball Comedy, Volume 1 set along with If You Could Only Cook, Too Many Husbands, and My Sister Eileen.

Throughout his career, he has worked as a scout and analyst for the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), technical director for Sevilla FC and Valencia CF, as well as director of football at clubs such as Xerez CD and M√°laga CF.  Career=Sevilla= In 2000, Fern√°ndez joined Sevilla as the scout for the club's academy and reserves team, also known as Sevilla Atl√©tico. He quickly became part of the first team scouting staff and was subsequently designated head of international football recruitment. At this stage, he forged a reputation for personally discovering Dani Alves, a young, talented player, who he insisted in signing after seeing him in action in the U20 tournament of Alc√∫dia and the South American tournament U20 (Uruguay 2003). Soon after, Monchi, Sevilla's sports director, appointed Fern√°ndez as the technical director of the club. In the next three seasons, Fern√°ndez recommended and oversaw the signing of players such as J√∫lio Baptista, Renato, Adriano Correia, and Lu√≠s Fabiano, among others. Fern√°ndez' career at Sevilla culminated with the achievement of the 2006 UEFA Cup, the European Super Cup 2006, and the proclamation \\"best club in the world\\" by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) =Xerez= In the 2006/07 season, Fern√°ndez took over as director of football of Xerez, a club of Spain's Segunda Divisi√≥n league. The team led the league table for 14 weeks, but at the end, had to give way to rivals with greater financial budget and had to settle for the 8th position. =Valencia= Fern√°ndez's good job leading Xerez did not go unnoticed, and in July 2007, he received a call from Miguel √Ångel Ruiz, football director of Valencia CF, who offered Fern√°ndez the role of technical director of the club. In his first and only year in the team, Fern√°ndez oversaw the signings of Edwiges Maduro, Manuel Fernandes and √âver Banega among others, and saw the season culminate with the celebration of the 2008 Copa del Rey title. =Spain national team= That same summer, Fernando Hierro, sports director of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), offered Fern√°ndez a spot in the coaching staff of the Spain national team, as the scout and analyst of the senior team. With the 2010 World Cup as his main target, Fern√°ndez accepted the proposal, and for the next two and a half years, tracked the top Spanish players to be called up by Vicente del Bosque for his team. On July 11, 2010, the Spain national team defeated the Netherlands (1‚Äì0), and for the first time in history, became world champion. =M√°laga= Following this success, Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, sheik owner of M√°laga CF, signed Fern√°ndez as the director of football. Fern√°ndez' spell at the club ended in August 2012, with Malaga having qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time in its history.  Tribute July 2010, the neighborhood board of Guadalcac√≠n approved the naming of the local stadium \\"Estadio Municipal Antonio Fern√°ndez March√°n\\", in recognition of Fern√°ndez distinguished work in the Spain national team.

T. Saunders Alfred Thomas Saunders (4 September 1854 ‚Äì 3 November 1940) was an accountant and amateur historian of the early days of South Australia, with a particular interest in the sea and River Murray. Working with his own remarkable collection of chronological but un-indexed notes, an incredible memory and a passion for facts clearly stated, he came to be regarded as South Australia's unofficial historian. By engaging in controversy, he attracted a wide following. On many occasions he challenged writings by famous writers and public figures, including Joseph Conrad, who became something of a friend. History Saunders' grandparents, William and Ann Galway left the north of Ireland on the Adam Lodge in 1837 and arrived in Sydney on 13 July 1837. Ten years later they came to Port Adelaide in the Juno, the first steamship to enter Port Adelaide from another colony under its own steam. Both his mother and her sister married ship's captains. His father, Captain Thomas Alfred Saunders (married Margaret Galway 23 June 1849) arrived in South Australia from Hobart in 1849, and in 1852 was appointed first harbormaster at Port Elliot, then a busy harbour, and while there, helped survey the treacherous Murray Mouth. Saunders was born at Queenstown, South Australia in the house his grandfather William Galway built in 1859, then the only two-storey house in the area, later owned by Frank Coleman. Young Alfred, after only two years' schooling, began work in 1867 as an office boy. From late 1875 to 1876 he worked as a clerk for Coombe Brothers, storekeepers in the fledgling town of Port Pirie, so gained valuable first-hand knowledge of its early days. From 1895 to 1905 he was employed by the sharebroker H. L. Conran to keep his records. In November 1886 he contributed his first article to a South Australian newspaper, his impressions of the effect the newly laid railway to Mount Gambler was having upon Beachport. He continued to write, and as the years went by the pursuit of South Australian history became a very serious hobby. His greatest asset in this endeavour was his collection of clippings from every South Australian newspaper from 1837 to 1909, arranged chronologically, and relying on his memory to locate the required article. He also had records of the arrival of every ship which had visited South Australia. Nearly every day he answered an enquiry relating to South Australian history, and frequently contacted authors and newspapers, not only in every Australian State, but also in England and America, with corrections on matters of fact. =Bully Hayes= Around 1911 Saunders took to visiting his bedridden aunt, who regaled him with stories of her time in the Spice Islands, where she had met the famed naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and the notorious Bully Hayes. The more he checked her dates and facts, the more he trusted her memory and decided to commit the Hayes story to print. Having begun to write a history of Hayes, he found it essential to visit Singapore, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Any search undertaken by him was not abandoned until all possible avenues of information had been exhausted. Clerks in the British Admiralty were often called upon to delve into the dusty past, to complete Mr. Saunders' record of some old time sailing ship. =Joseph Conrad= He once wrote to Joseph Conrad, pointing out an error that the author had made, and after Conrad had written acknowledging the mistake, a correspondence sprang up between them. Conrad visited South Australia as mate of the ship Torrens in 1893. Saunders noticed the name John Galsworthy among the passenger list of The Torrens, and wrote to Conrad to ascertain if the Galsworthy mentioned was the author. Conrad replied that it was. Conrad visited South Australia a few years later in the Otago. The visit was recalled in a letter by Conrad to Saunders: :'14 June 1917, Capel House, Orlestone, near Ashford, Kent. :'Dear Mr. Saunders ‚Äî You are a terror for tracking people out. It strikes me if I had done some thing involving penal servitude I would not like to have had you after me. However, I have done nothing of the sort, and am not likely to now ‚Äî too old, and I can enjoy without misgivings the evidences of your skill, tenacity, and acuteness. Many thanks for your letter with the enclosures, giving the history of those lively ladies, the daughters of the late lamented Bully Hayes. Mostly all the inferences and surmises in your letter are correct. I did go to Minlacowie. The farmers around were very nice to me and I gave their wives ‚Äì on a never-to-be-for gotten day ‚Äì a tea party on board the dear old Otago, then lying alongside the jetty there. The Smile of Fortune story does belong to the Otago cycle, if I may call it so. The Secret Sharer in the same volume also does in a way, as far as the Gulf of Siam selling goes. The swimmer himself was suggested to me by a young fellow, who was second mate in the sixties of the Cutty Sark, and had the misfortune to kill a man on her, but his skipper had the decency to let him swim ashore to the Java coast, as the ship was passing through Anjer Straits. The story was well remembered in the merchant service, even in my time. To a man of letters and a distinguished publicist so experienced as your self I need not point out that I had to make material from my own life's incidents, arranged, combined, coloured, for artistic purposes. I don't think there is anything reprehensible in that. After all, I am a writer of fiction, and it is not what actually happens, but the manner of presenting it that settles the literary, and even the moral value, of my work. My little volume of autobiography, of course, is absolutely genuine. The rest is a more or less close approximation to facts and suggestions. What I claim as true are my mental and emotional reactions to life, to men, and their affairs, and their passions, as I have seen them. I have, in that sense, kept always true to myself. I have not the time to write more at present, but pray believe that I appreciate very highly the kind way you are keeping me in mind. In a few days I will dispatch to you a copy of the new edition of Lord Jim, which is about to be published by Dent. Believe me, yours sincerely, JOSEPH CONRAD.' =German settlement in South Australia= Saunders questioned the attitude of those such as Pastor Brauer who opined that South Australia in general and George Fife Angas in particular, owed a debt of gratitude to the 500-odd Germans who left their country to settle in South Australia around 1838. Angas had lost heavily in financing the unplanned third voyage; that of the Catharina under Captain Schacht Pastor Kavel's people from Posen. Kavel had been ungrudging in his gratitude to the English and Dutton in particular. =The libel case= On 12 January 1918, The South Australian Register published a letter from Saunders which accused Government members Crawford Vaughan (Premier), Reginald Pole Blundell and Clarence Goode of complicity in shady land deals, notably the purchase at inflated prices from accomplices, of land intended for First AIF soldier-settlers. As a result of his enquiries, assisted by whistleblowers, and energetic publicising of his findings and opinions, a Royal Commission was held which found two officials (Chief Secretary Alfred William Styles, and Government Valuator Edward Britten Jones) guilty of misdemeanours, but failed to impeach Vaughan, Blundell and Goode, who issued Saunders with a writ for libel. Prominent citizens such as the Hon. D. M. Charleston, writing as a member of the Stock Exchange Club, contributed to a defence fund, but the writ was withdrawn. =A. T. Saunders, Captain Cadell and the Randells= Saunders had a very jaundiced view of the personality and achievements of Francis Cadell, comparing him unfavourably with Charles Sturt and William Randell and accusing him of \\"childish vanity\\" and called his pioneering paddle-steamer Lady Augusta (or Lady Agusta as he delighted in referring to the spelling by which she was registered) a \\"two- funnelled monstrosity\\". \\"Cadell\\", said Saunders, \\"had plenty of political, financial, and Adelaide Government House pull . . . and Government money was poured into his pockets. His father, relatives, friends, and clique kept him well before the public and in the press. Lieutenant-Governor Young and Governor MacDonnell omitted from despatches that the Randells had the Mary Ann on the Murray months before Cadell had the Lady Augusta; yet Cadell failed, and whined that he had been ruined by competition . . . he did not stick to his Murray River business, but was running round seeking for notoriety and the limelight, and asking for concessions. Randell had not powerful moneyed friends, such as Cadell had; yet, undismayed by bad luck, Randell plugged on, stuck to the river, and succeeded. The Randells personally, and not by proxy, made a success of river navigation, and in so doing showed boldness, courage, and originality.\\" Saunders may have been alone in his campaign against the memory of Cadell. Those who knew the man, such as George Johnston and Thomas Goode and others such as John Lewis M.L.C. and W. J. Magarey had a much better opinion of him. Saunders somehow acquired the board minutes of Cadell's River Murray Steam Navigation Company, and donated it to the Public Library of South Australia to put on the public record the \\"brilliant genius (of) Capt. Francis Cadell\\". In 1899 Saunders was elected to the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia. Critiques Saunders had a good brain but a minimum of schooling, so found writing irksome, and he had no knowledge of record-keeping standards. This led to him developing his own systems, which required a minimum of writing and were highly effective, but incomprehensible to anyone else. He had a perfect memory for names, places and dates, but was incapable of memorising abstractions such as the conjugation of a simple French verb or the batting averages of a cricket player. Saunders had a very jaundiced view of the Lutheran Church and the German people (at least those who came to South Australia and settled in places such as Hahndorf and Klemzig, South Australia), finding them boorish and insular. Such sentiments found ready acceptance during World War I. Bibliography *Saunders, A. T.

Unlucky Years  The ages most often considered unlucky in Japan are 25, 42, and 61 for men, and 19, 33, and 37 for women, though there is much regional variation. Note that yakudoshi are calculated by traditional age reckoning in Japan, according to which children are considered to be one year old at birth, and add to their age every New Year's Day. In some communities, the sixty-first year, which was traditionally the year for retirement, has been held to be lucky rather than unlucky. Among the unlucky years, the most unlucky are thought to be the ages of 42 for men and 33 for women, which are known as daiyakudoshi, or \\"great-calamity years.\\" The year preceding a yakudoshi year, called a year, is also considered dangerous, as is the year following one, called atoyaku. Although yakudoshi is a folk belief, it is shared even by many sophisticated urban Japanese, though the anthropologist David C. Lewis noted in a 1998 study that \\"Even if a person does visit a shrine or buy a charm on account of social pressures, some inner scepticism about the 'truth' of the yakudoshi beliefs might remain.\\" The superstition is taken very seriously, for example, by the high-status family at the heart of Tanizaki's novel The Makioka Sisters. Different historical sources specify different ages as yakudoshi. For example, the Iroha Jiruish≈ç (Ëâ≤ËëâÂ≠óÈ°ûÊäÑ), a Japanese dictionary from the Heian period (12th century), states that the years 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97 are unlucky. On the other hand, the Shuugaishou (ÊãæËä•ÊäÑ), from the Kamakura period, states that 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, and 99 are yakudoshi.[Ê¥ûÈô¢ÂÖ¨Ë≥¢] Ê∏ÖÂéüÊûùË≥¢Á≠âÁ≠ÜÊ∞∏Ê≠£‰∏ÉÂπ¥1510ÂÜô. ‰∫¨ÈÉΩÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÈôÑÂ±ûÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®. 2011Âπ¥2Êúà9Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ß The 16th-century source Kanei (ÂØõÊ∞∏) states that 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 85, and 99 are the yakudoshi numbers.[Ê¥ûÈô¢ÂÖ¨Ë≥¢] ÂØõÊ∞∏Â£¨ÂçàÂ≠üÂ§èÂêâÊó¶Ë•øÊùëÊ∞èÂêâÂÖµË°õÊñ∞Âàä. ‰∫¨ÈÉΩÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÈôÑÂ±ûÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®. 2011Âπ¥2Êúà9Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ß And in Buddhist teachings, meanwhile, 7, 13, 33, 37, 42, 49, 52, 61, 73, 85, 97, and 105 are considered to be unlucky.  Remedies  To ward off the misfortunes believed to occur during a yakudoshi, individuals may engage in prayer to Shinto or Buddhist deities, attend rituals, purchase protective charms, make pilgrimages, exchange gifts, or hold special festivities, usually at the beginning or end of the year. An anthropologist reported in 1955 that to send away the danger associated with a yakudoshi, individuals sometimes abandoned a personal item such as a comb or a writing brush at a crossroads, and that in one region, men wore underwear in the lucky color of red during their forty-second year. A yakudoshi festival is held annually at Hachiman shrines on January 18 and 19. During the two-day period, people entering either a maeyaku or yakudoshi year attend the shrine to undergo a harae ritual called . The ceremony involves a priest reciting a prayer whilst waving a haraegushi above the person in order to ward off the unlucky spirits. People also purchase items to display in their home or carry on their person to protect them during the year.Source?  Origins  Some elements of yakudoshi beliefs probably stem from the Chinese-derived astrological system known as Onmy≈çd≈ç, though yakudoshi practice today is more closely associated with Shinto institutions. Several scholars find it suggestive, for example, that the Chinese lunar-solar calendar runs on a sixty-year cycle, so that in one's unlucky sixty-first year, one is at the same point in the cycle as in the year of one's birth. The yakudoshi superstitions may also be related to indigenous traditional Japanese beliefs regarding ritual purification and affinity by age. In some rural communities, it was thought necessary to avoid exchange yakudoshi gifts with, or attending the yakudoshi festivities of, one's age- mates during an unlucky year. Many Japanese believe that the bad luck associated with some ages derives from puns that it is possible to make with their numerals. The numeral 33, for example, can be pronounced sanzan, which may mean either \\"troublesome\\" or \\"birth difficulty,\\" the numeral 42 can be pronounced shi ni, meaning \\"to death,\\" and the number 19 can be pronounced j≈´ ku, meaning \\"intense suffering.\\" In 1955, the anthropologist Edward Norbeck dismissed such explanations as \\"folk etymology,\\" arguing that when yakudoshi practices first arose, literacy was not widespread enough for homonyms to have caused them, but in 1998, another scholar, David C. Lewis, suggested that such puns involve only simple Chinese characters for numbers and could indeed have been widely known even in early periods. When asked about yakudoshi, Japanese sometimes say that they mark the boundaries of significant life-stages or that they mark significant moments of change in the human body.

Armistead William Martin Armistead (May 8, 1873 - November 5, 1955) was a publicist for N. W. Ayer & Son, the oldest advertising agency in the United States. He is credited with inventing the modern style of advertising, proposing small frequent announcements, shying away from the normal practice of publishing weekly or annual announcements in newspapers. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery (lot 22) in Nashville. Early life Born on May 8, 1873 in Davidson Co., TN and died in Wayne, PA on November 5, 1955. At age 12 he became a messenger for the Banner of Nashville, and at age 17 he was promoted to office boy. He later moved to Atlanta, where he started his own advertising agency. In 1914, he married Eleanora Smith, a descendant of James Robertson (explorer). Advertising In 1909, William Armistead was approached by the firm N.W. Ayer & Son, and offered a position in the Philadelphia headquarters. In 1913, he mapped an advertising program for R. J. Reynolds. In 1918, William Armistead was elected a member of the firm [N. W. Ayer & Son]. During this time, he was in charge of the whole South, seeking companies that could benefit from advertising. Soon after he was in charge of advertising for Prince Albert Tobacco, Camel Cigarettes, the converting of Canon Mills to national advertising. He also helped launch the Ford Motor Company on it first national advertising, when the Model A Ford was introduced in 1927. William Martin Armistead was credited with running the first advertising campaign for Camel cigarettes.\\" As part of his campaign, he coined the slogan: \\"I'd walk a mile for a Camel,\\" which was the basis for the famous campaign and the launching of the Camel cigarette brand. On April 12, 1919 he described a new campaign\\"to advertise advertising\\" in which he pointed out to the readers of daily newspapers the benefit from reading carefully each advertisement, saying: \\"Very few publishers, until recently, gave serious consideration to making their publications better advertising mediums to consistently educate readers to read advertisement. Advertising advertising is a most interesting subject when one takes in consideration what advertising has accomplished for the public in an economic way. Among other things it has played its part in making this country a united nation. The same tobacco, the same cigarettes, the same pipes, same automobile tires, the same shoes, same clothing, same hats, same toilet articles and thousand of commodities are sold under same brands in every section of this country in cities, towns and at crossroads. Advertising has taken the chance out of buying. It conserves time in shopping, It at once directs the consumer to the best articles. Advertising has accomplished this and more.\\" In 1929, when N. W. Ayer & Son became a corporation, he became vice-president. Due to personal illness, he retired in 1930, selling his shares of the original trust. In 1936, he returned to the firm.  Works One of his writings, on preempting a competitor, is kept in the Reynolds archives: \\"Mr. Armistead's Memo\\" 22-24, Series 19, Box 7, File 1, AC.

William M. Armistead was a member of the Tennessee lodge. He was a 32nd degree mason. He was a former member of the Merion Cricket Club and St. David's Golf Club in Philadelphia.

It tackles the tensions of female independence in a patriarchal society. The play was first staged for a single performance in January 1924 by the at the New Theatre in London's West End. It starred Campbell Gullen as Eustace Gaydon and Jean Cadell as Lois Relph. Its first major revival was at the Shaw Festival, Canada in 2008 following the rediscovery of the manuscript. Its professional UK premiere at the Orange Tree Theatre, London, in February 2013. In March 2014 The Stepmother received its North of England premiere, being performed by York Settlement Community Players in the Studio at the York Theatre Royal. The play was produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2017.  Synopsis  The play begins as middle-aged widower Eustace Gaydon learns that his late sister Fanny has left ¬£30,000 to her impoverished, young, orphaned companion Lois rather than to him. Eustace's financial troubles had left him hoping to inherit, so he woos Lois before she learns of her inheritance. The play continues a decade later. Lois has married Eustace to become the titular stepmother to his two daughters. She owns a successful dress-making business, but Eustace controls and mismanages the family's finances. It is an unhappy marriage, and Lois sought refuge from her misery in an affair with neighbor Peter Holland. When Lois seeks a dowry for her step-daughter's prospective marriage, the truth of Eustace's financial mismanagement emerges. Eustace confronts Peter and flees England with the remains of Lois's fortune.  Initial Production  The Stepmother was first performed on Sunday, January 13, 1924, in a performance by The Play Actors, and sponsored by Lady Wyndham, the former actress Mary Moore. The Play Actors was a private club that produced single-performance productions of both new and established plays; thus the one-time performance of The Stepmother was not the sign of a flop, but an effect of the production company. The magazine Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News expressed surprise that \\"such a play should have to be presented by a play-producing society instead of by an ordinary management company whose fortune it might easily make.\\" Despite this accolade, no subsequent production occurred. Sowerby biography Patricia Riley attributes this to a male-dominated British theatre scene that felt free to ignore plays by women.  Critical reception  The Times review of the 1924 production focused almost exclusively on the role of Eustace. The review characterizes him as so \\"wicked\\" and \\"villainous\\" that the character \\"became incredible and ridiculous\\" and made a \\"sad mess of what was once an unusually promising play.\\" The villainy was over-played, and the audience \\"was beyond caring for his crimes and was laughing at him as a farcical hypocrite.\\" Reviewers of the more recent revival productions have likewise seen the overwhelming vile and venal character of Eustace as a structural weakness in the play. Writing for The Telegraph, Domenic Cavendish saw this weakness indicated by the audience's delivery of \\"the kind of boos usually reserved for Mr Punch\\" even as Cavendish also praised the actor's performance as \\"wonderfully reptilian account of masculinity\\". Reviewing the 2008 Shaw Festival revival, Christopher Hoile credits Eustace's character arc with a bit more nuance, writing, \\"If we do initially see him as a villain we end by viewing him as pitiful human being who has ruined his own life and knows he has done so without fully understanding why.\\" And J. Ellen Gainor allows that the writing of Eustace's character may walk a fine line: \\"While Sowerby ensures that we quickly see through Eustace, she also deftly arranges her narrative so that the women in the play do not.\\" Where reviewers panned Eustace's one-dimensional role, they have been more receptive to the role of Lois. The 1924 Times reviewer called her \\"a woman of variety and truth;\\" Natasha Tripney called her \\"intriguingly shaded.\\" J. Ellen Gainor wrote, \\"The role demands the convincing representation of Lois‚Äôs transformation from innocent adolescence to careworn maturity.\\" Several recent revivals after nearly a century of dormancy suggest that producers and audiences find relevance in the play despite its flaws. Gainor asserts that the success of the revivals at the Shaw Festival and the Orange Tree Theatre demonstrate \\"the continuing theatrical power and vitality\\" of the play. Laura Thompson writes that, despite the many advances in the status of women since 1924, the play \\"remains grimly pertinent.\\" Charles Hutchison said the play \\"still has much to say to a modern audience.\\"  Biographical influence  Githa Sowerby grew up in a well-to-do family. Her father John George Sowerby was the director of the Ellison's Glass Works, and her mother had an annual income of ¬£900. Under her father's leadership, the glass works undertook several new failed business ventures in the 1880s, and he eventually declared personal bankruptcy and sold the family home. When John George died, Githa's mother Amy Margaret was reduced to living in two rented rooms. Patricia Riley sees these events of Sowerby's life reflected in The Stepmother and writes that the play is \\"suffused with Githa's anger over his irresponsible handling of money.\\" Riley notes that the play was written nearly 40 years after the passage of the Married Women's Property Act which allowed women to control their own property after marriage, but that many women gave power of attorney to their husbands. Sowerby sought to discourage this practice through the play, but notes that the single night's performance meant that the play's message had little opportunity to spread.

Sohili24, 11 May 2017.) was a Zimbabwean judge. He served on the High Courts of Zimbabwe and Namibia and was the chairperson of the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission. Early life and education Mutambanengwe was born at the Old Umtali Mission in eastern Southern Rhodesia (now Mutare, Zimbabwe) on December 9, 1930 with a twin sister Abigail Gloria Mutambanengwe. He attended school at Mutambara Mission and Goromonzi School, after which he worked as a teacher for one year at Old Umtali Mission. He studied English and History at the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1959. He then studied law at the Inner Temple, in London and became an advocate in 1963. After practising law there until 1964, he returned to Rhodesia, working as advocate until 1979. During that time he also served as ZANU Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Judicial career From 1979 on he worked as a lawyer in independent Zimbabwe until 1986 when he was appointed a High Court Judge. In 1994 he was appointed to the Namibian High Court. Mutambanengwe also served on the Supreme Court of Namibia, both as acting Chief Justice of Namibia and after his retirement several times as Acting Judge of Appeal. He was appointed chairman of the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission on 31 March 2010, despite being a controversial figure in Zimbabwe. Mutambanengwe was a key figure in the Nhari rebellion in 1974, and known for his outspokenness and independent judgements on various courts. He resigned from this position in February 2013, shortly before the scheduled referendum on a new constitution for Zimbabwe. Mutambanengwe gave his declining health as reason for this move while Zimbabwean independent media speculate that he was deliberately pushed out. =Notable cases= * In the Caprivi treason trial Mutambanengwe along with Judges of Appeal Gerhard Maritz and Johan Strydom ruled in Namibia's Supreme Court (State vs. Malumo and 24 Others) that confessions from 25 accused are inadmissible before the High Court in Windhoek due to the occurrence of \\"coercive actions\\" at the hands of Police or military to obtain the testimonies.
