This gene encodes a homodimeric protein that catalyses the cleavage of alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds to release glucose-1-phosphate from liver glycogen stores. This protein switches from inactive phosphorylase B to active phosphorylase A by phosphorylation of serine residue 14. Activity of this enzyme is further regulated by multiple allosteric effectors and hormonal controls. Humans have three glycogen phosphorylase genes that encode distinct isozymes that are primarily expressed in liver, brain and muscle, respectively. The liver isozyme serves the glycemic demands of the body in general while the brain and muscle isozymes supply just those tissues. In glycogen storage disease type VI, also known as Hers disease, mutations in liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibit the conversion of glycogen to glucose and results in moderate hypoglycemia, mild ketosis, growth retardation and hepatomegaly. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]. Structure The PYGL gene encodes one of three major glycogen phosphorylase isoforms, which are distinguished by their different structures and subcellular localizations: brain (PYGB), muscle (PYGM), and liver (PYGL). PYGL spans 846 amino acids and shares fairly high homology in amino acid sequence with the other two isozymes, with 73% similarity with PYGM and 74% similarity with PYGB. Nonetheless, PYGB and PYGM demonstrate greater homology to each other, indicating that PYGL evolved by a more distant descent from the common ancestral gene. This protein forms a homodimer, with each monomer composed of N-terminal and C-terminal domains of nearly equal size. The catalytic site forms at the interface between these two domains and interacts with the required cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate, to bind the substrate glycogen. This cofactor is attached by a covalent Schiff base linkage to Lys-680 in the C-terminal domain. At the opposite side of the enzyme, the regulatory face opens up to the cytosol and contains the phosphorylation peptide, which is phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase and dephosphorylated by the phosphatase PP1, and the AMP site, which is connected to the active site by an adenine loop. Phosphorylation or binding of the allosteric sites induce conformational change that activates the enzyme. Function As a glycogen phosphorylase, PYGL catalyzes the phosphorolysis of an Œ±-1, 4-glycosidic bond in glycogen to yield glucose 1-phosphate. Degradation of glycogen The glucose 1-phosphate product then contributes to glycolysis and other biosynthetic functions for energy metabolism. As the major isozyme in liver, PYGL is responsible for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis by regulating the release of glucose 1-phosphate from liver glycogen stores. One model suggests that Ca2+ oscillations play a role in activating glycogen phosphorylase in glycogen degradation in liver cells. Through its function in the liver, PYGL is also central to meeting the glycemic demands of the entire body. Though other tissues may express all three forms in different proportions, the purpose of expressing multiple glycogen phosphorylases remains unclear. Clinical Significance PYGL has been implicated in glycogen storage disease type VI, also known as Hers disease, and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glycogen storage disease type VI has been attributed to PYGL deficiency as a result of causal mutations in PYGL gene, including two splice-site mutations and two missense mutations. The function of PYGL in regulating liver glucose production also plays a role in diabetes. Since hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is the result of excessive glucose production by the liver, developing a drug that targets PYGL may prove effective in controlling blood glucose levels. Glycogen-induced hepatomegaly in type 1 diabetes and glycogen storage disease type VI present similar clinical manifestations such as liver dysfunction, fasting hypoglycemia, and ketosis. Interactions Inhibitors PYGL has been known to interact with allosteric inhibitors, including Bayer W1807 and sugar derivatives that bind the glucose inhibitor site. In addition, glucose and purines stabilize the inactive conformation of PYGL, thus inhibiting binding to its active site.

He has written over 20 original plays and has served as Su Teatro's artistic director since 1989.  Biography   Early life  Garcia grew up in Denver, Colorado and has mentioned that his family lost their home as a result of the construction on Denver's Auraria Campus in the late 1960s.  Education  Garcia began attending the University of Colorado at Boulder in the fall of 1973 and dropped out in the spring of 1974. He later graduated from the University of Colorado at Denver with a Bachelor of Arts in Theater. Garcia has since completed several fellowships, including the Rockefeller Fellowship in Theater arts in 2006, the United States Artists Fellowship in 2006, and the Livingston Fellowship from the Bonfils Stanton Foundation in 2011.  Career  Garcia started out as a musician for Su Teatro while still a student in 1972. He later took on roles as an actor until 1989, when he became Su Teatro's Executive Artistic Director. Since writing his first play in 1986, Garcia has written plays consistently, finishing one every three to four years. Garcia spearheaded Su Teatro's fundraising campaign to raise $4.5 million for the theater's move to its new facility in the Denver's Santa Fe Arts District in 2010. Garcia has also served as a faculty member for the National Association of Latino Art and CultureLeadership Institute. He currently still does work as a peer trainer for the Colorado Creative Industries‚Äô Peer Assistance Network, is a member of the Western States Arts Federation‚Äôs Board of Trustees, and is an adjunct professor at Metro State College in Denver.

Service in World War I interrupted his college education; he was a second lieutenant in the Army Air Service. After the war, he completed his B.A., graduating from Augustana College in 1920. From there, Peel moved between teaching and post-graduate education, eventually earning a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1927. While an assistant professor of government at New York University, Peel researched and wrote extensively, publishing several articles and books. By 1934, he was the director of research in public administration at NYU and had achieved the rank of full professor. In 1935, Peel began a nearly two-year research expedition to Scandinavia, planning to survey public administration in those countries. Returning to the United States in late 1936, he took a position at Indiana University. During World War II, Peel worked for the government in a confidential civilian capacity. This tour of service included a stint as chief of the United States Information Service in Copenhagen in 1945. President Truman appointed him director of the Census Bureau in February 1950, only months before the decennial census. Peel stayed on at the Census Bureau until 1953, when he returned to the academic world. He took a position at California State University, Northridge, and taught there until his death in 1978.

They are a full-baseplate, double chain or kevlar strap drive, professional quality bass drum pedal used by many leading drummers. The Iron Cobra comes in both single and double pedal configurations with 3 different drive choices and, recently, a longboard Speed Cobra option. Tama also produces an Iron Cobra Junior pedal for the beginner/intermediate audience. The pedal's initial popularity was in its adjustability, but it has also become known for its durability over time. History Tama Drums introduced the first Iron Cobra pedal prototype in 1992. This pedal had some of the eventual features of the production Iron Cobras but, with quickly machined, blocky parts, it looked quite a bit less refined than the eventual consumer version. In 1993 the first generation Iron Cobra went on the market. The pedals looked similar to previous Tama models, having the typical silver, squared off footboard of the Tama pedals of the 1980s. The main difference with the new Cobra was the added adjustability of many of the components. The pedal was offered in a slightly less adjustable standard version and a full- featured professional version. The pedal was mostly the native silver color of the metal, with a few black painted details. In 1998 the second generation Iron Cobra was released. This version had a more refined, curved footboard, updated branding and logo, and a black powder-coated finish. The bearings were upgraded and the hoop clamp was upgraded. All of the adjustment mechanisms were refined for the second generation, as the pedal had built its name on adjustability the past 5 years. Around this time was when the standard non- professional version became known as the Iron Cobra Junior. The Junior version had only a single chain drive, as opposed to the double chain of the full professional version. In 2011 the third generation Iron Cobra came out with a new set of features. The pedal retained the black styling of the second generation, but with a few changes in features. This Cobra had a footboard surface that was smoother, the bearing housing was redesigned, the cam shapes were altered slightly, and the baseplate came with a feature called the Cobra Coil. The Cobra coil was a spring mounted beneath the footboard that was supposed to increase speed and responsiveness. Unlike the other upgrades, this Cobra Coil feature is unique to the Iron Cobra line and has come to be seen as a gimmick, rather than a true upgrade, adding very little to the playability of the pedals. In 2013 the third generation pedals were joined by two new variants, the duo-glide, which allowed the cam shape to be altered, and the Speed Cobra, a longboard version with a unique light sprocket cam, new fastball bearing type, and a different beater shape. Features Since the beginning the Iron Cobra was known for adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had the ability to adjust the footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, adjust the beater head angle, adjust the hoop clamp size, adjust the beater shaft length, adjust the feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and adjust the spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case. Artists Prominent drummers to use the pedal include: Dave Lombardo, Scott Travis, Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Gavin Harrison, Stewart Copeland, Lars Ulrich, Derrick Plourde, etc. References Human‚Äìmachine interaction Percussion instrument beaters Hardware Drumming Musical instrument parts and accessories ","title":"Tama Iron Cobra"},{"id":"48633509","text":"Jannie \\"Jan\\" Habig is a South African rally driver and six-time champion in the South African National Rally Championship.

The evergreen, Cinnamomum glaucescens (syn. Cinnamomum cecidodaphne), part of the family Lauraceae, is native to Nepal and grows wild in the districts of Dang, Rolpa and Sallyan in the Rapti Zone. This species is a diploid and can grow to an altitude of 1300 meters. Cinnamomum glaucescens is recognized as an aromatic plant, meaning it has an elevated level of essential oil. Using steam distillation, the dried berries of Cinnamomum glaucescens produce the essential oil commonly known as sugandha kokila oil, which is yellow in colour and has a camphoraceous, spicy aroma. This product can be used as a fragrance in soaps, detergents, cosmetics, perfumes and industrial fragrances. Sugandha kokila oil is also used in indigenous medicine as a demulcent and stimulant. The Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2010, identified Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) as one of Nepal‚Äôs top twenty goods and services with export potential. Wild Harvesting Citizens of Nepal have been collecting wild herbs and berries from the natural environment for centuries, where both women and men traditionally carry out the harvesting practice. Today, the harvesting of MAPs is regulated by The Department of Forests, under the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation. While wild aromatic and medicinal plants are the property of the government, any citizen is free to harvest them after applying to the department of forests and paying government royalty fees. However, Non-timber forest products, such as Cinnamomum glaucescens, are over harvested, and if the current rate of collection occurs, may disappear from Nepalese forests. Cultivation Cinnamomum glaucescens has been successfully cultivated, and promotes species conservation. A ranking scale was established, assessing mode of domestication, cultivation and social beliefs from farmer or forest users perspective, to rank the suitability of MAPs for farming. With the highest ranking being five, and lowest zero, sugandha kokila ranked four out of five. This demonstrate that Cinnamomum glaucescens is not only physiologically appropriate for cultivation but also has a high chance to be adopted by farmers, when compared with other MAPs. Furthermore, the GEF Small Grants Programme ran a successful project mobilizing two indigenous Nepalese communities, promoting the knowledge and tools to cultivate sugandha kokila. The project amended the two involved communities‚Äô local forestry operation plan to include the conservation of Cinnamomum glaucescens. The two communities involved planted Cinnamomum glaucescens 13ha of community forests, in addition to 6ha planted on private land. Increasing the market demand of sugandha kokila oil will not only benefit the farmers and producers in Nepal but also encourage the conservation of Cinnamomum glaucescens. As the market grows, the plant will increase in value, encouraging more cultivation of the plant and therefore increase conservation efforts. Also, three women-run forest nurseries established, responsible for growing 30,000 seedlings of sugandha kokila, sapindus, cinnamon, zanthoxylum, lemon and asparagus. Creating women run nurseries empowered women to learn new skills and play an important role in the cultivation of sugandha kokila and other products. Additionally, 86 households were supported in developing suitable infrastructure for the processing of sugandha kokila. This project is an example of how the cultivation of sugandha kokila using a community approach can empower women and conserve this endemic plant. Production The majority of MAPs grown in Nepal, are exported to India to be processed. However, as Cinnamomum glaucescens is considered an at-risk species due to over-harvesting for monetary gains, this species can only be exported after processing occurs within Nepal. Therefore, sugandha kokila is processed within the country, using distillation units operated by local people. MAPs have been processed in Nepal since 1981 with the government establishment of Herbs Production and Processing Co. Ltd., which today supports 600 families that are involved in the cultivation and processing of MAPs. Currently, there are an estimated 112 distillation units operating across Nepal, the majority of which are located in the Terai regions. Distilling the product in Nepal will result in a unique product and provide steady revenue for the rural, low-income population. Distillation Process Sugandha kokila oil is a product of steam distillation from the dried berries of Cinnamomum glaucescens. Steam distillation reduces wasted material and lowers productions costs. This process enables the sugandha kokila oil to be distilled at a temperature significantly lower than its boiling point. The steam breaks through the plant material and releases the essential oils, along with the steam, after which they rise upward into a connecting pipe leading them to the condenser. In the condenser the steam and essential oils are cooled and liquefied. Due to differences in density, the essential oil will float on the surface of the water and be siphoned off. The essential oil is then filtered to remove any impurities. Finally, the quality of the oil needs to be verified and is stored in container made of glass, stainless steel, aluminum, epoxy coated drums or food grade high-density polyethylene containers. Products Similar to most essential oils, sugandha kokila oil, is a diverse product due to the array of uses for manufactures. Companies that sell essential oils, describe sugandha kokila oil as ‚ÄúA gift to perfumers from the Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal‚Äù. Sugandha kokila oil‚Äôs uniquely spicy scent is ideal for beauty products and toiletries, including soaps, detergents, cosmetics, massage oils, lotions, hair treatments and perfumes.

Personal life  Johnson was born in Fauquier County, Virginia to Harriet and Thomas Johnson, who were held in slavery and worked on a plantation. Once his parents were freed, they migrated to Alexandria, Virginia. Following the war, Alexandria's black population grew and a number of institutions were created. One that stood out in particular to Johnson and his parents was the Alfred Street Baptist Church. Johnson completed four years of college and graduated from Washington, D. C.'s Wayland Seminary in 1868, with honors. He married writer Amelia E. Hall on April 17, 1877. She was an Afro-Canadian born in Montreal in 1868. Amelia met Reverend Harvey Johnson in Baltimore after her family had relocated to Baltimore in 1874. The two married a few years later. Amelia bore three children by Harvey, two sons, Harvey Jr. and Prentiss, and a daughter, Jessie E. They remained married until her death in the spring of 1922.  Religious background  Growing up, Johnson was always highly involved in the church, so he focused on becoming a minister. Following college he began going around teaching the ministry. His time came in 1872 when Reverend William P. Thompson died at the age of thirty-two, and Johnson became the head of Baltimore Union Church. Since he became the pastor the church has gone from 250 members to 2200+ members. He served for the rest of his life (fifty years) until his death in January 1923. For Baltimore this marked the end of a leadership era.  Professional career  He embarked on a career filed with spiritual and civil rights expansion, also serving the black community. He set his sights on gaining equality for all black ministers by raising their pay and growing the number of black people in Baptist churches. He accomplished this by creating many unions between other churches. To combat discrimination Johnson focused on economic independence and institutional autonomy. He did this by urging black congregations to break from the hold of white finances and break away from the Union Association.  Civil rights involvement  Johnson owned and led a Union Baptist house. In the 1880s, he became one of the most important African American civil rights protectors. This was in the time where a wave of \\"redemption\\" came toward the South and the civil rights protections became lost. Some black people went to court, believing they had rights that shouldn‚Äôt be taken away. Johnson collected five Baptist colleagues in 1885. Among them was J.C. Allen of the First Baptist Church. Rev. Johnson called the meeting to put an end to the problem of not being treated fairly. He discussed the Reconstruction Era which resulted in the development of a civil rights organization called the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty of the United States (MUBL). This organization, run by Johnson, pledged \\"to use all legal means within our power to procure and maintain our rights as citizens of this our common country.\\" Two offices were established in 1885 of the MUBL, and a three-day conference was held on the black civil rights discussion. Frederick Douglass even attended the conference. Not only did Johnson found the MUBL, but also the Colored Baptist Convention of Maryland (1898). He came up with a plan to make progress in the racial issues in Baltimore known as the \\"Texas Purchase Movement\\". This movement called for separation of each races of the U.S. and blacks moving to Texas (the independent state).  Contributions to the legal community  Johnson paved the way in the legal community by being a civil rights activist and helping a few law firms defend blacks who had had their rights taken away. The few law firms included the MUBL, established in the 1870s, that took on many cases of inequality. Johnson and the MUBL law firm took on cases that included the absence of black jury members, deterioration of black teachers from public city schools, and the dehumanizing codes effecting black women. The legal team helped over a hundred African Americans gain back their rights and equality. Johnson's efforts shaped the legal strategy of the lawyers in the MUBL, the NAACP, and Thurgood Marshall. The first public high school for coloured people built in America was called the Frederick Douglass Senior High School, located in West Baltimore. References  External links  * Rev.

The design process and construction Design for Manufacture Competition John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister announced the competition to construct a home for around ¬£60,000 on 26 September 2004. 53 firms/consortiums submitted pre-qualifying questionnaire by the deadline of 13 May 2005. On 1 June 2005, John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that 33 firms had been invited to take part in the Design for Manufacture Competition to design and construct homes for around ¬£60,000 on 10 sites in England. They would be invited to submit firm proposals by July 2005 to submit their proposals. The Design for Manufacture Competition was run by English Partnerships on behalf of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (now known as the Department for Communities and Local Government. The 10 sites chosen for the competition were in Leeds, Aylesbury Vale, Upton (Northampton), Newport Pagnell, Basingstoke, Maidstone, Hastings, Stone and Merton as well as Oxley Park, Milton Keynes. In November 2005, the successful bidders for the first four sites were announced, which included Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners as architects and George Wimpey as the builders, to build on Oxley Park. Construction It was planned that a total of 145 houses would be built on the site. In total there would be 11 house styles, from 2 bedroom maisonettes to five bedroom family houses. It would be a mix of affordable housing and larger private dwellings. The houses would take advantage of a range of new technologies and processes involving prefabrication and off-site assembly. This would reduce the construction time, but also reduce waste and energy in the transportation of materials to site. Each house would have a timber frame. The cladding panel would mean that waste was reduced to just 15% during manufacturing. The structure would take just one week to manufacture in the factory before travelling to site. The external element of the building would take just two days to form the shell, without the need for any scaffolding. The interior of the building would take just two weeks to complete.

Due to their property to lower cholesterol and potentially reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, oat Œ≤-glucans have been assigned a qualified health claim by the European Food Safety Authority and the US Food and Drug Administration. Oat flakes used for making common oatmeal products A bowl of oatmeal, a common food source of beta-glucans  History  Oat products have been used for centuries for medicinal and cosmetic purposes; however, the specific role of Œ≤-glucan was not explored until the 20th century. Œ≤-glucans were first discovered in lichens, and shortly thereafter in barley. After joining Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in 1969, Peter J Wood played an instrumental role in isolating and characterizing the structure and bioactive properties of oat Œ≤-glucan. A public interest in oat Œ≤-glucan arose after its cholesterol lowering effect was reported in 1984. In 1997, after reviewing 33 clinical studies performed over the previous decades, the FDA approved the claim that intaking at least 3 g of Œ≤-glucan from oats per day decreased saturated fats and reduced the risk of heart disease. This marked the first time a public health agency claimed dietary intervention can actually help prevent disease. This health claim mobilized a dietary movement as physicians and dietitians for the first time could recommend intake of a specific food to directly combat disease. Since then, oat consumption has continued to gain traction in disease prevention with noted effects on ischemic heart disease and stroke prevention, but also in other areas like BMI reduction, blood pressure lowering and highly corroborated evidence for reduced blood serum cholesterol.  Structural properties  Cereal Œ≤-glucans - including Œ≤-glucan from oat, barley and wheat - are linear polysaccharides joined by 1,3 and 1,4 carbon linkages. The majority of cereal Œ≤-glucan bonds consist of 3 or 4 beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds (trimers and tetramers) interconnected by 1,3 linkages. In Œ≤-glucan, these trimers and tetramers are known as cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl. Oats and barley differ in the ratio of cellotriosyl to cellotetraosyl, and barley has more 1-4 linkages with a degree of polymerization higher than 4. In oats, Œ≤-glucan is found mainly in the endosperm of the oat kernel, especially in the outer layers of that endosperm (a marked difference from barley, which contains Œ≤-glucan uniformly throughout the endosperm). Most oats contain 3-6% Œ≤-glucan by weight. Oats can be selectively bred based on favourable Œ≤-glucan levels. Often millers only process oat cultivars with at least 4% by weight Œ≤-glucan. Oat Œ≤-glucans are linear and linked at the 1,3 and 1,4 carbon sites. Oat Œ≤-glucans can form into a random coil structure and flow with Newtonian behaviour until they reach a critical concentration at which point they become pseudoplastic. The gelling ability of oat Œ≤-glucan correlates to the percentage of trimers.  Extraction  Œ≤-glucan extraction from oat can be difficult due to tendency of depolymerization ‚Äì which often occurs in high pH. Thus Œ≤-glucan extraction is usually performed under a more neutral pH and generally at temperatures of 60-100 degrees Celsius. Usually Œ≤-glucan is solubilized in the extraction process with residual starch, which is then removed by hydrolysis with alpha-amylase. The residual solution usually contains coextracts of hemicelluloses and proteins which can then be separated through selective precipitation. Through wet milling, sieving, and solvent- extraction, oat beta-glucans can achieve up to 95% extraction purity.  Viscosity of oat Œ≤-glucan  In oats, Œ≤-glucan makes up the majority of the soluble fibre; however, oat Œ≤-glucans do become insoluble above a certain concentration. The total viscosity is determined by the level of solubility, the molecular weight, and the trimer-to-tetramer ratio. The lower the trimer- tetramer ratio, the higher the Œ≤-glucan viscosity in solution. A more viscous internal Œ≤-glucan solution generally leads to beneficial physiological effects ‚Äì including a more pronounced hypoglycemic effect and lowered cholesterol levels, and a decrease in postprandial blood glucose levels.  Physiological effects  As fermentable fiber In the diet, Œ≤-glucans are a source of soluble, fermentable fiber - also called prebiotic fiber - which provides a substrate for microbiota within the large intestine, increasing fecal bulk and producing short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities. This fermentation impacts the expression of many genes within the large intestine, which further affects digestive function and cholesterol and glucose metabolism, as well as the immune system and other systemic functions.  Cholesterol  In 1997, the FDA recognized the cholesterol lowering effect of oat Œ≤-glucan. In Europe, several health claim requests were submitted to the EFSA NDA Panel (Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies), related to the role of Œ≤-glucans in maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations and maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight. In July 2009, the Scientific Committee issued the following statements: * On the basis of the data available, the Panel concludes that a cause-and-effect relationship has been established between the consumption of beta-glucans and the \\"reduction of blood cholesterol concentrations.\\" * The following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \\"Regular consumption of beta-glucans contributes to maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations.\\" In order to bear the claim, foods should provide at least 3 g/d of beta-glucans from oats, oat bran, barley, barley bran, or mixtures of non-processed or minimally processed beta-glucans in one or more servings. The target population is adults with normal or mildly elevated blood cholesterol concentrations. In November 2011, the EU Commission published its decision in favour of oat beta-glucans with regard to Article 14 of the EC Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs with nutrition and health claim statements permitting oat beta-glucan to be described as beneficial to health. Following the opinion of the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) the EFSA and the Regulation (EU) no. 1160/2011 of the Commission, foodstuffs through which 3 g/day of oat beta-glucan are consumed (1 g of oat beta-glucan per portion) are allowed to display the following health claim: \\"Oat beta- glucan reduces the cholesterol level in the blood. The lowering of the blood cholesterol level can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\\" Œ≤-glucan lowers cholesterol by increasing the viscosity of digesta in the small intestine, although cholesterol reduction is greater in those with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in their blood. The degree of cholesterol reduction depends upon the particular strain of Œ≤-glucan in a range between a molecular weights of 26.8 and 3000 kD. Although more viscous Œ≤-glucans result in a more viscous solution of intestinal digesta, and thus more cholesterol uptake, after a certain molecular weight, Œ≤-glucans become less soluble and thus contribute less to solution viscosity. The intake of Œ≤-glucan in liquid form generally results in greater solubilization and oat Œ≤-glucan is more effective at lowering cholesterol in juices than in hard foods like bread and cookies. Despite the recognized impact of viscosity on serum cholesterol levels, no current data exists comparing internal solution viscosity and serum cholesterol. Intake of oat Œ≤-glucan at daily amounts of at least 3 grams lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5 to 10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels.  Digestion  Throughout digestion, Œ≤-glucan alters the physical properties of digesta while chemicals in the digestive tract break down Œ≤-glucan, changing its composition. Fermentation of Œ≤-glucans by microbiote results in the production of short chain fatty acids and changes to gut microbes as well as the depolymerization and structural change of the original Œ≤-glucan. In the stomach, Œ≤-glucans swell and cause gastric distension ‚Äì which is associated with the signal pathway of satiation ‚Äì the feeling of fullness, leading to a decreased appetite. Studies demonstrating Œ≤-glucan's effect on delayed gastric emptying may differ due to variants in food combination, Œ≤-glucan dosage, and molecular weight, and variety of food source. In the small intestine, Œ≤-glucan may reduce starch digestibility and glucose uptake ‚Äì significant in the reduction of postprandial glucose levels. Oat Œ≤-glucans have a prebiotic effect where they selectively stimulate growth of specific strands of microbes in the colon, where the particular microbe stimulated depends on the degree of polymerization of the Œ≤-glucan. Specifically, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus are stimulated by all oat Œ≤-glucan while Bifidobacterium bacteria also stimulated by oat Œ≤-glucan oligosaccharides. Soluble Œ≤-glucan increases stool weight through the increase in microbial cells in the colon.  Blood glucose  Postprandial blood glucose levels become lower after consumption of a meal containing Œ≤-glucan as a result of increased gut viscosity, which delays gastric emptying and lengthens travel through the small intestine. In one review, the net decrease in blood glucose absorption reduced postprandial blood insulin concentrations, improving insulin sensitivity. A meta-analysis of clinical trials concluded that regular dietary intake of oat beta-glucans reduced blood glucose levels in people with diabetes, but did not affect insulin levels. Diabetic people who increased their daily consumption of beta- glucans by more than 3 grams per day for months also lost body weight.  Cosmetics  Œ≤-glucan is used in a variety of creams, ointments and powders with potential to affect collagen production and skin disorders.  Wound healing and immunomodulation  In preliminary research, oat Œ≤-glucan is being studied for its potential immunomodulatory effects, antitumour properties, and stimulation of collagen deposition, tissue granulation, reepithelization, and macrophage infiltration in the wound healing process.

Finley, a native Californian, has been an employee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) since January 1958, making her the longest-serving woman in NASA. Two days before Explorer 1 was launched, Finley began her career with the laboratory as a human computer, calculating rocket launch trajectories by hand. She now serves as a subsystem engineer for NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). At JPL, she has participated in the exploration of the Moon, the Sun, all the planets, and other bodies in the Solar System.  Life and education   Education  In 1955, Susan Finley began studying art and architecture at Scripps College, in Claremont, California, with the intention of becoming an architect. Her knowledge of engineering was vast because of her talents in mathematical and computing courses, so she attempted to learn art, but later realized that engineering was in her future.Finley, Susan (05 October 2015). Email with Rachel Lantz.Finley, Susan (28 October 2015). Email with Rachel Lantz. After three years at Scripps College, Finley claimed she \\"couldn't learn art.\\" During her college experience, she majored in the humanities which allowed her to be successful as a subsystem engineer. A subsystem refers to a smaller system within a larger one, thus her position requires her to focus on more specific aspects of the technologies she works with at JPL. At the age of 21, she left Scripps College to become an engineer with a thermodynamics group at Convair in Pomona, California.  Family life  At the beginning of her career, Finley made sacrifices in her career for her family. Susan Finley married Pete Finley and had two sons together. She left JPL twice in the first few years of employment in order to support her husband's education and also took maternity leave for some time for her two sons, returning permanently to JPL in 1969. Susan Finley divorced her husband Pete in the 1970s. According to Susan Finley, balancing her work and family lives was difficult because of the \\"lack of good child care options,\\" although she believes that women still face these struggles today. One of her goals was to keep her work and home life separate, aiming to never bring her work home with her or \\"working late without making up that time at home.\\" She cooked all the meals for her family, but did not spend much time on housework. Her husband, on the other hand, worked on the cars and the yard as he was of the \\"generation that did not help with the house or children\\". She has 4 grandkids; Katherine and Matthew, Noah Finley and Zoe Finley. SGF  Career  Finley dropped out of Scripps College, after three years of studying, and applied for a filing clerk position at Convair in Pomona, California. Convair was an aircraft and rocket manufacturing company that no longer exists. Finley took a required typing test to compare her abilities with other candidates. After completing the test, Convair informed Finley that the job had been filled. Instead, the company asked Finley her thoughts on working with numbers. Finley explained how her passion for numbers was greater than that of letters. She began her work as hand-calculating rocket launch trajectories as a human computer. In 1957, after her marriage, Finley moved to San Gabriel, California. She expressed her concerns to her husband about the commute to and from work each day. Finley worked for a year with Convair until she pursued a new opportunity of which her husband suggested. In 1958, Susan Finley took a position at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, as a computer. NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, had officially formed in July of 1958. This was a response to the National Aeronautics and Space Act. This act was put into action shortly after the Soviet Union launched their satellite, Sputnik. Prior to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, all space exploration was deemed by the country, the military's responsibility. Shortly thereafter, NASA assumed control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). In the 1950s, computers were mostly women who solved complex problems by hand. Many women did not have degrees. Rather, like Finley, they were good with numbers. Being a computer required Finley to perform \\"trajectory computations for rocket launches by hand\\". Two days after Finley was hired, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory launched the United States' first-ever satellite: Explorer 1. Finley's most-remembered contribution to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) came in 1958. JPL launched Pioneer 3 on December 6, 1958. Its mission was to orbit around the Moon and enter a solar orbit, but Pioneer 3 failed its mission. A digital computer failed to correctly calculate the probe's velocity data. Following the failure, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory asked Finley to calculate the velocity data of Pioneer 3, and she was successful in providing the sought after information. On January 26, 1962, NASA launched Ranger 3. Ranger 3 was of great importance as it was NASA's first attempt to hardland a spacecraft of the surface of the Moon. Much to their disappointment, Ranger 3 missed the moon by 22,000 miles, due to multiple malfunctions within the spacecraft's guidance system. It was a calculation Finley made that demonstrated to NASA that Ranger 3 had missed the Moon by such a large margin. Susan Finley took a leave of absence from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to allow her husband to begin his graduate degree at the University of California, Riverside. Between jobs, Susan Finley took a short course in FORTRAN in Riverside. FORTRAN, is the primary computer programming language developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific applications. Male engineers largely didn't want to do the programming themselves in the 1960s. The advent of electronic computers slowly changed what the all-female computations group did. It was still considered \\"women's work,\\" not part of an engineer's job description. Finley returned to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1962 once her husband finished his master's degree. A year later, Finley left the Jet Propulsion Laboratory again to take care of her two sons. In 1969, Finley returned to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and would not leave again. This marked Susan Finley's transition from a human computer to a human programmer. Throughout her career, Finley provided both manual computation work and FORTRAN programs as part of JPL's missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, in the Ranger, Mariner, Pioneer, Viking, and Voyager programs. By the 1970s, teams of female programmers were integrated with male engineers of the same mission. Prior to the 1970s, they were kept apart. Susan Finley went on record as saying \\"the men always, from the very beginning, treated us as equals. We were doing something they couldn't do, and that they needed to go forward with what they were doing.\\" Later, in the 1980s, Finley switched to software testing and subsystem engineering for the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). A systems engineer in the context of NASA \\"encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems\\". The DSN is used to track and communicate with every deep space probe sponsored by NASA as well as non-US space missions. They would communicate by sending commands to the probe, transmit software updates, as well as gather data. The research group tracked the Russian spacecraft Vega which carried a French balloon to Venus on its journey to Halley's comet. Although working with the Russians was difficult during this Cold War time period, her team was able to collaborate well with the French and they successfully delivered tracking data for the French balloon to route toward the comet. Finley's contribution was a program that automated the movements and translations of the platform's antenna. More specifically, the antenna had to be aligned with the spacecraft. Otherwise, no data would be received. Finley considers this project the most memorable of her many years at NASA. In the 1990s and 2000s, Finley contributed to JPL's further explorations of the solar system. Finley worked with the Mars Exploration Rover missions and developed technology in which musical tones were sent at differing phases of descent through the Martian atmosphere and were transmitted back to DSN. The program had the rover send musical tones back to the command center once each stage of the craft's descent. The engineers were then able to use this information to determine which landing stage the rocket was in at a given time. This process was utilized in 1997 for the Pathfinder. However, the program was left out of the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander Mars missions. Both the Climate Orbiter and the Polar Lander were lost in 1999. NASA attempted to find the causes for each of the failures. Fortunately for NASA, Finley's tones assisted in finding the issues with each of the two failed missions. The engineers used Finley's tones to update the whereabouts of the platforms in their last minutes. Finley was stationed at the Goldstone and Tidninbilla stations while the landings were taking place and was the first to hear the tones that confirmed the landers survived their trip to Mars. Unfortunately, her work went unrecognized in the media because they reported from JPL's mission control only. In 2004, Finley's tones returned to the Marian landing process of different components. Susan Finley explained that all of the Mars missions that carried the tones were a success. It was not until the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) mission failed where mission designers recognized the value of the tones Finley was responsible for. In 2008, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reviewed their job listings and each of their employees pay. Finley was demoted from a salaried engineer to being paid by the hour. Finley was now an hourly engineering specialist. This was due to her lack of a Bachelor's Degree. Although Finley's overall pay did not change, she remained eligible for overtime. The only downside being she now had to clock in and clock out. She continues to work full-time for JPL and is involved in DSN support for NASA's recent unmanned missions, including the recent Pluto flyby by the New Horizons spacecraft and the Juno mission to Jupiter. Susan Finley currently has no plans to retire.  Awards and honors  * 2013 - NASA Group Achievement Award, NASA (nine certificates awarded to Susan Finley) *2018 - NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal Over the course of her career, Finley has won several NASA Group Achievement Awards. This certificate is \\"awarded to any combination of government and/or non-government individuals for an outstanding group accomplishment that has contributed substantially to NASA's mission\\". In 2018, Finley was awarded a NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal \\"This prestigious NASA medal is awarded to any non-Government individual or to an individual who was not a Government employee during the period in which the service was performed for sustained performance that embodies multiple contributions on NASA projects, programs, or initiatives.\\" Her years of dedication and service to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have made her the longest-serving woman in the space agency.

The book is a semi-fictionalized account of the 1980 Grand Island tornado outbreak, which produced seven tornadoes (including three that rotated anti- cyclonically) in and around Grand Island, Nebraska, on the evening of June 3, 1980, killing five people and injuring 134. It is told from the point of view of its 12-year-old protagonist Danny Hatch, who ‚Äì after his home and neighborhood are destroyed by one of the tornadoes ‚Äì begins a search for his parents as the event takes place. The book won six literary awards including the Golden Sower Award, the Iowa Children's Choice Award and the Sequoyah Children's Book Award and as well as an Outstanding Science Trade Books for Children recommendation by the National Science Teachers Association and Children's Book Council. A loosely adapted made-for-cable television film of the same name was released on February 14, 1996, airing on The Family Channel (now Freeform). Plot At 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of June 3, 1980, three hours before the tornadic thunderstorm hits Hall County, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington ‚Äì an inquisitive California native with six sisters ‚Äì take a bike trip to the Mormon Island State Recreation Area to go on their first swim of the summer, where they discuss the art class taught by Danny's aunt, Goldie, where Arthur created a bull roarer as part of a Native American crafts project (and accidentally broke a light bulb in the basement with); while at Mormon Island, they run into Arthur's 14-year-old older sister Stacey ‚Äì whom Danny is infatuated with ‚Äì and 10-year-old younger sister Ronnie Vae, whom Arthur declines to give a ride home before the storm hits. On their way home, Danny and Arthur are foreshadowed with the oncoming storm, when they endure strong winds as they cut through the Fonner Park parking lot and Sand Crane Drive. An hour later, Danny asks his mother Linda ‚Äì who quit her job as a hairdresser to take care of her infant son Ryan after he was born ‚Äì to see if Arthur can stay for dinner, while his father John plans to head out to his parents' farm in Phillips after dinner to fix his father's broken tractor. After dinner, Goldie arrives to borrow Linda's bowling ball to attend a bowling league night at Meves Bowl, as the boys are about to take a bike ride through their neighborhood, where they run into their 81-year-old neighbor, Belle Smiley, whose hair Linda is supposed to style before a church bazaar that Friday ‚Äì and visit the Darlington's house. When they return to the Hatch house, as Linda sews a birthday dress for Grandma Hatch, Arthur sits down to watch television, and as Danny looks for snacks, the show they turned to on KGIN (referred to in the book by its real-life brand name, \\"10/11,\\" in reference to Lincoln parent station KOLN and its Grand Island-based satellite) is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin about a tornado and funnel cloud sightings north of Grand Island, in St. Paul and Dannebrog. Several minutes after Linda leaves to check on Mrs. Smiley after being unable to contact her by phone, and placing Danny and Arthur in charge of looking after Ryan, tornado sirens blare as a worried Danny tries to phone his grandmother to warn his grandparents and John of the oncoming tornado, only for the siren to abruptly cut off after Danny hangs up when the phone line cuts out. Seconds after the sirens sound again, a worried Arthur rushes to tell Danny of a tornado alert that was just broadcast over the radio. Right then, a violent tornado hits their neighborhood, sending Danny and Arthur scrambling to get Ryan and take cover in the basement. As the twister starts to obliterate the Hatches' home, they ride out the storm in the shower of the basement's bathroom; they remain there for several more minutes after the tornado passes, as rain and hail hit them from above the gaping hole where the first floor of the house once stood, and as water from one of the severed underground pipes seeps in underneath them. After Danny and Arthur ‚Äì who become fearful whether or not their families survived ‚Äì escape from the basement of the leveled house (with Ryan in tow) through the collapsing floor beams with the help of Stacey (who arrived after the storm passed, searching for Arthur), and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatch family home, Stacey informs Arthur that the rest of their family is alive, although Ronnie Vae was sucked out of the Darlingtons' now-demolished home (as she, Stacey and Mrs. Darlington were unable to fit under the master bed with the other four female Darlington children, leaving the three having to resort to lying flat on the floor) and briefly knocked unconscious after landing into the bushes of their neighbors, the Winegars. After Dan spots the wreckage of Goldie's home and Linda's car in the next yard over, Stacey and Arthur spot Linda running toward them, later recalling how she and Mrs. Smiley took shelter as the tornado came at them. As rescuers search for residents unaccounted for, Danny, Arthur and Stacey volunteer to search for Mrs. Smiley, who is trapped in her roofless house, to the reluctant allowance of Linda, who takes Ryan and boards a bus to a local shelter. The three go to rescue Belle from the basement, using her kitchen table to navigate to her amid the partially collapsed back stairs, after Dan and Arthur find her asleep on a sofa, which they use as a makeshift ladder to get her and themselves out the window with Stacey helping them from outside. While seeking information about his dad, Danny exhibits more worry when a firefighter informs him that tornadoes were reported near Phillips, where John and Danny's grandparents are. As Dan, Stacey and Arthur are transported by police car with other evacuees to the Kmart on South Locust Street (one of the few buildings that escaped damage from another tornado that had hit the business district minutes after the one that destroyed the Hatches' and Darlingtons' neighborhood struck), Danny struggles to find out what happened to the Hatch farm in Phillips, when he hears a message on the two-way radio that Meves Bowl was struck. Shortly after, the police car experiences a close call, when another tornado touches down near the car's location and cuts through their path; Officer Kelly ‚Äì who begins to lose his vision after the car's windows shatter from the twister's violent outer winds, spraying his eyes with flying glass ‚Äì then asks Dan to help him steer the car to the Grand Island Police Department headquarters, eventually letting Danny take over driving. Later that night at the police station, Dan, Arthur and Stacey are moved to the women's room of the jail that is serving as an emergency shelter for some of the tornado victims, where at one point, they listen to stories from the other families who lost their homes in the first tornado; Arthur later ponders why Grand Island had to be hit, even wondering if playing with the bull roarer caused the tornadoes due to a Hopi legend that its roar brings about whirlwinds, leading Dan to wonder himself if the tornado was his punishment for his jealousy and resentment of Ryan. Struggling to sleep, Stacey helps Danny take his mind off his worry by quoting scripture, when the generator at the station suddenly goes out partway through the verse, knocking out power to the entire building. The next morning, Danny, Arthur and Stacey discuss walking to the Kmart and the local armory, when the jail matron, Mrs. Minetti, asks the policewoman on duty to take the kids there on her way to her house in Doniphan, when the group experiences the grayness and mugginess of the weather. At the armory, Stacey and Arthur reunite with their relieved father, working in his office, who had been out searching for his two oldest children the previous night. Just before Minetti escorts Danny to the Kmart where Linda and Ryan are, Mr. Darlington informs Danny that he doesn't know the whereabouts of John or Goldie. With all streets barricaded either by bulldozers and various emergency vehicles or downed lines and water on the roadway, Mrs. Minetti offers to either take Danny to her house in Doniphan or back to the armory; Danny asks to walk the way to the Kmart on his own, and dodges all obstacles along the way once he departs. When he arrives, he finds out the store's parking lot has been turned into an emergency command post and all civilians taken to the store were evacuated during the night due to high water, being transported to other shelters. Just as Dan makes a run for it back to his destroyed house to see if either of his parents went there, John ‚Äì with Linda and Ryan in the passenger's seat ‚Äì drives up behind in his pickup truck as Danny crosses Fonner Park, where the family is reunited. Danny finds out that the tornado that hit Phillips had missed the farm (although the crops in the farmland were flooded by the heavy rain accompanying the storm), and that John spent much of the overnight searching around Grand Island for the rest of the family after returning to town and the remnants of their home on Sand Crane Drive around 1:15 a.m., eventually finding Linda and Ryan at a Presbyterian church ‚Äì where they and Mrs. Smiley were sleeping on a rug in the minister's study ‚Äì three hours and 15 minutes later but unable to find Danny when at the police station. The Hatches later arrive at their home, staring at the tattered remains from inside the truck. In the epilogue, Danny explains what happened in the year since the storm. The family temporarily stayed on the Hatch farm, along with Arthur, whose family members stayed elsewhere, with Stacey living with her friend Evelyn, while Ronnie Vae (who did not talk or speak for three days after being tossed into the bushes by the tornado) stayed with cousins in California, before the Hatches and Darlingtons moved into government-provided trailers that August. Goldie ‚Äì who, after being rescued from the destroyed Meves Bowl, wound up being taken to Omaha by a truck driver, where she stayed in a hotel, before reuniting with the Hatches on the farm the following Friday by transport from a Red Cross volunteer ‚Äì opted to move into an apartment closer to the center of Grand Island. People in and outside of town help bring food and supplies to Grand Island, including Mrs. Smiley, who ‚Äì with the help of some Mennonites ‚Äì served canned food to others in town. By June 3, 1981, when the Hatches throw a party commemorating the first anniversary of the tornado in their newly rebuilt home, the family has adopted a new cat, Minerva II, to replace the one who disappeared (and presumably, died) during the tornado and Arthur's mother has given birth to a seventh child, a girl named Tempest June. Mrs. Smiley, meanwhile, died three months before the anniversary, while waiting for a doctor's appointment. Background Ivy Ruckman ‚Äì a native of Hastings, Nebraska ( south of Grand Island) ‚Äì based the book on the experiences of her first cousin, Florence Rozendal, following the Grand Island tornado outbreak, the common nickname from which serves as the book's title. The home on Bismark Road in Grand Island that was inhabited by Rozendal, her husband, Harley, and their three children ‚Äì sons Mark and Ryan, and daughter Cindy ‚Äì was destroyed by an F4 tornado that caused severe damage throughout the southern portion of the city during the early evening of June 3. (The Rozendahls later rebuilt a new home in the same location where the original once stood.) Ruckman learned of the tornado's impact on Grand Island during a radio news report that ran hours after the storm, and subsequently made multiple failed attempts to contact her cousin by phone, eventually discovering that Florence and her family had survived several days later, when ‚Äì while visiting her cousin's mother in Hastings ‚Äì a police officer notified them that she had made it through the storm; Ruckman talked to Rozendahl ten days after the tornado struck. In October 1981, Ruckman attempted to get Rozendahl to write an account of her experiences during the tornado for a piece in Reader's Digest, which paid $1,000 for first-person reports of major events. After Rozendahl's account was rejected by the magazine, Ruckman chose to adapt the story into a book, noting that no children's books about tornadoes had existed at the time. When Ruckman began to research the events of the outbreak in May 1982, when preparing to write the book (at which time, most areas of the city that were destroyed by the tornadoes were already rebuilt), the Rozendal family recalled to her stories of how they survived the tornado and other personal accounts in its aftermath. The book incorporates events occurring to the Rozendahls in the book; among them, Florence ‚Äì like Linda Hatch ‚Äì had been sewing a dress at her kitchen table, as her children repeatedly asked if they were going to shelter in the basement as the weather worsened; as experienced by Danny and Arthur before the tornado hit the Hatch home, the Rozendahls heard sucking noises emanating from their sink and pipe drains, and sought cover from the tornado in their basement shower (where Danny, Arthur and Ryan sheltered within the Hatch family's home in the book). Florence's son Ryan, an infant at the time of the storm, also served as the namesake for the infant son of John and Linda in the book, while Kelly Buck, a deputy with the Hall County Sheriff's Department who had spotted the first of the seven tornadoes in northwest Grand Island and who died from an inoperable brain tumor two months before Ruckman sought to interview him, inspired the character of Officer Kelly. As the book was based on the real-life events of the storm, Ruckman also incorporated references to cities and landmarks within Hall County and central Nebraska into the book (including points of interest within Grand Island such as Dodge Elementary School, Mormon Island State Park and the Fonner Park horse racetrack, as well as the nearby towns of Dannebrog, Phillips and St. Paul) as well as an Associated Press report on the storm that is included as the book's foreword; however, the neighborhood depicted as the one where Danny lived was partially fictionalized, although incorporating two real-life streets in the city, Sand Crane Drive and Fonda Way. Ruckman stated in a 1990 interview with the Grand Island Independent that writing Night of the Twisters gave her more of a respect at the power of severe weather, acknowledging, \\"I'm a lot more afraid of tornadoes than I used to be.\\" Film adaptation Night of the Twisters is a 1996 American disaster film that was based on the book and directed by Timothy Bond. The film premiered on February 14, 1996 on The Family Channel (now Freeform). The movie version is a loose adaptation of Ruckman's novel, set in the fictional Nebraska town of Blainsworth, in which a teenaged aspiring artist Danny (Devon Sawa) deals with his father (John Schneider) ‚Äì who is renamed Jack and established as his stepfather, whereas Danny's biological father died in a plane crash years prior ‚Äì constantly pushing him into being an athlete. As the film is structured as a coming-of- age story, most of the adaptation both follows portions of as well as differs from the book (among the differences, Danny's mother ‚Äì who is renamed Laura (Lori Hallier) ‚Äì works as a diner waitress, instead of as a hair dresser- turned-homemaker; the inclusion of characters such as storm chaser Bob Iverson (David Ferry) and a more prominent role of Danny's grandmother; as well as the absence of four of Arthur's younger siblings and the Hatch family cat, Minerva), with more of a focus on Danny's heroic efforts to try and reunite with his family. The movie also stars Amos Crawley as Arthur Darlington, Laura Bertram as Stacey Darlington and Alex and Thomas Lastewka as Ryan Hatch.

Targets include transport trucks, operated by middlemen, which previously were not usually targeted. Importance of oil and goals Oil is the largest source of funding for ISIL, representing about half of the group's income. As of November 2015, ISIL controlled nearly all of Syria's oil production, as well as one oil field in Iraq. While oil production and refining facilities have been bombed before, ISIL have been able to quickly repair the damage. The U.S. raid in May 2015 that killed Abu Sayyaf, the \\"emir\\" of ISIL's oil production, also obtained extensive documents about the workings of ISIL's oil production and operation. This led to efforts focused on inflicting damage that requires hard-to-get parts or is difficult to repair quickly. The Pentagon released video showing the use of A-10 and AC-130s in one attack against oil trucks. The New York Times reported that an email from U.S. military spokesperson Colonel Steven H. Warren said, \\"We intend to shut it all down.\\" A goal is the reduction by 2/3rds of ISIL oil revenue. By late December 2015, Col. Steve Warren announced that airstrikes conducted by the US-led Coalition had destroyed 90% of ISIL's oil production, since the beginning of Operation Tidal Wave II.Amid Anti-ISIS Fight, 90% Of Islamic State Oil Destroyed By US-Led Coalition Airstrikes In Syria And Iraq The Pentagon said coalition planes had destroyed about 400 tankers. On 2 April 2016, the Washington Post reported that more than 200 strikes against oil wells, refineries, pipelines and trucks. U.S. officials said that since the start of the campaign, the Islamic State‚Äôs oil production has plummeted, and it has lost both refining capacity and easy access to its black-market dealers in Syria and southern Turkey. On 7 August 2016, \\"Multiple\\" coalition warplanes destroyed some 83 oil tankers used by the Islamic State near Albu Kamal. It was not immediately clear if the drivers of the oil tankers in Sunday's raids were forewarned. Avoidance of civilian casualties Before Operation Tidal Wave II, attacks against oil transport were generally avoided because of the impact on civilian populations and the possibility of killing civilian truck drivers. To avoid killing civilian truck drivers, the US and its allies are doing low passes with aircraft, dropping warning leaflets and firing warning shots. Even with the new rules of engagement, attacks on makeshift refineries, run by civilians, are still off-limits. The U.S. is still attempting to avoid an environmental disaster as well.

Ziyarat in Shiite means pilgrimage or visit to pay respect to Imams.Mohd Faizal Musa, 'Axiology of Pilgrimage:Malaysian Shi‚Äôites Ziyarat in Iran and Iraq', Cultura. International Journal of Philosophy of Culture and Axiology, Vol. 10, No. 1 (2013), pp. 67-84. Although, the visitation is not obligatory rites of religion like prayer, fasting and hajj, but it plays an integral role in the religious life of Shia. But technically, Ziyarat Arba'een refers to the 40-day pilgrimage of the holy city of Karbala to mark the 40 day mourning period after the killing of Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Imam Hussain. The culture as stated by a researcher provides ways to express social emotion Steven Gordon, L., 'The sociology of sentiments and emotion', Social psychology: Sociological perspectives, (1981), pp. 562-592. and from sociological perspective, feelings rules are ‚Ä≥appropriate ways to express internal sensation\\". So, also the ziyarat is directly or indirectly used to express the mourning of Imams. The Ziyarat Arba'een is a prayer which is usually recited in the Iraqi city of Karbala on the day of Arba'een. It is narrated from Safwan al-Jammaal from Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shiite Imam in which the Imam instructed him to visit Imam Husayn's mosque, and to recite a specific visitation prayer on Arba'een by which believer should reaffirm their pledge to Husayn's ideals. The Ziyarat or prayer is a text which designates Husayn as the \\"inheritor\\" of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Importance of Ziyarat of Arba'een The number 40 holds an important status in the light of Islam. Quran emphasized the importance of 40: \\"And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, \\"Take my place among my people, do right [by them], and do not follow the way of the corrupters. (), while the Hadith also reported that the earth mourns a death of believer for forty morning. Also, according to the teachings of Ahlul Bayt, it holds a special spiritual significance. With respect to Imam Hussein, Imam Baqir reported that the heavens wept over Imam Hussein for forty morning, with the sun rising red and setting red. Duties of the mourners According to Imam Hasan al-Askari , the signs of a believers are five: * Performing fifty- one rakats of salaat (prayer) daily, * Reciting Ziyarah of Arba'een, * Wearing a ring in the right hand, * Placing the forehead on dust [during sajda], * Saying \\"Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim\\" aloud in salaat. There are some duties that mourners have to observe during forty day of Imam Hussein. They are as follow: * Ziyaratul Arba'een * Use the ziyarat to link-up with the Imam and take him as a role model in everything. * Living in peace with others that are lovers of Imam Hussein * Rise against the oppression and come to the aid of oppressed. * Renew our pledge, love and bond with the Ahlul-Bayt. The text of pilgrimage Peace be on the favorite of Allah, Peace be on the beloved friend of Allah, His distinguished hero! Peace be on the choicest confidant of Allah, sincerely attached precisely like his father! Peace be on Hussain, who gave his life in the way of Allah, a martyr, underwent untold hardships Peace be on the hostage surrounded by the-tightening circle of sorrow and grief, killed by a horde of savages. O my Allah I give witness that beyond a shadow of doubt he is Thy favorite and choicest confidant, who enjoys Thy confidence and favor, precisely like his father! Thou looked up to him and elected him in Thy cause, picked and chose him for the good fortune, selected for him the best purified parents, appointed him guardian, leader, and defender of rights, a true representative (inheritor and progenitor) of guardians, leaders and defenders of rights, gave him much and more from the inheritance of the Prophets, put him forward as a decisive argument, along with the other successors (of the Holy Prophet-the twelve lmams) to the mankind. He met with deadly dangers, acted justly and fairly, made use of everything belonging to him to pay full attention to give sincere advice, took pains, made every effort and put his heart, mind, soul and life at the disposal of Thy mission to liberate the people from the yoke of ignorance and evil of bewilderment, but an evildoer, deceived with empty hopes of mean and worthless worldly gains, had pressed heavily on him, and sold out his share (eternal bliss) for the meanest and lowest bargain, betrayed his \\"day of judgment\\" for a vulgar return, took pride in insolence, fell into the fathom- well of silly stupid follies, provoked Thee and Thy Prophet to anger, did as the harsh discordant, the hypocrite, the heavily burdened bearers of sin, condemned to Hellfire, advised to him, however, he (the Holy lmam), steadily, rightly and justly coped With them, till, in Thy obedience, gave his life after which his family was set adrift.

Analysis According to Analysis of discourse, there are three poles in the context of Ziyarat of Arba'een . The first pole is concerned with Time. In other words, Time considered as in important particular in the Ziyyarat. The ziyyarat derivates of the element of Time. In fact, determination of a special time helps to identification of the kind of religious rituals. We have two sorts of time; one concerned with text and in other word, time presented in text of Ziyyarat. The other concerned with Time but is a time in which text actualized. It is said that the latter produce a determined meaning for Shia. The time helps to make identify the process in the discourse.

At high reduced pressure and temperature, close to the saturation curve the speed of sound is largely sensitive to density variations along isentropes. Consequently, the fluid flow departs from the ideality assumption and under particular conditions may even exhibit non classical gas dynamic phenomena, whose nature is governed by the value of the fundamental derivative of gas-dynamics Œì. A non-monotonic Mach number trend along an expansion is typical for 0 < Œì < 1, while for Œì < 0 values admit the occurrence of inverse gas-dynamics phenomena such as rarefaction shock waves , splitting waves or even composite waves. Inverse gas-dynamics behavior has been theoretically predicted for heavy complex molecules in the vapor region,and a recent study discovered that two-phase rarefaction shock waves are physically realizable close to the critical point. Applications Application NICFD flows can be found in numerous fields. Basically, they are encountered in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbogenerators, refrigerator, supercritical carbon dioxide power system, pharmaceutical processes, transportation of fuels at high-speed, and in transonic and supersonic wind tunnels.

From its outset, EquityZen was designed to allow employees of private companies to sell their equity in the company to accredited investors. The firm started out as part of the 500 Startups accelerator program in the fall of 2013. The company received seed funding in January 2014 and as of September 2015 had raised Series A funding from undisclosed investors. EquityZen has raised $6.5 million in outside financing, including a $3M injection in 2017 led by Tim Draper's Draper Associates. The financial technology firm was recently mentioned in Forbes' Fintech 50 list. Service EquityZen operates a marketplace in which employee shareholders in private companies can make their equity available to outside investors. In addition to traditional share transfers, EquityZen introduced a new offering in the private shares market by working with the issuer to register a transfer of shares so employees and early investors can sell a portion of shares for cash without having to wait until an IPO or acquisition. The firm works exclusively with companies that have already raised capital from large, institutional investors. Companies need to have at least $50 million in enterprise value to be listed on the marketplace. The minimum investment amount for investors is $20,000. Financial Advisors, who manage capital on behalf of others, invest their clients' capital through the platform. Investors outside of the US have invested in private companies.

The National Picture Theatre  The National Picture Theatre on Beverley Road in Kingston upon Hull was a cinema which was built in 1914. During the Second World War, the cinema was bombed and mostly destroyed when an air raid took place on the night of 18 March 1941. A film had been showing at the time of the bombing, which was Charlie Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'. All 150 people in the cinema at the time escaped and there were no casualties. The interior of the building was completely destroyed but the facade somehow escaped the blast. It still remains to this day alongside fragments of the foyer and vestibule behind it. The cinema is the last remaining civilian bomb ruin still in existence and was Grade II listed in January 2007. The current owner of the building is Saleem Hakim, who had plans to turn the front of the Theatre into an alfresco dining area. The Hull City Council first considered these proposals in 2009, when the owner had plans to convert the site into flats and a restaurant. As a result of the recession in 2010, work had stalled. In November 2013, the owner intended to use part of back of the site as a car park. A decision to issue a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the site was made by the Hull City Council in October 2014, when the plans failed to materialise. This was issued in January 2015 after the owner had failed to sell the site at an auction. Further attempts at auctioning the site off by the owner were made in June 2015, where it again failed to sell. The auction, which only included the building's frontage, were listed with a guide price of ¬£40,000. In March 2016, Hull City Council refused an application by the owner to create an outdoor dining area in what used to be the building's main auditorium. The owner had wanted to use the land in conjunction with a new Indian restaurant, due to open next door at a neighbouring pub. The scheme was refused during the planning process after it was found that such a development would have a detrimental impact on the theatre itself. The application was the ninth submitted in five years. In May 2016, the Hull City Council issued a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the building, allowing them to buy the land with or without the owner‚Äôs permission. But it was not until July 2018 that the building was in the hands of Hull City Council. In March 2020, work got underway to stabilise the foundations of the structure.  The Trust  As a result of the cinema being derelict since the Second World War, The National Civilian WW2 Memorial Trust were formed to 'establish the National Picture Theatre ruins and site as a National Home Front tribute, to be a place of education, history and remembrance, to honour the civilians who lived and worked through the Blitz not only in Kingston upon Hull but across the whole nation.' The Trust was officially registered with The Charity Commission on 4 October 2012 with the current chairman being Tom Robinson. That month, the Trust were given planning permission to turn the theatre into a memorial site with an education centre.

He joined this organisation in 1941 and continued to participate in various ways for the remainder of his life. For his dedication and contribution to the improvement of volunteer fire services both within and beyond Toodyay he was awarded the Australian Fire Service Medal in 2001.Citation for Award of the Australian Fire Services Medal. Investiture brochure with information on recipients, 14 September 2001. Early life Patten was born in Somerset in England on 11 January 1924, the only child of Tom and Eve Batten. In 1928 the family migrated to Western Australia on the ship Ormond. They stayed with relatives on their farm at North Baandee before settling in Toodyay at Mr Groves‚Äô dairy at Mill Farm. While his father worked as a farm hand tending to the horses and eventually became manager, Patten enjoyed the simple pleasures of childhood, swimming in the river with friends and making canoes from sheets of corrugated iron. Before catching the bus to school in the morning he earned his pocket money by working in the dairy separating the milk. During the 1930s Patten attended the state school in Duke Street. One of his school friends was Hector Wood from Coorinja Vineyard. By this time single-teacher schools had closed down and pupils were collected from outlying districts by school buses. On 6 August 1931 Patten was on the school bus when it collided with a wheat train at the town railway crossing in Clinton Street. He and several others were injured; five children were killed in the accident. War service With the commencement of the Second World War in September 1939 a number of Toodyay's men enlisted to fight in Europe. At 16 years Patten was too young to enlist so he served in the Volunteer Defence Corps as an ambulance and staff driver. He was stationed at Harvey, then at Bluff Point just north of Geraldton. He was also a member of the Toodyay Rifle Club where he received basic rifle training and drill. Rifle clubs became a part of the military home defence scheme and were a source for recruitment. In 1944 Patten enlisted with the Second Australian Imperial Force at Karrakatta Camp and was posted to Wewak in New Guinea. He was assigned to the 2nd 44th Jeep Transport Platoon where he worked as a driver. The following year he was transferred to Itabie on the north coast of Dutch New Guinea to work with the 96th Heavy Transport Platoon. Their job was unloading barges carrying supplies for the front line on the Kokoda Trail. He remained at Itabie for the duration of the war. The war ended with the unconditional surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. Patten recalled how he was astonished to see Japanese soldiers coming out of the jungle waving white flags. The platoon was transferred back to Wewak where they witnessed the formal surrender of Hataz≈ç Adachi, the commander-in-chief of Japanese forces in the region, to Australian General Horace Robertson.Eric Patten, an oral history, 2006, unsourced newspaper clipping. The Toodyay Oral History Series, No.5. Toodyay Historical Society collection. Following the surrender, Patten and his Transport Unit were sent to Rabaul as part of the occupation force, where their job was to supply food and essentials to Japanese prisoners. Patten was amongst the last of the servicemen to return home.Toodyay Herald, 14 June 1946, p.2. After he was discharged he joined the 10th Light Horse Regiment as an army recruit. During the 15 years he spent with the Light Horse he rose to the rank of major and became an officer in charge of a full squadron.Eric Patten, an oral history, unsourced newspaper clipping. He also joined the Toodyay Returned Services League and served for many years as its secretary. Return from war and marriage After his discharge from the army, Patten rejoined his father for a time in the dairying business before going into partnership with Edgar Dorizzi. The business expanded from cartage to working with earth moving equipment and laying house pads. In May 1955 Patten married Shirley Campbell, who had come to Toodyay from Wiluna with her parents in about 1948. They were married in St Stephen's Anglican Church and the wedding breakfast was held at the CWA Hall. The couple had three sons, Craig, Dean and Wayne, also known as Jack, and a daughter Jenny Lee. Toodyay Fire Brigade Patten joined the Toodyay Volunteer Fire Brigade in around 1941 and continued to serve in one capacity or another for the next 60 years.Eric Patten, an oral history, p.19. He continued his interest and attendance at the Toodyay Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service meetings until about six months before he died. On 13 March 1983 he was honoured with the naming of the Eric Patten Running Track for 40 years dedicated service. The track ran between Duke and Clinton Streets along what is now known as Charcoal Lane. This was a section of the old Toodyay-Miling railway line, and close to where the school bus crash had occurred. The running track sign, once situated below an old bell, was unveiled by Brigade member Spec Sinclair. The event took place during a Picnic Demonstration Day attended by nine Volunteer Fire Brigades.Northam Advertiser, 24 March 1983, p.14 Awards Patten received a number of awards for his services to the town that have included State Emergency Service controller, volunteer ambulance driver, President of the Avon Branch Legacy, and numerous memberships of sporting clubs.

There, he was started under saddle and was sold in the Ocala Breeders Sale of Two Year Olds in April 2001. He raced three times at Rockingham Park and five races at Suffolk Downs, between 2001‚Äì2002. In June 2002, he returned to Rockingham Park and broke his maiden on August 25, 2002. During his career, he raced mostly in claiming races and had a number of different owners.

Retirement In 2004, Blue Blue Sea was owned by Donald L. Demeza. Demeza listed Blue Blue Sea on the CANTER-Mid-Atlantic (at the time West Virginia) website. From that site, Prather saw his listing and eventually purchased the horse with the plans to train him to be a show jumper. In August 2006, Blue Blue Sea colicked five times in the course of the month. Local veterinarians referred the case to the Marion Scott Dupont Center in Leesburg, VA. There, the horse was diagnosed with a malabsorption disorder. The prognosis was grave with a 1‚Äì2 year life expectancy. A nutritionist veterinarian formulated several new diets and with careful management, Blue Blue Sea managed to thrive. In 2011, Prather started a Facebook page for Blue Blue Sea, which linked thousands of followers from around the world, some who suffered from an illness as well. These friends banded together to raise funds to fly Gran Huracan, Blue Blue Sea's half-brother, from Puerto Rico to a rescue in Florida.http://www.paulickreport.com/features/ottb-showcase/ottb- showcase-blue-blue-sea-a-k-a-blue/ Retrieved 2015-11-23. Death and legacy On the evening of February 8, 2013, Prather went to the barn where Blue Blue Sea was his usual energetic self. The next morning, February 9, 2013, the horse was found dead. There were no signs to suggest that Blue Blue Sea colicked in the night. It appeared that he had simply fallen over dead, possibly from an aneurysm. Prather had him cremated in Boonsboro, Maryland. http://offtrackthoroughbreds.com/2013/02/11/blue-blue-sea-passes-on/ Retrieved 2015-11-23.

In 2004, she discovered a new spiral arm in the Milky Way galaxy. She was awarded the Prime Minister's Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist in 2006 and in 2015 was honored for her research in physics by receipt of the Pawsey Medal from the Australian Academy of Science. Biography Naomi Melissa McClure- Griffiths was born on July 11, 1975 in Atlanta Georgia. She entered Oberlin College in 1993 where she studied both French and physics and then in 1997 entered the University of Minnesota to study astrophysics. During her PhD, she participated in the International Galactic Plane Survey, leading the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to map the hydrogen gas in the Milky Way. In 2001, she relocated permanently to Australia taking up a post doctoral fellowship at the Australia Telescope National Facility as a CSIRO Bolton Fellow. During her Fellowship McClure-Griffiths studied the movement of interstellar gases and how explosions of stars create bubbles or shells which push the gasses out of the galaxy. In their movement, chimneys of empty space may be created, two of which were discovered by McClure-Griffiths. One of the chimneys she discovered is the only known chimney to \\"extend through the top and bottom of the galactic plane\\". Then in 2004, she discovered a new spiral arm during her senior postdoctoral position. The new arm was shown on previous mappings but never identified nor given a name. McCure-Griffiths created a computer model to confirm its existence which was confirmed by her team. In 2006, she was honored with the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the year one of the annual prizes awarded as the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science. As Principal Investigator she initiated the Galactic All Sky Survey that same year and then in 2007, she was the recipient of the Powerhouse Wizard Award from the Powerhouse Museum at the Sydney Observatory. McClure-Griffiths' team took part in the international effort to complete the mapping of the Milky Way's magnetic fields in 2011. In 2015, she left CSIRO and joined the Australian National University as a professor conducting her research from the Mount Stromlo Observatory.

He was Minister of Justice in 1892 and again in 1895‚Äì96. He is best known for steering through the 1898 law on workplace accidents. Early years (1839‚Äì85) Louis Pierre Hippolyte Ricard was born on 17 March 1839 in Caen, Calvados. His father was Paul Urban Ricard, a Caen hosiery manufacturer, and his mother was Marie-Caroline Rossignol. He grew up in a comfortable and rather conservative Catholic home. He studied law in Paris and joined the bar of Rouen in 1861. He became well known in the Rouen Court of Appeal. In 1864 Ricard married Annette Gratienne Lesueur, a Protestant, daughter of a cotton manufacturer and niece of a major manufacturer of chemical products. They would have one son. His wife brought him a large dowry, and also introduced him to what were then advanced political and social views. He became an anti-clerical Republican, and gradually moved towards a very liberal Protestantism. After his first wife died he remarried to Berthe Renaud. In 1876 he moved into an opulent townhouse in Rouen. On 13 November 1881 Ricard was elected to the municipal council on the Left list, and three days later was appointed mayor. He was elected to the general council of the department in 1882 for the fourth canton of Rouen. In April 1882 he was the first mayor of Rouen to be elected by the members of the council. He was a moderate Republican who would move towards radicalism. During his term of office there were significant improvements in social and medical services in the city. A school for young girls was founded and the Theater of the Arts was rebuilt after a fire. National politics (1886‚Äì1902) In the general elections of 4 October 1885 Ricard was elected deputy on the Republican list for the Seine-Inf√©rieure. He resigned his municipal offices on 8 January 1886 when he entered the Chamber. He was succeeded as mayor of Rouen in 1886 by Maurice Lebon. Ricard sat with the Progressive Republican Left. Ricard did not run in the general election of 1889, but when the deputy for the first district of Rouen died he ran in the by-election of 1 December 1889 and won in the first round. He was reelected in the first round for the same constituency on 20 August 1893 and 8 May 1898. Ricard sat with the Progressive Republican Left in the Chamber. Ricard became Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs when the cabinet of √âmile Loubet was formed on 29 February 1892, and held office until 6 December 1892. He was again Minister of Justice in the cabinet of L√©on Bourgeois from 1 November 1895 to 29 April 1896. He is best known as principal rapporteur of the law on workplace accidents on 1898. In 1900 he became a member of the Higher Council on Labor, and chaired the committee on industrial employment of women and children. He unexpectedly lost the legislative election of 27 April 1902. Last years (1902‚Äì21) After his electoral defeat Ricard retired from politics and returned to his career as an attorney. He was made an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1903 by General Andr√©. During World War I (1914‚Äì18), in 1916 Ricard chaired the committee on regulating military construction companies. He died on 2 March 1921 in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, aged 81.

Background The plaintiff in this case was Michael O'Brien, who had been wrongfully convicted of a murder in Cardiff in 1987. In addition to receiving compensation from the Home Office for the eleven years he spent in prison, O'Brien was seeking aggravated and exemplary damages from South Wales Police for malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office.O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [18]. O'Brien's conviction was based on the \\"confession\\" of an associate of his, Darren Hall, who had been with him the night of the murder. The misconduct alleged by O'Brien included that police officers; * Applied improper pressure to Hall and himself during interviewing in an attempt to induce admissions, \\"without regard to the truth or reliability\\" of them, * Fabricated admissions of guilt, and; * Suppressed evidence which exonerated the defendants.O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [19]. O'Brien wished to have evidence admitted that would show that the two police officers leading the investigation against him had led two other cases where similar misconduct had been alleged; the Welsh bomb trial and the murder of Karen Price.O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [20]-[24]. At a case management conference of O'Brien's claim, Judge Graham Jones of the High Court, granted permission to O'Brien to rely on the similar fact evidence.O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2003] EWCA Civ 1085 at [1]. The police appealed this decision unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal and subsequently appealed to the House of Lords.  Judgments  The House of Lords unanimously dismissed the appeal. Lord Bingham noted that, > \\"Any evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant. Contested trials last > long enough as it is without spending time on evidence which is irrelevant > and cannot affect the outcome. Relevance must, and can only, be judged by > reference to the issue which the court (whether judge or jury) is called > upon to decide. As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in Director of Public > Prosecutions v Kilbourne [1973] AC 729, 756, \\"Evidence is relevant if it is > logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof ‚Ä¶.. > relevant (ie. logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence > which makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable\\".\\"O'Brien > v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [3]. Lord Bingham then concluded that evidence must satisfy a two-stage test before being admitted in a civil case. Firstly, it will be legally admissible if it is probative of a relevant matter. Secondly, judges will have to weigh the argument in favour of admitting the evidence against any arguments against admitting it, such as, the evidence relates to a collateral matter, is potentially prejudicial or unduly burdensome.O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [6]. Lord Phillips observed, > \\"The Court of Appeal held that, in civil as opposed to criminal proceedings, > the judge has to proceed in two stages when deciding whether to admit > evidence. First he has to decide whether the evidence is admissible. If it > is, he has to decide, as a matter of discretion whether he will permit the > evidence to be led. The test of admissibility is that propounded by your > Lordships' House in Director of Public Prosecutions v P [1991]2 AC 447. The > exercise of discretion as to whether admissible evidence should be permitted > to be led involves the approach that the judge should bring to case > management in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR).\\"O'Brien v > Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [24]. On the issue of admissibility, Lord Phillips held: \\"I would simply apply the test of relevance as the test of admissibility of similar fact evidence in a civil suit. Such evidence is admissible if it is potentially probative of an issue in the action.\\"O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2005] UKHL 26 at [53]. Settlement South Wales Police settled O'Brien's claims out of court for ¬£300,000 in 2006.

Early life Scharer was born in Seattle, and is of half-African American and Filipino descent. His father is an African- American, while his mother is a Filipina, who hails from Bauang, La Union. His parents divorced when he was a child. At age seven, he first learned basketball in the tough community in Central District, Seattle through his uncle, who used to let him play against grown men. This experience made him a better rebounder and a physical defender he is today. High school and college career Scharer went on to play four years of varsity basketball for Garfield High School in Seattle. During this time, he helped former University of Washington alum and current NBA player Tony Wroten develop his game. During his high school years, he was not heavily scouted to play college basketball, so he decided to take his basketball talents to North Shore Community College, and played there for a year. He then transferred to Green River Community College through a scholarship offer. However, his stint there did not last long as his grades started to dip and he came back home. After being out of school for three years and spending a year in jail, he tried out for Shoreline Community College, where his talent was noticed by assistant basketball coach Adam Jose. It was Jose who mentored him and noticed a character chance in him. He went on to play for Shoreline Dolphins, averaging 16 points, 6.5 rebounds, 9.5 assists and 2.5 steals per game, while helping the school finish seventh in the Northwestern Athletic Association of Community Colleges (NWAACC), its best record in 10 years. Professional career Being undrafted, Mongolia, and Seattle Mountaineers Scharer applied for the 2012 NBA draft but was undrafted. In that same year, he then applied for the NBA D-League Draft along with current PBA player Japeth Aguilar, but was also undrafted. Yet, he did receive phone calls from NBA teams as well as in the overseas, particularly ABL teams, expressing their interest for his services. This made him decide to play professionally in the Philippines as he considered it as a step closer to his NBA dream. Scharer first played professionally in Mongolia, playing for the Aravtuud Bulls of the Mongolian National Basketball League. He then played for the Seattle Mountaineers in the ABA, a team mostly made up of basketball players from the Seattle area. Westports Malaysia Dragons In his second overseas stint, Scharer saw action in the Malaysia National Basketball League, suiting up for the Kuala Lumpur Dragons (now Westports Malaysia Dragons) and made an outstanding impression, entertaining the crowds with his crossover moves and court vision. He had an impressive MNBL campaign after averaging an impressive 19.5 points, 6.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists per game. He was rewarded a spot to play for the Dragons in the ASEAN Basketball League after another Filipino-American, Rashawn McCarthy, left the team to join the PBA draft. On August 8, 2014, he made his much-anticipated debut for the Dragons in the ABL with a three pointer in the dying seconds to tie the game against Saigon Heat in regulation, which they eventually won.Avery Scharer: \\"We are a family\\" During the league's regular season, he posted averages of 15.1 points, 6 rebounds and 6.53 assist per game, while leading the league in assists (6.5) and steals (2.6) per game. He also helped the Dragons reach the Finals to face the Hi-Tech Bangkok City, but was swept 0-2. During his stint with the Dragons, he became teammates with current PBA players and fellow Fil- foreigners Moala Tautuaa and Justin Melton. PBA D-League On November 23, 2015, it was announced by Philippine Basketball Association commissioner Chito Narvasa that Scharer was one of the 215 aspirants for the 2015 PBA D-League Draft, which was to take place on December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, he was drafted fifth overall by the Wang's Basketball Couriers in the PBA D-League rookie draft held at PBA Caf√© in Metrowalk, Pasig City. However, due to some undisclosed reasons, Scharer never played for the team. Thailand On May 2, 2016, it was reported that Scharer would sign with the OSK Basketball Club of the Thailand Basketball League. Player profile Scharer is a point guard who can score, dish out assists, collar rebounds, and defend all at the same time at any given night. He is also notable for his sick crossover moves, court vision and high basketball IQ. Personal life Scharer became a father when he was 20 years old, and had to stop schooling and work for three years to support his son. During this time, he was affiliated with the Black Gangsters Disciples, a Seattle-based gang whose method of operation includes drug trafficking and other crimes. In July 2009, he was arrested for conspiring to distribute BZP (a synthetic substance similar to ecstasy) with another gang member Dimitrius Tinsley. Both men pleaded guilty to drug charges related to the sale of BZP. On January 15, 2010, he was given an 18-month prison sentence by the US District Court, while Tinsley was given a six-year sentence. During his time in prison, he dedicated himself to getting in shape and playing basketball. He then became a Christian while in jail.

A day of thanksgiving was a day set aside for public worship in thanksgiving for events believed to signal God's mercy and favor. Such a day might be proclaimed by the civil authority or the church. History National days of prayer for specific occasions had been ordered in England as early as 1009 by King √Üthelred the Unready. Occasional days of fasting were held in England in the middle of the sixteenth century under Elizabeth I in response to plague outbreaks and the Armada Crisis of 1588. Puritans especially embraced occasional days of fasting. By the middle of the seventeenth century, days of thanksgiving were celebrated in New England annually in November. Days of humiliation and fasting A day of humiliation or thanksgiving might be proclaimed in response to a drought, flood, fire, military defeat, or plague. They might also be held before the undertaking of a difficult endeavor. People were expected to search themselves for sin and to repent in order to appease God's wrath. Everyone between the ages of sixteen and sixty was expected to spend the entire day in fasting, church attendance, listening to sermons of exhortation and meditating on their sin. Days of thanksgiving A day of thanksgiving might be held in response to signs of God's mercy, such as rain allowing a good harvest, arrival of needed supplies, or recovery from sickness. They might also be held after a long period of general success and lack of disaster. On days of thanksgiving, the faithful would also spend the day in church attendance, but would pray thankfully, sing psalms of praise, and feast. Puritan feast days were more solemn and demanding than traditional Christian feasts. Days of thanksgiving were celebrated with joy in thanks for recent blessing, but Puritans also saw them as days to look forward to the coming of the Kingdom of God. As replacements of traditional holidays Puritans rejected the traditional Christian liturgical calendar of holy days, including Easter and Christmas, as well as saints' days, but set aside special days in response to current events. However, natural cycles caused penance and rebirth to continue to be associated with Spring, as had been the case with Easter. Thanksgiving days were normally celebrated in Autumn following the harvest.

It is the church for the Torvastad parish which is part of the Karm√∏y prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1880 using designs by the architect Ole Ottesen Vangberg. The church seats about 450 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1301, but it was likely built during the 12th century. A carved dragon head was found inside a wall during a renovation in the 17th century which was dated to the 1100s, which is the basis for the likelihood of the church's original construction around that time. The first church at Torvastad was a stave church. During the 1620s, major repairs were undertaken, but they were not long-lasting. In 1635, the church was torn down and replaced with a small timber-framed church on a location slightly to the northwest of the present site of the church. In 1880, the old church was torn down and a new, larger church was built about southeast of the old site of the church. The new building was consecrated on 13 October 1880.

He has also served as chairman and director for several aviation-related and non-aviation- related companies. Gitner is best known for his time as the CEO of TWA in the late '90s during which time he increased fleet numbers, renewed the fleet, improved the company's debt structure, won two J.D. Power and Associates awards, and ultimately facilitated the 2001 sale of the company to American Airlines. Education Born In Boston, he attended Boston Latin School,https://www.bls.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=203830 then attended Boston University College of Arts and Sciences where he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in 1966. He then attended the University of Rochester where he received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1968.

Career Gitner began his career at TWA in 1968. He would work his way up to vice president for scheduling before leaving in 1974. He moved on to Texas International Airlines where he eventually became the Senior Vice President of Marketing. In 1980, he left Texas International and co-founded People Express Airlines, a low-cost airline based in the northeastern United States. He was the president of that company before leaving in 1982 to become the Senior Vice President of Marketing and Planning at Pan American World Airways. He would eventually add the titles of Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, and Chairman/CEO of Pan Am World Services. In his time at Pan Am, Gitner worked on Pan Am's debt, reworked the fleet, and raised cash. He also participated in the sale of Pan Am's Pacific flights to United Airlines.

He was elected acting CEO of TWA in late 1996 and assumed the position of Chairman and CEO in February 1997.

Gitner stepped down as CEO in 1999, while remaining Chairman. During his tenure, the company won two J.D. Power and Associates awards (one for long- haul flights in 1998 and one for short-haul flights in 1999). Since his time at TWA, Gitner has gone on to be a part of numerous other companies and firms.

The announcement detailed a commitment by 228 cities to cut up to 13 gigatons of carbon emissions by 2050. Mayors Eduardo Paes of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Anne Hidalgo of Paris, France and Park Won-soon of Seoul, South Korea joined in the announcement, representing C40, UCLG, and ICLEI. UN-Habitat provided additional support and oversight for the launch of the Compact. On December 8, 2014, World Resources Institute, C40 Cities, and ICLEI revealed the Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), identified as the first set of standardized global rules for cities to measure and publicly report their carbon pollution emissions. This standard is the baseline on which Compact of Mayors was founded. At the C40 Latin American Mayors Summit on March 27, 2015, Compact of Mayors officials launched the first public recruiting effort, receiving commitments from twenty Latin American mayors to join the Compact and accelerate their push toward low-carbon economies. On June 30, 2015, Mike Bloomberg and Mayor Anne Hidalgo jointly announced their plans to host a Climate Summit for Local Leaders on December 4 at Paris City Hall. The summit will convene mayors from around the world at the COP21 climate negotiations and build upon existing climate commitments under the Compact of Mayors. At the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas on August 24, 2015, President Barack Obama challenged 100 cities to commit to the Compact of Mayors as part of a larger push to advance clean energy across the United States. Rio de Janeiro became the first city to achieve full compliance with the Compact on August 26, 2015. Vice President of the United States Joe Biden called out the success of the Compact of Mayors in promoting action against climate change during his address at the US-China Climate Leadership Summit in Los Angeles on September 15, 2015. Later that month, on September 28, 2015, Mike Bloomberg announced the launch of a new parent organization combining the efforts of the Compact of Mayors and the Compact of States and Regions at NYC Climate Week. Vice President Biden also cited the success of the Compact of Mayors while speaking on November 5, 2015 at the National League of Cities Congress of Cities in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. On November 20, 2015, the Compact of Mayors was recognized by the White House for exceeding 100 U.S. member cities prior to the COP 21 climate negotiations in Paris. Mayors and other leaders of hundreds of cities committed to the Compact of Mayors attended the Climate Summit for Local Leaders at Paris City Hall on December 4, 2015 during COP21. At the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, Leonardo DiCaprio welcomed climate action commitments made by 392 cities under the Compact of Mayors, and he urged the local leaders in attendance to do more to fight climate change. Following the Climate Summit, 428 global cities had committed to the Compact of Mayors, representing over 376 million people worldwide. The Compact of Mayors officially merged with the Covenant of Mayors on June 22, 2016 in Brussels, Belgium. The newly created Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy unites more than 7,100 cities in 119 countries across six continents in the shared goal of fighting climate change through coordinated local climate action. The initiative represents more than 600 million residents, or more than 8 percent of the world's population.  Leadership  The Compact of Mayors was launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Mike Bloomberg. The organization receives oversight from ICLEI, United Cities and Local Governments, and C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. UN-Habitat has provided founding and operational support. Mayor Eduardo Paes of Rio de Janeiro currently serves as the chairperson of C40 Cities, while Mayor Kadir Topbas of Istanbul, Turkey and Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, France currently serve as president and co-president of United Cities and Local Governments. Mayor Ashok-Alexander Sridharan of Bonn, Germany is the current president of ICLEI, and Ms Maimunah Mohd Sharif serves as the current Executive Director of UN- Habitat. Mayor Nanda Jichkar of Nagpur, India is a board member of Global Covenant of Mayors.  Controversy  In 2020, the Covenant received international condemnation for bowing to Chinese pressure and updating the six member cities in Taiwan from their original designation as being cities in \\"Chinese Taipei\\" to cities in \\"China.\\" Taiwanese premier Su Tseng-chang criticized the changes as \\"extremely improper.\\" The decision was reversed a few days later with assistance from the European Union. Foreign Minister of Taiwan Joseph Wu said ‚ÄúWe are happy to learn that they have changed our name back to the original title\\".

It operated XL426 from 1984 to 1986 and XH558 from 1985 to 1993. It was disbanded in 1993, due to defence cuts. History Prior to the formation of the VDF, various Vulcans were publicly displayed by operational RAF squadrons as part of their normal duties. Since the Vulcan had been a popular performer, it was decided after the disbandment of the last operational Vulcan unit, 50 Squadron, to set up the VDF to continue display flying. The first display, performed using XL426, was for IX Squadron's Standard Presentation Parade at RAF Honington on 23 May 1984. Over 50 displays were then completed using XL426 for the 1984 season. As a result of budget cuts, it was decided by the Ministry of Defence to discontinue the VDF, as it couldn't justify the cost of maintaining a single aircraft type simply for display purposes. The final flight, performed using XH558, was at RAF Cranfield on 20 September 1992.Birtles 2008, p. 97. Operations The Vulcan Display Team (VDT) was a volunteer unit, with the aircraft based at RAF Waddington but with 55 Squadron, a Victor tanker unit based at RAF Marham, being their parent unit.Darling 2012, p. 155 To avoid disputes between squadrons, the VDF's Vulcans flew with the Black Panther insignia of No. 1 Group RAF, the same device worn when Vulcans were posted overseas on exercises. Aircraft The VDT was initially allocated the aircraft XL426, with XH560 held in reserve. XL426 was one of the last three Vulcans to be in bomber configuration in active RAF service, having been retained as training aircraft for the Vulcan tankers of 50 Squadron.XL426 in the RAF Vulcan Restoration Trust With XL426's flying hours running out, it was decided in the first year of displays to replace it with XH560, although after it was discovered that XH558 had more flying hours, it was chosen instead. The already withdrawn XH558 had been at Marham for spares recovery prior to eventual disposal. A former tanker, XH558 was converted back into bomber configuration at Waddington and made its display debut at the TVS Airshow in Bournemouth in May 1985. XL426 also continued to display until a final appearance at RAF Coningsby Open Day on 14 June 1986. XL426 was sold to a preservation group based at Southend Airport (where it remains as a taxiable aircraft), being delivered on 19 December 1986. After the disbandment, XH558 was also sold for preservation, being delivered to Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome in Leicestershire on 23 March 1993. It was eventually returned to flight in 2007 and was displayed as a civilian aircraft from the 2008 to 2015 seasons inclusive before being grounded for engineering reasons, also remaining as a taxiable aircraft at Robin Hood Airport.

Among his best known works are the operas Fellow Travelers and Paul's Case, as well as his Requiem. Background Spears grew up in Virginia. He attended Eastman School of Music, received a master's degree at Yale University, and earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University. He studied with Hans Abrahamsen and Per N√∏rg√•rd while a Fulbright Scholar at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. Style Spears' music often draws on earlier musical styles processed through contemporary minimalist techniques. The New York Times's Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim described his opera Fellow Travelers: \\"But what makes Fellow Travelers such a satisfying operatic experience is the old-fashioned combination of a swift- flowing and deft libretto and gorgeous music.\\" Alex Ross in The New Yorker elaborates: \\"The harmony is largely tonal, but it is anti-Romantic in effect, tending instead toward a decorous neo-Baroque sensibility. Voices and instruments often perform courtly pirouettes against sustained chords and even pulses. The atmosphere is one of hushed disclosure: the music implies more than it says. What emerges is a potently ambiguous sound world that conveys human warmth and chill in equal measure. Above all, it is a transparent medium in which singing actors can speak instead of shout.\\" Heidi Waleson described Spears' compositional style in her Wall Street Journal review of the opera O Columbia: \\"Mr. Spears writes brilliantly for vocal ensembles. Starting with neoclassical-style clarity, he builds textured, complex musical structures that sound old and new at the same time, and his skillful text settings use minimalist-like repetition to give Mr. Vavrek's pointed, thoughtful words even more power and emotional specificity.\\" Steve Smith, in his New York Times review of the opera Paul's Case, based on the Willa Cather short story of the same title, described the score: \\"Mr. Spears's elegantly spare music, with its gamelan-redolent modes and clockwork repetitions, Baroque vocal fillips, intricately woven ensembles and dramatically placed dissonances, further infuses the tale with a sense of ritual and inevitability.\\" David Patrick Stearns, in his Philadelphia Inquirer review of Spears' Requiem, described his musical influences: \\"Spears intersperses the swan myth with the requiem text, much of it reflecting lyrical Baltic influences of Arvo P√§rt, but with a young composer's restlessness. The swan's song is speculatively re-created with otherworldly vocal ornaments.

The mission of this organization is to \\"enrich the lives of residents and visitors by serving as a center for community activities and providing information, cultural, and civic services that are responsive, affordable, and enjoyable.\\" Specifically, the Library serves the needs of the community of Sedona Arizona by providing youth and family services, community rooms, job finding resources, Internet access, online resources, print materials, eBooks, and entertainment services and much more. In addition to a staff of 22 employees and a volunteer board of trustees, volunteer workers provide 16,000 hours of vital service to the Library's everyday operation. The Friends of the Sedona Library, Inc. support the library through raising funds and by volunteering. The Friends are a separate entity from the Sedona Public Library. History The Sedona Public Library was established in 1958 by the ‚ÄúFriends of the Library‚Äù in a donated space that consisted of three shelves of donated books and magazines. In 1964, the Friends of the Library formed a board a trustees to manage the administrative duties of the Library. A lease was signed on the Riordan Building and a librarian was hired for $50.00 a month (later raised to $75.00). Coconino County covered half of the annual rent at $480.00 a year. In 1964 when the Sedona Public Library incorporated as a non-profit, they possessed 6,230 books. Two residents of Sedona, Eugenia Wright and Helen Ecker donated land on Jordan Road for a new library building. Eugenia and Helen wanted to use the land to benefit the largest number of people in the community, and the library was most representative of that ideal. More property was later added which included a small house for the librarian as a part of compensation for their work. Local fundraising began for a new building. Friends of the Sedona Public library raised more than $75,000 in August 1966, and a new building was complete on October 26, 1969. By 1985 the Library had grown out of its 5,000 square foot space, and the board of trustees investigated ideas for library expansion. In 1986, Sedona resident Ethel Low donated $326,000 to buy land. In 1988, the Jordan Road Street Fair began a fundraising campaign, and $9,000 was raised. The Fair's success convinced the Friends of the Library and the board of trustees that the public was duly interested and capable of raising the necessary funds for a new Library building. Ground-breaking ceremonies for the new building took place October 2, 1991. The building was dedicated on October 1, 1994. In October 2000, Sedona Public Library joined the Yavapai Library Network. The Children‚Äôs Library opened on September 7, 2002. By this time the library was 25,500 square feet. In December 2005, Sedona Public Library opened a second facility in the Village of Oak Creek. This location provides public internet access and free Wi-Fi as well as many other library services. Library Services The Sedona Public Library offers a variety of services such as access to current print and ebook fiction and non-fiction titles, access to online databases, and access to 34 patron computers. In addition, the library offers a Culture Pass, which gives a library customer FREE admission for two people at participating arts and cultural institutions. The Sedona Public Library offers various Library programs for children, teen, and adults ranging from arts and crafts, musical performers, movie nights, writing workshops, book clubs, chess clubs, sewing guilds, children's storytime, and informative programs.

The current version of the act was put into place in 2004, five years after their current constitution was established. A group of men in Africa ploughing with oxen.  History  ‚Ä¢ The Labour Act, 2004 ‚Ä¢ The Factories Act, 2004 ‚Ä¢ The Pensions Act, 2004 ‚Ä¢ The Trade Disputes Act, 2004 ‚Ä¢ The Trade Union Amended Act, 2005 ‚Ä¢ The Employees Compensation Act, 2010 ‚Ä¢ The National Minimum Wage Act, 2011 ‚Ä¢ The Pension Reform Act, 2014  Rights of workers   Wages  The Labour Act of 2004 set the standard for the minimum amount of naira a worker in Nigeria is supposed to make. In 2004 the minimum wage was set to ‚Ç¶5,500.00 per month. In 2011, the National Minimum Wage Act of 2011 set the minimum wage to ‚Ç¶18,000.00 per month. The Labour Act of 2004 also has an exception that states that any establishment which employs fewer than 50 workers does not have to abide to the Nigerian minimum wage. In 2019, a new implementation for an increase to more than 50,000 Naira was advocated but later settled to 30,000 Naira which has commenced payment at that rate.  Pensions  The Pension Act of 2004 established a contributory pension scheme for people employed in the public and private sector of Nigeria. The amount that has to be contributed towards the pension is 7% of an employee's paycheck. It also states that in the event of an employee's death that the next-of-kin is to receive their pension and any benefits from their life insurance policy. In the act, it allows retired employees to receive retirement benefits.  Leave  Under legislation passed in 2004, every employee is entitled to twenty-one days' leave after working for twelve months of continuous service and in the case of people under 16 years old 12 leave days. The exception to this rule is in the case in which an employer and employee agree to extend the period of entitled leave from 12 months to 24 months, but no more than 24 months. Employees also have up to 12 days of paid sick leave per year in which an employee is allowed absence from their job as long as a registered medical practitioner certifies the illness (Adesegun- Smith, 10-11). A woman also has the right to maternity leave as long as she provides a written medical certificate from a medical doctor stating that she should not or cannot work. The medical certificate allows a woman to not work for approximately six weeks before the birth of her baby and six weeks after the birth of her baby. She's also owed at least 50% of her normal wages as long as she has been employed for six months. She is also allowed two extra thirty-minute breaks for the purpose of nursing her child.  Transportation  The labour act also provides transportation for employees in situations in which they have to travel over . In that situation, the employer might provide free transportation. It is also mandatory that the vehicle is in good condition, sanitary, and not overcrowded.  National Housing Fund  Under Nigerian Law, employees who make over ‚Ç¶3,000 must also contribute 2.5% of their paycheck to the National Housing Fund, which is controlled by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. Any company who fails to deduct 2.5% from a pay cheque of an employer could face a fine of ‚Ç¶50,000.  Termination  The Labour Act of 2004 allows for a few different ways in which employees can be terminated. The first method is in the event of the death of an employee. The second is that either party may terminate the employment contract as long as the other party is given notice. The amount of notice given goes as follows: one day's notice for a contract that has lasted less than three months, one week of notice for a contract that has lasted more than three months but less than two years, two weeks for a contract that has lasted more than two years but less than five years, and one month for a contract that has lasted for more than five years. Also within the terms of the contract, all payments most be made to an employee before his contract is terminated.

The game was released in Japan by Sega, in North America by Atlus USA, and in Europe and Australia by NIS America in March 2016. The game's story centers around a young man who must journey to unite four witches so he can save his home town from destruction. It is the last game developed by Imageepoch, before filing for bankruptcy. Gameplay Gameplay is divided into different areas, free time and battle time. During either players have the ability to purchase items and fight random monsters, however there are certain things that can only be accomplished via free time and battle time. In free time players are given three opportunities to build relationships with their teammates, perform odd jobs, or explore the surrounding area. They are also given the opportunity to \\"tune\\" the witches, a process that becomes necessary when personal strife would prevent the player from increasing their relationship with the respective witch. Doing any of these things will cause time to pass and the extent to which a player develops a relationship can impact the game's ending. Engaging in battle time will progress the game's story. Battles are turn based and the extent of a character's abilities can depend greatly on how close Alto is to the person, as a closer relationship or friendship can allow the character to unlock various abilities. The game must be played through twice to unlock the True Ending which can only be accessed the second time through if you choose the right option between granting or denying a certain game-changing request. Of course, the player has to figure out which is the correct option. Plot The protagonist Alto is a young man suffering from amnesia. He has managed to find a home in Mithra Village with his friend Lisette, however their happiness is destroyed when the Witch of Destruction, Hilda, arrives and turns the village - and almost everyone in it - into crystal via song, something that only witches can do. Alto and Lisette are initially spared from this fate but are soon confronted by Hilda and one of her followers. In her grief Lisette transforms into the Water Witch using a mysterious crystal Alto gave her as a birthday gift. Just as their fight with Hilda comes to a climax, Alto and Lisette are saved by the Regnant Knights, who fight on behalf of the land's Queen. They're brought to the city where they discover that Hilda has been doing this all over the country and that if not stopped, she will crystallize everything. In order to stop her Alto and the others must bring together four witches, each of which personify the four elements, and have them sing a song that will undo Hilda's efforts. During this process Alto finds that he is no ordinary young man, as he is a Conductor, an entity with powers that can fine-tune and amplify the witches' songs. A betrayal later awakens a larger threat to the planet, forcing Alto to ally with Hilda to stop it. Development Imageepoch trademarked the name Stella Glow in August 2014.

Canavalin is a vicilin protein homologous to phaseolin. The crystallization of jack bean seed proteins has been studied extensively since the early 20th century and was of particular interest to 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate James B. Sumner, though Sumner's group never fully characterized canavalin and it remained of little interest until its crystallization properties began to be studied in the 1970s. It was among the first reported examples of a protein whose tertiary structure contains two pseudo-symmetrical protein domains.

Made by Erik Hattrem from 4x5\\" Kodak plus-x on Fomabrom IV123 paper Bromoil print by Josef Jind≈ôich ≈†echtl, 1920s Goldbandlilie, 1932, a 4-color bromoil-transfer by F. Rontag The oil print process is a photographic printmaking process that dates to the mid-19th century. Oil prints are made on paper on which a thick gelatin layer has been sensitized to light using dichromate salts. After the paper is exposed to light through a negative, the gelatin emulsion is treated in such a way that highly exposed areas take up an oil-based paint, forming the photographic image. A significant drawback to the oil print process is that it requires the negative to be the same size as the final print because the medium is not sensitive enough to light to make use of an enlarger. A subtype of the oil print process, the bromoil process, was developed in the early 20th century to solve this problem. The oil print and bromoil processes create soft images reminiscent of paint or pastels but with the distinctive indexicality of a photograph. For this reason, they were popular with the Pictorialists during the first half of the 20th century. The painterly qualities of the prints continue to appeal to artists and have recently led some contemporary art photographers to take up these processes again. Oil print techniques The origins of the oil print process go back to experiments by Alphonse Louis Poitevin with bichromated gelatin in the 1850s.\\"Pigment Printing Processes\\". Early Photography website. To make an oil print, a piece of paper is coated with a thick gelatin layer containing dichromate salts that sensitize it to light. A contact print is made by laying a negative over the paper and exposing it to light, which leads to hardening of the dichromated gelatin in proportion to the amount of light that reaches the paper. After exposure, the print is soaked in water and the non-hardened areas absorb more water than the hardened parts. The sponge-dried but still moist paper is then inked with an oil-based ink, which sticks preferentially to the hardened (drier) areas. The result is a positive image in the color of the ink. As with other forms of printmaking, the ink application requires considerable skill, and no two prints are identical. Multicolor oil prints are possible through local inking of the print, and it is also possible to create reverse prints by contact- printing the wet oil print to a piece of plain paper. Artists have also sometimes created variations by applying extra paint using brushes. In the later 19th century, it was possible to buy commercially prepared gelatin- coated paper. Bromoil process The bromoil process is a variation on the oil print process that allows for enlargements.\\"Oil Printing: Updating a Classic Process\\" In 1907, E. J. Wall described how it should theoretically be possible to place a negative in an enlarger to produce a larger silver bromide positive, which would then be bleached, hardened, and inked following the oil print process. That same year C. Welborne Piper worked out the practical details. Much as Wall envisioned it, the bromoil process starts with a normally developed print exposed onto a silver-bromide paper that is then chemically bleached, hardened, and fixed. When the still-moist print is inked, the hardest (driest) areas take up the most ink while the wettest areas become the highlights. An issue with the bromoil process is that inadequate rinsing of the chrome salts can lead to discoloration of the prints when exposed to light over long periods of time. In addition, irregularities in the thickness of the gelatin layer can, under unfavorable conditions, lead to stresses that damage the pictorial (ink) layer. A version of the bromoil process was developed to produce full-color prints in the 1930s before commercial color film was developed. This technique requires three matching negatives of the subject, each made on Ilford Hypersensitive Panchromatic plates and shot through a blue, green, and red filter. The developed plates are enlarged and printed onto separate pieces of bromide-silver photographic paper, which are then bleached and hardened in the usual manner. The three prints are then inked with a firm bromoil ink, yellow on the blue-filtered print, red on the green-filtered print, and blue on the red-filtered print. The three inked prints are then treated as printing plates and passed through an etching press that will transfer the ink to a new piece of paper or cloth, reversing the image in the process. Care must be taken to maintain exact registration of the three plates.

He was a legal counsel to public school boards, arguing against the integration of black students in Virginia. Early life Collins Denny was born on June 10, 1899, in Nashville, Tennessee. His father, Collins Denny, was a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. His mother was Lucy Chase Chapman. He had four sisters. Denny and his family moved to Richmond, Virginia, in 1910, when he was eleven years old. Denny was educated in private schools in Richmond. He began attending Princeton University, joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in July 1918. Although he was sent to Europe, Denny never saw combat in World War I before the war ended. Upon discharge, Denny returned to Princeton, graduated in 1921, and then traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to attend the University of Virginia School of Law. He received a LLB degree in 1924. Career Upon admission to the Virginia bar, Denny begun his legal career at the Richmond law firm of Wellford and Taylor. In 1926, he and Charles S. Valentine established a law firm that later became known as Denny, Valentine and Davenport. John R. Saunders appointed Denny Assistant Attorney General in 1930, and he served until 1934. Denny and his father opposed the unification of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and the Methodist Episcopal Church, foreseeing that such would endanger racial segregation. Despite Denny's evidence in the 1930 church trial of re-unification proponent Rev. James Cannon (actually for misusing church money to support Al Smith for President, for which Cannon was acquitted), and their 1937 pamphlet entitled An Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion Concerning Methodist Unification, unification occurred in 1939, forming the Methodist Church (USA). Denny personally refused to join the new entity, and unsuccessfully argued for the right of a breakaway South Carolina congregation to continue to use the Methodist Episcopal Church, South appellation. In 1949, Denny defended the right of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to segregate their trains. However, federal Judge Charles Sterling Hutcheson rejected Denny's attempt to disqualify all jurors who were members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. A vocal opponent of the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education as well as member of Byrd Organization, Denny advised the public school boards of Surry County, Virginia, Powhatan County, Virginia and Prince Edward County, Virginia when they refused to accept black students. Denny co- founded and became counsel for the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties, a pro-segregationist organization. In 1956, Denny met with Virginia governor Thomas B. Stanley and helped devise the Massive Resistance strategy opposing the Brown decisions, including what became known as the Stanley Plan which included not only public voucher support for segregation academies (private schools which only accepted white pupils), but also gave the governor power to close any school which integrated (whether voluntarily pursuant to decisions of a local school board or because of a court order). The Prince Edward County schools had remained closed for more than four years rather than accept integration when the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Denny hoped to argue the case for segregation in March 1964, but died in January (so John Segar Gravatt handled the segregationist argument, which the Supreme Court not only rejected, but strongly rebuked in its May, 1964 opinion). Denny also served on the Boards of Directors of the Richmond Federal Savings and Loan Association, the Miller Manufacturing Company, and Mason- Hagan. Personal life Denny married Rebecca Smith Miller on September 10, 1932, in Brandy Station, Virginia. They had two sons, Collins Denny III and Clifford Miller Denny. They resided in Powhatan County, Virginia. Denny was a member of The Commonwealth Club, a private gentlemen's club in Richmond, and the Country Club of Virginia, a golf club. He was also a member of the Richmond German Club. Death and legacy After years of poor health, Denny died on January 14, 1964, at home in Powhatan County, Virginia. He was buried in Richmond's Hollywood cemetery, with instructions that contributions be made both to the white Virginia Education Fund and also to an organization that educated some black students during the closure, the Prince Edward Free School Association.

It was written by Yahlin Chang and Ted Sullivan, and directed by Thor Freudenthal. The episode centers on Kara dealing with babysitting Cat Grant's son while on vacation while tackling a series of attempted bombings that threatens National City. Plot Flying around National City, Supergirl destroys a drone following her. She suspects Hank is watching her, but he denies it, and Alex tells Kara to trust him. When Cat receives an award but must go to Metropolis for the event, Kara volunteers to babysit her son Carter. James discovers Lucy has come to National City to pursue him. An explosion sends Supergirl racing to a skyscraper, saving it from collapsing. Alex tells Hank that the drone belongs to Lord Technologies. They confront Maxwell about the drone and the explosion, but he is uncooperative. Hank instructs Alex to keep on eye on Maxwell, who explains his dislike for Supergirl. At CatCo, news of Supergirl saving the building gets the attention of Carter, who is a big fan. At Lord Technologies, Alex calls Kara after discovering a bomb in the building. Carrying the bomb into the atmosphere when it detonates, Kara is knocked unconscious into the ocean. Waking up at the DEO, Kara realizes she forgot about Carter. Kara confirms to Lucy that James is not seeing anyone, and convinces James to fight for love. Lucy returns to see James, and they kiss. The DEO learns that a former employee of Lord Technologies, Ethan Knox, is behind the bombs. When Max learns that the launch of his new rail system is the next target, he refuses the DEO's help ‚Äì his parents were scientists killed due to poor safety conditions, leading to his distrust of government agencies. Left in Winn's care, Carter disappears. A decoy bomb is planted at the airport, but Kara is fixated on finding Ethan as Carter, looking for Supergirl, is pushed onto the train. Spotting Ethan aboard the train, Supergirl orders everyone else to another train car. She tries to reason with Ethan, who claims he is acting on behalf of his daughter and activates another bomb. Supergirl disconnects the car from the rest of the train, saving everyone before Ethan blows himself up. At the DEO, Kara helps Alex defuse the fail-safe in the decoy bomb. Cat learns that Carter met Supergirl, and refuses to let Kara watch him again. Kara catches James and Lucy kissing. Supergirl visits to Maxwell's penthouse, suspecting he had been paying Ethan's daughter's medical expenses, and used the bombings and drones to test her. Maxwell denies this, but Supergirl says she will be watching him. Release This episode was originally scheduled to air November 16, 2015, but due to the November 2015 Paris attacks, it was pulled because the content in the episode was similar to the events. As a result of this move, CBS moved the episode \\"Livewire\\" up to November 16, 2015. Reception Ratings The episode attracted 1,021,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 2nd most watched programme on Sky One for the week. Critical response Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called the episode a \\"dud\\".\\"Supergirl: How Does She Do It?\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 23, 2015) Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of 10, saying, ‚Äú'How Does She Do It?' is a pretty dull episode of television by any standard, and unfortunately Benoist and a few funny lines aren‚Äôt enough to save it. There are too many characters getting a lot of screen time (and Cat not getting enough) without enough presence to keep them interesting, storylines that we‚Äôre not invested in, and action that‚Äôs not exciting. This episode would have been better left unaired\\".

She is an associate professor, principal research fellow, and head of the Developmental Psychobiology Laboratory at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, Australia. Kim is an active science communicator, and has given public lectures at TEDx Melbourne, Australian Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Victorian Science Week, City of Melbourne (Melbourne Conversations), and the Wheeler Centre. She has also interviewed for ABC Radio, Radio New Zealand, SBS TV, Channel 10 (The Project), and was featured on ABC Catalyst.  Research  Kim's research has demonstrated that the acquisition and retrieval of fear memories is different across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and that fear memories are able to be erased early in life. Kim's research uses rodent models that closely resemble human behaviors to understand the neurobiological basis of those behaviors. Specifically, her work investigates the role of memory and forgetting in the development and treatment of two major mental disorders across childhood and adolescence: anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. To study anxiety, the Kim laboratory employs a classical conditioning paradigm based on the work of Ivan Pavlov known as fear conditioning. Despite originating 100 years ago, this model is widely used by modern scientists to uncover the neural mechanisms of fear and anxiety. To investigate substance abuse the Kim laboratory uses an operant conditioning paradigm based on the work of B. F. Skinner known as intravenous self-administration. Kim's research especially focuses on extinction, a form of inhibitory learning that forms the basis of exposure- based therapies for both anxiety and addiction disorders. Kim has 55 original publications to date, and her work has been cited in other publications over 2000 times.  Career  Kim completed her undergraduate degree at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2004, graduating with the University Medal in Psychology. She completed her PhD in psychology in 2008 at UNSW, during which time she published six original scientific articles. After graduating, Kim worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at UNSW, and then the University of Michigan. Kim then gained a position as a Senior Research Officer at the Florey Institute, before becoming head of the Developmental Psychobiology Laboratory at the institute.

He is best known for his groundbreaking reporting on the emerging HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s and its impact on the LGBT community at that time. Schmalz himself was a gay man who paved the way for other gay reporters at the Times in an era when homosexuality was more heavily stigmatized in the newsroom and the country as a whole. He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1990 and died of AIDS-related complications on November 6, 1993, at the age of 39. He had booked a dinner at a restaurant in lower Manhattan for his 40th birthday party. Instead, the party became a memorial gathering held on December 6, 1993. Schmalz's reporting on AIDS includes in-depth profiles of well-known people with HIV/AIDS like Mary Fisher, Magic Johnson, and Larry Kramer. His work is recounted in the December 2015 book and radio documentary \\"Dying Words: The AIDS Reporting of Jeff Schmalz and How It Transformed The New York Times\\", by Samuel G. Freedman.  Early life  Schmalz was born and raised in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. His parents split up when he was two. His father was an alcoholic who died when Jeff was a teenager. His mother worked at the local Sears and raised Jeff and his sister Wendy with the help of family nearby. Jeff worked on his high school newspaper and graduated valedictorian. He received a scholarship for fatherless sons to attend Columbia University in New York City in 1971. He studied economics, and considered law school before he began working at The New York Times.  Career  Schmalz's career began in January 1973 at The New York Times where he worked as a night copy boy while attending Columbia. He was 19 years old. When he was promoted to a copy editor position, he dropped out of college. Later, Schmalz worked as a metropolitan news reporter and a regional editor before being named chief of the paper's Albany bureau in 1986, where he chronicled the early years of New York Governor Mario Cuomo's rise to prominence. In 1988, The New York Times sent Schmalz to Miami, where he served as bureau chief before returning to New York two years later as deputy national editor under Soma Golden Behr. In October of that year, Schmalz, while still in the closet to his bosses at the Times, wrote an article about how AIDS discrimination affected the lives of the Ray brothers in Arcadia, Florida.  AIDS diagnosis  On the afternoon of Friday, December 21, 1990, Schmalz had a seizure and collapsed working at his desk at The New York Times. By February, his doctors had determined Schmalz had AIDS. His T cell count was just two and he had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a brain disease that is often fatal within months. He told his editors about his illness and took a health leave for about seven months. He responded well to AZT and returned to The New York Times just after Labor Day in 1991. He decided to cover the 1992 presidential campaign.  AIDS Reporting  While Schmalz covered the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, he started to figure out the way he wanted to cover AIDS. In June 1992, he wrote his first post-diagnosis article about the disease, a profile piece on dermatologist Marcus Conant, one of the first U.S. doctors to diagnose and treat AIDS back in 1981. The New Yorker wrote an article about Schmalz and his work on October 5, 1992 and one month later he discussed his career and his illness during an appearance on Charlie Rose. On December 20, 1992, Schmalz wrote a first-person story for The New York Times titled, \\"Covering AIDS and Living with It: A Reporter's Testimony.\\" This first-person journalism was new for Schmalz, who had been a consummate Timesman focused on objectivity and non-biased reporting. In his first-person piece, Schmalz wrote about waking up with nightmares where he was in a coffin, about his mother's death after she learned he had AIDS, and his sense of being completely alone. In New York magazine, Edwin Diamon profiled Schmalz in the May 24, 1993 issue. The article, Out of the Closet: The Times New Gay Voice. Schmalz's last pre-mortem Times article ‚Äì a profile of author and person with AIDS Harold Brodkey ‚Äì ran on June 17, 1993. ABC News aired a profile of Schmalz called \\"A Reporter's Notebook\\" on its TV news show Day One on October 11, 1993. Schmalz's partner, Louis Broman, died of AIDS on March 27, 1995. The couple met in an AIDS support group.  Legacy  On November 28, 1993, three weeks after Schmalz' death, The New York Times Magazine ran Schmalz's final article \\"Whatever Happened to AIDS?\\" and President Bill Clinton mentioned Schmalz and the article in his December 1, 1993 address on World AIDS Day at Georgetown University Medical Center. Schmalz was memorialized publicly at a memorial service held at the Dalton School in New York City on December 7, 1993, with eulogies by Soma Golden Behr, Peter Kaufman, Anna Quindlen, Mary Fisher, Larry Kramer and David W. Dunlap. In addition to Mary Fisher, Magic Johnson, and Larry Kramer, Schmalz profiled many famous people who had HIV and/or AIDS, some who ultimately died from the disease, including journalist Randy Shilts, child advocate and activist Elizabeth Glaser, writer Harold Brodkey, attorney Thomas Stoddard, and AIDS and environmental activist Bob Hattoy.

She is the owner and perfumer for The Virginia Perfume Company. Education Heaton received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1994, and her Master of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2000. She was awarded a Jacob K. Javits Fellowship to attend the Master of Fine Arts program at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. Heaton went on to study at the MIT Media Lab and graduated with a MS from MIT in 2000. The subject of her Master's thesis was \\"physical pixels\\", a sculptural effort to liberate computer graphics from the flat screen of a computer monitor. Heaton's suite of prototypes included the \\"Digital Palette\\" for sequencing loops of colored-light animation, and \\"Peano\\", a system of reconfigurable blocks, each of which behaved as an RGB pixel. In 2001, her thesis work was awarded the L'Oreal Promotion Prize in the Art and Science of Color. Career In the early 2000s, Heaton developed a reputation for complex, obsessive and often humorous installations involving technology. During her time at the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies, she worked with engineer Steven Gray to create her first major sculpture: \\"The Pool\\" of \\"Reflection Loop\\", a large concave slab embedded with 400 reprogrammed Furby dolls arranged in the pattern of water molecules. The Furby dolls were altered to mirror the presence of a viewer, creating a noisy, amusing and weird reflection of the audience until the robotic toys eventually \\"died\\" from excessive use. \\"Reflection Loop\\" was selected for the 2001 Annual Exhibition of the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, Heaton was offered her first solo exhibition in New York at Bitforms gallery. Heaton went on to numerous shows and residencies, including the now-defunct Art Interactive in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and Department of Information Science and Information Studies at Duke University. In 2003, Heaton's installation \\"Live Pelt\\" premiered at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City. The central piece of the show was a coat (\\"The Surrogate\\") made from 64 used Tickle Me Elmo dolls that Heaton \\"trapped\\" on online auction while documenting every detail of her transactions with other eBay members. The acquired Elmo dolls were eviscerated for their furry pelts and laughing electronics, all of which Heaton re-engineered into a coat that giggles and quivers when touched, like a surrogate lover. Filmmakers Shambhavi Kaul and Joshua Gibson collaborated with Heaton to document the various personalities of her process. In early 2004, Heaton moved to Switzerland where she lived and worked until 2009 as a part-time innovation consultant for the Diabetes Care division of Roche Diagnostics. During this time, she co-authored several patents related to methods of data visualization for continuous glucose data. Heaton also taught herself analog electrical engineering and developed another body of work, \\"The Parallel Series\\". Heaton's 2015 exhibition, \\"Pollination\\" involved sculpture, electronics, perfume, and mixed media art. The exhibition included \\"The Beekeeper\\", a floor-to-ceiling kinetic sculpture that Heaton referred to as \\"an energetic self-portrait\\". A self-taught perfumer, Heaton has created several fragrances, including \\"Smells Like Weeds (The Queen of Hungry Spirits)\\", a perfume made using bee-friendly plants; and \\"Smells Like Money (Hungry Spirits)\\", a perfume extracted from hundreds of dollar bills using the labor-intensive method of cold enfleurage. In 2014, Heaton founded The Virginia Perfume Company to create authentic, small-batch perfumes based on old-world techniques. Personal life Heaton lives in Virginia with her husband and stepchildren.

It has been described by The Guardian newspaper as \\"the biggest picture frame on the planet,‚Äù however is also controversial as the \\"biggest stolen building of all time.‚Äù The project was conceived by Fernando Donis, and selected as the winner of a design competition by the Government of Dubai. It is alleged that the designer had his intellectual property stolen and was denied credit for the design. It holds the record for the largest frame in the world. Architecture competition The design was selected as the winner of the 2009 ThyssenKrupp Elevator International Award from 926 proposals. Participants from all over the world were invited to submit an emblem that would promote ‚Äúthe new face for Dubai\\". It is near the Star Gate of Zabeel Park and stands at and 95.53 m wide. The ThyssenKrupp Elevator Architecture Award is an international architecture competition first held in 1988 and sponsored by one of the world's leading elevator companies. An international panel of judges selected the winning idea from among 926 design proposals to create a Tall Emblem Structure for Dubai. The original jury consisted of 11 international architects ‚Äî a former and current chairman of the International Union of Architects (UIA) and the regional chairman of ThyssenKrupp Elevator. Dubai Municipality‚Äôs director general and H.H. Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum were listed as ‚Äòhonorary‚Äô jurors. Dubai frame Donis' design was ultimately selected, for which he won an AED 367329.70 ($100,000) prize. According to Donis, when designing the structure he saw Dubai as a city full of emblems and rather than adding another one, they proposed to frame them all: to frame the city. Instead of building a massive structure, the purpose of the proposal was to build a void of 150 meters by 105 meters to continuously frame the development of the past, current and future Dubai. To become the structure that celebrates yet constrains the city. Design The Dubai Frame is created out of glass, steel, aluminum, and reinforced concrete. It is positioned in such a way that representative landmarks of modern Dubai can be seen on one side, while from the other side, visitors can also view older parts of the city. The Frame opened in January 2018. Lawsuit In December 2016, the architect Fernando Donis filed suit in US court against the Municipality of Dubai and ThyssenKrupp Elevator. In his suit, Donis claims that he has not received either a contract or compensation for his design, despite it being currently under construction. As of 2018, the architect and the Municipality of Dubai were engaged in a legal dispute over ownership of the copyright for the building.

The controversies primarily concern portrayal of North Korea and the description of the regime of the South Korean president and dictator Park Chung-hee. Historical context The controversy's origins can be traced at least to 2013, when South Korea's Ministry of Education instructed publishers to revise their history textbooks. In 2015 the South Korean National Institute of Korean History announced plans to replace existing history textbooks in high schools with one authorized version by March 2017. The state-issued textbooks are to be written by a government-appointed panel of experts. In the larger context, this controversy is a part of an ongoing dispute on whether the state should control the content of history textbooks, and possibly enforce a monopoly, or whether individual schools (or teachers) should be free to choose their own textbooks. South Korea used to have state control over textbooks until the rules were relaxed in 2003 leading to the appearance of several competing textbooks used since, particularly since 2010. Criticisms Existing textbooks have been criticized by the government as well as by the Korean right or conservative side for being too positive on North Korean topics, and for \\"liberal, left-leaning\\" bias. On the other hand, the left, also described as liberals and progressives, represented among others by The Hankyoreh newspaper, are critical of the changes such as removing any mentions of the Geochang massacre and excluding photos of the first North‚ÄìSouth summit, which they have described as biased towards a conservative view of history and the state that lends legitimacy to the pre- democratic, authoritarian, conservative governments. In particular, the regime of Park Chung-hee, the father of the then current Korean president, Park Geun- hye, is seen by liberals as given a \\"white-wash\\" treatment by the new revisions. The conservatives rebuke that the current textbooks describe Park Chung-hee and his predecessor, Rhee Syng-man, in an excessively negative manner. Other controversial topics involve the framing of the pro-democratic protests against Park's regime, or the inclusion of the story of Korean teenage heroine Yu Gwan-sun. Liberals had also criticized the action on the grounds that the government control over textbooks is limiting freedom of speech and spreading propaganda. As of October 22, 2015, a petition against the new textbook reform had over 50,000 signatures. The government has also been facing several lawsuits, including one by the current textbook authors who accuse the government of libel. The plan has been described as controversial, and has led to public protests. Over 400 Korean history professors have expressed their opposition to the proposal. Outside Korea, the proposal has been criticized by over 200 professors of Korean studies. An opinion poll showed the Korean public opinion divided into approximately 50% against the new textbook plan, and 36% in favor. Several commentators compared this to the comfort women issue, noting that with the recent government interference into the content of history books, South Korea is losing its moral high ground from which it previously criticized the Japanese government for its perceived historical textbook problems.

The Cathedral sat alone near the banks of the River Golo some three miles from the sea, in the midst of fields. History Church of S.

He admits, however, that neither the time nor the circumstances of the martyrdom are known. the existence of a Saint Petreius, Bishop of Mariana and martyr, for whom a shrine was built by a certain Ugo Colonna of Rome, according to the Sacra Corsicae Chronica of Salvatore Vitale. Giuseppe Cappelletti points out that Vitale is the only source of the story, but that Ugo Colonna built the Cathedral, which was dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and that San Petreio was a different church. He also notes that the Martyrologies do not report the existence of a bishop, a bishop and martyr, or just a martyr named Perseo or Petreio.Cappelletti, XVI, p. 366. Pius Gams both italicizes the name Perseus and puts it in parenthesis, indicating grave suspicion.Gams, Series episcoporum, p. 766. Ughelli then reports the existence of a Bishop Catanus, Corsicanus episcopus, who attended the Synod of Arles in 314. Neither the name nor the diocese of Mariana occurs, however, in the list of those who attended the Synod.J.D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima, Tomus secundus (2) (Florence 1759), pp. 476-477. Ughelli thirdly reports the existence of Bishop Leo of Corsica, on the authority of letters of Pope Gregory I and the Sacra Corsicae Chronica of Salvatore Vitale. Bishop Leo did exist, but Pope Gregory addresses him as episcopus in Corsica, bishop in Corsica, not bishop of Corsica.Gregory I, Epistolarum Liber I, no. 78 (sometimes numbered 76), in: J. P. Migne (ed.), Patrologiae Latinae Tomus LXXVII (Paris 1862), pp. 532-533. Leo had been sent by the Pope as an Apostolic Visitor, since, as the Pope notes, the dioceses of Corsica had long been vacant.Gregory (Epistles I, no. 80; Migne, p. 533) writes to the clergy and nobility of Corsica: Gregorius clero et nobilibus Corsicae a paribus. Etsi vos multo iam tempore sine pontifice esse Dei ecclesiae non doletis, nos tamen de eius regimine cogitare et suscepti cura compellit officii.... He announces that he is sending a second bishop to work with Bishop Leo, \\"Martinum fratrem et coepiscopum nostrum ibidem cardinalem constituere sacerdotem, Leoni vero fratri et coepiscopo nostro operam eius visitationis iniungere. The fourteenth century was a period of extreme crisis in Corsica. Roger Caratini notes that the population of ordinary people on the island had decreased by 8% between 1300 and 1350, mostly by migration to the territory of Pisa; then came the Black Death; between 1350 and 1400 the population decreased another 19%. The ability to maintain traditional institutions in the face of the new Genoese overlords was greatly compromised. In 1453 Pope Nicholas V entered into a verbal agreement with the Republic of Genoa, which specified that, although the Pope maintained the exclusive right to appoint bishops on the Island of Corsica, he would appoint only Genoese subjects who were acceptable to the Government. The Genoese government turned the island over to the administration of the Genoese Banco di S. Giorgio, under new statutes for Corsica were issued, the Capitula Corsorum, which specified that bishops on the island had to be natives of the island. In 1464, however, the Republic of Genoa came under the domination of the Duchy of Milan, and it was the Milanese who decided appointments. In 1479 the Milanese were compelled to evacuate Corsica, and their regulations were nullified. In 1563, considering the extreme poverty of the diocese of S. Pietro de Accia, which could no longer support a bishop, Pope Pius IV joined the diocese with the diocese of Mariana, with the new title of Bishop of Mariana and Accia. During the French Revolution, the National Constituent Assembly reformed the Church in France, drawing up the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (12 July 1790).Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English) Retrieved: 2016-11-13. All clergy were obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, thereby effectively entering into a schism with the Papacy and the Roman Catholic Church. The number of bishoprics in France was dramatically reduced. The five bishoprics on the island of Corsica were suppressed and combined into one, to be called the dioc√®se de Corse. When the electors of Corsica assembled, they elected Ignace-Fran√ßois Guasco, Provost (or Dean) of the Cathedral Chapter of Mariana as their 'Constitutional Bishop'. The canonical bishop Verclos made his protest and fled to the mainland of Italy. Guasco was consecrated at Aix on 16 June 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Charles-Beno√Æt Roux, Metropolitan of Bouches-de-Rh√¥ne; the consecration was valid but illicit and schismatic. On 11 August 1793, judging that the territory of Corse was too large, the National Convention in the Constitution of 1793 divided both the department and the diocese of Corse into two, Golo (Guasco, resident at Ajaccio) and Liamone, and ordered a second bishop to be elected for the northern and eastern part of the island. Before this could be done, however, the British seized the island, and on 23 December 1793, Guasco recanted and resigned. Bishop Verclos immediately returned to Corsica. In November 1801, the decision was taken by Pope Pius VII in implementing the Concordat of 1801 not to alter the situation in Corsica which had been imposed by the French Revolution. All of the dioceses remained suppressed, with the exception of Ajaccio, which had been the center of the 'Constitutional Bishop of Corse' and which was coincidentally the birthplace of the First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte. In April 2002 the title Bishop of Mariana in Corsica (though not the diocesan apparatus) was revived.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy, Mariana in Corsica (titular see), retrieved: 2016-11-15.

The property was designed by Warren and Wetmore, architects of the Helmsley Building and Grand Central Terminal. It is one of the most expensive retail and office space locations in the United States. History The Crown Building was originally known as the Heckscher Building, designed by architects Warren and Wetmore and completed in 1921. The building stands 26 stories (416 feet) high. The name was changed to the Crown Building in 1983, attributing its crown-like look when illuminated at night. The building was purchased in 1981 by then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Marcos used international companies to purchase the building secretly, also obtaining help from Ralpy and Joseph Bernstein as well as Adnan Khashoggi. The Crown Building was the focus of various lawsuits after the fall of the Marcos regime. Numerous parties, including the Philippine government, claimed rights to it. Lawsuits claimed that Marcos entered into various agreements for the building or purchased it with money that was not his. The parties involved agreed to sell the building and split the proceeds in excess of the $89 million mortgage. Bernard Spitzer acquired the building in 1991 for $95 million. His son and former Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer took over the property after his father's death in 2014. The building was scheduled for auction in late 2014, with Jeff Sutton and General Growth Properties stepping in prior to the auction to purchase the building. The cost was $1.75 billion and included both the 400,000 square-foot tower and of retail space on the ground floor of the building. In 2015, the building was again acquired, this time by Michael Shvo in partnership with Vladislav Doronin. General Growth Properties and Wharton properties acquired the retail part of the building. The $1.8 billion purchase was one of the largest in New York City real estate history. It is anticipated that the property will be converted and redeveloped into luxury residences.

In 1779 it was named after its founder Prokofi Demidov. In 1800 it was separated from the Home and moved to St. Petersburg. In 1904 it received Imperial status and officially ceased its existence in 1918 but de facto it continued working. In 1931, it served as the foundation for Leningrad Training Mechanics and Technology Refrigeration Plant, which later became the St. Petersburg State University of Refrigeration and Food Processing Technologies.  History   1772‚Äì1800, Moscow Period  The first director of the College, Ivan Betskoi in 1776‚Äì1777 In 1772, Prokofi Akinfiyevich Demidov turned to Catherine II with a suggestion to open as part of the Moscow Foundling Home an \\"Educational School for Children from Merchant Families for Commerce.\\" A regular donor to the Foundling home, he donated 205,000 rubles for education of merchant children. Head of the Foundling Home Ivan Betskoy was tasked with developing the curriculum. The top priority was given to shaping students' personalities while obtaining knowledge of commerce came second. On 6 December 1772 the plan was approved, marking the founding date of the school. Every three years the school accepted six-year-old boys who stayed there till they were of age at 20‚Äì21 years old. Education was free. Graduation certificates were given only to those who'd completed to the entire course. At first finding enough students was a challenge, since only merchants' children were accepted. Merchants considered it unprofitable to send away their children for 15 years when could have spent that time teaching them at their own companies.Baranenko, p.10 Ivan Betskoi in 1773 sent to the school from St. Petersburg 17 boys, and the following year came three more. Only seven out of twenty children were merchants, one was the son of a freedman of the peasant, the other were from the petty bourgeoisie. They were mostly orphans who lived with distant relatives. 15 people have completed the course. Students were divided by age, and each group had its own set of classes with a different number of allocated hours: * 6‚Äì9 year olds ‚Äì ‚Äúlearning faith,‚Äù manners, reading (including in foreign languages,) drawing, dancing, writing and basic counting. * 9‚Äì12 year olds ‚Äì additional courses included arithmetic, geometry, history, geography, Slavic language, and depending on their talents singing and musical instruments. * 12‚Äì15 year olds ‚Äì mathematics and mechanics, navigation and seafaring, other languages, speech, accounting, basics of commerce, additional classes such as gardening and home building. * 15‚Äì18 year olds ‚Äì advanced classes in commerce and accounting, law, economics, arts. * 18‚Äì21 year olds ‚Äì religion studies, theoretical classes were replaced with internships and first deals.Baranenko, p.8-9 In 1779 by the order of Catherine II the school was renamed after Demidov and bared its name up until its move to St. Petersburg in 1800.Baranenko, p.11 During the 27 years of the Moscow period, the school had 9 freshmen groups, and out of 239 original students only 46 graduated. Most of them were children of impoverished merchants, but two were children of government officials (in 1779). The Moscow period was complicated. The students had to share housing facilities with the orphans. Caretakers looked after everybody and there weren‚Äôt enough teachers. Periodically teachers from Moscow University showed up but didn't stay long. After the death of Catherine II in 1796, Pavel I named his wife Maria Fedorovna \\"Head of the Society for Education of Noble Maidens\\" and on 2 May 1797 she took over supervision of Moscow and St. Petersburg Foundling homes. Almost instantly she decided to move the Commercial College to St. Petersburg, closer to her, and to separate it from the Home. She also ordered to start its library. The last Moscow graduation took place in 1799. Graduates got certificates and the more successful ones received medals. Each graduate also was awarded 100 roubles to get started ‚Äì these moneys up until 1828 were funded personally by the empress Maria Fedorovna.  1800‚Äì1917. St. Petersburg Period  After moving to St. Petersburg, the College took over the Italian Palace on the Fontanka River and in 1801 it moved to a two-story building on the corner of Zagorodny Prospect and Chernyshov Pereulok.Baranenko, p.12 The College's Council was appointed by the Empress and it was an honor to be invited even if somewhat burdensome. The members were expected not just participate in management but also invest their own funds in repairs, books and general student upkeep. They could only leave the position with an explicit permission by the Empress.Baranenko, p.14 After the move, the directorship was awarded to . He put together the first documentation about the College.Baranenko, p.18 Starting in 1810, the directorship goes to . Without higher education or pedagogical experience, he'd been fired from Preobrazhenski Regiment in the rank of major. He was a rather successful in his position as the director.Baranenko, p.19 From 1818 to 1827 the director was , a lawyer and philosopher. He had previous experience as a director of universities of Lviv and Krakow.Baranenko, p.20-21 The admission rules also changed at the new location. Now the College accepted 60 boys for free (instead of 100) and the rest had to pay for their tuition. Education lasted six years. From 61 students moved from Moscow, 58 graduated.Baranenko, p.21 The challenging part was the condition of acceptance for free: graduates had to commit to doing commerce for life. Parents signed an agreement that their children would stay in merchants forever, no matter what class they belong to previously. In 1811, the Council turned to Emperor Alexander I with a petition to allow graduates to determine their own choices but only in 1822 the life-long commitment was abolished and changed for a 10-year term for mandatory involvement into any kind of commerce.Baranenko, p.26 The College kept in close contact with the Home, provided boarding for students, but many parents had reservations about letting their children out of their sight for too long. Some of that was because of persisting class differences: as a somewhat charity establishment, the College couldn‚Äôt provide any social guarantees for its graduates. But its specialization was training people with European views. It was supported by successful Russian entrepreneurs who thus were raising their future employees. Photo pre- revolutionary building of Imperial Commercial College on Lomonosov st. In 1834 the number of students reached 200, the staff also grew, and the Council asked Emperor Nikolas I to allow to build a new three-story building on Chernishev Pereulok. It was completed in 1838.Baranenko, p.34 The College had been under the patronage of emperors for a long time and was opposed to moving under the management of the Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Finance (which in the second half of the 19th century started training staff for its offices in its own commercial colleges not just in the capitals but in smaller towns too.)Huceeva, p.6 As the result no ministry could prove the need to restructure the College.Huceeva, p.20 Under the patronage of the state and mostly working with its support, the College was tasked with training business people for the betterment of the country. But still its graduates even with European-quality education could only get mid- range positions in commerce. To start their own businesses they would need startup capital that most of them didn't have.Huceeva, p.17-18 The best group was between 1820 ‚Äì 1850, when the graduates took positions in joint-stock companies, banks, etc.Huceeva, p.19 In 1841 the position of a director was replaced by a trustee. The first trustee (only for a year) was Prince Oldenburgsky, while patronage remained with Empress Aleskandra Fedorovna, wife of Nikolai I.Baranenko, p.39 That same year, the College also changed its Charter and the length of education. The course lasted seven years and the overall number of subjects was cut from 22 ‚Äì 29 (depending on age) to 16.Baranenko, p.41 In 1830-40s Russia needed mechanics and engineers, which was reflected in the curriculum. In January 1843, education in the last years was augmented with chemistry, mechanics and drafting. It became mandatory to have an internship both at commercial companies and manufacturing facilities of St. Petersburg.Baranenko, p.42 The building today In 1870‚Äì80 Russia experienced a boost that resulted from the abolition of serfdom. After a two- year directorship (1860‚Äì1862) by Tibo-Brioniol, the new director (till 1880) became M. Bogoyavlenski. During his tenure the College canceled the mandatory ten-year commitment to commerce after graduation.Baranenko, p.51 The College needed new space. In 1866, a competition was called for projects of a new building. The building in Romanesque style designed by was started in 1869 and finished in 1871. Admissions criteria and curriculum changed once again: now the College accepted 9-10-year-old boys, and the course lasted eight years.Baranenko, p.54-56 The school year for all grades started in the second half of August. The new curriculum included new classes in engineering and technologies. Students were expected to know about the origins of goods, their chemical and physical characteristics, the level of their quality. In the course on commodities, much time was spent on technologies for processing and storing foodstuffs. Later these courses played an important role in the establishment of the Institute of Refrigeration and Food Processing. On 14 December 1904 the St. Petersburg Commercial College gained the status of Imperial.Baranenko, p.63 Vladimir Aleksandrovich Wagner was its director from 1906 till October Revolution.Baranenko, p.68 Between 1906 and 1910 the number of graduates decreased while the number of teachers increased. By the Civil War the number of students from peasantry. During the War, the budget decreased and there were no more students from the most militarized area of the country ‚Äì the Don Host Oblast ‚Äì by January 1917. In February 1917 Nikolas II renounced the throne. Vladimir Lenin and other Bolsheviks were convinced that specialized commerce education wasn't necessary, The number of commercial establishments was reached 370 by the end of 1917, including schools, trade schools, classes and courses, but the College survived and never stopped classes.Huceeva, p.21 Until June 1918 the College was under the Commission for Social Help of the Petrograd Soviet and on 14 June it was moved to the Commission on Public Education of the Northern Workers. It was said that that year the College seized its existence, but the St. Petersburg Central Historical Archives have documents citing admissions in 1919, 1920 and 1924. In the early 1920s the building of the College was given to an evening school.Huceeva, p.23 In 1931, the Council of People's Commissars of USSR opened in the College's former building a Leningrad Teaching Mechanics and Technology Refrigeration Plant that became the State University of Refrigeration and Food Processing Technologies. It lasted for 80 years and in 2011 was joined with ITMO University. The building for the plant was a nod to the old Commercial College, which was among the few institutions in pre- revolutionary Russia to train specialists in refrigeration.

Pornography in China is strictly prohibited under Chinese criminal law. Those producing, disseminating, or selling sexually explicit material may be sentenced to life imprisonment. There is an ongoing campaign against \\"spiritual pollution\\", the term referencing the Chinese Communist party's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign of 1983. Although pornography is illegal, it is available via the Internet. Chinese authorities have closed down many pornographic services in recent years, but an ongoing cat and mouse game between the two has led providers and users to find other ways to share adult content, both self-made and pirated from other pornographic film studios. In this aspect the development of the nation's online porn industry reflects the overall development of China's Internet. Phases and forms of development Internet pornography was outlawed in China in 2002, when the authorities issued guidelines requiring that all websites remove any pornographic material. The government began to suppress pornographic websites in 2004, and one woman was imprisoned. Pornographic websites: 2004‚Äì2006 The first pornographic websites appeared in China before sites like YouPorn and Pornhub became popular in the West. A few major (though ill-fated) websites appeared in China during 2004, including \\"99 Erotica Forum\\" and \\"Erotica Juneday\\". Some of these websites are still in existence, but many have disappeared. The business model for these websites requires visitors to navigate through pay-per-click advertisements for sex toys, Viagra-esque pills, and online casinos before they can watch or download pornographic content. The websites typically offer a mix of domestic amateur pornography videos and pirated content from Japan, Europe and the US. They typically set up their servers overseas and frequently change their URLs to avoid being detected by the authorities. For some users, the quantity of advertisements on these websites can be uncomfortable and frustrating. Sometimes there is no pornographic content available after the advertisements have been navigated. The chance of picking up malware in the process is high. Hence some services in China charge a membership fee in return for greater reliability and fewer or no advertisements. However, in China the use of domestic bank accounts makes such websites vulnerable to the authorities. \\"99 Erotica\\" was among the first to be closed after having acquired more than 300,000 registered users within a year of its launch. In 2005 authorities sentenced its eleven workers, among them teachers and civil servants, to imprisonment ranging from three to twelve years for disseminating obscene material. In October 2006 authorities closed down \\"Erotica Juneday\\", which charged its highest-paying members 3,999 yuan (then around $490) a year, and sentenced founder Chen Hui to life imprisonment. Among those who complained about the harshness of the sentence was the sociologist Li Yinhe. She called on authorities to either repeal the pornography laws in China or stop pretending the nation enjoys freedom of expression. 2008 onwards Since 2008, the production of pornographic films has been banned. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television's prohibition on pornography has been complete, and the government has shown no signs of reversing its decision. Directors, producers, and actors involved in pornographic films have been barred from competing in any film competitions. Any film studio found in violation may have its license revoked. As a result of this action, adult films and media can only be obtained through the Internet or on the black market. Possession of pornography is punishable by up to 3 years in prison, a fine of , or up to life imprisonment for large underground distributors. In 2010 China shut down 60,000 pornographic websites and arrested almost 5,000 suspects.  Slang terms  Pornography collectors who have resources are called \\"old drivers\\" (), while sharing pornographic videos is referred to as \\"driving\\" (), the recipient of the content is known as a \\"car seat\\" () and pornography is \\"welfare\\" ().

Racing only as a three-year-old she won five of her eight races and was rated one of the best British fillies of her generation over middle and long distances. After winning three minor races in spring she finished second in the Ribblesdale Stakes and then recorded her first major win when taking the Lancashire Oaks at Haydock Park in July. In the following month she moved up to the highest class to win the Yorkshire Oaks over a field which included The Oaks winner Dunfermline. She was retired from racing after finishing fourth in the Prix Vermeille but had no success as a broodmare. Background Busaca was a bay mare with no white markings bred in France by the County Kildare-based Dollanstown Stud. She was sired by Busted who won the Eclipse Stakes and King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1967, a year in which he was voted British Horse of the Year. As a breeding stallion he sired many major winners including Bustino, Mtoto and Erins Isle. Busaca's dam Saraca was a top-class French racemare who won the Prix Vermeille and finished second in the Prix de Diane in 1969. She was a descendant of the influential broodmare Lost Soul, the ancestor of many leading turf performers including Hethersett, Doyoun and Neasham Belle. During her racing career, Busaca was owned by Marianne Esterhazy and trained by Peter Walwyn at Seven Barrows, near Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career 1977: three-year-old season Busaca was unraced as a two-year-old and began her racing career in the spring of 1977 by finishing unplaced in a seven furlong maiden race. She recorded her first win in a maiden over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and followed up in a minor event over one and a half miles at Salisbury Racecourse. She then completed a hat-trick when winning a handicap race over one and a half miles at Kempton Park Racecourse on 21 May, before being moved up in class for the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. The race saw her matched against Triple First, a filly who had won the May Hill Stakes and the Musidora Stakes before finishing fourth to Dunfermline in The Oaks. She proved the best of the British fillies, but was beaten four lengths into second place by the Irish-trained Nanticious. In July she faced four opponents in what appeared to be a weakly-contested race for the Group Three Lancashire Oaks at Haydock Park. Ridden by Pat Eddery, she started the 1/2 favourite, took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish, and won easily by four lengths from Olwyn. Later that month, the form of the race was boosted when Olwyn recorded an upset victory over Nanticious and six others in the Group One Irish Oaks (a race which had been considered as a target for Busaca). In August Busaca, with Eddery again in the saddle, started at odds of 5/1 for the Group One Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles on firm ground at York Racecourse. Her opponents included Dunfermline, Triple First (who had won the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood), Sassabunda (runner-up in the Irish Oaks), Royal Hive and the leading Polish three-year-old Konstelacja. Busaca was always among the leaders in a slowly-run race before going to the front half a mile from the finish. She stayed on strongly in the straight to win by a length from Royal Hive, with Dunfermline five lengths back in third. Busaca was then sent to France for the Group One Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 18 September. The race was won by the locally trained Kamicia, with Busaca losing out in a three-way photo-finish for second against Royal Hive and Fabuleux Jane. The unplaced fillies included Trillion, Nanticious and Olwyn. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1977, Busaca was rated the sixth-best three-year-old filly in Europe behind Dunfermline, Madelia, Trillion, Kamicia and Mrs McArdy. The independent Timeform organisation gave Busaca a rating of 122 in 1977, making her eleven pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year-old filly Dunfermline. In their annual Racehorses of 1977 they described her a strong filly, who would have done even better if campaigned over longer distances. Breeding record Busaca was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the Dollanstown Stud. She had very little success, producing two confirmed foals, neither of whom appeared on the racecourse: * Heeria, a bay filly, foaled in 1979, sired by Habitat. Unraced. * Elsaca, bay filly, 1983, by Ela- Mana-Mou. Unraced.

Kovaƒçeviƒá (; 1821‚Äì1883) was a Serbian teacher and activist. He has been described as one of the hardest working Serbian educational and national workers of the 19th century. He was born in Petrovaradin in 1821, into the large family of Kovaƒçeviƒá. His given name was Milovan, while his patronymic, noted as his middle initial, was Davidov (–ú–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –ö–æ–≤–∞—á–µ–≤–∏—õ). According to tradition their ancestors lived in Graƒçanica in Kosovo, which they left in the \\"Great Migration\\" under Patriarch Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá during the Great Turkish War (1690s), and settled in Bosnia. In 1858, he left for Pristina, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now Kosovo). In 1858 or 1859, Kovaƒçeviƒá and merchant Dane Filipoviƒá founded the Serbian school in Pristina. At that time there were eight Turkish schools in the town. In the mid-19th century, the most notable Serbian educators (as founders of secular schools) in \\"Old Serbia\\" (part of the Ottoman Empire) were Nikola Musulin in Prizren, Kovaƒçeviƒá in Pristina, and Sava Deƒçanac and Milan Popoviƒá in Peƒá. In 1868, he moved to Vranje, which was under Ottoman rule and where Bulgarian propaganda started to spread. He employed his earlier student Zarija as his assistant. After the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78), the Ottoman military court in Pristina made it hard for the Ottoman Serbs; apart from the Prizren region, the old schools that worked under the wing of the Russian consulate were closed down, and the teachers fled or were imprisoned. Those few that managed to stay open, were stripped of all curriculum but literacy, to be taught without books. After this, Kovaƒçeviƒá moved to Pirot, part of the newly acquired territories from the war (along with towns Ni≈°, Vranje, Bela Palanka).

Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans or Jozef Laurent DyckmansOther name variations: 'Josef-Laurens Dyckmans', 'Joseph Laurent Dyckmans' (Lier, 9 August 1811 ‚Äì Antwerp, 8 January 1888) was a Belgian painter mainly of genre scenes and portraits whose painstakingly detailed pictures earned him the nickname 'The Belgian Gerard Dou'.Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans (1811-88), The Lace Maker at the Royal Collection Life Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans was born in Lier where he received his first artistic training from the local painter Melchior Gommar Tieleman. Dyckmans started his career as a decorative painter in his native town. His local patrons recognized his talent and after he had won all the first prizes at the local drawing school, the Lier city government awarded him an allowance that permitted him to continue his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. He studied at the Antwerp Academy from 1834 to 1835 and worked in the workshop of Gustaf Wappers, one of the leading Romantic and history painters of Belgium at the time.Max Rooses, 'Dyckmans' in: Max Rooses, 'Oude en Nieuwe Kunst', Boekhandel J. Vuylsteke, Ghent, 1896, p.139-144 The lace maker Dyckmans became a frequent contributor to the local salons (art exhibitions) early in his career. He sent in 1834 his first contribution to the Antwerp salon where his painting A confession of love was well received. In 1836 his Game of checkers won the silver medal at the Brussels salon. His 1838 submission of a Vegetable market to the Ghent salon was a sensation and was subsequently exhibited in Antwerp in 1840 and The Hague in 1841. In The Hague the painting was awarded a silver medal. He exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1846, 1860, 1863 and 1869 and participated in the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1867.Jany Zeebroek- Ollemans, DYCKMANS, Joseph Laurent in: 'Dictionnaire des peintres belges' at Belgian Art Links and Tools Grandmother's Birthday; La F√™te de la Grandm√®re at the Victoria and Albert Museum In 1841, Dyckmans undertook a journey to Paris and the Netherlands. In November of that year he was appointed professor of painting and perspective at the Antwerp Academy. On 8 January 1847 he became a corresponding member of the Belgian Royal Academy. As he was of a timid disposition he did not participate in the meetings of the Belgian Royal Academy and never became an active member. He left his teaching post at the Antwerp Academy in 1854. Dyckmans is reported to have worked in London some time during his career. Dyckmans married in 1847 and had two daughters. Despite his international success, Dyckmans lived a relatively secluded life alternating between his spacious house in Antwerp and his small country retreat in Kalmthout, near Antwerp. Dyckmans received many official awards. The Belgian state made him a knight in the Order of Leopold in 1851 and later in 1870 an officer in the Order of Leopold. Dyckmans had many students including from Belgium and abroad such as Franz Vinck, Ernst St√ºckelberg, Wilhelm Busch, Paul Weber and Emil H√ºnten.Franz Zelger, 'Der Historienmaler Ernst St√ºckelberg: 1831 bis 1903', Juris-Verlag, 1971, p. 21 Eva Weissweiler, 'Wilhelm Busch.

He also painted a few portraits, landscapes, cityscapes and still lifes. Paternal advice When Dyckmans entered the art scene, Belgian painting was dominated by the historic-Romantic school exemplified by the grandiose works of Nicaise de Keyser, Edouard De Bi√®fve and his own master Gustaf Wappers. The members of this school of painting chose as the subject matter of their work important historical events in Belgium‚Äôs history, which were regarded as key to the country‚Äôs national identity. The style of these works directly referenced the Flemish Baroque of 17th century Antwerp artists such as Rubens.Johan Decavele, et al. \\"Belgium.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 November 2015. Unlike these masters, Dyckmans preferred to depict intimate domestic scenes in a refined style that was inspired by the 17th century Dutch 'fijnschilders' ('small masters') such as Gerard Dou and Eglon van der Neer. Dyckmans painted scenes of poor people as well as of the well-to-do bourgeoisie. The drawing of his figures was slight and his painting was like enamel and porcelain in its smoothness, particularly in his later works. Dyckmans was a master in the refined art of painting which represented each reflection, wrinkle, hair, leaf of a tree etc. He paid painstaking attention to the details of body, clothing and environment. At the same time, he aimed to represent the emotional state of the persons represented. One of his most successful paintings was The blind beggar. He painted the original in 1852 (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) and made a reduced copy which is in the National Gallery, London. The painting was extremely popular in the 19th century and was repeatedly copied after it had entered the National Gallery's collection.Jozef Laurent Dyckmans, The Blind Beggar at the National Gallery Dyckmans painted later a variation on the theme of the blind beggar of which he also made a reduced copy (private collections). The figure of the blind beggar in the painting is reportedly a self-portrait of the painter. Dyckmans painted also portraits and some cityscapes of Antwerp.Jozef Laurent Dyckmans at Belgian Art Links and Tools He further painted a still life of flowers entitled Spring flowers.

The CIECH Group consists of 8 manufacturing sites, in addition to trade and service businesses. Its annual revenues place the company among the top fifty Polish companies. In 2014, the company employed more than 3,900 people in Poland, Germany and Romania. CIECH is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange since February 2005 and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since August 2016.  Products  The CIECH Group offers high-end chemical products such as: soda ash (the second largest European provider), baking soda, salt, polyester and epoxy resins, agricultural products and glass products, as well as other chemicals. They are used by glass, food and furniture industries, for detergent production, in agriculture and in construction.  History  The company was founded in 1945 as state- controlled Centrala Importowo-Eksportowa Chemikalii i Aparatury Chemicznej\\" (Import-Export Centre for Chemicals and Chemical Instruments). From the very beginning, the company was exporting its products ‚Äî soda ash, carbide and zinc white ‚Äî to 12 countries. The first registered office was located in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. In 1946, CIECH moved its headquarters to Warsaw. In the following years, the company continued its operations, exporting its products to an increasing number of global markets. In the early 1960s, the company was renamed \\"Centrala Handlu Zagranicznego CIECH\\" (Foreign Trade Centre CIECH), in which \\"CIECH\\" was an abbreviation of the name \\"Centrala Importowo-Eksportowa Chemikali√≥w\\" (Import-Export Centre for Chemicals). The 1960s and 1970s brought the company successes on the sulphur market (when Polish \\"yellow gold\\" held the second place in the world in export of this raw material), nitrogenous fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, paints and varnishes. In 1976, nearly 95% of Polish chemical products were sold on foreign markets through CHZ CIECH. At the turn of the 1980s, at the beginning of the political transformation, CIECH was the largest foreign trade centre, with a monopoly for the delivery of oil to Polish refineries. In the 1990s, at the time when the centre celebrated its 45th anniversary, CIECH held the 97th place in the top hundred leading companies of the world. Poland's transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy entailed the loss of the monopoly for the delivery of oil. This coerced the company to transform into a modern and free market chemical company. Therefore, in the 1990s, the company initiated the process of building a capital group, concentrating major national manufacturing sites around itself. These transformations were crowned by the company's entry to the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2005, which proved a great success. It provided the company with access to capital and means of implementing bold activation measures. As a result of the company's listing on the stock exchange, its prestige increased, along with credibility and brand recognition. One year later, CIECH confirmed its position as one of the leaders of the European chemical industry by completing the purchase of the first foreign manufacturing subsidiary of the Group, a Romanian soda factory, \\"US Govora\\" (now: \\"CIECH Soda Romania\\"). In the same year, \\"ZCh Organika- Sarzyna\\" (now: \\"CIECH Sarzyna\\") was also purchased. In 2007, the company acquired a German soda manufacturer, \\"Sodawerk Stassfurt\\" (now: \\"CIECH Soda Deutschland\\"), and fortified its position as the second largest soda manufacturer in Europe. In 2014, CIECH acquired a new majority shareholder, the international investment group Kulczyk Investments.

Etymology  The name comes from the Greek words œÄŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ [pikros] for \\"bitter\\" and ŒºŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ [meros] for \\"part\\", and relates to the bitter taste of the mineral.  Occurrence  Picromerite is found on comparatively few places, currently (2015) only about 40 localities are known. It was first identified in active volcanic fumaroles on Mt. Vesuvius by Arcangelo Scacchi in 1855 and has also been found in volcanic deposits on Mt. Etna and on Hawai'i. It is more commonly found in the kainite zones of some marine salt deposits, among them salt mines in Thuringia, Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), near Hall in Tirol, Hallstatt and Bad Ischl (Austria), near Whitby (UK), and in the Carlsbad Potash District (New Mexico), also on salt lakes in western China. Picromerite can also form in sulfate-rich hydrothermal ore deposits and is found in slag heaps of some ore and coal mines. Picromerite is often accompanied by anhydrite, epsomite, halite, hohmannite, kainite, metasideronatrite und metavoltine, depending on the locality.  Properties  Picromerite dehydrates in dry air, and crystals then show dull, spherical dehydration zones. Progressive dehydration leads to leonite.

Early life  Maurice Dior was born in Normandy and came from a family of industrialists who were former farmers from Savigny-le-Vieux, on the border between the Calvados and Manche departments. Together with his cousin Lucien Dior, a future member of parliament and minister, he took over the management of a chemical company specializing in fertilizer, founded in 1832 by Louis-Jean Dior. It was situated in Saint- Nicolas, not far from Granville. In 1898, at the age of twenty-six, he married nineteen-year-old Madeleine Martin. They had five children: Raymond in 1899, then Christian in 1905, Jacqueline in 1909, Bernard in 1910, and Ginette, known as Catherine, in 1917.  Career  Dior's villa Les Rhumbs in Granville (Manche), France. Working with Lucien, Maurice strove to make the family firm prosper. In 1905, its capital reached 1.5 million francs. The decision to establish the company headquarters at the Rue d'Ath√®nes in Paris demonstrates this prosperity. The company's success was buoyed along by innovations and the diversification of its activities: the Diors were the first people to produce sulphuric acid for phosphate fertilizer. The family also owned phosphate plants in the departments of Meuse and Ardennes. In 1912, the family firm adopted the name of \\"Dior Fils & Cie\\" (Dior Sons & Co) and became a joint- stock company. Its capital rose to four million francs heralding a period of prosperity that was to last for around twenty years. The Diors opened factories in Brittany - in Landernau, Rennes and Saint-Marc, a town not far from Brest that was to give its name to the famous washing powder created a few years later. In 1923, Maurice and Lucien Dior's firm became a public company. This business success led to changes in Maurice Dior's personal life. In 1905, the family left for the center of Granville and moved into a villa - Les Rhumbs - which Maurice's wife Madeleine decorated in the fashion of the time and where she created a garden sheltered from the wind. It is now home to the Mus√©e Christian Dior. The family moved to the Parisian district of La Muette in 1910, to Rue Richard Wagner, later known as Rue Alb√©ric Magnard, keeping Les Rhumbs as a holiday home. After the war, during which the Diors took refuge in Granville, they returned to Paris in 1918, living not far from their previous address. This new apartment once again demonstrated Maurice Dior's success: decorated in neo-Louis XVI style, two valuable paintings were displayed, a Boucher and a L√©pici√©, which Maurice Dior purchased on the advice of a friend.  Ruin  Wishing to make the revenue generated by his companies grow, Maurice Dior began speculating in 1923. To devote more time to this activity, and noting that his sons would not be taking over the family firm, he delegated some of his responsibilities to his cousin Lucien. In May 1931, Madeleine Dior died. A few months later, the fall-out from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was felt in France and the businessman's shares lost their value. He then found himself unable to pay back the loan that he had taken out as part of the real estate operations intended to ensure his fortune and that of his sons. Maurice Dior was ruined and forced to liquidate his assets. The family firm was sold, and was later renamed SOFO, then SOFERTI. He left Paris in 1932 to live in Callian in the department of Var, where life was cheaper. His daughter Catherine accompanied him, while Christian, who was not yet the renowned couturier that he would soon become, stayed in Paris and sent them money regularly. It was in Callian, in \\"Les Na√øss√®s\\", the small Proven√ßal farmhouse that he purchased in 1932, that Maurice Dior died on December 9, 1946, a few months before the inauguration of his son's couture house and the resounding success of his first runway show.

It is considered one of the most notable carnival events worldwide. The event is held 12 days before the Christian season of Lent on the Sunday before Ash Monday, 50 days before Orthodox Easter. The festival is a 10-day colourful event of people feasting, singing songs, satire, games, carnival processions and balls.My Destination: Limassol Carnival History A typical Greco-Roman thematic Limassol Carnival Festival, which is said to be an old custom traced to pagan rituals, is now held as an entertaining event. The local belief is that it is a Hellenistic heritage that goes back to pre- Christian times and to an ancient Greek festival honoring Dionysus, the deity of wine and fun. However, the first written reference of the carnival is by N–µ–æphitos Egklistos, who accuses Cypriots of idolatry and accepting an alien tradition of celebrating the start of the Great Fast. The second historical mention is from Christophor Furkher Nirenberg, wh–æ visited Cyprus in 1566 during a journey to the Holy Land. Nirenmberg was impressed by the carnival parades and told a story about how local noblemen organize amazing feasts, where people dance, sing and have fun.Limassol Carnival: The History of the Festival From Ancient Times to the Present As practiced now in Limassol is a legacy from the Venetians who ruled over Cyprus during the 15th‚Äì16th centuries. The Carnival of Venice, however, takes itself very seriously, in comparison. In contrast, both adults and children can join the Limassol Carnival and as a rule everyone pours foam on each other in the Old City. The celebrations are held in most towns around the island, but the event held in Limassol is by far the largest and most popular. Social Importance Limassol The Grand Parade with young participants As an institution and traditional festival, the Carnival has been celebrated consistently in Limassol and all over Cyprus over the last one hundred years, and regardless of political or economic conditions it represents a ritual which on the eve of spring affords the opportunity for people to express their faith and optimism for a good year.Limassol Municipality: Carnival The municipality conducts a minimum of five masked balls which include an open-air ball on Heroon Square in the heart of city center, and in huge ball rooms of major hotels. A children‚Äôs parade is rightly considered to be one of the key events of the carnival. It is held on the first Sunday of the festive events. Children customarily dress up in carnival costumes and travel the streets of Limassol. On the Grand Carnival parade the floats theme and the singing are commonly satirical. The Carnival King or Queen could be presented as a satirical figure representing social, political and economic conditions of relevance to Cyprus or Europe in general. On the final day which is the Grand Carnival more than 150 floats and an estimated 50.000 people take part in the procession. The city's brass band and groups of drummers and mandolin-toting kantadoroi (serenaders) accompany the Carnival King (or Queen). During 2014 the satirical theme was the Carnival King depicted with Euro signs indicative of the economic crisis in Europe. On an earlier occasion the Carnival Queen was presented as Angela Merkel as they had then considered her responsible for the economic crisis in Cyprus. Themes & Timeline Marlow's Snow White at the Limassol Carnival Festival, 2017 Limassol Parade mascots with painted faces *The first week of the festival begins on a Thursday with entry of the King Carnival (as a satirical display it could be a Queen also) in a procession through the town which is decorated for the occasion followed by a grand fancy dress competition of children that is held at the Tsirion Athletic Stadium. The first week also marks the Meat Week (Kreatini), which is the last week for eating meat before Easter. The day the festival starts is also known as \\"Tsiknopempti\\" (meaning \\"Stinky Thursday\\"), a name attributed to the cooking aromas of meat pervading the streets.Limassol carnival set to be 'biggest ever' *In the second week of the festival, which is called the cheese week (Tyrini), dairy products are consumed. At the end of the week on a Sunday the celebration involves the Grand Carnival parade which is taken through the Makariou III Avenue of Limassol. People from all parts of the island gather to watch the \\"floats with the serenade and other masqueraded groups.\\" *Throughout the festival period most hotels and clubs in the city hold fancy dress balls and parties. Clowns, cowboys, pirates, dragons, ancient Greeks and medieval knights are popular themes, but pop stars along with characters from the year's hit movies and musicals are also a common sight.CNN: Limassol, Cyprus: Coolest Carnival outside of Rio?

Around 1880 he set up and ran the Tokyo branch of the Nagoya Cloisonn√© Company. He exhibited his artworks at national and international expositions, where he took an organising role. He was recognised as an Imperial Household Artist and created art works for imperial residences. He sometimes signed his works with the character (pioneer).  Biography  Bowl with Chrysanthemum Blossoms, circa 1900 Pair of cloisonn√© vases with Imperial crests The \\"Myriad-Year Clock\\" with western and Japanese dials, weekly, monthly, and zodiac setting, with sun and moon, made by Hisashige Tanaka and enamel work by Namikawa, 1851 Japanese cloisonn√© traditionally involved opaque blocks of enamel enclosed in brass wire cloisons. In the late 19th century, artists replaced brass with silver and developed enamels that were translucent or transparent. Namikawa's workshop is regarded as the foremost developer of these techniques. With repeated firings, wires were not necessary to stop enamel areas bleeding into each other. He used two new techniques taking advantage of this: in the wires are only used for fine details whereas in the wires are removed entirely before the final firing. In , sulphuric acid burns out the wires. These techniques were created with help from Gottfried Wagener, brought from Germany as a technical consultant to Japanese industry, but Namikawa later took credit for their creation. He also claimed to have invented in 1879 his process for creating colour gradients. With these techniques, Namikawa's enamels could resemble paintings. He recreated nihonga paintings (of a classical Japanese style), particularly those of Watanabe Seitei. His subjects included hazy views of Mount Fuji and of clouds across the moon. A tray from around 1900 is likely modeled from a work by the Rinpa artist Ogata K≈çrin. Over his career, Namikawa made increasing use of blank space, adopting a more distinctively Japanese style. The collector Donald Gerber distinguishes three schools of Japanese cloisonn√© and places Namikawa at the head of the Tokyo, or pictorial, school.  Recognition  Namikawa exhibited at the 1881 National Industrial Exposition in Tokyo where his works were shown in the Art section while all other cloisonn√© works were displayed in the Industrial section. He won awards at the 1885 Amsterdam Colonial and Export Trade Exhibition, the 1885 Nuremberg International Metalwork Exhibition and the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889. He also exhibited at the World's Columban Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 he won a Grand Prize. His work was also included in the Japan-British Exhibition held in London in 1910. An article on Japanese enamels in The Decorator and Furnisher of February 1893 commented: > Among Japanese enamellers Namikawa, of Tokyo, is pre-eminent. Indeed, in his > own field, he has no world left to conquer. [...] [H]e has done all the > enamelling throughout the royal palaces and wins always the highest art > prizes at the fine arts exhibitions around the world. In 1896 he was appointed an Imperial Household Artist, one of only two cloisonn√© artists ever to receive this award, along with Namikawa Yasuyuki. These artists were given a yearly stipend and were commissioned by the Imperial family to make presentation wares as gifts for foreign dignitaries. These would often bear the Imperial family crest, a sixteen-petaled chrysanthemum. He seems to have been especially popular with the Imperial family, receiving many commissions. In 1906‚Äì7 he made a series of thirty enamel plaques for the Akasaka Palace. These oval medallions bear designs by Watanabe Seitei depicting flowers and birds of the four seasons. His Imperial commissions also included a pair of vases that were presented to the British admiral Sir Nowell Salmon. Outside of Japan his works are in collections such as the Walters Art Museum and the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art of the Meiji Era.

Namikawa Yasuyuki and Japanese Cloisonn√© The Allure of Meiji Cloisonn√©: The Aesthetic of Translucent Black, pp.182-188, The Mainichi Newspapers Co, Ltd, 2017 For his work he was appointed an Imperial Household Artist in 1896. He sometimes signed his pieces Kyoto Namikawa (Namikawa of Kyoto).  Biography  A former samurai, Namikawa Yasuyuki started work as an artist around 1868, working for the Kyoto Cloisonn√© Company from 1871 to 1874 and eventually forming his own company. He gave tours of his workshop; one visitor was the English writer Rudyard Kipling. These tours began in a garden to introduce Japanese aesthetics, and Namikawa would show the many stages of his production process, including fourteen polishing stones of different roughness that were used in sequence. Along with Namikawa S≈çsuke, he was one of only two cloisonn√© artists ever to be appointed Imperial Household Artist. These artists were given a yearly stipend and were commissioned by the Imperial family to make presentation wares as gifts for foreign dignitaries. After the Meiji era, foreign demand for Japanese art tailed off. Namikawa Yasuyuki retired in 1919 and his workshop closed in 1923.  Style  Vase with Flowers and Birds (Ëä±È≥•ÊñáËä±Áì∂) The collector Donald Gerber distinguishes three schools of Japanese cloisonn√© and places Namikawa at the head of the Kyoto, or naturalistic, school. He invented the first transparent black glaze, which led to the development of other transparent enamels. He used intricate wire work and is known for attention to detail. His early work used geometrical motifs or stylised representations of plants. His style became more pictorial over his career, usually depicting Kyoto's landmarks. He also worked with larger and more varied vases. Colourful figures on a yellow ground are one of his identifying marks. His style was shaped by his contact with Gottfried Wagener, a German scientist brought to Japan by the government to help modernise Japanese industry. Together they developed a semi-transparent mirror black enamel that became a hallmark of Namikawa's work. By 1893 Namikawa had learned to hide background wires, creating solid areas of enamel. Judges at Japan's fourth National Industrial Exhibition in 1895 remarked on Namikawa's change of stylistic approach when awarding him first prize: > \\"[H]ere flowers of the four seasons, with birds of exquisite coloring, are > set on to a black background color, forming a picture far beyond a mere > pattern. But he seems still to adhere to the traditional methods of > depiction, not attempting to imitate brushwork as do some other persons. He > places great emphasis on fine wirework and on a flawless surface with no > pitting or bubbles, achieved through painstaking study of glazing and > firing.\\" At the National Industrial Exhibition of 1881, Namikawa was awarded second prize for a copper vase \\"of elegant shape with opaque and transparent colors and complicated wire-work, with no trace of cracks.\\"  Collections  Many of his works are in collections today such as the Ashmolean Museum, the VIctoria and Albert Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Khalili Collection of Japanese Art. The Namikawa Cloisonne Museum of Kyoto (ja) and Kiyomizu Sannenzaka Museum (ja) in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto, exhibits a range of his items. The most highly acclaimed and famous of his works is the 1899 Vase with Flowers and Birds of the Four Seasons (ÂõõÂ≠£Ëä±È≥•Âõ≥Ëä±Áì∂) which is owned by the Museum of the Imperial Collections.Toyoro Hida, Gregory Irvine, Kana Ooki, Tomoko Hana and Yukari Muro.

Life Schreurs was born as Jacobus Schreurs in The Hague, Netherlands, to Jacobus Lambertus Keizer and his common-law wife Nelly Schreurs. His father was a painter in the style of the Hague School. As a child, Jaap often accompanied his father when he went into the countryside to paint the Dutch landscape, and he let the child have a go at it too. In his teens Schreurs joined a group of boys who went to the polders for the day, painting and drawing. Afterwards the boys' efforts were seriously examined and commented on by Jaap‚Äôs father, who insisted on the importance of perfection and professional skillBaart-Heringa, Th.E.

He studied at the Royal Academy of Art and the Free Academy of Visual Art in The Hague.Soestbergen, Annemiek van (2000), ‚ÄòJaap Schreurs, een schuwe schilder met zinderende zeggingskracht‚Äô. Tijdschrift Museum Amstelkring, Amsterdam, 2000. His teachers were Christiaan de Moor and Francis de Erdely. After he had finished his studies, he installed himself as a professional painter, and led the life of a poor but hard-working artist. During World War II he had to go into hiding because he refused to sign the so-called ‚Äòdeclaration of Aryan descent‚Äô (‚ÄòAri√´rverklaring‚Äô), which the Nazi racial policy required from every artist. From that moment on, he was punishable by law. Schreurs moved to Utrecht in the early 1950s. He led a rather secluded life and refused to become a member of an art society or to conform to any contemporary school of painting. He wanted to develop his own style independently and had no ambition to become a career painter. He also declined the BKR artist subsidy and its forerunners the Dutch state granted to artists from 1949 onwards because he objected to such subsidies in principle. In 1983 Schreurs died of a cardiac arrest. Legacy Upon his death he left behind over a thousand paintings, gouaches, drawings, etchings and linocuts.Almering, Lisette (2015), ‚ÄòVanuit divers perspectief: Het oeuvre van Jaap Schreurs (1913‚Äì1983), ‚Äòschilder van het diepere leven‚Äô.

His relatives consulted eight experts from prominent Dutch museums, art magazines, and auctioneering firms. These unanimously judged the quality and originality of the work positively; many pieces were judged to be of museum quality. They advised prudent and professional management of the collection. The legacy has been catalogued and can be viewed on a website (see external links below).  Painting style  The artist at work in his studio Influences Schreurs‚Äô style has been visibly influenced by three factors, namely #Loss of eyesight: ophthalmologist dr. Philippe Lanthony from the H√¥pital des Quinze-Vingts at Paris has examined how Schreurs‚Äô loss of binocular vision influenced his painting. The inability to see depth and perspective in the usual way forced Schreurs either to avoid painting depth, or to find other solutions. Moreover, monocular vision often stimulates a painter to pay extra attention to the eyes of his figures. Lanthony shows how in Schreurs‚Äô work this effect may be observed in his paintings of figures with very large dark eyes, as well as in his tendency to emphasize and exaggerate differences between the two eyes of his figures.Haeften, Chris van (2016), ‚ÄòThrough the Eyes of Jaap Schreurs‚Äô. In Guus van den Hout, (ed.) Jaap Schreurs: The Vulnerability of Existence/De kwetsbaarheid van het bestaan. Eindhoven: Timmer Art Books/Lecturis.Lanthony,P. (2009) Art and ophthalmology. Amsterdam: Wayenborgh-Kugler Publications. #Contact with the underprivileged and the disabled: Schreurs‚Äô life spanned the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. For financial reasons Schreurs could only afford as his models the homeless he found at the shelter of the Salvation Army. Moreover, the effects of bombing, razzias, deportation, poverty, the lack of social services and health care, the famine and all of its concomitant scenes of survival of the fittest ‚Äì at the cost of others ‚Äì were all visible on the streets. After the war, he saw how the very same mechanisms were still operating, albeit below the surface. His fascination with outcasts and vulnerable people is reflected in many of his paintings, in particular the ones from the last 20 years of his life. #Psychological realism: Schreurs‚Äô life spanned not only political and economic upheaval, but also a turbulent period in the Dutch art world. ‚Äú... he was caught between the legacy of the Hague School and the rise of the Cobra movement. Artistic styles collided, clashed, and overlapped; the central struggle between abstract art and realism was relentless...‚Äù, writes art historian Guus van den Hout, ‚ÄúSchreurs was aware of the significance of abstract art movements, and he did not refuse to acknowledge them; the influence of artists such as Picasso, Modigliani and Morandi on his work is undeniable... but as an artist he remained loyal to the realist tradition.‚Äù In his later work, however, in many paintings the figures are severely deformed. These deformations function as a mirror of their inner sufferings and conflicts. That is why art historian Quarles van Ufford has titled her essay The Inside Out. Schreurs once used the term ‚Äòpsychological realism‚Äô for these poignant paintings. Although this is a technical term from literary theory, it is an applicable characterisation.  Works  Chronology Although Schreurs only rarely signed and dated his works, Quarles van Ufford shows that the oeuvre can be roughly divided into three periods, each with its own characteristics. #1930‚Äì1950: His early paintings are mainly in oil on canvas. The style is naturalistic, some of the works clearly showing the influence of contemporary painters he admired such as Jan Sluijters, Charley Toorop and Constant Permeke. Various art reviewers also connected Schreurs‚Äô early paintings with Hieronymus Bosch and Breughel.Gruyter, W.Jos de (1944) ‚ÄòHedendaagse kunst‚Äô.

De Schouw, August 1944. The main themes are figures, portraits, still-lives, and religious scenes. The colouring is rather dark, mostly purple, brown, red and sometimes green. #1950‚Äì1965: Most works from these years are painted in light colours in acrylic on hardboard. The themes are highly stylized figures and faces, depicted two-dimensionally with their contours in dark outlines, some with elongated necks and/or extremely long and thin limbs. Their atmosphere is mostly quiet, introvert.Es, Jan van, (1994) ‚ÄòVerrassende wendingen in het schilderwerk van Jaap Scheurs‚Äô. Woerdense Courant 1994.Gemeentemuseum Den Haag (2012), Liefde. Zwolle: WBooks, p. 402-3.Reporter (1957), ‚ÄòWerk van Jac. Schreurs en K. Noorhoff‚Äô. Utrechts Nieuwsblad, May 3, 1957. #1965‚Äì1983: In this period, Schreurs returns to themes already present in his earliest work, such as his compassion and his respect for disabled, neglected and demented people. Often the meaning of inner conflicts, despair or impotence is represented by deformation and/or reinforced by the size of the painting. As Van den Hout describes it, ‚ÄúSchreurs confronts the viewer with the harsh reality of existence....Yet they (the paintings) are doing exactly what art should do: they facilitate and encourage understanding, contemplation and reflection.Keita, Fatou (1993), ‚ÄòJaap Schreurs ou l‚Äô√©loquence de la protestation silencieuse‚Äô.

The works from this third period are however much more poignant and emphasise the connection between the suffering of Christ and the suffering of humanity.Fink, F.G.

Lower Courts Magistrates Court Criminal Jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court Dealing with criminal law cases which are liable to attract a sentence of a maximum of two years and/or a fine of ¬£20,000. Civil Jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court Dealing with civil matters where the sum in dispute does not exceed ¬£10,000. Commonly known as ‚Äúpetty debt‚Äù cases. Family Law Matters covers child maintenance payments, child contact and other issues which arise from time to time when a relationship breaks down. Inquests are held at the magistrates court and are normally held at the request of the Law Officers of the Crown. Juvenile Court The Juvenile Court is part of the Magistrate's Court and, if considered appropriate by Her Majesty's Procureur, will sit to consider some cases involving juveniles (under the age of 18) who are charged with criminal offences. Her Majesty's Procureur may also refer the case to the Child Youth and Community Tribunal. This court is not open to the public. Contracts Court This court, convened with a Jurat Lieutenant Bailiff and four other Jurats witness conveyances of real property, real property agreements, legal charges on property (bonds), marriage contracts and deed polls prior to their registration on the public records, as well as liquor licence applications. Royal Court The primary court of record. It can sit in a number of configurations, depending on the type of case and the powers to be exercised. The Full Court Historically known as the Cour en Corps comprising: * a single Judge of law, this being either the Bailiff, the Deputy Bailiff, a Judge of the Royal Court or a Lieutenant Bailiff qualified in law; and, * not less than seven, but no more than twelve, Jurats acting as Judges of fact. The Full Court has original criminal jurisdiction in respect of indictable offences committed anywhere in the Bailiwick of Guernsey with a few exceptions and normally deals with serious criminal offences. The Royal Court is also an appeal court for lower courts. Dealing with civil jurisdiction cases that are beyond the scope of the Magistrates Court and certain other routine civil matters such as registering new legislation as well as some administrative appeals. The Ordinary Court Comprising a single Judge of law, this being either the Bailiff, the Deputy Bailiff, a Judge of the Royal Court or a Lieutenant Bailiff qualified in law; and a minimum of two Jurats, although normally with three. Sometimes the Judge will sit alone. The Ordinary Court will deal with criminal matters originating in Alderney or Sark. The Ordinary Court deals with all original civil business beyond the competence of the Magistrate's Court such as property disputes, company liquidations, guardianships, evictions, terre mises a l'amende applications and the swearing-in of Parish Officials and Police Officers It acts as a court of appeal for the Courts in Alderney and Sark. The Matrimonial Causes Division Established under the Matrimonial Causes Law (Guernsey), 1939, constituted by a single Judge of Law, this being either the Bailiff, the Deputy Bailiff, a Judge of the Royal Court or a Lieutenant Bailiff qualified in law, sitting alone; or a single Judge of Law sitting with four Jurats. Dealing with matters of divorce, judicial separation, annulments and dissolutions of marriages, and contentious judicial separations. Other Courts Guernsey Court of Appeal Constituted under the Court of Appeal (Guernsey) Law 1961, it comprises the Bailiff of Guernsey and other judges appointed by warrant of the Sovereign. Guernsey and Jersey work closely together with the bailiff of each appointed to the opposite island‚Äôs Court of Appeal so that cases that may have a conflict of interest can be heard. A higher appeal lies from the Guernsey Court of Appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Judicial Committee of the Privy Council The higher appeal from the Guernsey Court of Appeal goes to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in civil cases. In criminal matters further appeals may only be made with special leave of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which is the final court of appeal This is the final appeal for matters from the Magistrate's Court, the Royal Court, the Court of Alderney and the Court of the Seneschal. Court of Chief Pleas An ancient Court, constituted in the same way as a Full Court. It is attended by the Full Court, the Law Officers of the Crown, Advocates and the Seigneurs and Bordiers owing suit to the Court. Normally held just once a year at the start of the legal year when oaths are taken from HM Procureur, HM Receiver General and HM Comptroller. It is followed by a service at the Town Church then a traditional dinner. Dealing with a mixture of issues, such as explosives licenses, water courses, charitable funds, ‚ÄúSalle Publique Licences‚Äù and is an opportunity to admit to the Guernsey Bar, qualified students. European Court of Human Rights Effective from 2006, the Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2000 incorporates into Bailiwick legislation the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. People are able to pursue their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in the Bailiwick's courts and tribunals, instead of having to go to the European Court in Strasbourg although that is still the final appeal route. Ecclesiastical Court The Ecclesiastical Court's origins probably go back beyond surviving written records, existing in the 13th Century, and almost certainly for centuries before that. Many of the old jurisdiction functions have fallen by the way, such as dealing with acts of heresy and idolatry. Today the court deals with just three matters: * The proving of Wills and the issuing of Letters of Administration in deceased Estates; * The granting of marriage licences * The issuing of faculties In this respect the Ecclesiastical Court is unique in the world. Normally held each Friday and presided over by the Dean of Guernsey acting under a commission from the Bishop of Winchester. (prior to the time of Queen Elizabeth I, the Bishop of Coutances) The Court used to be held in an upper room in the Town Church where its most notorious decision was the sentencing in 1556 of the Guernsey Martyrs for heresy. The Court relocated in 1822. It is currently held in its own offices within the Saint Peter Port Constables office building. Sark Chief Pleas (French: Chefs Plaids; Sercquiais: Cheurs Pliaids) is the parliament of Sark. Despite having its own legislative assembly, Sark voluntarily submits to Guernsey in matters of criminal law. Alderney The Court of Alderney exercises unlimited original jurisdiction in civil matters and limited jurisdiction in criminal matters. The Court sits with a Chairman (the Judge of Alderney) and at least three of the six Jurats. Appeals are made to the Royal Court of Guernsey, which also exercises some original jurisdiction in criminal matters in Alderney, and thence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.Court Of Alderney Alternatives to Court Tribunals The use of tribunals has increased over the years, with tribunals normally created by statute and is a less formal and potentially faster source of justice. These include: * Chambre de Discipline. Under the Guernsey Bar (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2007 (as amended). For complaints made against Advocates. * Child Youth and Community Tribunal (CYCT). Created under the Children (Guernsey and Alderney) Law 2008. * Clergy Discipline Measure. A Church of England disciplinary tribunal established in Guernsey when necessary under the Clergy Discipline (Bailiwick Of Guernsey) Order, 2006 * Employment & Discrimination Tribunal. The Tribunal deals with employment and sex discrimination related matters. * Mental Health Review Tribunals. The Tribunal provides a way for patients to appeal against detention or a Community Treatment Order. * Planning Tribunal. Deals with appeals against the Environment Department planning decisions * Parochial Appeals Tribunals Loi relative aux Douits (Amendment) Law, 2013 and the Parochial Administration Ordinance, 2013 * Police Complaints Commission, a Tribunal * Supplementary Benefit Tribunal. For aggrieved benefit recipients to have their appeal heard by an independent tribunal. * Tax Tribunal. An independent appeal body set up to hear income tax appeals which cannot otherwise be resolved. * Utilities Appeals Tribunal. Deals with complaints made against the Office of Utility Regulation. Arbitration Arbitration in civil matters is recommended in Guernsey using the Arbitration (Guernsey) Law, 1982. There are no legal impediments to arbitrating any type of dispute, except where the relief sought by the claimant is only available from specific bodies or institutions, such as the Royal Court. There is a Channel Islands branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. Ancillary Notes Language After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Norman French became the official language used at court and by the nobles. Guernsey's Royal Court and officials employed standard French from the Medieval period to the mid 20th century. In 1926 English was made an official language of the States of Guernsey although it took more time for the Courts to change. Until 1948, French was the official language of Guernsey. Court Building The earliest reference to a court building dates from the 12th century, when reference is made to a building in St Peter Port in a district known as La Plaiderie (literally translated as the place of pleading) where courts were held in the King's barn, although it had to be vacated at lunch time so a corn market could take place in the afternoons. During the English Civil War it was relocated temporarily to Elizabeth College to put it out of range of the Royalist cannon on Castle Cornet. It was 1799 before the current court buildings were built, with the first sitting in 1803. Expanded repeatedly over the years, with the latest addition completed in 2006. Advocates Only Advocates of the Royal Court may have rights of audience to the Royal Court and the Guernsey Court of Appeal. The Advocate is an officer of the Royal Court and his or her primary duty is to the Court and not to the client. The qualification route is normally through obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree in England, then a qualification as a Solicitor or Barrister in England and Wales, followed by vocational training, passing Guernsey Bar exams and then obtaining a Certificat d‚ÄôEtudes Juridiques Fran√ßaises et Normandes from Caen University Law Officers Appointed by the Crown. * H.M. Procureur (Attorney General) & H.M. Receiver General * H.M. Comptroller (Solicitor General) & H.M. Deputy Receiver General Registry Her Majesty's Greffier is Clerk of the Royal Court and is responsible for maintaining records of all Court proceedings. The court building holds many historic documentary records as well as maintaining Island records, such as births, marriages, deaths and property ownership. Jurat A maximum of 16 Jurats, each Jurat is elected by secret ballot at the States of Election and once elected, holds office until 70 which may be extended to a maximum age of 72. The post of Jur√©- Justicier Suppl√©ant was created in 2008 for an experienced Jurat and has a retirement age of 75. Earliest Courts Rollo, on being given his lands by Charles the Simple in 911AD, established a superior court in Rouen, which had the name of Eschequier or Exchequer, to which appeals could be made. Each Fief, or manorial land area had a court composed of principal tenants. In Guernsey before 1066, a superior court was introduced above the Fiefs and below the Eschequier Court in Rouen and comprised the Bailiff and four Knights to hear appeals and to try criminals. It was in the reign of King John the lands in France were lost and as the Island had shown their loyalty to the Duke of Normandy (the King of England, King John), the appeal system moved to England and the Royal Court was established. In 1642 during the English Civil War the Royal Court was dissolved by Parliament, although courts continued, being relocated temporarily to Elizabeth College to put it out of range of the Royalist cannon on Castle Cornet. Courts no longer in use Fief la Cour, Rue Des Vallees * Cour d'Appeaux was a court of appear from the Cour Ordinaire or Ordinary Court, comprising more Jurats than in the Ordinary Court. * Court of Judgements was a court of appeal above the Cour d'Appeaux comprising at least seven Jurats.

Constructed in the Mughal architectural style, the mosque was built in 1795 by the family of Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot during 1765. It has a large prayer hall, a tank and a large ground in front. The entire structure is constructed with granite without the use of iron or wood. The Nawab of Arcot was friendly towards fellow Hindus, appointing a Hindu as his chief personal secretary. A chronogram written in Persian by Raja Makhhan Lal Bahdur Khirat, the Hindu Munshi of the Nawab, is found on the entrance to the prayer hall. The mosque is the largest and one of the oldest in Chennai and is active as a place of worship. It is administered by Prince of Arcot Endowments Trust. Most of the administrative staff of the mosque are Hindus, symbolizing peaceful coexistence between the two religions. History Image of the mosque during a wedding ceremony The Nawab of Arcot was a loyal ally of the British who offered him Chepauk Palace where he could house his military and administrative buildings. It is believed that Nawab Muhammad Ali moved to Chepauk, located in Triplicane in 1768. There were around 20,000 Marakayar Muslims who moved with him to the city. It was then the largest community of Muslims in South India after Hyderabad. The Nawab had full control of the region and all the cases were resolved under Muslim Law irrespective of the religion of the accused. Historians believe that after the mosque was built, it added to the cultural mix in Triplicane, which had a famous Hindu temple in Parthasarathy Temple and the Portuguese Christian stronghold of San Thome. Big Mosque was built in 1795 by the family of Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot during 1765. There is a plaque in Persian written by the private secretary of the Nawab, Rajah Makhan Lal Khirat. The mosque is now administered by Prince of Arcot Endowments Trust. The plaque indicates that the mosque was renovated during the regime of Azam Jah, who modified its minarets and added golden finials to the spires. The Nawabs of Arcot were friendly towards fellow Hindus, appointing a Hindu as chief personal secretary. A significant number of the administrative staff of the mosque are Hindus, which is seen as a symbol of a harmonious mix of cultures. Architecture Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot, who built the Biq Mosque Big Mosque is the largest mosque located in Chennai from the time of its establishment. It is constructed of granite without any iron or wooden additions. There is no fixed architectural style, though the two minarets are characteristic of Mughal architecture. Historians attribute the change of architecture to the arrival of North Indian Muslims who settled there. The mosque houses the image of the Persian scholar Barool. It is believed that he came from Lucknow to educate the Royal family. The chronogram written by Raja Makhhan Lal Bahdur Khirat, the Munshi of the Nawab, is found on the entrance of the prayer hall. There is a large temple tank to the North East of the sanctum and a large ground in front of it. Almost the entire portion of the mosque has an equivalent width of steps leading to it. To the West of the sanctum, the mausoleums of important people associated with the Royal family are located. Culture Big Mosque is the largest and considered the principal mosque in the city of Chennai. The mosque is an active place of worship. There is a constant flow of visitors in the mosque as it is located in one of the busiest places in Chennai. The mosque can accommodate thousands of devotees. During the sacred festivals of Bakrid and Ramzan, the devotees overflow, some of them offering prayers from the surrounding grounds. There was a proposal made by the administration to cover the open grounds at least during festive occasions to protect devotees from inclement weather conditions. There were contrasting views put forth by heritage enthusiasts who argued against roofing claiming the openness and the architecture would be hidden by the structure.

Facts Mr Homer claimed indirect age discrimination, because after a rule change he was required to have a law degree to get onto the third and highest pay grade, once he was 62 years old. He began working as a legal adviser in 1995 with the Police National Legal Database. He was required to have a law degree or in his case ‚Äòexceptional experience in criminal law with a lesser qualification‚Äô. But to get the highest pay grade after a 2005 review, legal advisers now actually had to have a law degree, and so he was refused entry. He brought a claim under the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, SI 2006/1031 after internal grievances and appeals were dismissed. The Employment Tribunal allowed Mr Homer‚Äôs claim. In the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Elias P, [2009][2009] IRLR 262 overturning the Tribunal, held that there was no basis for thinking there was any particular disadvantage for those aged between 60 and 65, because it was not intrinsically more difficult for people in that category to get a degree. The financial consequences resulted merely from age, not age discrimination. The Court of Appeal [2010] [2010] EWCA Civ 419 agreed with the Employment Appeal Tribunal, arguing that it was not Mr Homer‚Äôs age that put him at a particular disadvantage but his impending retirement, the same as any employee nearing retirement in four years. The Supreme Court [2012] https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0102-judgment.pdf allowed his appeal and determined that the case must be remitted back to the Employment Tribunal for further consideration. The Supreme Court determined that the new education requirement discriminated on the basis of age. Judgment Lady Hale (with whom Lord Brown and Lord Kerr agreed) held that Mr Homer had suffered indirect age discrimination. Mr Homer‚Äôs near retirement was directly related to his age. The question would be remitted to the Tribunal to decide whether there was a justification for indirect discrimination. Lord Hope, in a short concurring judgment, expressed the view that discrimination is not justified just because eliminating it would put others at a disadvantage that was not related to their age. Lord Mance also gave a short concurring judgment, although pointing out that to allow Mr Homer to go to the third pay grade without a law degree could be discriminatory against young people.

By publishing variants of a patent claim, the risk of adverse patenting may potentially be decreased (improvement inventions may no longer be patentable). Cloems may also be potentially patentable. One of the issues of patentability, however, is that only a natural person can be a listed as an inventor on a patent.

Facts Mr Seldon, a partner, claimed direct age discrimination for being compulsorily retired after he turned 65. He joined the partnership in 1971, became an equity partner in 1972, and revised the partnership deed in 2005 which restated that partners would retire the December after turning age 65. He asked to stay, but was offered ¬£30,000 to retire instead. He claimed age discrimination under EEAR 2006 regulation 17. The partnership argued it was justified by business need. The Employment Tribunal held he was less favourably treated, but it was justified for (1) giving other associates the opportunity of partnership within a reasonable time ‚Äì and therefore to remain with the firm (2) workforce planning (3) limiting need to expel underperforming partners. It upheld, however, a victimisation claim. The EAT,[2009] IRLR 267 said although an aim of ‚Äòcollegiality‚Äô was not legitimate, the decision could be right, although it would have to be remitted to decide afresh. It should have considered if another age would have been proportionate. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. Mr Seldon argued that the justification had to relate to him, not the firm. Judgment Lady Hale held that Mr Seldon had not suffered unjustifiable age discrimination, and rejected the claim that it could not be justified in relation to business need. However, it was remitted to Tribunal to decide whether, on the facts, an age of 65 was legitimate. Lord Hope, Lord Brown, Lord Mance and Lord Kerr.

It is an adaptation of the 1973 fantasy novel Momo by Michael Ende. It spawned an animated series in 2003. The film won a Silver Ribbon for Gianna Nannini's musical score, and was also nominated for Silver Ribbon for best screenplay. Plot Momo is an orphan girl who finds herself in a town, where she makes friends with an old man, Beppo, who loves her as a granddaughter, and with Gigi, a child who immediately falls in love with her. Momo also knows other playmates: Enzo, Bruno, Livia and the little Chicco, who create a house in an ancient amphitheatre, and Cassiopea, a tortoise she finds on the street. But the city is invaded by the Gray Men who convince many people, including the ingenious barber Osvaldo Fusi, that they don't have much time left to live: the Grey Men's goal is to save all the people's time in their special \\"Bank of the time\\", which helps them to survive. A Gray Man tries to bribe the little Momo with a very beautiful doll, but she manages to soften the heart of the Gray Man, humanizing him and turning him into a Grey-Pink Man, who admits that they always feel cold and they do not know what the warmth of love is. Momo then decides to immediately warn her friends, who in turn try to warn their parents to stay away from the Gray Men, but it's too late. After having eliminated the Grey-Pink Man, accused to be a traitor, the President of the Gray Men gives the order to capture Momo, who manages to escape from them thanks to Cassiopea, who leads her to a magical place. Momo is welcomed into the home of Master Hora, who controls time assisted by his faithful helpers, the time of day and the time of night, under the guise of a Rooster and an Owl. Master Hora unveils to Momo the true nature of the Gray Men and the secret place where time lives. Momo listens to the Music of Light, a song that can break the spell of the Grey Men and free everyone, but the wise Master Hora tells her that it takes time for her to internalize the music, she has to sleep on it. Momo then goes to sleep, but meanwhile, the quiet town on Earth has turned into a huge metropolis. Poor Beppo, destroyed by the disappearance of Momo, is arrested and kept into an asylum after he tried to denounce the Grey Men to the authorities, and Gigi, who is hired by television, is threatened with dismissal if he keeps looking for Momo. When Master Hora wakes up Momo, the town seems to be lost, but there is a way to save it: stop time. Master Hora can stop time by falling asleep, but only for an hour. The Grey Men steal the hours from the people and turn them into cigars that must smoke continuously, in order to avoid disappearing. If time stops, they can no longer steal hours and will eventually dissolve all. Unfortunately, the evil Grey Men have a reserve of cigars in their Bank and, as long as they can access them, they have enough cigars to survive until the awakening of Hora; Momo should, therefore, be able to keep them away from storage the necessary time. The girl faces the great challenge, helped by Cassiopeia, and manages with purity of soul and kindness to defeat all the Grey Men, freeing all her friends. The town is saved and the sweet Momo can finally re-embrace Beppo; Gigi returns to what it once was and Momo will live happily ever after with her friends. To celebrate, Gigi and Momo dance in the amphitheatre in front of the city's people.

The group includes The Montcalm London Marble Arch and The Marble Arch by The Montcalm London, both of which are near Marble Arch, as well as M By Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, located in Shoreditch. The Montcalm at The Brewery London City and London City Suites by Montcalm, both of which are located in the City of London, round out the hotel chain. Each of the sites is a five-star hotel. The Montcalm London Marble Arch was acquired by Shaftesbury Hotels in 2008. History The Montcalm London Marble Arch was acquired by Shaftesbury Hotels in 2008 and, following a ¬£38 million refurbishment programme, reopened in September 2010. It was previously owned by Nikko Hotels (part of the JAL Group). The hotel dates from the early 1970s when Piccadilly Estate Hotels Ltd. built it at 2 Wallenberg Place. It opened in 1973 and was originally called The Montcalm, named after the Marquis de Montcalm, the commander of the French forces defeated by the English in the struggle for possession of Canada in the mid-eighteenth century. The link between this battle and the building is the Canadian province of Quebec, which had already lent its name to the original mews (Quebec Mews) at the rear of the building. However, the site's history dates back much farther, as suggested by the hotel's crescent-shaped Georgian fa√ßade, which in agreeing to the hotel's construction, Westminster Council insisted should remain. The fa√ßade originally belonged to the building erected as houses at 2 Wallenberg Place on plots leased from the Portman family in 1789. It is likely that each house had four storeys (including an attic storey) over a basement and was three bays wide. All the houses came with stabling in Quebec Mews, accessed from New Quebec Street. During the nineteenth century, exterior alterations were made to the houses, including the conversion to cottages of the buildings in Quebec Mews. Both Wallenberg Place and Quebec Mews are located within Westminster's Portman Square (designated as a conservation area in 1967). The area, part of the parish of St Marylebone, was covered with trees and marshland as part of the forest of Middlesex until, in 1532, Sir William Portman leased the 270 acres that surrounded it. In 1554 the freehold was conveyed in perpetuity to Sir William and his heirs and, three years later in 1757, when Marylebone Road was sited to provide a route to the City bypassing the West End, the grid of streets that's now recognisable as the Portman Estate was laid out. Shortly afterwards in 1764, construction of Portman Square and neighbouring streets began; the development was completed in 1820. Hotel properties The Montcalm London Marble Arch Located in Wallenberg Place, near Park Lane and Oxford Street, The Montcalm has 153 rooms, a grand ballroom (which can hold between 50 and 550 people), a club lounge, an all-day lounge, a champagne bar and a luxury spa (The Spa at the Montcalm), which comprises a fitness centre, a sauna, a steam room, a Jacuzzi and an exercise pool. The hotel also has two restaurants, The Sixtyone Restaurant and The Crescent brasserie. In October 2015, the hotel became the first in the Montcalm chain to have a 10 Gigabit Ethernet wide area network (WAN) and Internet connection delivered by Internet service provider Exponential-e Ltd. On 30 October 2015, the World Boutique Hotel Awards (WBHA) ceremony was held at The Montcalm. The Marble Arch by The Montcalm London The Marble Arch by The Montcalm is a smaller site and was once a townhouse. M by Montcalm ‚Äì view from City Road, Shoreditch, London M By Montcalm Shoreditch Tech City Hotel M By Montcalm Shoreditch Tech City Hotel is a contemporary-style, 18-storey hotel capable of holding events for 250 delegates. It contains 269 rooms, a business centre, meeting room space on its second floor, a spa and fitness centre, a swimming pool, two bars and two restaurants ‚Äì one on the ground floor and the other on the 17th floor. The 17th floor restaurant, Urban Coterie, is overseen by head chef Martin Zahumensky (formerly of restaurants Texture and Hibiscus). The interior design of the restaurant and its Sky Bar, produced by Tonik Associates, takes inspiration from the building's architecture, using traditional materials like brass, timber, bianco marble and leather. A private dining room, which seats 12 people, offers views over the city and the restaurant's menu is billed as a celebration of all things British. The Montcalm at The Brewery London City Formerly the site of Whitbread & Co., Britain's first purpose-built mass production brewery, The Montcalm at The Brewery's building is listed and dates back to 1750 when Samuel Whitbread moved his brewing operations to Chiswell Street on the 'eastern rim of Georgian London', now Barbican. The last beer was brewed on the site in 1976, after which it became Whitbread Plc's Head Office and then The Brewery, a conference and banqueting venue. The hotel contains a gourmet gastropub (The Jugged Hare), a restaurant (Chiswell Street Dining Rooms) and business conference facilities. London City Suites by Montcalm Occupying a Grade II listed building opposite its sister hotel (The Montcalm at The Brewery), London City Suites shares the amenities of the latter site. Technology At the end of October 2015, a mobile app for iOS and Android was launched to allow visitors to plan and book their stay at the hotels, manage their reservations and get updates on latest deals. In August 2014, the Montcalm London Marble Arch trained its staff to use the Google Glass to enable them to offer advice on local restaurants, shops, travel plans and directions, freeing them from being behind a desk as they do so.

It also helps to explain other forms of consciousness: creative imagination, thought, the formation of beliefs and motivations ... It is based on two key assumptions: 1) Imagination is a simulation of perception. 2) Brain registrations of memories are self-excitatory neural networks (neurons can activate each other).  Definition  A convergence-divergence zone (CDZ) is a neural network which receives convergent projections from the sites whose activity is to be recorded, and which returns divergent projections to the same sites. When an experiment is recorded, the signals that converge on the CDZ excite their neurons which strengthen their mutual connections (according to the Hebbian theory) and thus form a self-excitatory network. The excitation of this network is then enough to reproduce the combination of initially received signals. In a self-excitatory network the excitation of a part spreads to all the others, just like a memory fragment awakens an entire recorded experience. A CDZ is thus the place of recording and reproduction of memories. It is both a detector and a signal producer (forms of neuronal activation). This is the basic neural mechanism that explains memories and other forms of imagination.  Arborescences of CDZ  In addition to convergent-divergent paths, a CDZ may be connected to the rest of the brain in every imaginable way, by input signals that activate or inhibit it, and output signals with which it influences the rest of the system. In particular CDZs may be organized into a system and form an arborescence. A CDZ may recruit converging input channels from many other CDZs. It can thus make a synthesis of detection and production capabilities of all the CDZs thus recruited. To make a model of the CDZ system, we distinguish in the nervous system a peripheral part and a central one, with a gradual progression from the periphery to the center. The periphery includes all sources of perception: the feeling of the outside and inside, emotions and actions. The periphery, thus understood, includes all cortical sensory, emotional and motor areas, and all intracerebral nuclei that contribute to their functioning. The CDZ system is organized in a hierarchical fashion, from the periphery to the center. The most peripheral CDZs have convergent paths directly from the periphery. We approach the center going up the arborescence of CDZs. One can think of roots that plunge into the earth, the periphery, and converge to the base of the trunk, the center. But in the brain, there are a large number of centers. The most central CDZs have converging projections from other CDZs, and are not recruited by a more central CDZ. The memory of an episode of our life is preserved in such central CDZs. When we relive the perceptions, emotions and actions of a past experience, the excitation of this central CDZs activates all subordinated CDZs and the peripheral areas. It thereby reconstructs the previously lived experience.

The Carmarthen Journal bemoaned the lack of organization amongst the Independents, compared with Labour and referred to the haphazard methods of nomination, particularly in rural areas. Labour took all nine aldermanic vacancies. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Retiring aldermen A number of retiring councilors stood down to allow retiring aldermen to be returned unopposed. These included a Plaid Cymru councilor at Ammanford in favour of retiring Labour alderman, John Harries. Unopposed returns There were more unopposed returns than in any previous election, according to one local newspaper. In Llanelli, where many wards had been closely contested at previous county elections, Labour candidates were returned unopposed in all nine divisions. These included the No.1 Ward which had been held by an Independent in the previous council. Contested elections In the few contests that took place very few seats changed hands.

Clarke was suspended from the party on 24 September 2015, following the suicide of Conservative activist Elliott Johnson who had claimed that Clarke had bullied him. A series of accusations subsequently appeared in national newspapers about Clarke's alleged misconduct. In November 2015 he was expelled and banned for life from representing or joining the Conservative Party. His alleged misconduct within the Conservative Party also led to national newspaper coverage about the extent to which senior figures in the party knew about complaints regarding his actions that subsequently led to the resignation of Grant Shapps as a government minister.  Early life and education  Clarke was born in June 1977, to Madeline Clarke and Denis Ogden. He is a great nephew of Dominica's first female prime minister, Dame Mary Eugenia Charles, grandson of Bertie Clarke, a Barbados-born member of the West Indies Cricket Team. Bertie Clarke came to Britain in 1939 \\"to play three tests against England,\\" but could not return home because of the outbreak of World War II; Clarke the grandfather trained as a GP, and had a daughter, Madeline, who would become Mark Clarke's mother. Mark's parents, Denis and Madeline, split up when Mark was young, and details of his early life are \\"sparse\\"; he has described his father as being absentee, and that his upbringing included time on the Ivybridge estate in Isleworth, Hounslow, West London. Mark Clarke was schooled at London's Dulwich College after achieving a government assisted places position. Afterwards, Clarke studied Ancient and Modern History at Durham University, graduating in 1999.  Career   Marketing consultancy  In the years from his graduation up to 2015, Mark Clarke used his university training to engage in consulting positions related to marketing, a period that included work with Procter and Gamble, Mars, Accenture, and Unilever, and a period of 4 years residence in Switzerland. As of 2015, he was reported to be a senior marketing analyst at Unilever, but left the company in March 2018 after claims of sexual harassment were made against him. Clarke was the subject of a formal investigation by Unilever in respect of the sexual harassment matter, but resigned before that investigation was concluded.  Early political career  Clarke has been an active Conservative Party campaigner since at least 1997 where he was seen in John Major's entourage as the former prime minister gave his speech to concede defeat to Tony Blair in a huge landslide defeat. He would later become the elected chairman of Conservative Future between 2006 and 2008 and he also came to prominence in the Young Britons‚Äô Foundation as their director of outreach, an organisation headed by Donal Blaney at the time. He would also assume the nickname \\"Tatler Tory\\" after being tipped as a future Cabinet Minister by Tatler magazine.  2010 General election  Sadiq Khan who defeated Clarke in the 2010 General Election In 2010 Mark Clarke stood as the Conservative Party candidate for Tooting; an election he would go on to lose to Sadiq Khan, a Labour Party MP by 2,524 votes. However his election campaign was not without incident with an article appearing in The Daily Mirror newspaper which published allegations, which Clarke would deny, from Naaz Coker, chairman of St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, which said Clarke had \\"made 'inaccurate' and 'unfounded' claims to 'undermine' patients' confidence in their local health service.\\" During this election campaign, it was widely alleged that Clarke had an affair with an MP's staff member, India Brummitt, an allegation that he denied. After this election loss Clarke was not reappointed to the Conservative Party parliamentary candidates list.  Road Trip group Clarke independently established the Road Trip campaigning group, which later received the endorsement of Conservative Campaign Headquarters and then Party Chairman Grant Shapps MP. It featured predominantly in the 2015 General Election and organised bus-loads of predominantly young party members to campaign in key marginal seats. Some local Conservatives however regarded Road Trip assistance as \\"chaotic and useless\\". When the accusations of serious misconduct during the Road Trip sessions began to appear in the national media in September 2015, Road Trip activity was suspended and later formally disbanded.  Controversy and political scandal Allegations and response Clarke has repeatedly denied allegations against him of misconduct and criminal activity that contributed to widespread national media coverage after the death of Elliott Johnson. Most of the national media which covered the stories surrounding Johnson's death, and subsequent stories of misconduct and criminal activity happening during the Road Trip campaign, have quoted either directly or indirectly Clarke's rebuttal that all allegations against him are false: In the context of reporting by Rajeev Syal, Jamie Grierson, and Rowena Mason of The Guardian on the sexual harassment and assault allegations, Clarke is reported as well to have \\"vigorously denied any wrongdoing.\\" Nevertheless, reputable media outlets continued to publish allegations centred on Clarke's activities, which included: *Bullying, harassing and threatening young members of the Party in his duty of care. *Filming party activists, including MPs, engaged in sexual activity to use as blackmail collateral; *Adultery, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Suspension of the Conservative Future National Executive Committee After the suicide of Conservative Party activist Elliott Johnson, quick measures were enacted to close down the activities of organisations and people who were alleged to have failed in their duty of care of young activists or were implicated in the bullying of them. The first measure was to immediately ban some activists, including Mark Clarke and Andre Walker, an associate of his and fellow activist, from attending the annual Conservative Party Conference in 2015. Robert Halfon MP Further to this, it was reported on 20 November 2015 that the entire National Executive Committee of Conservative Future had been suspended over some scandals which overlapped with allegations of criminal activity occurring on Road Trip and allegedly perpetrated by Mark Clarke. Aside from the interrelationship between Conservative Future activists and Road Trip activities, the most prominent of the allegations was that of Alexandra Paterson, the Conservative Future chairman, and her alleged affair with Robert Halfon MP. In this episode it was alleged that Mark Clarke had orchestrated a plot to record documentary evidence of Paterson and Halfon having an affair. Halfon is reported to have discovered an attempt to blackmail him and reported the news to Downing Street. With the Tatler Tory scandal seemingly pervading into more senior ranks of the Conservative Party it was deemed that the National Executive of Conservative Future had not delivered a reasonable duty of care to its members nor acted with propriety. The Conservative Future National Executive Committee was suspended and the Party installed Baroness Chisolm of Owlpen and Chloe Smith MP, two senior Party officials, to oversee the new governance of the organisation. One of their first actions was to write to all regional Conservative Future branches asking them to immediately cancel any social functions they had organised over the Christmas period stating that it would be improper for such events to continue. Resignation of UK International Development Minister Grant Shapps MP On 29 November 2015 Grant Shapps, who had previously held office as the co-Chairman of the Conservative Party, resigned as International Development Minister over the scandal centred around Mark Clarke's reintroduction to the Conservative Campaign Headquarters, for which he had admitted responsibility. Shapps had previously asserted he was unaware of the seriousness of the allegations of Clarke's alleged misconduct with the youth volunteers in the Party, however his predecessor as chairman of the Conservative Party, Sayeeda Warsi, produced a letter that she had written to him making similar concerns clear and asking for him to take action to prevent Clarke's future involvement. Cancellation of Young Britons' Foundation annual conference On 7 December 2015 an interview was held on LBC radio between Iain Dale and Donal Blaney, the founder and head of the Young Britons' Foundation, where Blaney admitted BBC Newsnight reporters were investigating if YBF female delegates had been sexually assaulted by Clarke. Blaney, who had previously awarded Clarke YBF's most prestigious honour for upholding the principles he was taught in the foundation and for his Road Trip 2015 activity, said he regretted ever being friends with Clarke and wished he had never met him. The YBF annual conference, which has attracted illustrious speakers from politics, but has been described as a radicalising organisation akin to a Tory madrasa by former Conservative Party leadership candidate David Davis, lost all six of its ministerial keynote speakers after the allegations of Clarke became national news. Around the same time, for reasons Blaney said were to protect the young delegates from media intrusion, the annual conference was cancelled. Resignation of senior figures at Conservative Way Forward On 20 December 2015 it was reported that both Donal Blaney and Paul Abbott had resigned from the Thatcherite think-tank and pressure group Conservative Way Forward, at the time of their resignations they were both chairman and chief executive respectively. A statement issued by a spokesman for Blaney refuted the resignation was related to anything other than his need to spend more time caring for his wife and concentrating on business interests in USA. Abbott was said to want a six-month break from politics. Previous to their resignations, both Blaney and Abbott had become entangled in the Tatler Tory scandal, having received media attention and questions about their making redundant Elliott Johnson two weeks before he committed suicide; Blaney also became focus of an LBC interview with Iain Dale where his formerly close connections with Mark Clarke were scrutinised, and his being the founder of Young Britons' Foundation which was alleged to be a radicalising force in right wing youth political training and educated some of the protagonists of the Tatler Tory scandal, including Mark Clarke. The Guardian newspaper quoted an unnamed source at Conservative Way Forward stating that a contributing factor to both Blaney's and Abbott's resignations was the pressure caused over Elliott Johnson's death: \\"My understanding is they're stepping down from those roles. I think a lot of the pressure that‚Äôs been created with what happened to Elliott has put quite a bit of strain on both of them. They‚Äôve both got private lives and family being caught up in the pressure of this.\\" Paul Abbott, who was formerly the chief of staff for Grant Shapps MP, who in turn resigned on 29 November over his role in the reintroduction of Mark Clarke into the Conservative Party, was thanked by the Johnson family for his assistance in helping them understand the circumstances around Elliott's death.  Outcomes of official investigations into wrongdoing  The allegations of common assault and blackmail that faced Clarke after the death of Elliott Johnson were considered by the police, but after investigation by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) it was decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. On 9 February 2016 a CPS spokesman said: \\"Having considered the evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors we have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to charge Mark Clarke with offences of common assault or blackmail against Elliott Johnson and we have advised that no further action be taken\\". In response to this, Johnson's family said they would appeal against the CPS decision and would consider launching a private harassment case especially as harassment had not been considered by the CPS. An appeal was lodged and with publicity from The Mirror and Daily Mail it was reported on 11 February that a new case for charges of harassment against Clarke was being considered.  Conservative Party ban  On 18 November 2015, it was reported that Clarke had been expelled from the Conservative Party and given a lifetime ban. The details of the order were to ensure Clarke could never represent, or stand as candidate in any election for, the Conservative Party in his lifetime.  Media coverage  Clarke's role in the foregoing matters has been examined by a number of radio and television programmes, including Newsnight.  Make Me A Tory  Clarke was a protagonist of Make Me a Tory, a 2007 Channel 4 documentary that also featured future Prime Minister David Cameron. In the documentary he was one of several prominent campaigners for the Conservative Party who sought to change the mind of the documentary maker, a lifelong Labour Party supporter.Make Me A Tory. Daniel Cormack (2007), Episode 6. Channel 4, 13 May 2007. ISAN: 0000-0001-CE47-0000-J-0000-0000-H  Newsnight  Ben Howlett MP On 18 November 2015, Clarke was the focus of an investigative feature on BBC's flagship current affairs programme Newsnight. During the episode his contemporary, Conservative MP Ben Howlett, spoke about his personal efforts to counter institutional bullying in the youth wing of the Party. A further Newsnight programme, aired on 8 December 2015, focused on allegations that the chairman of the Conservative Party, Lord Feldman, knew from as early as 2010 about allegations of institutional bullying in the Party's youth wing and that a twenty-page dossier was handed to him and Sayeeda Warsi by two activists naming several perpetrators, one of which was Mark Clarke.  BBC Radio 4  On 29 November 2015, a special thirteen-minute profile on Mark Clarke was aired on BBC's flagship current affairs radio channel, Radio 4. The programme was an exploration of the reasons that resignations were occurring and being sought in some of the highest offices in the Conservative Party and government; it included discussion of the then-recent resignation of the International Development Minister. The documentary also contained assertions that Clarke's political activities may well have tipped the balance of the General Election in favour of the Conservatives, but also that he had quickly become \\"the disappearing man of British politics\\" owing to the reluctance of his former associates to defend him in the press, concluding that \\"the former Chairman of Conservative Future now has no Future in the Conservative Party.\\"  Personal life  Clarke is married to Sarah, an NHS employee, and has two children. Prior to Clarke's marriage, he was in a relationship with Justine Greening, an MP (she stepped down in 2019), Secretary of State for International Development (from 4 September 2012) and, from 2016 to 2018, Secretary of State for Education. In 2015, allegations accusing Clarke of serial infidelity were published in British newspapers, including that he had a long-term affair with India Brummitt, a former Conservative Future executive committee member, accusations that Clarke denied.

According to Turkey, the aircraft was fired upon while in Turkish airspace because it violated the border up to a depth of for about 17 seconds after being warned to change its heading 10 times over a period of five minutes before entering the airspace. The Russia Defence Ministry denied the aircraft ever left Syrian airspace, counter-claiming that their satellite data showed that the Sukhoi was about inside Syrian airspace when it was shot down. The U.S. State Department said that the U.S. independently confirmed that the aircraft's flight path violated Turkish territory, and that the Turks gave multiple warnings to the pilot, to which they received no response and released audio recordings of the warnings they had broadcast. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pointed out that Turkey had the right to defend its airspace. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that the U.S. knew the flight path of the Russian jet and should have informed Turkey; two U.S. officials said that Russia did not inform the U.S. military of its jet's flight plan.Phil Stewart, Russia didn't give downed jet's flight plan to U.S.: U.S. officials, Reuters (27 November 2015). The Russian pilot and weapon systems officer both ejected from the aircraft. The weapon systems officer was rescued; the pilot was shot and killed by Syrian rebel ground fire while descending by parachute. A Russian naval infantryman from the search and rescue team launched to retrieve the two airmen was also killed when a rescue helicopter was targeted by the rebels. The shooting down of the Sukhoi Su-24M was the first destruction of a Russian or Soviet Air Forces warplane by a NATO member state since the attack on the Sui-ho Dam (during the Korean War). Reactions to the incident included denunciation from Russia and an attempt to defuse the situation by NATO afterwards. Russia deployed the guided missile cruiser Moskva armed with S-300F (SA-N-6 Grumble) long-range SAM missiles off the Syrian coast near Latakia and S-400 (SA-21 Growler) mobile SAM systems to Khmeimim airbase. In response, the Turkish Armed Forces deployed the KORAL land-based radar electronic support system in Hatay Province along the Turkish‚ÄìSyrian border. Background Erdoƒüan (left) and Putin at the G-20 summit in Antalya on 15 November 2015. After the 2012 shooting down of a Turkish jet by Syrian forces, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoƒüan protested, saying that brief incursions should not trigger an attack, pointing out that Turkey did not shoot down Syrian helicopters that strayed into Turkish airspace. Nevertheless, as a response to the event he announced that Turkey changed its rules of engagement, and said it would start to consider all \\"military elements\\" approaching from Syria an enemy threat and would act accordingly. Subsequently, Turkey shot down a Syrian Mi-17 helicopter in September 2013 and a MiG-23 warplane in March 2014. Russia is one of several countries directly involved in the Syrian conflict. On 30 September 2015, Russia began its air campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other anti-government forces. In early October, Turkey and NATO protested against what they saw as Russia's deliberate violations of Turkish airspace. The Russian Defence Ministry admitted that a Russian Su-30 aircraft had entered Turkish airspace \\"for a few seconds\\" because of bad weather, adding that measures had been taken to prevent a repeat of such incidents, however Turkish radar had tracked the aircraft straying into Turkish airspace for up to lasting \\"several minutes\\". From 3‚Äì15 October, five discussions between senior ranking officials from Turkey and Russia occurred, concerning Turkish rules of engagement and Russian violations of Turkish airspace. On 6 November 2015, six U.S. Air Force F-15C fighters were deployed by US European Command from the 48th Fighter Wing at their Lakenheath base in Britain to Incirlik Air Base as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The Government of Turkey requested these to secure the sovereignty of Turkish airspace because of earlier repeated Russian intrusions into Turkish airspace. On 19 November, Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov and the Russian military attach√© Colonel Andrei Victorovich Dovger were summoned by Turkey. Russia, which was criticised by Turkey for having conducted operations near the Turkish border, a region inhabited by Syrian Turkmen and largely free of ISIL (though al-Nusra Front, the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, is present in the region), was notified that Turkey's rules of engagement were in place and it would react to any violations of its border security. Turkey also warned Russia that it would not be indifferent to \\"attacks targeting the life security of Turkmen\\" in the Bayƒ±rbucak area. The preceding week Turkey had called for the UN Security Council to discuss attacks against Turkish-backed Turkmens. Approximately 1,700 people had fled the area in the previous three days due to battles between Syrian government forces and anti-government Syrian Turkmen and al- Nusra Front fighters. Russia has bombed the area near the Turkish border to support Syrian government forces. Syrian Turkmen formed their own armed brigades called Syrian Turkmen Brigades in opposition to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, loosely affiliated with other rebels such as the Free Syrian Army. The Turkmen brigades also cooperate with al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate the al-Nusra Front and with the Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al- Sham. In Latakia the Turkish-supported rebels formed the Jabal al-Turkman Brigade. The shootdown Approximate flight paths according to the Turkish and Russian forces. On 24 November 2015 at 9:24 am, as it was returning to Khmeimim airbase, a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft with tail number 83 was shot down near the Syrian‚ÄìTurkish border by an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile from a patrolling Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet. Later analysis suggested that a radar guided medium range AIM-120 AMRAAM was responsible for the shot being fired between 9 and 12 miles away.https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/heres-reason-why-russian-aircraft- keep-dying-syria-128527 The Economist reported that the two Su-24s were on their way to strike Syrian Turkmen targets. Syrian government forces supported by the Shiite militias and the Russian Air Force were fighting against Syrian Turkmen brigades, Army of Conquest and al-Nusra Front fighters. Early reports from Russian news agencies citing the Russian Defence Ministry, indicated that the aircraft had been downed by a ground-based strike from Syrian Turkmen rebels, but they later confirmed Turkish reports that the aircraft had been shot down by Turkish fighter jets. The Turkish military released a graphic of the Russian aircraft's flight pattern, which shows it crossing the southern tip of Hatay Province before being shot down and crashing near Turkmen Mountain. Russia then countered Turkey's radar trace analysis by publishing a different flight map showing no airspace violation. Three days later, on 27 November, Russia published another map. According to Turkey's statement to the UN Security Council, two aircraft, whose nationalities were unknown at the time, violated Turkish airspace up to a depth of for about 17 seconds. According to Turkish officials, the aircraft were given 10 warnings within the span of 5 minutes, by operators at a ground-controlled interception station, to change their course. Turkey later released the audio recording (\\"The unknown air traffic position to Humaymim 020 radial 26 miles. This is Turkish Air Force speaking on Guard. You are approaching Turkish airspace, change your heading south immediately\\"). The Russians claim there were no warnings. Analysts have noted that Turkey's warnings were issued on a dedicated mutually-agreed radio channel, which was the international Guard (emergency) channel (243.0 MHz), but the R-862M radio fitted to the Su-24M is not able to monitor this channel without optional equipment, which may not have been installed. According to Turkey, one aircraft left Turkish national airspace after violating it; the other aircraft was fired upon by Turkish F-16s patrolling the area and crashed into Syrian territory after being hit in Turkish airspace. Based on its heat signature, an anonymous American official stated that the jet was hit in Syrian airspace after a short incursion into Turkey. On 30 November, US Ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute stated that the data supported the Turkish version of events. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, the Su-24 was downed from an altitude of within one kilometre of the Turkish border and in Syrian airspace, while returning to the Khmeimim airbase in Syria. Russia has maintained that the aircraft never left Syrian territory. The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the aircraft was an Su-24 but said that it had proof the jet was within Syrian airspace. According to the commander- in-chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Viktor Bondarev, a Turkish F-16 entered Syria's airspace for 40 seconds and flew inside Syrian territory, but the Russian warplane did not violate the Turkish border. Casualties Repatriation of Oleg Peshkov's body at Chkalovsky Airport, 30 November 2015. Both pilots ejected after the aircraft was hit. Initially, the deputy commander of a Turkmen Syrian opposition rebel brigade in Syria, Alparslan √áelik (a Turkish citizen and member of the Grey Wolves ultra-nationalist group), claimed his forces had shot dead the two pilots as they descended with parachutes, and in a film a person could be heard in the background repeatedly shouting \\"Stop shooting!\\" in Turkish as the parachutists descended. A Turkish official reported that he believed both were alive. It was also reported that one of the pilots had been captured by the Turkmen fighters and a video was circulated which allegedly showed the pilot's body. Russia's military general staff spokesman Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoi confirmed that one pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Anatolyevich Peshkov, was killed by ground fire; the other pilot, who was the navigator, was rescued. The shooting of an ejecting aircraft pilot is in contravention of Article 42 of the 1977 additional protocol of the Geneva Convention. The pilot of the Su-24, Oleg Peshkov, 45, was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation, the country's highest military honour; the surviving weapon systems officer, Konstantin Murakhtin, and the killed rescuer, Alexander Pozynich, 29, received the Order of Courage. On 2 December Peshkov was buried with full military honours in the Alley of Heroes of the cemetery in Lipetsk with about 10,000 people attending. Search and rescue The Turkish state-owned Anadolu Agency showed video footage of the aircraft crashing and the two pilots parachuting down. Russian helicopters conducted low-altitude combat search and rescue flights in the area to look for the pilot. Two Mil Mi-8 helicopters were sent to find and recover the pilots from the crash site. One of the helicopters was damaged by small-arms fire from Syrian Turkmen Brigade militants, resulting in the death of a naval infantryman, and was forced to make an emergency landing. All the surviving crew of the helicopter were later rescued and evacuated. The Free Syrian Army's 1st Coastal Division claimed that they subsequently destroyed the abandoned helicopter using a US-made BGM-71 TOW missile. As the Russian armed forces began planning an operation to extract the pilot, the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani contacted them and proposed a joint rescue operation under his supervision. The rescue team which General Soleimani put forth consisted of eight Hezbollah special forces personnel and 18 Syrian commandos, who were trained by Iran and had firsthand knowledge of the geography of the area, with Russia providing transport, logistical support, air cover and satellite intelligence. One of the pilots, Oleg Peshkov, had been wounded and then killed by rebels after parachuting from the plane, while the other one, Konstantin Murahtin, escaped and was rescued. During the rescue mission a Russian Marine, Alexandr Pozynich, had been fatally wounded. The rescue team returned to base safely and handed over the pilot to the Syrian Army. Vladimir Putin was reportedly closely following the operation.http://m.sputniknews.com/middleeast/20151128/1030912844/qasem- soleimani-IRGC-syria-su-24-pilot.html The body of the dead pilot was flown to Turkey and Russian officials in Ankara arranged for its repatriation to Moscow. Aftermath Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu presents President Putin with the flight data recorder of the Su-24 On 25 November, the foreign ministers of Russia and Turkey spoke for an hour by telephone, and both governments stated that day that they would not initiate a war as a result of the incident. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists that his country would \\"seriously reevaluate\\" its relationship with Turkey. The Russian Defence Ministry broke off military contacts with the Turkish Armed Forces and Russian defence officials said that future airstrikes in Syria would be escorted by fighters. According to the Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu, Russia will deploy S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to Khmeimim airbase in Syria, where the Russian Aerospace Forces group is stationed. Reactions Involved parties A few hours after the incident, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke from Sochi, where he was meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, saying that it was a \\"stab in the back by terrorist accomplices,\\" that Russia would not put up with attacks like this one and that Russia‚ÄìTurkey relations would be affected. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was due to visit Turkey the next day, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan had scheduled a visit to Russia later in the year. Lavrov cancelled his trip after the incident. Lieutenant General Sergey Rudskoi said that forces threatening Russia would be targeted. Protesters pelted the Turkish embassy in Russia with eggs before police cleared the area. On 26 November, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced broad economic sanctions against Turkey that would affect their joint investment projects, including the possible shelving of a multibillion-dollar deal to build Turkish Stream gas pipeline through Turkey. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said that Turkey would regret its actions. Putin accused Turkey of helping ISIL in the illegal oil trade, saying that funds from the sale of oil were used to support terrorists. The Russian Air Force had recently started bombing the oil tankers en route to other countries, including Turkey, and the infrastructure for processing and storage of crude oil. Putin later claimed that the Turkish shoot-down was an \\"ambush\\" that had been prepared in advance. A bill making denial of the Armenian Genocide illegal has been introduced in the Russian State Duma. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said the shooting would be added to the criminal record of insurgent groups fighting in the country and of those countries that were financing and arming them; he mentioned Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the strongest such backers. Erdoƒüan pointed out that Turkey had the right to defend its airspace. He said worse incidents have not taken place in the past because of Turkey's restraint. He also stressed that Turkey's actions were fully in line with the new rules of engagement adopted after Syria shot down a Turkish jet in 2012. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu offered condolences and said the Turkish pilots did not know it was a Russian plane. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu defended the action saying Turkey has the right to defend itself against border violations, but that it did not amount to an aggression against any foreign territory and the country called for NATO to hold an extraordinary meeting later in the day. He further called for working towards solving the crisis in Syria. Davutoƒülu also said that attacks on Turkmen could not be legitimised under the justification of attacking ISIL. Turkey's Ambassador to the United States, Serdar Kilic, asked for Turkey's warnings to be taken seriously. Davutoglu said Turkey would cooperate but did not offer an apology. Dozens of protesters were reported outside the Russian consulate in Istanbul demonstrating against Russian military operations in the Turkmen-populated areas of Syria. Russian President Putin issued a decree within hours of Turkey's statement which placed a ban on trade of some goods, forbade extensions of labour contracts for Turks working in Russia as of 1 January 2016, ended chartered flights from Russia to Turkey, disallowed Russian tourism companies from selling holiday packages with a stay in Turkey, and called for ending visa-free travel between Russia and Turkey, while ordering tighter control over Turkish air carriers in Russia, using security as a justification. Russia started bombarding rebels ‚Äì including Turkmen insurgents ‚Äì in Latakia, ignoring demands made by Turkey over the previous week to end its military operations close to the Turkish border. A Turkmen commander said missiles fired from Russian warships in the Mediterranean were also hitting the area. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that as soon as the pilot was rescued the groups responsible for the attack had been killed by Russian bombing and Syrian government rocket artillery. A Turkish supply convoy, reportedly carrying small arms, machine-guns and ammunition, was bombed by what is believed to have been Russian airstrikes in the northwestern town of Azaz, in north-western Syria. Claimed as an aid convoy by the Turks, no organization has as yet confirmed that the convoy belonged to them. At least seven people died and ten people were injured as around 20 trucks went up in flames. Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency accused Russia of supporting the Kurdish YPG, PYD and Syrian Democratic Forces. On 25 November ‚Äì the day after the jet was shot down, a Russian lawmaker, Sergei Mironov, introduced a bill to the Russian parliament that would criminalize the denial of the Armenian Genocide, a political move that Turkey has strongly opposed when countries like France and Greece adopted similar laws. On 26 November, Russia deployed the guided missile cruiser Moskva armed with S-300F (SA-N-6 Grumble) long-range SAM missiles positioned off Latakia, off the Syrian coast and S-400 (SA-21 Growler) mobile SAM systems to Khmeimim airbase. The Russian military warned it would shoot down any aerial target that posed a threat to its planes. On 26 November, the Russian Ministry of Defence broke off contact with the Turkish military. All existing channels of communication between the two sides have been shut down, the ministry said. On 27 November, Russia announced that it had also suspended its participation in joint Black Sea naval drills indefinitely. The Russian navy's envoy in charge of coordinating the actions of Russia's Black Sea Fleet with the Turkish navy has reportedly been recalled. On 27 November, Russian Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Moscow will halt the existing visa-free regime starting on 1 January, saying that Turkey has become a conduit for terrorists and has been reluctant to share information with Moscow about Russian citizens accused of involvement in terrorist activities. On 28 November, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree imposing economic sanctions against Turkey. The decree, which came into force immediately, banned charter flights from Russia to Turkey, prevented tour firms selling holidays there, and outlawed some Turkish imports, and halted or curbed the economic activities of Turkish firms and nationals. On 2 December, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov said in a media briefing with foreign journalists that Turkey was the biggest buyer of \\"stolen\\" oil from Syria and Iraq and accused the family of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of being directly involved in the trade of petroleum with the Islamic State group. On 3 December, Putin referred to the incident during his annual state of the nation speech.Al Jazeera: \\"Putin: Turkey will regret downing jet 'more than once'\\". The Politicon, 3 December 2015 At his annual press conference on 17 December 2015, when asked about a third-party involvement in the current Russian-Turkish relations deteriorated by the shootdown of Russian Su-24, Vladimir Putin remarked \\"‚Ä¶if someone in the Turkish government decided to lick the Americans in a certain place, well I don't know then, was that the right decision or not?\\". On 23 December, Selahattin Demirta≈ü, co-leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), criticized Ankara's stance regarding a Russian jet shot down by Turkey. On 27 December, the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet published an interview with Alparslan √áelik who spoke about the downing. TASS reported that the Turkish militant had fought in Syria for two years. The Russian foreign ministry expressed surprise and indignation that a major Turkish newspaper had given floor to the \\"murderer and terrorist... filled with hatred towards Russia and the Russian people.\\" On 30 December, the Russian foreign ministry called for Ankara to arrest √áelik. In June 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin expressing sympathy and 'deep condolences' to the family of the victims. An investigation was also reopened into the suspected Turkish military personnel involved in the incident. Russian media interpreted the contents of the letter as an apology for downed aircraft. Three weeks later (in the meantime, there had been a coup d'√©tat attempt against him), Erdoƒüan announced in an interview that the two Turkish pilots who downed Russian aircraft were arrested on suspicion that they have links to the G√ºlen movement, and that a court should find out \\"the truth\\".http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com 21 July 2016 On 5 December 2016, Russian Academy of Sciences senior official Ruslan Kurbanov said the shootdown order was given by a G√ºlen movement follower Turkish colonel in Incirlik Air Base. Kurbanov further accused the movement of being CIA spy network that tried to destroy Russia‚ÄìTurkey relations with the shootdown.

In 1786, the Qing- appointed Governor of Taiwan, , discovered and suppressed the anti-Qing Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society). The Tiandihui members gathered Ming loyalists, and their leader proclaimed himself king. Many important people took part in this revolt and the insurgents quickly rose to 50,000 people. In less than a year, the rebels occupied almost the entire part of southern Taiwan. Hearing that the rebels had occupied most of Taiwan, Qing troops were sent to suppress them in a hurry. The eastern insurgents defeated the poorly organized troops and had to resist falling to the enemy. Finally, the Qing imperial court sent Fuk'anggan while , Counsellor of the Police, deployed nearly 3,000 people to fight the insurgents. These new troops were well equipped, disciplined and had combat experience which proved enough to route the insurgents. The Ming loyalists had lost the war and their leaders and remaining rebels hid among the locals. Lin Shuangwen, and other Tiandihui leaders had started a rebellion which at first was successful, and as many as 300,000 took part in the rebellion. The Qing general Fuk'anggan was sent to quell the rebellion with a force of 20,000 soldiers, which he accomplished. The campaign was relatively expensive for the Qing government, although Lin Shuangwen and Zhuang Datian were both captured. After the revolt ended, the Qianlong Emperor was forced to rethink the method of government for Taiwan. Lin, who was an immigrant from Zhangzhou, had come to Taiwan with his father in the 1770s. He was involved in the secret Heaven and Earth Society whose origins are not clear. Lin's father was detained by the local authorities, perhaps in suspicion of his activities with the society; Lin Shuangwen then organized the rest of the society members in a revolt in an attempt to free his father. There was initial success in pushing government forces out of Lin's home base in Changhua; his allies did likewise in Tamsui. By this point, the fighting was drawing in Zhangzhou people beyond just the society members, and activating the old feuds; this brought out Quanzhou networks (as well as Hakka) on behalf of the government. Eventually, the government sent sufficient force to restore order; Lin Shuangwen was executed and the Heaven and Earth Society was dispersed to mainland China or sent into hiding, but there was no way to eliminate ill-will between Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Hakka networks. Though they never again were serious to push out the government or encompass the whole island, feuds went on sporadically for most of the 19th century, only started coming to an end in the 1860s. There were more than a hundred rebellions during the early Qing. The frequency of rebellions, riots, and civil strife in Qing Taiwan is evoked by the common saying \\"every three years an uprising; every five years a rebellion\\" (‰∏âÂπ¥‰∏ÄÂèç„ÄÅ‰∫îÂπ¥‰∏Ä‰∫Ç). p. 10 The Manchu Aisin Gioro Prince Abatai's daughter was married to the Han Chinese General Li Yongfang ÊùéÊ∞∏Ëä≥.

The Rotherhithe crossing is a proposed route for pedestrians and cyclists across the River Thames in London, England between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf. A bridge was first proposed at this location by Sustrans in 2008. The construction contract was awarded to Atkins in 2018 and a vertical lift bridge design was selected in 2019. The project was paused in June of that year for budgetary reasons, Transport for London describing the construction of an opening bridge at the site as \\"complex\\" and unaffordable at that time. In July 2019 TFL made the decision to no longer progress a walking and cycling bridge between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf due to costs and affordability, TfL has been carrying out further work to develop a more affordable proposal for a ferry crossing.https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2020/march/tfl- starts-design-work-for-turn-up-and-go-ferry-between-rotherhithe-and-canary- wharf Initial studies The project is listed in the 2014 National Infrastructure PlanHM Treasury, National Infrastructure Plan para 5.16 and has received support from the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson,The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/24/revealed-the-new-thames- bridge-proposal-thats-a-no-brainer and by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The crossing is listed in the Transport for London (TfL) 2015 consultation of new river crossings as \\"A pedestrian and cycle crossing linking Rotherhithe to Canary Wharf.\\" Following the publication of Sustrans' feasibility study into a crossing at this location in 2016, it was reported that TfL, who had been working with Sustrans to develop this project, had plans to run a design competition later in 2016. Instead, however, initial market testing took place, with the actual procurement process later indicated to take place in 2017. TfL opened a public consultation on the crossing in November 2017. This sought public opinion on the preferred option of a moveable bridge, alongside alternatives including a tunnel but also an enhanced river ferry crossing. Public response to the consultation was in support of the crossing, with 93 per cent supporting proposals for any type of new crossing between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf, and 85% supporting TfL's preferred option of a navigable bridge. A potential tunnel was perceived by the public as likely to have greater costs and environmental impact compared to a bridge, and a free ferry service seen as cheaper, though possibly less likely to encourage as many trips. Former Bridge proposals The three proposed sites for the former bridge plans in the March 2018 consultation: the top site would join Nelson Dock Pier to Westferry Circus; the middle site would connect Durand's Wharf with Impound Lock; the bottom site would join Durand's Wharf to West India Dock The preferred location for the bridge identified in the feasibility study would be between the Impound Lock close to Cascades Tower on the northern (Canary Wharf) bank, and at Durand's Wharf park on the southern (Rotherhithe) bank. These would connect to Westferry Circus, Impound Lock or West India Dock. The Nelson Dock Pier to Westferry Circus connection received the most public support during the March 2018 consultation, with 79% being in favour, compared to 55% and 29% for the other links. The Jubilee line runs directly underneath the proposed bridge, with the nearest stations at Canada Water and Canary Wharf. The procurement process appointed Atkins to develop proposals for the crossing as part of an engineering and architectural contract. Proposals incorporated feedback from the November 2017 public consultation, before designs went out to further public consultation in summer 2018. In March 2019, TfL selected a vertical lift bridge design for the crossing, that if built would be the world's largest of its type. The route on the east would start at Durund's Wharf park and end between the original north and central alignments of the original proposal on the western bank. the bridge was expected to be the subject of a Transport and Works Act order by the end of that year, subject to consultation and further design work. In June 2019, TfL announced that it would pause work on the bridge due to its midpoint cost estimate of ¬£463m exceeding the ¬£350m allocation in the TfL Business Plan. Nearly ¬£10,000,000 was spent to date on the failed bridge attempt. https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/revealed-firms-who-cashed-in-on- canned-rotherhithe-crossing-02-09-2019/ Following the cancellation of the plans for a bridge river crossing, the chair of the London Assembly's Transport Committee, Navin Shah, asked how TfL had gotten its sums so wrong? https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/18291558.tfl-unveils-plans-turn-go- rotherhithe-canary-wharf-ferry-service/  Current Ferry proposal  TfL now proposes a clean, fast turn up and go ferry service with new specially designed boats and piers which will be as environmentally friendly as practicable.https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2020/march/tfl- starts-design-work-for-turn-up-and-go-ferry-between-rotherhithe-and-canary- wharf There is currently a Thames Clippers ferry shuttle, the Canary Wharf ‚Äì Rotherhithe Ferry, running a parallel course 250 metres north of the proposed bridge location. Work has begun looking at expanding this service and making it free of charge. https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/exclusive-first- look-rotherhithe-ferry-replace-shelved-600m-bridge-25-06-2019/ In June 2019, Thames Clippers issued a statement welcoming the news to pause plans to build the bridge and announcing that they had been working in partnership with Beckett Rankine and Aus Yachts on a proposed electric, fully accessible ferry cross-river solution which could be delivered at a relatively minimal cost, and sooner than a bridge. Thames Clippers suggest that this could be replicated further east along the Thames where other crossings were required. The Rotherhithe proposal is for three electric self-docking ferries each with a capacity of 150 passengers of which 50 could be cyclists. With all three ferries operating the interval between sailings would be 4 minutes giving a carrying capacity of 2,250 passengers an hour in each direction. rotherhithe to canary wharf artist impression march 2020 TfL is currently working with specialist consultants on designs for both the ferries, and pier locations. Sponsorship and subsidy options are also being considered, which could result in the service being free for customers to use.https://londonist.com/london/transport/ferry-between-rotherhithe-canary- wharf-tfl-plans A public consultation is due to be launched in summer 2020, with construction expected to begin in 2021.

He currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority and President of South-East Asia Center. In 1998, Sen was nominated by President Bill Clinton and confirmed by the United States Senate as the Director of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the U.S. Department of Transportation. His research has centered on the ways in which mathematical theories can help analyze human movement within any given space. Early life and education Sen was born in Delhi in 1942 and raised in Dacca, New Delhi and Calcutta. He went to Loretto House, St. Columba's School, St. Xavier's College and later completed his bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Calcutta. After that, he went to Canada and earned his doctorate in 1971 from the University of Toronto.  Career  From 1969 through 1998, Sen worked as a professor and as an administrator at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle and its successor institution, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Besides teaching, Sen served, at certain times, as Dean and as Director of the School of Urban Sciences and later as Director of the School of Urban Planning. While at UIC, he wrote the proposal which resulted in the creation of the Urban Transportation Center. Sen became its director in 1996. He published extensively, including planning manuals for paratransit and transit. He also wrote two books. In the late 1980s, Sen worked on the ADVANCE project, a major research project on car navigation systems. In 1980, Sen went on leave from UIC to work for the Government of India Planning Commission under the leadership of Manmohan Singh. In 1990, Sen was appointed to the Chicago Board of Education, where he chaired the Real Estate and later the Budget/Finance Committees. In 1998, President Bill Clinton nominated Sen as the Director of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the Department of Transportation. The responsibility of the Bureau was to collect and analyze data related to transportation to help improve the national transportation system. During this time, he served on the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board and was the lead author of Changing Face of Transportation, the Clinton Administration's transportation legacy document, which reviewed the last 25 years of transportation and speculated on the next 25. He chaired the DOT-NASA Committee on Remote Sensing. Sen is active in the political activities of the Asian diaspora in America.

CircuitMaker is available as freeware, and the hardware designed with it may be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes without limitations. It is currently available publicly as version 1.3 by Altium Limited, with the first non-beta release on January 17, 2016.  History   MicroCode CircuitMaker  CircuitMaker, TraxMaker and SimCode were originally developed by the Orem- based MicroCode Engineering, Inc. since 1988. CircuitMaker 5 for Windows 3.1, 9x and NT became available in 1997, CircuitMaker 6, CircuitMaker PRO, TraxMaker 3 and TraxMaker PRO in 1998.  Protel CircuitMaker  Electronic design automation software (EDA) developer Protel marketed CircuitMaker 2000 as a schematic capture tool, together with TraxMaker as its PCB layout counterpart, as a powerful yet affordable solution for circuit board needs. Its ease of use and comparatively low cost quickly gained it popularity among students, and the software suite was commonly used to teach circuit board design to engineering students in universities. The wide availability of plug- ins and component libraries have accelerated adoption, and quickly amassed a worldwide community. When Protel was renamed Altium Limited in the early 2000s, engineering efforts were redirected towards the development of DXP 2004, and CircuitMaker 2000 was eventually discontinued. Due to its new status as abandonware, CircuitMaker 2000 remained popular among hobby users and students. This popularity has been observed by Altium, and the most successful features of CircuitMaker 2000 have since been integrated in DXP 2004 and later were incorporated into Altium Designer.  Altium CircuitMaker  Open source hardware and easy-to-use development boards such as the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi have increased community interest in electronics, particularly in fablabs, hackerspaces and makerspaces. The leading EDA software vendors traditionally lack free versions, and professional licenses are unaffordable for amateurs. This resulted in high piracy rates for professional software packages, or users sticking to outdated software, including CircuitMaker 2000. Several initiatives such as EAGLE have attempted to fill this void, releasing restricted versions of semi-professional EDA tools. The rise of KiCad further fragmented the market. This pressure eventually provided the incentive for Altium to release a simplified and more user friendly version of their professional EDA software package and flagship product, Altium Designer, targeted at less complex circuit board projects. This culminated into the rebirth of CircuitMaker as schematic capture and PCB design software. How To Create A Professional Schematic Despite the resemblance in naming, the current CircuitMaker differs entirely from CircuitMaker 2000 regarding features and graphical user interface: the SPICE simulation module has been removed; the library system has been overhauled; and the controls changed from classic menus to a more modern and visually appealing ribbon interface.  Merge with Upverter  On 14 May 2018, Altium announced plans to merge CircuitMaker and Upverter into a single, free to use design platform. However, in a blog post on May 11, 2019, Altium COO Ted Pawela stated that the plans had evolved, and the products would remain separate, with interoperability features for the design files.  Features  CircuitMaker implements schematic capture and PCB design using the same engine as Altium Designer, providing an almost identical user experience. The schematic editor includes basic component placement and circuit design as well as advanced multi-channel design and hierarchical schematics. All schematics are uploaded to the Altium server and can be viewed by anyone with a CircuitMaker account, stimulating design re-use. CircuitMaker supports integration with the Octopart search engine and allows drag and drop placement of components from the Octopart search results if schematic models are attached to them. Users can build missing schematic symbols and commit them to the server, called the Community Vault, making them available for other users. The continuously growing part database eliminates the need for a custom schematic symbol or footprint design for common parts, increasing user- friendliness for beginners. Concurrency editing was added in version 1.3, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a schematic or PCB document simultaneously and exchange thoughts through an integrated comment and annotation system. Transfer of schematics to a PCB is a straightforward process in CircuitMaker since PCB footprints are automatically attached to any component on the schematic that was picked from the Octopart library. PCB footprints may have simple 3D models or complex STEP models attached to them, enabling real time 3D rendering of the PCB during development. CircuitMaker supports design rule configuration and real time design rule checking. Some advanced features, including differential pair routing, interactive length tuning, and polygon pour management, are also available. Production files can be exported directly, although an external Gerber viewer must be used to check the exports. The entire PCB can also be exported as a 3D STEP model for further use in mechanical 3D CAD software.  Open source hardware  CircuitMaker requires a free account to represent its users in the community. An active internet connection is required to start and use the software. Users are allowed to have 2 private projects, the so-called sandbox mode for practicing. By default, all schematics and PCBs are uploaded to the server and can be viewed by other users as soon as they are committed through the internal svn engine. While this renders CircuitMaker undesirable for closed source projects, it encourages collaboration in the community. Users are allowed to fork existing projects, or request permission to collaborate in existing projects. Importing schematic documents and PCBs from other EDA packages (OrCAD, PADS, P-CAD, EAGLE) is supported. Users are allowed to own unlimited projects, and there is no hard limit on board complexity. However, Altium warns that users may experience a performance drop for large projects. All documents are under version control by default, allowing users to revert changes made in their projects, and build new versions of existing schematic symbols or footprints in the Community Vault. Users can comment on each other's projects and parts, rate them, and propose improvements. CircuitMaker supports direct generation of production files in industry standard formats such as Gerber and NC Drill, as well as printing of stencils for DIY circuit board etching.  Online community  As of April 2017, there are over 110,000 registered users within the CircuitMaker Community, together authoring over 12 000 PCB projects. The ease of use has led to rapid adoption of CircuitMaker by schools and universities to teach PCB design.  Criticism  As a result of its reliance on the Altium Designer schematic capture and PCB design engine, CircuitMaker is only available for the Windows operating system. This requires users to have access to a Windows license to use CircuitMaker. Dependence on Windows has been cited as a weakness of the CircuitMaker project, and Altium had reported to current users that a cross-platform solution is in development. As of 2020, CircuitMaker can be run in Wine on Ubuntu, with limitations, but the installation procedure is cumbersome, and many users reported it does not work on their Linux distribution. This currently forces most users to fall back to a complete virtual machine. Unofficial support for Linux and BSD users is provided by Altium staff and volunteers on the CircuitMaker forum. The effort to develop a cross platform desktop client seems to have been abandoned since the acquisition of Upverter. CircuitMaker currently does not install or run on ReactOS due to a .NET Framework related error. A second concern is the lock-in resulting from CircuitMaker's cloud centric approach. While users can import resources from competing EDA software packages, CircuitMaker does not support exporting design resources itself. Reviewers consider this in conflict with the open source ideology. However, a workaround for this issue is provided by Altium Designer 15 and 16 which do support the import of CircuitMaker files. A trial version of Altium Designer can be requested free of charge from Altium for this purpose. The community has developed pathways to share schematic symbols and footprints between CircuitMaker, Altium Designer, and CircuitStudio despite the lack of official Altium support.

Dustiness is affected by the particle shape, size, and inherent electrostatic forces. Dustiness increases the risk of inhalation exposure. Dusty materials tend to generate aerosols with high particle concentrations measured in number or in mass. The tendency of powdered materials to release airborne particles under external energies indicates their dustiness level. The dusty level of powders directly affects worker exposure scenarios and associated health risks in occupational settings. Powder-based aerosol particles can pose advert effects when deposited in human respiratory systems via inhalation.  Motivation  A significant motivation for quantifying and measuring the dustiness of materials comes from the area of workplace safety. The potential health impacts of suspended particles, particularly by inhalation, can be significant.  Dustiness testing  The amount of dust produced during handling or processing of a powder can be affected by the nature of the handling process, the ambient humidity, the particle size and water content of the powder, and other factors. To measure dustiness of a particular powder in a replicable way, standardized testing procedures have been created and published.  European Committee for Standardization - Continuous Drop and Rotating Drum  Various laboratory systems have been developed to test dustiness of fine powders. A European standard on dustiness testing has been established by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) since April 2006. This standard is especially related to human exposure in workplace (EN 15051). It describes two methods: the rotating drum system and continuous drop system, both of which use gravity to stimulate the material and generate aerosols. The rotating drum method involves placing the powder in a cylinder containing baffles, while the continuous drop system involves allowing a stream of powder to fall onto a surface. While the drum approach has been successfully scaled down by some researchers, published standards call for tens or hundreds of grams of material, a stipulation that can prove problematic for nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals and other expensive powders.  Aerosol generation system  Recently, an aerosol generation system based on laboratory funnel (resembling a fluidized bed) has been developed, which has the potential to become an alternative or supplementary method to the existing systems in dustiness testing. Its performance was compared to other three aerosolization systems using the same test materials. Nanomaterials dustiness The dustiness of the nanomaterials can influence potential exposures and the selection of the appropriate engineering control during the manufacturing production. Electrostatic forces influence the stability of particle dispersion in air and effect the dustiness. Nanomaterials in dry powder form tend to pose the greatest risk for inhalation exposure, while nanomaterials suspended in a liquid typically present less risk via inhalation. Safety measures  The full life cycle of a nanomaterial should be considered when planning to control for dust exposure. Nanomaterial synthesis reactors, nanoparticle collection and handling, product fabrication with nanomaterials, product use, and product disposal are potential sources of dust exposure. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters on local exhaust ventilation, laboratory chemical hoods, lowflow enclosures, and any other containment enclosures as a best practice during the handling of engineered nanomaterials.

Preu√üisches Allgemeines Landrecht  The Preu√üisches Allgemeines Landrecht (ALR) of 1794 (English Prussian General Land Law) applied to Prussian state territory. Legal provisions for burgher classes (‚ÄûB√ºrgerst√§nde‚Äú) could be found in Eighth Title (Achter Titel). This comprised rules for craftsmen (Handwerker) (¬ß¬ß 179 to 400) in addition to these for artists and fabricants (K√ºnstler und Fabrikanten) (¬ß¬ß 401 to 423) and for merchants (¬ß¬ß 475 to 712).

French Code de commerce of 1808 ruled.  Particular law und Common law  Apart from that Particular law (Patrikularrecht) or subsidiary Common law, here ius commune, (Gemeines Recht) were applied.(German) Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner L√ºck, Dieter Werkm√ºller (Hrsg.), Handw√∂rterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte, www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).  Draft of 1849  Preliminary works for ADHGB can be traced back to 1848/49. Already Paulskirche Constitution of 28 March 1849 provided in ¬ß 64 inter alia establishing a General Commercial Code. On 2 December 1848 a commission had started preparations previously. In March 1849 finally the ‚ÄûEntwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches f√ºr Deutschland‚Äú (Draft of a general commercial code for Germany)(German) Theodor Baums: Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches f√ºr Deutschland (1848/1849), Heidelberg 1982, p. 59 ff.; Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches f√ºr Deutschland, Frankfurt a.M. 1849. was presented. After the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV had rejected the imperial crown, that he was offered on 4 April 1849, the constitutional project miscarried. In the same year Commission dissolved.  The ADHGB  Nuremberg HGB-Commission  On a proposal from the Kingdom of Bavaria the Federal Convention (Bundesversammlung also Bundestag) of the German Confederation establish a commission, that should elaborate a commercial code. That was 21 February 1856. King Maximilian II Joseph of Bavaria is said to have motivated the project in person.(German) Christoph Bergfeld: Preu√üen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), . 101 (107) Fn. 9. The Prussian deputy for the Federal Convention Otto von Bismarck thereby voted not against the application against, what contravene with the instruction form the Prussian Prime Minister Otto Theodor von Manteuffel (German) ibid., p. 101 (108). Also on the suggestion of Bismarck not Frankfurt am Main, Federal Assembly's official seat, but the ancient trading town Nuremberg was chosen as conference venue.(German) ibid. p. 101 (109). So the working group should go down in history as Nuremberg HGB-Commission (N√ºrnberger HGB-Kommission).(German) Cf. only Karsten Schmidt, in: Karsten Schmdit, M√ºnchener Kommentar zum HGB, 3. Auflage, M√ºnchen 2010, Vorbemerkungen zu ¬ß 1 Rz. 21. The commission presided by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice Friedrich von Ringelmann was in session as of January 1857. Also numerous merchants belonged to the commission.(German) Christoph Bergfeld: Preu√üen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (110). German mercantile community and jurists thereby pronounced against Code de commerce as a model for ADHGB, because it was pre-industrial characterized and thus been overtaken by circumstances.(German) Ibid., p. 101 (108 et seq.). Instead a Prussian draft war favoured as a working basis.  Resolution on ADHGB  On 31 May 1861 this \\"Nuremberg Draft\\" (‚ÄûN√ºrnberger Entwurf‚Äú)(German) Gerhard K√∂bler: Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte ‚Äì Ein systematischer Grundriss, 6. Aufl., M√ºnchen 2005. of an Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was recommended to be introduced in the individual states by the General Assembly of the German Confederation.(German) Hartmut Oetker, in: Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, Mathias Habersack, Carsten Sch√§fer (Hrsg.) Staub HGB, Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Einleitung Rz. 5. As of 1861 ADHGB apllied in German Confederation¬¥s member states as inentical right. Some federal states, like the Free City of Hamburg, even declared ADHGB applicable for legal transactions (Rechtsgesch√§fte) without merchant participation.(German) Christoph Bergfeld: Preu√üen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (113).  Development after 1866  German Confederation was dissolved in Augsburg on 23 August 1866. ADHGB persisted in the former federal states.  Germany  Announcement for the North German Confederation (1869) North German Confederation took over ADHGB by federal act (Bundesgesetz) on 5 June 1869.(German)Bundesgesetzblatt of North German Confederation 1869 p. 379 - 381. ADHGB remained in force in German Empire in accordance with Imperial Act (Reichsgesetz) of 16 April 1871.(German) Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63; The Act of 22 April 1871 ordered that for the Kingdom of Bavaria, Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63. Supreme court for the interpretation of ADHGB was Reichoberhandelsgericht (ROHG, English Imperial Higher Commercial Court, until 1871 Bundesoberhandelsgericht, English Federal Higher Commercial Court\\"), that later was merged in Reichsgericht (english Imperial Court of Justice). ADHGB was replaced in German Empire by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, English Commercial Code), that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB) on 1 January 1900.  Austria  The ADHGB was introduced as Allgemeines Handelsgesetzbuch (AHGB) (english General Commercial Code) in the Empire of Austria on 1863(√∂sterreichisches Reichsgesetzblatt 1/1863). After establishment of the Republic of Austria it was applied until the annexation to the German Realm on 13 M√§rch 1938. Then it was gradually replaced by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB).  Liechtenstein  The Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was assumed by the Principality of Liechtenstein by the act of 16 Septembre 1865. To the present day its binding law.(German) Kundmachung vom 21. Oktober 1997 des Allgemeinen deutschen Handelsgesetzbuches, LGBl. 1997 Nr. 193. The ADHGB was originally announced by the act of 16 Septembre 1865, Landesgesetzblatt 10/1865 Large parts however were replaced by the Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht (PGR, English Personal and Corporation Law) on 19 February 1926. The ADHGB has still practical significance for the sectors procurators (Prokuristen), authorized representative (Handlungsbevollm√§chtigte), commercial brokers (Handelsm√§kler) and trading activities (Handelsgesch√§fte).(German) Elisabeth Berger: Rezeption im liechtensteinischen Privatrecht unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des ABGB, 2.

November 2015). ADHGB pursues preponderantly an objektive system represented by Levin Goldschmidt, that defines merchant (Kaufmann) objektive by means of legally standardized trading activities (Handelsgesch√§fte). Orientation on professional conduct according to Johann Heinrich Th√∂l was clearly rejected.  Reception   Germany  In the absence of a \\"Allgemeines Deutsches B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch\\" (english General German Civil Code) ADHGB included also general rules for representation (Stellvertretung) (Art. 52-56 ADHGB), fulfilling (Erf√ºllung) (Art. 324-336 ADHGB) and purchase agreement (Kaufvertrag) (Art. 337-359 ADHGB), that should be \\"a landmark template\\" (‚Äûrichtungweisende Vorlage‚Äú) for future B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB).(German) Oetker, Hartmut, in: Canaris, Claus-Wilhelm /Habersack, Mathias /Sch√§fer, Carsten (Hrsg.)

He moved to Glasgow to find employment shortly before his father's death, and his younger siblings then moved in with him.Eric Taplin, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VI, pp.150-152 Highly religious in his youth, Kessack became a socialist after hearing Robert Smillie speak at the 1901 North East Lanarkshire by-election. Sam MacDonald of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) noticed Kessack's speaking ability and persuaded him to join, and Kessack later joined the Socialist Labour Party, Industrial Workers of the World and then was a founder member of the Advocates of Industrial Unionism. He resigned from the SLP after the party forbade members from speaking at meetings of any other group, but remained prominent in the ILP, and the group sponsored his unsuccessful candidatures for the Labour Party at both the January and December 1910 general elections in Glasgow Camlachie. Kessack became the national organiser of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) in 1909, replacing James Larkin. Although during his first couple of years, membership of the union fell in Scotland, he managed to recruit large numbers of new members in the Humber ports, and was regarded as a successful figure. However, he left his post in 1914 to join the Scottish Horse regiment of the British Army. He was promoted to become a captain, but was killed in the Battle of the Ancre in November 1916.

Currently, both her origin and her fate are obscure, though it is possible that she was launched at Hull in 1745 and was last listed in 1789. EIC voyages EIC voyage #1 (1769‚Äì71) Captain Henry Gardiner left The Downs on 6 June 1769, bound for Bengal and Madras. Lapwing left Kolkatta on 24 August 1770 and on 12 October was at Madras. She reached the Cape on 16 December and St Helena on 6 January 1771, and arrived back at The Downs on 16 April. Lapwing stopped at Falmouth before reaching The Downs and Captain Gardiner came overland to London. He brought the news that although Madras was quiet, a threat of war hung over Bengal. The Mogul emperor (Shah Alam II) had allied with the Marathas, and Sujah Dowla (the Nawab of Bengal), would require British assistance.The Perth magazine of knowledge and pleasure, p. 152. EIC voyage #2 (1771‚Äì73) Captain Gardiner sailed from Portsmouth on 2 September 1771, bound for Bengal. Lapwing reached False Bay on 25 November, and arrived at Calcutta on 23 April 1772. Homeward bound she was at Ingeli, a point on the west side of the Hooghli Estuary on 17 November. She left Bengal on 20 September and Madras on 14 October. She reached the Cape on 26 January 1773, St Helena on 16 February, and Ascension Island on 22 February. She arrived at Falmouth on 15 April, and returned to The Downs on 1 May. When Lapwing reached Falmouth her purser left her and travelled overland to India House in London. There he reported her arrival at Falmouth, and that Captain Gardiner was no longer with her. (He had sought employment with the Bengal Pilot Service.) The purser also reported that a terrible famine had descended on Bengal, killing an enormous number of people. Bad weather had destroyed the \\"fruits of the earth\\", and the country ships that normally brought provisions had not arrived.The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History, Politics, and Literature for the Year 1771 (1794), p.83.

She practiced largely in Boston and specialized in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Early life Sara Murray was born in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1884. Her father, Patrick Andrew Murray, was an Irish carriage-repair worker, while her mother, Maria Stuart, was of English and Scottish heritage. Sara Murray enrolled at Radcliffe College in 1901 and received a bachelor's degree in the classics in 1904. Although she aspired to study medicine, her parents dissuaded her, and so she completed a PhD in classical philology and archaeology at the University of Munich. She graduated in 1908 and her thesis, titled A Study of the Life of Andres, the Fool for the Sake of Christ, was published in 1910. She married Sebastian Jordan, a German lawyer, in 1913. Their daughter, Mary Stuart Jordan, was born in 1914, and Murray returned to the United States upon the outbreak of the First World War. She divorced Jordan in 1921. Medical career In 1917, Jordan decided to enroll in medical school; she was accepted into the Tufts University School of Medicine on probation under the agreement that she would study chemistry and zoology courses in addition to medicine. When her probation was not lifted despite her having completed the required extra courses, she called for an investigation by the American Medical Association (AMA) and her probation was lifted. As a student, she performed research on thyroid disease with Frank Lahey, and they co-authored a scientific paper before Jordan graduated in 1921. Jordan completed her internship at Worcester Memorial Hospital before moving to Chicago to train in gastroenterology with Bertram Welton Sippy at Rush Medical College. After finishing her training, she opened a private practice in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1923, she joined Lahey at his nascent Boston-based Lahey Clinic, where she was the head gastroenterologist. She was appointed to the editorial board of the Journal of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition in 1934, which was at the time the official publication of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). She was elected president of the AGA in 1942, becoming the first woman to fill the position, and continued for a second term in 1943. She was involved in the AMA Section of Gastroenterology from 1941 to 1948 and was elected to the Boston Chamber of Commerce in 1948. Jordan specialized in treating peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. She promoted medical rather than surgical interventions, and often recommended conservative therapy based on \\"diet, recreation, and rest\\" to her patients. She treated a number of celebrity patients, including The New Yorker founder Harold Ross, who encouraged Jordan to co-write a cookbook with culinary journalist Sheila Hibben. The result, Good Food for Bad Stomachs, was published in 1951. Later life and death After retiring from medical practice in 1958, Jordan wrote a newspaper column titled \\"Health and Happiness\\". She lived with her second husband, Penfield Mower, a stockbroker whom she married in 1935, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. She diagnosed herself with colon cancer, the disease that led to her death on November 21, 1959 at age 75.

This was a time of experimentation and technical innovation, when Japanese artists produced works more advanced than had been achieved before, which could not be replicated with modern techniques. During the 1880s he ran his own workshop and also worked for the Ando Cloisonn√© Company in Nagoya. In 1902 he became the head of the company, succeeding Kaji Satar≈ç. Along with Hattori Tadasabur≈ç, Kawade developed the ( \\"piling up\\") technique which places layers of enamel upon each other to create a three-dimensional effect, often used in depicting flowers or blossoms. Another technique he invented was (drip-glaze), which produces a rainbow-coloured glaze. In 1902, he was the first Japanese artist to use the () technique, in which the metal foundation is hammered outwards to create a relief effect. He also used the new technique ( in Japanese) which creates panels of transparent or semi- transparent enamel. Enamel , linked by wires, are prepared on a copper surface which is then burned away with acid while the enamel itself is protected by lacquer. This was invented in France and came to Japan when Ando Jubei, one of the founders of the Ando Cloisonn√© Company, bought an enamel by Andr√© Fernand Thesmar at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Kawade analysed this piece to replicate and then further develop the technique.  Recognition  In 1911 the art historian Jiro Harada wrote that Kawade was > deservedly considered the greatest enamel expert in the manufacture of at > the present time. [...] He has been engaged in the industry for the last > forty years, and the advantage of his scientific knowledge and his > indefatigable devotion to the work have enabled him to invent new colours in > enamels.

It is one of the largest power plants in Armenia. This power plant was built in 1963‚Äì1974, and the first unit became operational in 1966. In 2013, a new unit was added. Four older units of the plant are owned and operated by the Hrazdan Energy Company, a subsidiary of Inter RAO UES, while the new fifth unit is owned and operated by Gazprom Armenia. History HTPP was envisioned as a power plant to serve the entire South Caucasus, including Armenia. Construction began in 1963, and the plant became functional in 1966, with two turbines with a total capacity up to 100 MW. By 1969 two PT-100-130 type turbines of type \\"T-100-130\\" of the unit 2 started to operate, increasing heat distribution to 560 kcal/h (650 MW) and overall capacity to up to 300 MW. In 1974, the first block was combined with a second in close proximity, which had a capacity of 810 MW in four condensing power-generating units. The new Hrazdan State Regional Power Plant (SRPP) became, with 1110 MW total power, the most powerful power plant of Armenia of those times. During its peak in the 1980s, the HTPP generated 6.85 TWh annually, with 7,300 hours (83%) clocked at total capacity. Between 1963 and the end of 2004, it produced 143 TWh electricity, but 12.3 Gcal/h energy in the form of heat. In 2003, the HTPP was passed to Russian Federation to pay off the Armenian debt which was approximately US$31 million. The shares of the Hrazdan Energy Company went to the Federal Agency for State Property Management of Russia. In July 2009, all stocks minus one share were acquired by the RUssian state-owned holding company Rosneftegaz. In May 2011, all shares were bought by Inter RAO UES. In 2015, Inter RAO UES sold the Hrazdan Energy Company to Cyprus-registered Liormand Holdings Limited, a part of Tashir Group owned by Samvel Karapetyan. The deal will become fully in force in 2017. In 1986, the plan of construction of four additional units (units 5‚Äì8) with a power generation capacity of 300 MW each was announced. Construction started in 1987, however, due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union the construction works were halted. In 2006, the assets of the incomplete unit 5 was sold to Armrosgazprom (now: Gazprom Armenia). The unit 5 as an independent power plant started operating in a pilot mode in January 2012, and since December 2013, it is in the commercial operation. Technical description (units 1‚Äì4) Located above sea level close to the junction of the Hrazdan River and Marmarik River, the power plant was built to accommodate inconstant and severe climate conditions. Five oil and gas boilers are used to power four co-generation turbines, two of model PT-50-130/7 and two of model T-100-130. T-100-130 turbines have a capacity twice as big as of model PT-50-130/7, 100 MW of capacity. The plant boasts five evaporative cooling towers and six feed pumps. The block part of the power plant consists of four power generator units, model TFM-104C gas and oil boilers with capacity of 670 t/h. TDC-250000/220 transformers connect two turbo-generators (TGV-200-2MUZ (Block No. 1) and TGV-200M (Blocks No. 2, 3, 4)) of 15.75 kV of voltage to 220 kV voltage circuit. The overall capacity is 810 MW. The HTPP is considered as one of the most environmentally friendly non-nuclear TPPs in Armenia. In the aim of excluding any possibility of water loss connected with evaporation, specially devised cooling system is used for cooling condensers in the four blocks. The cooling system, which was developed in Hungary by the firm Heller, has closed water circuit which gives an opportunity to use little natural water. At the time when the coolers were being constructed, aluminum radiators were used as heat exchangers to cool down the circulating water which heats up in the condensers. The key part which enables the usage of resources is the placement of the radiators, which are located along the edge of the cooling towers. Natural traction brings cooling air to the four towers. Heat loss is minimized by the use of chemically desalinated water in the closed circuit of cooling, which enables the usage of mixing condensers instead of surface condensers. This also reduces maintenance. Since 1993, the HTTP has used natural gas as its primary fuel, relying on oil as a reserve, a reversal of its earlier pattern. A gas distributing station and gas grid carry gas to gas control points throughout the plant. Technical description (unit 5) The fifth block's construction was directly connected to the Iran‚ÄìArmenia gas pipeline construction, which has a vital strategic importance for Armenia. Particularly, according to the agreement, the energy produced in Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant's 5th energy block is exported to Iranian energy system and serves as a means of paying for natural gas imported from Iran. Total of $465.2 million were spent for the construction and modernization of fifth energy block. For the construction of Hrazdan-5 different types of turbines were used, which work with steam and gas. The combination of these turbines makes this plant unique not only in the region, but also in the world. The use of this technology enables the block to have a power of 480 MW. The new technology of production enables the use of 278 gram of gas to produce 1 kWh energy, which reduces the cost of production. The construction was done by Gazprom Armenia. Role 80% of the electricity in Armenia is produced by four major energy producing companies, the Metsamor NPP, the Hrazdan TPP, the Sevan‚ÄìHrazdan Cascade, and the Vorotan Cascade. The HTPP is a balancing station providing energy in the case of deficit or shut down of the Metsamor nuclear facility, which is the primary source of power in Armenia. It closes for two to three months each year for maintenance and refueling, and HTPP steps in to meet consumer needs. The HTPP has also a big role in the export of electricity.

Gary Burne (20 April 1934 ‚Äì 26 August 1976) was a Rhodesian dancer, ballet master, and choreographer who spent ten years with the Royal Ballet in England before moving to South Africa to dance with ballet companies in Johannesburg and Cape Town.Marina Grut, \\"Burne, Gary,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), p. 359. He also danced for a period in Toronto, Canada.  Early life and training Algernon de Blois Hayes-Hill was born in Bulawayo, an industrial center in Matabeleland, a district of the self-governing British Crown colony of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He began his dance training as a seven year old youth with Elaine Archibald, where his grandmother, tasked with his care during WWII, was the studio pianist. He soon showed a facility for classical ballet. When Anton Dolin saw him in class, aged fifteen, during a visit to Southern Rhodesia, he suggested that Hayes-Hill would benefit from further training in London. Algernon's parents, Harry M Hayes-Hill and Una May (n√©e Spurr) were of British and Canadian stock, supported him in his ambition to pursue a career as a professional dancer, and made it possible for him to travel to London in 1951. He had one elder sibling, a brother, Terence Basil Hayes-Hill, whom became a prominent soldier in the unrecognised state of Rhodesia. Once in London, he enrolled in classes with Ruth French and, after three months' study with her, auditioned, successfully, for admission to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. The faculty there were favorably impressed. His command of classical technique, his height, his good looks, and his aristocratic bearing made him an ideal candidate for a danseur noble. After only one month's study at the school, he was invited to join the Sadler's Wells Ballet at Covent Garden. Professional career Hayes-Hill joined the Sadler's Wells company late in 1951, and later became known under the stage name of Gary Burne, as his birth name Algernon de Blois Hayes-Hill, was deemed unsuitable for theatrical purposes. He chose the surname Burne from his maternal Aunt's family, and the first name, Gary, was inspired by Gary Player, the South African golfer whom had just become the worlds youngest professional at age 17, as well as Gary Hocking, the future Southern Rhodesian Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, whom both were at the start of their careers; these Southern African personalities were prominent in world print media of that time. Europe After five years in the corps of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Burne was promoted to soloist in 1956, the same year that the company received a royal charter and changed its name to the Royal Ballet. In 1957, he created the role of King of the South in John Cranko's The Prince of the Pagodas, set to the music of Benjamin Britten, and danced a difficult variation in the act 3 pas de six. \\"With choreography mainly consisting of high jumps with open lines and then extremely fast beats in the coda,\\"Robert de Warren, Destiny's Waltz: In Step with Giants (New York: Eloquent Books, 2009), chap. 6, n.p. it always elicited applause. In 1958, he danced in the ensemble of Frederick Ashton's Ondine and appeared in other Ashton works in the repertory, including Symphonic Variations and Daphnis and Chloƒï. In 1959, he created the role of Eriocles in Cranko's Antigone, based on the tragedy by Sophocles and set to music by Mikis Theodorakis. Having gone on tours of the United States and Russia with the company, Burne danced for the first time in South Africa in 1960. His partners during these years included Rosella Hightower, Beryl Grey, and Antoinette Sibley.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books, 1981). In 1961, Cranko became director of the Stuttgarter Ballett, then a relatively obscure provincial troupe. At his request, Burne left England and moved to Germany to join the company as a principal dancer. There, appearing alongside leading dancers Marcia Hayd√©e, Richard Cragun, and Ray Barra, Burne enjoyed considerable success. For eighteen months, he danced in new productions created by Cranko for the company, including Daphnis and Chloƒì and Romeo and Juliet (both 1962), as well as in ballets in the existing repertory. Under Cranko's direction, the company became Germany's leading ballet company within a very few years.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Cranko, John,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Gary Burne,Xmas 1968, Bulawayo, personal family photograph by Neil Hayes-Hill Southern Africa In 1963, the South African government had established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces.David Poole, \\"The South African Way: Four Professional Ballet Companies Subsidized by the Government,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), May 1969, pp. 18ff. The two most vigorous were PACT Ballet, named for the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal, in Johannesburg, and CAPAB Ballet, named for the Cape Performing Arts Board, in Cape Town. Burne was offered the post of ballet master and principal dancer for PACT Ballet, under the direction of Faith de Villiers, soon after it was formed. He was quick to accept the job. When renowned French ballerina Yvette Chauvir√© came to Johannesburg as guest artist, Burne danced as Albrecht to her famous interpretation of Giselle in April 1963.Marina Grut and Johnathan Hurwitz, \\"South Africa: Ballet.\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 5, p. 652. He also formed a fortuitous partnership with ballerina Phyllis Spira, as they seemed ideally suited to each other. With this new, young company they danced leading roles in Swan Lake, Sylvia, and Casse Noisette (The Nutcracker).Amanda Botha, Phyllis Spira: A Tribute (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1988). Their stay in Johannesburg was brief, however, as an unfortunate salary dispute led to their defection to the company in Cape Town. Spira and Burne joined CAPAB Ballet as its principal dancers in 1965, leaving it temporarily in 1967-1968 and moving to Toronto to dance with the National Ballet of Canada, directed by Celia Franca. After touring North America with this company, they returned to South Africa at the end of 1968 and rejoined CAPAB Ballet. When David Poole resigned as ballet master in March 1969, Burne was appointed in his stead, and when Poole returned and became artistic director in 1970, Burne was made resident choreographer, a post he held for two years. His most creative works were The Prodigal Son (1970), set to electronic music by Morton Subotnik; The Birthday of the Infanta (1971), made for Spira and set to the music of Harry Partch; and Variations within Space (1971), made for Linda Smit and set to music by Bach played on a synthesizer.Marina Grut and Claude Conyers, \\"CAPAB Ballet,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 57. In other works in the repertory, Burne and Spira performed as a popular partnership until he left the company in 1971.Julius Eichbaum, \\"The CAPAB Ballet Company,\\" Dancing Times (London), June 1994, pp. 879, 881. Burne then moved to Paris and established himself as a free-lance choreographer, setting works for local companies in France and Germany. Engaged to produce Jesus Christ Superstar, the rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, he returned to Salisbury, Rhodesia, in late 1971. There he also mounted several works for the Rhodesian National Ballet, including Five Sisters, set to music by B√©la Bart√≥k, and Nongause, a ballet based on an African legend of the Xhosa people and set to music by Macbeth/Pickard. In 1973, he produced an enlarged version of Nongause for PACT Ballet, casting emerging ballerina Dawn Weller in one of her first important roles.June Schneider, \\"Johannesburg,\\" review of PACT Ballet's production of Gary Burne's history, Dance News (New York), September 1973, p. 9. He later worked at the Space Theatre in Johannesburg, doing experimental choreography with Gisela Taeger-Berger. Personal life Burne married Linda Smit, his colleague at CAPAB Ballet, in 1975. Their marriage was brief, however, as Burne died in Salisbury the very next year. Having developed an unshakeable drug habit, he committed suicide in August 1976. A flamboyant character and a gifted dancer, he was only 42 years old when he died.Ross Dix-Peek, \\"Southern Africa History Musings,\\" online website, http://peek-01.livejournal.com/37327.html.

These arsenals would come to be military schools comprising the South Carolina Military Academy. Playing a key role in South Carolina's efforts during the Civil War, the college gained a reputation for military discipline and rigor. After the Civil War, only the Charleston location reopened, known as The Citadel Academy. Renamed in 1910 as The Citadel, the school's academic reputation grew, even as larger colleges within the state and region competed for resources and students. After moving to a new campus near Hampton Park in 1922, the college has grown substantially, integrating minorities in the 1960s and women in the 1990s, and producing many military officers, business, and political leaders throughout its history. Citadel Academy In 1829 South Carolina constructed an arsenal on what is now Marion Square in downtown Charleston to house arms and ammunition. The State entered into an agreement in 1830 with the War Department for Federal troops from nearby Fort Moultrie to garrison this new arsenal. State militia replaced them in 1832. Over the next 10 years arsenals throughout the state were consolidated in Charleston and Columbia. Governor John Richardson eventually proposed converting both into military academies based upon the Norwich University model and on December 20, 1842 the South Carolina Legislature passed \\"an Act to convert the Arsenal at Columbia and the citadel and magazine in and near Charleston, into Military Schools\\" thereby transforming the two state arsenals into the South Carolina Military Academy. The act specified: > That the students when admitted, shall be formed into a military corps, and > shall constitute the public guard of the Arsenal at Columbia, and of the > Citadel and Magazine in and near Charleston ... to guard effectually, the > public arms and other property at the places aforsaid ... The first 20 cadets reported to the Citadel Academy at Marion Square in downtown Charleston on March 20, 1843, a date now celebrated as \\"Corps Day\\". Initially both schools operated as separate institutions governed by a common Board of Visitors, but in 1845 the Arsenal Academy in Columbia became an auxiliary to the Citadel Academy in Charleston. First year students attended the Arsenal then transferred to the Citadel Academy to complete their education. Both schools continued to operate during the Civil War but the Arsenal in Columbia was burned by Union forces and never reopened. The only surviving building from the Arsenal is the current Governor's Mansion. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Citadel cadets and faculty members trained South Carolina's Palmetto Regiment for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War; 17 graduates and cadets fought with the unit which teamed with U.S. Marines to enter the famous \\"Halls of Montezuma\\" in Mexico City in 1847. Lt. William J. Magill, a member of the first graduating class of 1846 was the first alumnus to serve in the U.S. Army and was a member of the 3d Dragoons under future President Zachary Taylor in the Mexican War. American Civil War and aftermath The Citadel at the start of the Civil War When South Carolina declared that it had seceded from the Union in December 1860, Major Robert Anderson moved his garrison of U.S. troops to Fort Sumter and requested reinforcements from the federal government. On January 9, 1861, a battery on Morris Island manned by Citadel Academy cadets fired on the U.S. steamer Star of the West, preventing it from reaching Fort Sumter with troops and supplies and thus firing what is considered to be the first shots of the American Civil War. Along with Confederate troops, Citadel cadets also manned several guns at \\"the battery\\" on Charleston harbor during the firing on Fort Sumter of April 12‚Äì13, 1861; The first shot of the bombardment is believed by many historians to have been fired by Second Lieutenant Henry S. Farley, Class of 1860. On January 28, 1861 the Corps of Cadets from the Arsenal Academy (in Columbia) and the Citadel Academy (in Charleston) known as The SC Military Academy was made part of the military organization of the state and named the Battalion of State Cadets. The Academy continued to operate as a military academy, but classes were often disrupted when the governor called the cadets into military service. Mounting and manning heavy guns, performing guard duty, providing security and escorting prisoners were among the services performed by the cadets. The Battalion of State Cadets participated in eight engagements during the Civil War. As a result of these actions, the state of South Carolina authorized the flag of the South Carolina Corps of Cadets to carry the following Confederate battle streamers:South Carolina Military Department, Office of the Adjutant General, General orders No. 5, dated 12 April 1939 and General Orders No. 3, dated 26 October 1942, The Citadel Archives old Citadel, Charleston in 1940. # Confederate States Army # Star of the West, January 9, 1861 # Wappoo Cut, November 1861 # James Island, June 1862 # Charleston and Vicinity, July‚ÄìOctober 1863 # James Island, June 1864 # Tulifinny, December 1864 # James Island, December 1864 ‚Äì February 1865 # Williamston, May 1865 (The Confederate States Army streamer is gray embroidered in silver and the remainder embroidered in blue) In early December, 1864 Governor Milledge Luke Bonham ordered the Battalion of State Cadets to Tulifinny Creek near Yemassee, South Carolina to join a small Confederate force defending the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. On December 7 and 9 the entire Corps of Cadets from the SCMA fought a much larger Union force (including a contingent of U.S. Marines) in the Battle of Tulifinny, successfully defending the rail line and forcing the Union troops to withdraw; the cadets suffered eight casualties and one cadet died after the battle from his injuries. The Battalion of State Cadets was commended for their display of discipline and gallantry under fire winning the admiration of the veteran troops who fought with them, only The Citadel and The Virginia Military Institute have fought pitched battle with their entire student bodies; The Citadel is also one of only 7 colleges to have received a battle streamer for wartime service. During the Civil War, 43 graduates and 200 former cadets were Killed in Action. On February 18, 1865, the school ceased operation as a college when Union troops entered Charleston and occupied the site. Following the war, the Board of Visitors eventually regained possession of The Citadel campus and with the urging of Governor Johnson Hagood, Class of 1847, the South Carolina Legislature passed an act to reopen the college. The 1882 session began with an enrollment of 185 cadets. Into the 20th century The Citadel bulldog mascot In the war with Spain in 1898 more Citadel alumni volunteered for service than were needed. In World War I, Citadel graduates were among the first contingents of American troops to fight with the Australian, and later British and French divisions; several served prominently with the Marine Corps at the Battle of Belleau Wood. The name of the college was officially changed in 1910 to \\"The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina\\"; the word \\"Academy\\" had become synonymous with secondary schools and the public had the misconception that the South Carolina Military Academy was a preparatory school. By that time the school had outgrown its facility despite numerous additions, in 1918 the city of Charleston offered the state of South Carolina on the banks of the Ashley River for a new campus on the condition that the state fund the construction. The state accepted the offer on February 26, 1919 and allotted $300,000 towards the construction of a new campus. In 1921 the title of the head of the school was changed from Superintendent to President, Colonel Oliver J. Bond was the last Superintendent and first President of The Citadel. The college moved to its current location in 1922; the new campus initially consisted of only a barracks, admin/classroom building, mess hall, gym and hospital but in the next 3 decades grew rapidly. New barracks were constructed in 1926, 1938 and 1942 bringing bed capacity up to nearly 2,000; between 1936 and 1939 a chapel, armory/field house, new mess hall and 2 more academic buildings were added. Capers Hall, the main academic building was built in 1951, a student activities building was added in 1957 and Daniel Library was completed in 1960; Deas Hall, the Physical Education facility opened in 1976. During World War II, the entire Class of 1944 was drafted and only 2 graduated. By 1943 so many cadets had left school to join the military that enrollment had dropped to less than 500 but was soon bolstered with the addition of active duty service members attending as part of the Army Specialized Training Program. Of the 2,976 living alumni in 1946 all but 49 served their country. Citadel alumni were members of some of the most famous units of the war to include the Flying Tigers, the Doolittle Raiders and the RAF Eagle Squadrons; 280 alumni were Killed in Action, 67 were declared Missing and 65 became Prisoners of War. In the immediate postwar period veteran students utilizing the GI Bill swelled the size of the school to record levels and at one time outnumbered cadets more than 2 to 1. Starting in the late 1980s a major initiative was begun to renovate older campus facilities and replace aging ones; McAlister Field House underwent an extensive rebuilding in 1987‚Äì89 that increased seating capacity from 4,500 to 6,000; in 1991 a new mess hall and classroom building (Grimsley Hall) were completed, a major renovation of the administration building (Bond Hall) was finished in 1993 and the beach house was rebuilt in 1995 after having been destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. A new barracks was constructed in 1996 and over the next decade three of the original four barracks were razed and rebuilt, the newest academic building (Thompson Hall) was completed in 2003. The Holliday Alumni Center located on Hagood Avenue just south of campus was dedicated in 2001, Johnson Hagood Stadium has had major improvements in recent years including a new field house and reconstruction of the home stands including a new press box tower that features club level seating and luxury boxes. The growth of the college has allowed for continuously expanding academic offerings; in 1916 only 3 majors were offered, at present 65 courses of study are available at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level. A Graduate School, the first in the Lowcountry area was established in 1968 to fill the educational needs of a growing metropolitan area. In recent years new majors in high demand fields such as Computer Science, Criminal Justice, Sports Management, Nursing and Mechanical Engineering have been established; minors are now offered in diverse subjects including Cybersecurity, East Asian Studies, International Relations, Management Information Systems and African American Studies. Additional facilities work continues, with a new building for the business school and a rebuilt Capers Hall (home of humanities and social sciences) slated for 2018 and beyond, and a rebuilt boat house and repairs to the beach house also recently undertaken. Women in the Corps of Cadets The Corps of Cadets was officially all male until 1996. In 1995 Shannon Faulkner won a legal battle and was granted admission by order of a federal judge; she reported the first day of knob (freshmen) orientation, but was admitted to the school's infirmary immediately following lunch; she remained in the infirmary for less than a week and quit. A Supreme Court ruling in a discrimination lawsuit against Virginia Military Institute eventually compelled the school to officially change its admission policy to admit women.Laura Fairchild Brodie, Breaking Out: VMI and the Coming of Women (2010) The first group of four female cadets matriculated in August 1996; using credits from another school Nancy Mace completed her degree in three years and became the first female graduate in Corps history on May 9, 1999. Czech born Petra Lovetinska was the first female graduate to have attended for four years, the first foreign female cadet, and after receiving her U.S. citizenship by Act of Congress, the first female graduate to be commissioned into the U.S. military. The other two women did not remain to finish their first year. As of September 2013 women comprise 7% of the Corps of Cadets and 21% of the overall student body. In the graduating class of 2012 Shanna M. Couch and Alexandria R. Burns were named First and Second Honor Graduates respectively. This was the first time in school history that either of the top two graduates of a class were women. A four-year starter on the soccer team, Couch was also the first woman at The Citadel to receive an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship. Burns, a native of Pendleton, South Carolina, was recognised for her remarkable academic achievement by the Anderson County Council in a resolution passed in June 2012. On March 21, 2018, The Citadel announced that Sara J. Zorn would serve as Regimental Commander, the highest ranking cadet for the 2018‚Äì19 academic year. She will be the first woman to hold that position.

The Mining industry of Cyprus is synonymous with copper extraction which began around 4,000 BC. Copper dominates the mining sector along with mining of iron pyrite, gold, chromites and asbestos fibers, bentonite, cement, and also petroleum. Though at one time, copper was a mainstay of the economy, as of 2012, the mining sector does not contribute in a significant way to the GNP. History The name Cyprus is a derivative of K√∫pros, which the Greeks called the island, and means Cuprous, synonymous with copper. Copper production can be dated to the fourth millennium BC, when it was used to make tools. The people of ancient Cyprus were known for their metalworking skills. To extract the high grade metal copper, called \\"copper talents\\", they prospected most of the areas containing copper. In the Bronze Age copper could be found on the surface, but as these depleted, underground extraction methods were adopted. The northern slopes of the Troodos Mountains (in the Pillow Lavas Series of Troodos Ophiolite) contained vast amounts of copper bearing ores. The wastes of the metal extraction process, known as \\"ancient slug\\", lying outside the mines, contains slight traces of residual copper, but are inaccessible as the mines are currently legislatively protected monuments. During the Roman period Cyprus was able to satisfy almost all of the world's copper requirements, but after the downfall of the Roman Empire, copper mining went dormant until the 19th century. From the 19th century, the need for producing sulfur revived the mining industry, mainly for extraction of pyrite and chalcopyrite, but copper was also extracted. In 1878 Cyprus was colonized by the British Empire, changing the social and political realms of the country. During the mid 1920s, the industry in the country was controlled by foreign companies, including the mining industry, which at the time was the most important industrial sector in the economy. The British administration gave foreign companies, \\"extra- territorial rights\\" and the latitude to exploit workers, conditions which were ideal, during and after World War I. The workers had no rights or protections under the existent legislation, as there was no labour code. Nor did the colonial administration favour introducing any type of regulation for limiting the miner's working hours, providing for medical care or workers' welfare, or anti-exploitation laws of any kind. Possibly the world's oldest operational mine, the Skouriotissa copper mine, was founded in 1914 by the Cyprus Mines Corporation. During World War II copper mining was suspended, but then resumed until the 1974 Cypriot coup d'√©tat. At the end of the conflict, the cease-fire demarcation line divided the holdings of the largest mining firm in the country, Cyprus Mines, causing their shut-down and sale to Hellenic Copper Mines Ltd. As a result of near complete extraction of copper and iron pyrite ore, and the expense of extracting the remaining low grade deposits companies which had resumed operations after the conflict operated on smaller scales. Falling international copper prices created a recession forcing the other companies to cease mining production entirely by 1979. In 1981, Hellenic Ltd. began recovering copper from leaching waste, ceased that production in 1993, but reopened mining operations at Skouriotissa in 1996. Production and impact Open pit copper mine Skouriotissa in Cyprus. According to data released by the statistical service of the government for the year 2011, mining and quarrying sectors produced a total value of ‚Ç¨79.5 million ($105.3 million), which reflected a drop of ‚Ç¨46.4 million ($61.4 million) in value- added products, such as finished metal works. This sector employed 534 people. The low-grade copper waste material of the Skouriotissa mines facility has been processed by leaching through the solvent extraction and electrowinning method. In 2012, their production reported production of 99.99% pure copper metal cathodes. Mineral commodities that have been mined include asbestos, bentonite, chromite and sulfide minerals, as well as stone products including cement, gravel and sand. Other marketable minerals including clay, gypsum, lime, ocher and umber production have been recorded. Exploratory drilling permits have been issued to companies searching for gold, natural gas and petroleum deposits. Legal framework The Mines and Quarries (regulation) Law, 1959; the Mines and Quarries regulations,1958‚Äì1979; and the Cyprus standard and Control of Quality Law 1975 (Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, 2012) are the legal instruments in force in the mining sector. The Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment has two departments responsible for regulating the mining industry. The Mines Service serves as administrator for the mineral operations of the country and the Geological Survey Department maintains oversight in evaluating mining resources and all mineral exploration programmes. Commodities In recent years the mining sector, particularly its copper deposits, has shown positive signals of recovery as a result of high copper prices and technological improvements in the sector. Thirty copper deposits have been identified, with resources of 50,000 to 20 million tonnes of grades from 0.3 to 4.5 percent copper. Apart from the intense mining activity occurring in the main districts of Kalavassos, Kambia, Limni, Skouriotissa and Tamassos, ore is also being extracted from mines near Mangaleni in Limassol, Peravasa in Limassol and Vretchia and the Troulli Mine in Larnaca, to a lesser degree. Geologically the ore genesis model shows Cyprus‚Äô copper deposits were created by volcanic activity. A better understanding of how the ore was formed has allowed Hellenic Copper Mines Ltd. to utilize extraction methods which result in higher yields. Their copper exports from the Skouriotissa mine were valued at US$13.1 million during 2010. As another example of increasing production based on knowledge of the volcanic nature of development, the Klirou copper-zinc property, which the EMED Mining Public Ltd has studied, has a high potential for exploitation. This facility is about to the southwest of Nicosia where the deposits extend to depth. Shallow cover rocks over the volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits indicate that ores can be extracted utilizing the open pit method. In addition to copper, Canadian and Swedish companies have explored areas of the Troodos complex and found evidence of surface gold. Core drilling permits have been sought for further exploration. Multiple companies have been involved in exploration for natural gas and petroleum deposits. Though no production had begun as of 2012, a U.S. firm, Nobel Energy, Inc., discovered a field that could be exploited.

To extend the service to a larger sphere by more number of youths he established Sangathan Viswabharatiyam & Ganatantrika Grama Samaj, the organization fought for the untouchables and for their social rights. As a volunteer leader of Sangathan Viswa Bharatiyam, he organised some relief camp and rehabilitation in Super cyclone-hit areas of Coastal Odisha on 31 October 1999 to 10 December 1999. He also participated as a front volunteer of Orissa Disaster Mitigation Mission, Bhubaneswar organised a relief camp in earthquake-hit areas of Gujarat on 31 January 2001 to 10 February 2001.  Research activities  Dr. Prusty qualified UGC- NET- JRF Exam and joined Utkal University as a research scholar. He submitted the thesis entitled \\"Social Relevance of Odia Novel\\" is a commendable work. In 2014, he did a PhD at Utkal University. But his tremendous research work, Odia language got classical Status. Recently he thoroughly study many of ancient Indian Rock Paintings, inscriptions and he tries to prove that the Indian Script is not close to the Sumerians, Hurrians, or Elamite. The Indian scripts are mostly clearly related to the cave arts as existed in primitive to modern Indian architecture. Thus the Cave arts are the forerunners of Indian Scripts.

When all the scholar and intellectuals of Odisha was accepted that Odia script, language and literature not more than 1000 years back. He proved with sufficient evidence that not only Odia language and script was more than 5000 years but also Odia Literature as old as Sanskrit Literature. First time he read the rock painting of the Yogimatha of Nuapada District of Odisha which was older script of India. The script ‚ÄòGa‚Äô, and ‚Äòo‚Äô (tha) was discovered from yogimatha rock painting, this painting saw a person with four animals and write some alphabet. According to Dr. Prusty, that painting created a word Like \\"Gaitha\\" (very popular Odia word at present ‚ÄòGotha‚Äô or ‚Äògroup‚Äô in English). This art closely related to this alphabet. This alphabet has similarity to Dhauli and Jaugada Inscription's script of Ashok. He assume it was the ancient form of Indian script and it is the first glimpse of possible origin of the Odia language and script. He proved that Kharavel's Hatigumpha inscr iption(40B.C.) is the real evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual & social status and it is the 1st poetic stake inscription. Though Ashok has created many rock edicts and inscription before Kharavela, yet his instructions for administration have been written in a rude and chocked language which has been seen in his inscriptions. On the other hand, the Hatigumpha inscriptions show the flexibility of a language in a sweet flow. He argued some important points about classical Status for Odia Language. He also proved that Sanskrit as the source of the modern Indo-Aryan languages, classical Odia is the source language of East India and South-East Asia's language. As Sanskrit is the most conservative and least changed of the Indo-Aryan languages, Odia is the conservative and advance updated languages as well that linguists must understand its nature and development. Unlike the other modern languages of India, Odia meets each of these requirements. It is extremely old (According to L.S.S O‚Äô Malley, as old as Latin and Vedic Sanskrit); it arose as an entirely independent tradition, with almost no influence from Sanskrit or other languages; and its ancient literature is indescribably vast and rich. After more than five years of deep Research work without any help and guidance, he prepared a document in personal effort and create political with intellectual movement for which Odia language achieved the classical status.  National Language Conference  thumb The annual national language conference on the Indian languages at the national level is the brainchild of Subrat Prusty. After the recognition of Odia as a classical language, it was organized by the Institute of Odia Studies and Research for two days on January 2 and 3, 2014 to prepare its next outline. The goal was to help create a platform to discuss language issues and support language movement in preserving the regional heritage and culture. The Conference was inaugurated by Hon‚Äôble Minister of Education Badrinarayana Patra and was attended by more than two hundred scholars of languages, linguistics, humanities and sociologist. Dr. Hermann Kulke, Professor at Kiel University, Germany, Prof. H.C. Boralingaiah, Vice-Chancellor of Kananda University, Prof. K. Rathnaiah, Vice-Chancellor of Dravida University, Dr. K. Ramasamy, Founder Director CICT were participated as guests. the Sixth National Language Conference (2020) was held on 23 ‚Äì 26 February, 2020 at Sambalpur University, Sambalpur, Odisha.  Organisational Activities  Early students life, he was created or involved various social service organisation. But Soon after the research work, he entered again to active organizational work, formed Janasammilani, Odisha. His views on eradication of poverty rests on setting up industry and reformation in agriculture should be encouraged with related cottage industry as Odisha basically is an agricultural state. His work, for imparting all education in ODIA medium. For this purpose he started giving training to promising students to appear various competitive examinations in Odia medium.,2nd Edition of Bhasa O Jatiyata Book inaugurated by Dr DP Pattanayak, Sj BK Dhal, Prof. Basudev Sahu at Bhubaneswar Book-fair  For Language Movement  An Important Meeting with Organising Committee Members about proposed Odia University and CICO at IOSR Office, Bhubaneswar  MY LANGUAGE MY RIGHT  Odia Biswabidyalaya Movement  established for Odia University Odianess in him evoked a spirit of establishing Odia Biswabidyalaya is a dream he is on his toe for its success. For this purpose he opened an Institute of Odia Studies and Research and doing various researches works and he got first success that when Odia declared as a Classical Language by Govt. of India, The institute, which had played an important role in documenting the classical nature of Odia language along with the culture department, hopes to rope in other departments in the future.  CICO Movement  thumb After getting Classical Status of Odia Language, now his one-point Mission is Setting up an Odia language University to create a body of knowledge and research in Odia and to develop Odia language as a lingua franca like that of Palli or Sanskrit in ancient India and English in the modem times.

Name change His name at birth, like that of his father, was Johannes Koch. The English language equivalent would be \\"John Cook\\". At some point he renamed himself \\"Johannes Magirus\\", reflecting an enthusiasm for classical culture that was common among many intellectuals of his time and place. \\"Magirus\\" (\\"ŒúŒ¨Œ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÇ\\") is the Greek word for \\"cook.\\" Life Johannes Koch was born in Backnang in W√ºrttemberg. He lost his father, the carpenter Johannes Koch through a fatal accident around 1540, and underwent an impoverished upbringing, supporting his mother Magdalena (born Magdalena Kurtz). As a boy he excelled at scholarship, especially in his study of Latin, raising concern on the part of a step father that he might be taken to Spain by Spanish soldiers of the Imperial army who were in Backnang in connection with the Schmalkaldic War between December 1546 and December 1549. He was removed from school and apprenticed in a craft trade for more than a year in order to divert attention from his academic prowess, but by 1653, at the unusually youthful age of just 16, he was studying Theology with a scholarship to the University of T√ºbingen. Continuing in his scholarly precocity, he became a Bachelor of Arts at the age of 18 and a Master of Arts at 20. In order to supplement his stipendium and fund his book buying habit, he was also operating as a wine dealer at this time. Two years later, in 1559, he obtained a post in Stuttgart as a deacon, becoming a deacon for the surrounding villages in 1561. Shortly afterwards ill health forced him to leave the city, and in 1562 he took up a diaconat at Vaihingen an der Enz, in the rural region to the west of Stuttgart. In 1567 he was appointed prelate (superintendent) and abbot at Maulbronn Monastery, which the Duke of W√ºrttemberg had refounded eleven years before as a Lutheran brotherhood. On 25 October 1578, still aged only 41, he was appointed Provost of Stuttgart's Collegiate Church in succession to Wilhelm Bidenbach, which was the highest ecclesiastical office in W√ºrttemberg. He held office till his death 36 years later, widely commended as a true pastor, good preacher, able businessman and insightful theologian. Along with his sermons, he published numerous pamphlets rebutting Catholic and Calvinist theological positions. Death During his final years Magirus was greatly troubled by \\"internal stones\\" (\\"Steinbeschwerden\\"), and he died at nearby Cannstatt where he had gone to seek relief from his illness. His body was taken home and buried in Stuttgart at the Collegiate Church, however. Family Johannes Magirus was twice married. By his first marriage, with Anna Fritz, seven recorded children were born, including Johannes Magirus the younger (1560-1626), like his father remembered as a Lutheran Theologian, Jakob Magirus (1564‚Äì1624) who became the abbot of Lorch and David Magirus (1566‚Äì1635) who became a Professor at T√ºbingen. His second marriage, to Veronika Grafegg, took place around 1588, and there were more children. It is recorded that most of his children either became or else married ministers of religion. A remoter descendant, Conrad Dietrich Magirus, founded in 1866 a business to manufacture fire fighting equipment which grew to become, during the first half of the twentieth century, one of Germany's leading truck producers.

It is in the premises of Fort Dansborg, built in the land ceded by Thanjavur king Ragunatha Nayak in an agreement with Danish Admiral Ove Gjedde in 1620 and acted as the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. The Church was built in 1701 A.D by Rev. Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg and has records from the 18th and 19th centuries. He is believed to be the first Protestant missionary in India and the Church is believed to be the first Protestant Church in India. Zion Church is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services and follows Protestant sect of Christianity. In modern times, it is under the dominion of Tiruchirappallli-Thanjavur Diocese of the Church of South India. It is one of the most prominent landmarks of Tranquebar (Tharangambadi). History Historic image of the church The Dansborg Fort was the most important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel for the Danish Emire. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholom√§us Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil in a few years and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of the 17th century. The Danes built the Zion Church in 1701, believed to be the first Protestant Church in India and the New Jerusalem Church in 1717. During 1919, a Tranquebar manifesto targeting a single episcopacy for all of Anglician, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Congregational and Weslyan over South India was discussed at this Church, but failed to arrive at a conclusion. Architecture Zion Church is enclosed in Fort Dansborg along with a set of buildings, the notable ones being the fort built in 1620, the Masilamaninathar Temple built in the 13th century, New Jerusalem Church built in 1718, the Town Gateway built in 1792, the Danish Governor Bungalow built in 1784 and a series of tomb stones built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The settlement inside the citadel is modeled like a small European town with a land gate and wooden doors leading to the main street, namely, the King's Street. The church is located two blocks away from the Bay of Bengal and has an exterior made of brick, stained glass windows and tiled brick spire. The architecture indicates common features in Indian structure of the time. The altar houses conventional Methodist images and a prayer hall for the devotees. The plaques of Jesus Christ and some of the apostles are housed in glass chambers in standing posture on the walls facing the devotees. The church was partially modified in 1782, which is believed to be the structure in modern times. There is a historic bell tower in the church and numerous tombstones. Culture Fort Dansborg, where the Zion Church is enclosed In modern times, the Lutheran Mission administers the New Jersulame Church, while the Zion church is under the dominion of the Trichy-Tanjore Diocese of the Church of South India (CSI). The Danish built the Zion Church for the Governors and the New Jerusalem Church for soldiers and the community. Ziegenbalg was the first pastor of the church and he preached in Tamil. There are records from the Church during the period of 1781 to 1814 indicating the burials carried out in the church. They indicate the expenses incurred for building the tombs, funeral services and maintenance of the cemetery. The Church along with other buildings in the fort were renovated twice in modern times, once by Tranquebar Association with the help of the Danish royal family and the State Archaeology Department in 2001 and secondly by a project named Destination Development of Tranquebar by the Department of Tourism of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2011.

It is a rhizomatous perennial from Croatia. It has flat, curved of sickle-shaped leaves, tall slender stems, 3‚Äì8 fragrant flowers, in shades of violet, or pale violet flowers, mauve, lavender, purple, yellow or white, between May and June. The iris was originally thought to be a separate species, but later classified as subspecies of Iris pallida, known as Iris pallida subsp. pseudopallida, although in Croatia, it is still known as Iris pseudopallida. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, especially in the Balkan regions. Description It has a bluish coloured rhizome, and has flat, curved, or sickle-shaped leaves. The leaves can grow up to long, and up to 3 cm wide. They can survive the winter. It has a slender stem or peduncles, that can grow up to between tall. It has branches (or pedicels) near top of the plant. The stem has (scarious) membranous, (or translucent) spathes (leaves of the flower bud). Similar to Iris illyrica, the spathes can have a dirty, rusty markings. The stems (and the branches) hold between 3 and 8 flowers, between May and June. The fragrant flowers, come in shades of violet, or pale violet flowers, mauve, lavender, purple, yellow or white. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are bent backwards, they have a light brown edge and reddish purple veins. They also have a thick strip of yellow hairs (the 'beard') in the centre. The flowers has dry, spheroidal pollen, that are 51‚Äì100 ¬µm large. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, that has 5 mm long seeds. Biochemistry In 2001, a karyologic study was carried out on various irises in the Alpine-Dinaric region (relating to the Dinaric Alps mountain chain), which included Iris cengialti, Iris illyrica, Iris pseudopallida and Iris pallida. It found that the mitotic number of chromosomes of most species was 2n=24. In 2003, a study was carried out on flavonoids within the leaves of Iris illyrica Tomm. and Iris pseudopallida Trinajstiƒá. It found significant quantitative differences in the leaf flavonoid patterns were obtained. In 2008, a study was carried out on five iris species including; Iris halophila, Iris pumila, Iris pseudopallida, Iris reichenbachii and Iris sibirica. It investigated vegetative propagation (including in vitro) and secondary metabolite production. In 2009, a plant regeneration study was carried out on three iris related to Iris pallida, including Iris pseudopallida, Iris illyrica and Iris reichenbachii, all from the Southern Europe. It used somatic embryogenesis. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=24, (published by Mitiƒá, B. 1991. Karioloska analiza nekih populacija vrsta Iris pallida, I. illyrica i I. pseudopallida (Iridaceae). in Acta Bot. Croat. 50: 91‚Äì98). Also confirmed in 2001. Taxonomy Wild plant growing near Niksic in Montenegro It is commonly known as 'Southern Adriatic iris', It is also known in Croatia, as 'jadranska perunika' meaning Adriatic Iris. The Latin specific epithet pseudopallida refers to 'false', 'pallida' or pale iris. It was first collected by Ivo Trinajstiƒá on 1 May 1973, and then it was first published and described in 'Biosistematika' (Journal) Vol.2 (Issue 1) on page 71 in 1976. Trinajstiƒá had called the plant, a separate species to Iris pallida, due to the difference in spathes. Iris pallida has silvery white spathes while Iris illyrica and Iris pseudopallida have spathes that have a dirty pale rusty tint. In 1991, Nikolic and Mitic also found that the size and shape of epidermal cells and stoma, was another difference between the 2 species, but these could be down to habitat effects. It was also thought to be related to Iris reichenbachii, but a study on Iris orjenii found various differences. Often plants are called one name and are later changed due to a new study. Later, some authors have re- classified the species as a subspecies of Iris pallida, as Iris pallida subsp. pseudopallida. Although, in Croatia, it is still known as Iris pseudopallida. It has not yet been verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service as of 20 November 2015. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. It is an 'unresolved' name in The Plant List. Distribution and habitat Wild iris growing on Mount Orjen, Montenegro It is native to Southern Europe. Range It is found along the Adriatic Coast, of the Balkan Peninsula. In Montenegro, Herzegovina, in Croatia, (including south Dalmatia,) and also in Albania. It is normally found in Croatia along with Iris reichenbachii, another endemic iris. Habitat It grows on rocks (made of limestone or karst), dry meadows or pastures. They can be found at an altitude above , above sea level. Conservation It has large colonies of plants, but they may be under risk from collection. Cultivation Growing in the wild in Montengero The plants are grown in gardens in Croatia and surrounding countries, and are also available for cultivation elsewhere, used in garden borders. It can be found in the Biokovo Botanical Garden Koti≈°ina. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C.

She made sure her son was baptized in Paris, in 1884, when he began studying at the Ma√Ætrise de Montmartre. Hoffet continued his studies at the Junioriat or Petit S√©minaire de Notre-Dame de Sion in Meurthe- et-Moselle, where the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate prepared youngsters who were destined to follow a religious vocation in their Order. He entered the Novitiate at Saint-Gerlach in the Province of Limburg in the Netherlands and took the habit on 14 August 1892. He professed his Perpetual Oblation in Li√®ge on 15 August 1894, and it was there that he was ordained priest on 10 June 1898. Hoffet taught at the Juniorat de Notre-Dame-des- Lumi√®res in the Vaucluse, spent a year in Rome in 1903-1904, taught for a further year at the Grand S√©minaire of Ajaccio and then, between 1905 and 1908, served as editor of the Order's journal, Petites Annales. He moved to Paris in 1914 where he lived at 7 Rue Blanche, situated in the 9th arrondissement, where he was authorized to say mass at the local parish church of Sainte-Trinit√©. Hoffet was renowned for his linguistic accomplishments, and maintained close links with eminent men, especially leading specialists and Professors from the Sorbonne. Hoffet was also involved with the journal Regnabit (1921-1929), that was founded by Pri√®re du R√©v√©rend P√®re F√©lix Marie Anizan (1878 ‚Äì 1944), who also belonged to the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and who was also at the Junioriat or Petit S√©minaire de Notre-Dame de Sion, as well as being a devotee of the Sacred Heart. Hoffet was the author of Papal Theology.My Favorite Passages from Dante, page 243 (compiled and edited by John T. Slattery, Devin-Adair, 1929). \\"Emile Hoffet, Lay brother of Mary Immaculate, Paris, France.

This claim was also made in two documents that were deposited in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France,Henri Lobineau, G√©n√©alogie des Rois M√©rovingiens et Origine des diverses Familles Fran√ßaises et Etrang√®res de Souche M√©rovingienne d'Apr√®s L'Abb√© Pichon, le Docteur Herv√© et les Parchemins de l'Abb√© Sauni√®re de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (Aude) (1964)Madeleine Blancassall, Les Descendants M√©rovingiens ou l'√©nigme du Raz√®s wisigoth (1965) but it was G√©rard de S√®de who first linked Hoffet with the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, as well as the first to claim that Jean- Fran√ßois-Victor Bieil (1835-1898) of the Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice, director of the Seminary of Saint Sulpice (located at the time at 9, place Saint-Sulpice in the 6th arrondissement), was his great-uncle. The 1965 document attributed to Madeleine Blancassall, Les Descendants M√©rovingiens ou l'√©nigme du Raz√®s wisigoth, claimed Hoffet also knew about the secret of the Ch√¢teau de Gisors (in March 1946, tourist guide Roger Lhomoy claimed he discovered the treasure of the Knights Templar in an alleged subterranean chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine, beneath the tower donjon of the ch√¢teau). In 1988, G√©rard de S√®de claimed Hoffet had known the French freemason and occultist, Georges Monti, also known as Comte Isra√´l Monti and Marcus Vella.

It can be used, for instance, to describe electronic states of a system, when single reference methods and density functional theory cannot be used, and for heavy atom systems for which quasi-relativistic approaches are not appropriate. Although perturbation methods such as CASPTn are successful in describing the molecular systems, they still need a Hartree-Fock wavefunction to provide a valid starting point. The perturbation theories cannot reach convergence if the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are degenerate. Therefore, the CASPTn method is usually used in conjunction with the Multi-configurational self- consistent field method (MCSCF) to avoid near-degeneracy correlation effects.  History  In the early 1960s, the perturbation theory in quantum chemical applications was introduced. Since, there has been a wide spread of uses of the theory through software such as Gaussian. The perturbation theory correlation method is used routinely by the non-specialists. This is because it can easily achieve the property of size extensivity comparing to other correlation methods. During the starting point of the uses of perturbation theory, the applications using the method were based on nondegenerate many- body perturbation theory (MBPT). MBPT is a reasonable method for atomic and molecular system which a single non-degenerate Slater determinant can represent zeroth-order electronic description. Therefore, MBPT method would exclude atomic and molecular states, especially excited states, which cannot be represented in zeroth order as single Slater determinants. Moreover, the perturbation expansion would converges very slowly or not at all if the state is degenerate or near degenerate. Such degenerate states are often the case of atomic and molecular valence states. To counter the restrictions, there was an attempt to implement second-order perturbation theory in conjunction with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) wave functions. At the time, it was rather difficult to compute three- and four-particle density matrices which are needed for matrix elements involving internal and semi- internal excitations. The results was rather disappointing with little or no improvement from usual CASSCF results. Another attempt was made in 1990, where the full interacting space was included in the first-order wave function while zeroth-order Hamiltonian was constructed from a Fock-type one-electron operator. For cases which has no active orbitals, the Fock-type one-electron operator that reduces to the M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset-Plesset Hartree-Fock (HF) operator. A diagonal Fock operator was also used to make a computer implementation simple and effective.

Built about 1870 as a private residence, it was from 1920 for many years a general store, and a mainstay of local business in the rural community. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. As of 2014, it was apparently again a private residence. Description and history The former Fitch's General Store is located at the crook of the V-shaped junction between Long Hill Road and Maine State Route 114 in the rural village of East Sebago. It is a rambling -story complex, built of wood framing sheathed in clapboards and resting on a granite foundation. Both the store and the house have gable roofs, with a two-story ell connecting them. There is modest Greek Revival and Italianate styling, including bracketed lintels on some of the windows, and corner pilasters. The house and store were built about 1870 by George E. Fitch, the store originally a barn. His father had established one of the first stores in the area in 1832, just across the road. That business continued to be operated by George Fitch and his descendants until it was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in 1919. At that time, Montford Fitch converted his father's barn into a store, and reopened the business there. When the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, it was still a going concern; it has since closed.

Aged 14 he met in Sanremo the Pasquali brothers who introduced him to the world of sculpture. Being born in Bordighera he was interested in the artistic production of all painters who lived and worked in his hometown such as Claude Monet, Pompeo Mariani Friederich von Kleudgen, Hermann Nestel, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, etc. To improve his training he attended the Accademia Albertina of Turin and he had as professor Andrea Marchisio. His original style is heavily influenced by the Impressionism even if one can already perceive some elements of cubism. In 1924 he painted \\"Il soldato\\", confirming his membership in the futurism movement. In 1926 he was commissioned to paint for the Church of the Immaculate Conception or Terrasanta of Bordighera, entitled \\"Death of Saint Joseph\\". In those years, he met the sculptor Adolfo Wildt who had a very large impact on his painting. This influence can be perceived in his famous portrait on yellow background. Between 1931 and 1946 Balbo lived mainly in Africa, with a short stay in Italy and Paris, where he exhibited in 1938. In 1941 he was taken prisoner by the British in Kenya, and he learned English on this occasion. He will return in Bordighera only in 1946. After returning to his hometown he opens his workshop in Via Vittorio Emanuele 61 and after some time, in the same premises, an art school for \\"Sunday painters\\". In 1947, on the occasion of the return of the relics of Sant'Ampelio a Bordighera, he was commissioned a wax statue to collect the relics of the saint. This statue is still visible in the left nave of the St. Mary Magdalene Church. In 1950, he founded the painting prize \\"5 Bettole\\" and in 1952 he organized the first European exhibition of Pollock, Arshile Gorky, Man Ray with the works of Guggenheim Museum. Peggy Guggenheim will spend a few days in Bordighera on the occasion of the exhibition. He died in Ventimiglia on 26 December 1980. His ashes are kept in the cemetery of Bordighera.  Giuseppe Balbo‚Äôs initiatives  In 1950 he created the painting prize \\"5 Bettole\\", which will also be associated later to a literary prize. In 1951 he obtained from the municipality, a room in the Palazzo del Parco for a small school which then became a more ambitious project, the \\"Accademia Riviera\\" to which his name will be added later. On the occasion of renovations of the Palazzo del Parco in 1970, the academy moved to Ventimiglia in via Hanbury, but was then back to Bordighera in 1971.storia/  Photo gallery  File:Statua di cera contenente le reliquie di Sant'ampelio, Chiesa Santa Maria Maddalena.jpg|Wax statue with the relics of Sant'Ampelio, Church of St. Mary Magdalen (Bordighera)  Bibliography  * \\"Jean Cocteau, Peggy Guggenheim e le mostre di pittura americana a Bordighera 1952-1957\\" by Leo Lecci, De Ferrari Editore (2004), 128 pp. with Cd-Rom.

He was a relative of Eug√®ne Lisbonne, an attorney and senator for H√©rault who was Senate rapporteur for the 1881 law on freedom of the press. His father was Jules Lisbonne, an attorney in Nyons, municipal councilor and deputy mayor. √âmile Lisbonne attended the lyc√©e in Avignon, then studied at the Faculty of Law in Aix-en-Provence and the Faculty of Law in Paris. Lisbonne's father died in 1900 and he had to support his mother and two sisters. He became a prosecutor, and served in various different courts in France. He enlisted in the army at the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18) and served with bravery. As a magistrate he was sometimes called to sit on military tribunals, and was shocked by some of the expedient judgments. As a senator he would be rapporteur of a bill to establish a special court of military justice. National politics Lisbonne ran in the by-election on 6 January 1924 that followed the death of the senator for the Dr√¥me, and was elected in the second round of voting. He sat with the Democratic and Radical Left and Radical Socialist group. After his election he was named honorary vice-president of the tribunal of the Seine. He was reelected in the first round on 20 October 1929. He was chosen Minister of Health in the first ministry of Albert Sarraut on 27 October 1933. The ministry fell on 24 November 1933. Lisbonne was Minister of Health in the cabinet of √âdouard Daladier that took office on 30 January 1934. It was replaced after a few days by the Doumerge cabinet of 9 February 1934. Lisbonne was one of the few left- wing Radicals in the senate. Later he left the Radical party and joined the socialists. He was one of the few senators who gave their support to the Popular Front in 1936. He was defeated in the elections of 23 October 1938. Later career Lisbonne continued to serve in the general council of the Dr√¥me as representative for Buis-les-Baronnies. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) the Vichy regime dissolved the general councils. Lisbonne, who was closely associated with the left, was placed under house arrest in Aveyron. He returned to the Dr√¥me after the Liberation of France. In 1947 he was named a member of the Superior Council of the Magistracy. Lisbonne died in Paris on 21 December 1947 at the age of 71.

Child labour increased during the Industrial Revolution due to the children's abilities to access smaller spaces and the ability to pay children less wages. In 1839 Prussia was the first country to pass laws restricting child labor in factories and setting the number of hours a child could work, although a child labour law was passed was in 1836 in the state of Massachusetts. Almost the entirety of Europe had child labour laws in place by 1890. The International Labour Organization, ILO, now works to set global minimum standards of labour.  History  Child labour has existed since before the start of civilized society. Early history showed children were used to pick berries and do small maintenance in nomadic tribes. Once people started setting areas, children were used to help on the farmlands. This is a practice that continues even to today. Child labour expanded during Industrial Revolution. Children were able to work in smaller places than adults could not access, such as chimney sweeps, behind cotton machines, and in small places in mining. This work was dangerous and children often lost their lives while working. In 1839 Prussia was the first country to pass laws restricting child labor in factories and setting the number of hours a child could work. Though the reasons behind why these laws were passed were to expand working conditions for adults, it did lead to laws being passed across Europe. In 1839 Britain enacted its Factory Act which restricted child labour and in 1841 France adopted its first child labour laws. After Britain, France and Germany adopted their laws. Almost the entirety of Europe had child labour laws in place by 1890. Although individual states had adopted laws starting with Massachusetts in 1844, the United States did not enact federal laws until the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938. This law set minimum wages to 40 cent an hour, restricted the child work week to 40 hours a week, and restricted children under 16 from working in manufacturing plants and mining. In 1941 the U.S. Supreme Court mandated that the law was constitutional. Much of the labour laws enacted started either shortly before or after World War I.The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF were created with the Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I as a way to bring safer working conditions for adults, institute minimum age labour limits, enhance working conditions for children, and eliminate child labour around the globe. In 1919 members of the ILO consisted of countries from the League of Nations. In total 41 countries brought together the ILO. In 1926, the United States joined the ILO. After World War II, the ILO was adopted, and then funded, by the United Nations. After World War II, the ILO set out to change the child labour standards not just with the countries in the United Nations, but also expanded around the globe. In 1992 the ILO created the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) which is an organization that works exclusively on the elimination of child labour and exploitation. A global North‚ÄìSouth divide is a divide indicative of economic and political standings. Prior to the year 1990, most child labour laws were enacted in what has been termed the Global North. With the creation of many agencies, the promotion of child labour laws has expanded into what is termed the Global South. In 2014 there were many changes and laws passed in several Asian and Pacific Island countries. Thailand, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, India, Kiribati, Mongolia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Fiji, and Cambodia have seen laws passed limited the age of children laborers, increases in schools, and harsher punishments for those caught sexually exploiting children. By 2014, there were an increase in child labour laws in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, Madagascar, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, Chad, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Lesotho, South Africa, Djibouti, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have produced plans to increase child education, set age limits on child labor, and enacted laws to eliminate child trafficking and sexual exploitation. C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Tanzania, and Uganda have conducted individual research on child labor and child trafficking but have not enacted any laws.  Current Global Laws  Since its induction, the International Labour Organization currently has 23 conventions, or laws, within its constitution that regulate the labor of adults and children. These laws include the minimum age restriction, protection against forced labor, holiday/vacation time granted, conditions of the workforce, safety standards, protection against pregnant women, and night time working conditions. Within these conditions are stricter standards set for the safety of children. Most of the conventions and recommendations for child labour fall under Article 3, The Elimination of child labour and the protection of children and young persons. The first convention listed is the Minimum Age Convention, 1973. This convention states that a person under 18 cannot work in a facility that may jeopardize their safety, health, or morals. This work includes mining, operation of heavy machinery, and heavy manual labor. Children ages 13‚Äì15 may perform light work as long as the work does not bring any harm or hinder their education. Children under 13 are restricted from working. The Worst Forms of Child Labor conventions mandates that persons under 18 cannot be used in work as slaves, prostitution, pornography, or drug trafficking. The Medical Examination conventions hold that a child under 18 cannot work in an industrialized or non-industrialized position without being deemed fit by medical professional. Person's under the age of 18 are not permitted to work underground such as in a mine. Persons aged 18‚Äì21 are required to be supervised when working in an underground environment. Lastly, persons over the age of 14 but younger than 18 must have at least 12 hours off, 14 if currently engaged in school, and these hours must include the hours of 10PM through 6AM. These conventions and recommendations are in place to provide children with a safe working environment and promote their education. Since its start in 1919, 186 countries have become members of ILO. As a member of the ILO, countries vow to keep the minimum conventions held in the ILO constitution.  Changes Taking Place  Since the start of these organizations, there has been a decrease in the number of child laborers. Between 2008-2012 there was a reduction of 78 million child laborers. This was nearly one third of child laborers since 2008, with the highest number of reduction in Asian countries. Even with the reduction, there is an estimated 168 million children ages 5‚Äì17 still in the labor force. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest number of child laborers. Sub-Saharan Africa are enslaving child workers and exploiting their labour in the production of cocoa and mining. The ILO and IPEC are concentrating their efforts in Sub-African in order to reduce and eliminate child labour in the regions. One way to ensure that products bought were not produced by child labour or through unsafe labour practices is by purchasing items through the World Fair Trade Organization, WTFO. The WTFO set 10 core principles which includes that any products registered could not have been produced by forced child labour and if any child labour was provided it remained within the conventions of the ILO.  Global Organizations Promoting Change  The International Labour Organization, or ILO, is the leading organization advocating against child labour. The ILO mission is to promote the rights of workers, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and increase awareness of work-related issues. Founded in 1919 after World War One. Since its inception, the ILO has promoted safe working environments. In 1973, the ILO drafted its first conventions. Since then it has had several modifications. Currently, the ILO contains 186 nations that have vowed to maintain the minimum labour requirements in these conventions. The ILO continues to push for global labour laws and restrictions on child labour. The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) is an organization established in 1992 by the International Labour Organization. Where the ILO is centered on reform in all forms of labour, both adult and child, the IPEC primarily focuses on the elimination of all forms of child labour. The IPEC uses programs to remove children from working environments and places the children in an educational setting. The IPEC provides job training for the parents to enhance their economic position to reduce the reliance of income from the child. The IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries and is the largest operation in the world working to reduce child labour. UNICEF, or the United Nation Children's Fund, was founded in 1919 after World War I. UNICEF promotes the safety and well being of children and actively works to change harsh conditions that children live in. UNICEF promotes education for all children. UNICEF also works against to reduce and eliminate child labour and the exploitation of children. Currently UNICEF has programs in 190 countries and programs. The International Initiative to End Child Labor (IIECL) is a not-for-profit organization based out of the United States that actively works around the world to end child labor. The IIECL uses education and training programs to enable children and adults to gain an education and promote adult based labor skills. The organization also monitors and evaluates public and private sector, non-government organizations, organizational research, and development institutions to eliminate child labor. The Child Labor Coalition was founded in 1989. The Child Labor Coalition uses its Stop Child Labor campaign to promote the education and well-being of working minors as well as actively work to eliminate the exploitation of children.

Greek letter societies include Greek letter organizations, sororities, fraternities, and Greek life. Members join while enrolled in tertiary education. These organizations primarily consist of solely all women or all men. Members of a Greek letter society share collective goals and understandings of the organization's requirements, rituals, and relationships. Membership is generally focused within the undergraduate education, where many students begin to explore and experiment within different experiences, but also requires a lifetime commitment to the society. Greek letter societies, with their emphasis on member relations, provide a platform for members to create their own identity through the organization. Identity creation for those are transitioning to a new chapter of their life, like undergraduate students, relies heavily on who you interact with and who you build relationships with. Greek letter organizations offer opportunities for incoming students to interact with, and create relationships with, diverse individuals to mold their identity. Greek letter Societies also require a monetary commitment through the payment of member dues, bringing in the factor of privilege into the organizations. Being surrounded and bonded by others who also share, most likely, very similar classes, family situations, and financial commitments can affect how youths' identities are created in this transitional period. This causes more unanimity within the chapters, and Greek life as a whole, as only those who have the privilege to both attend secondary education and pay their organization's dues. In addition to class, racial factors within Greek letter organizations play a large role in how identity can be created. In conjunction with class, Greek life among college students in North America consists primarily of Caucasian members. Certain chapters only accept members of a particular race or heritage. This adds to the unanimity that class and privilege creates, causing members to be only surrounded by those primarily of their lifestyle. While Greek letter organizations started in, are primarily active in the United States, there also international chapters in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. The root traditions for Greek letter Organizations are generally constant around the world, but do have different demographics and traditions. College education differentiates between countries and continents, but many of the Greek traditions of chapters remain constant such as rituals and greetings. Comparing North American and international Greek chapters differentiates American traditions and international expectations. Greek Life and Relationship Building Two members of Kappa Delta Rho bonding during a Brotherhood event.  Bonds  Greek letter organizations rely heavily on the relationship among its members, both active and alumni. Through practices that bring the chapter together as a whole, fraternities and sororities place emphasis upon the bond that is created through their shared Greek affiliation. These bonds are created through educational, social, and ritualistic bonds that build the relationships. Educational practices of these bonding practices can consist of the academic demands of membership in Greek Letter organizations. With pressure from higher education in itself and academic standards, such as a minimal grade point average requirement, members have the support of their fellow members who are also under similar pressures of success to bond and create relationships with. Members also are able to create mutual relationships over their coursework or availability to study aids within the chapter. Social practices such as sisterhoods or brotherhoods bring the chapter together as a whole, not as individual members or pledge classes. These consist of both non-alcoholic and alcoholic events that allow the members to build better relationships within the chapter. Members, foremost and most concretely, are bonded through their organization's ritualistic practices. Through pledge processes, initiation, and chapter rituals throughout membership, the members hold ritualistic practices that are, in most cases, unique and confidential within the chapter. Holding these secretive and unique practices gives the members a shared bond that transcends all other social or academic bonds. Learning is created in an environment where there is a constant emphasis upon interpersonal relationships, such as a collegiate Greek letter organization.Reuter, Timothy H., et al. \\"A Values- Based Learning Model to Impact Maturational Change: The College Fraternity as Developmental Crucible\\". Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors, Inc. (AFA) 2012. 19-36. Interacting with people on a consistent basis allows for a broader exposure to different world views, educational practices, and opinions that transforms a dualistic perception of the world to one that understands multiplicity of perspectives and a larger schematic threshold. Greek letter organizations provides the basis for these worldly understandings to flourish since they provide the relationships needed. These changes that are evident in relationship building that continue to be influential into early adulthood.  Relationships in Identity Creation  Relationship building is a component to identity creation in young adults. Attending college is the next step for many privileged high school students when transitioning into adulthood.Greek-Letter Membership and College Graduation: Does Race Matter Severtis, Ronald E. Jr.; Christie-Mizell, C. Andre Page 99-101 Prior to college, young people who attend rely more heavily upon their parents or parental figures for guidance through difficult transitions or stressful life situations.Lisa M. Swenson, Alicia Nordstrom, Marnie Hiester\\"The Role of Peer Relationships in Adjustment to College\\" Journal of College Student Development. 2008. Vol. 49 pp. 560-563 As young people begin to take on more responsibilities that are linked with adult life, they transition from relying on their parents to relying on their peers. These relationships include friendships and romantic relationships. These relationships, and their quality, become a factor in how young adults create their identity, and use them to transition into adulthood. The greater support accumulated from peer relationships allowed for flourishing academics, greater mental health, and more confidence in self characteristics.Lisa M. Swenson, Alicia Nordstrom, Marnie Hiester\\"The Role of Peer Relationships in Adjustment to College\\" Journal of College Student Development. 2008. Vol. 49 pp. 560-563 The quality of peer relationships has been seen as a sign of how well the student is adjusting to college and their next steps into life. Greek letter organizations give students an option to create or seek out these relationships at an early, and vulnerable step in their new journey. But, these relationships created at such an infantile stage in their development can also cause student to adopt values and perceptions that may not have surfaced without the influence of their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters Class and Privilege  Monetary Commitments  Members of Phi Mu Sorority on their Bid Day. Many members will pay for extra amenities on Bid Day. Greek organizations require a monetary commitment for membership with the requirement to pay dues.Carnevale, A.P. & Rose, S.J. (2003). Socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and selective college admissions. New York: The Century Foundation. While varying across locales, they generally include chapter fees, national dues, and sometimes social or facility charges. Outside of the member payments, other costs exist. Social events, including appropriate clothes, night-life, Greek \\"family\\" gifts, and letter apparel all are optional, but additional costs. While they are not mandatory, they are seen as part of the Greek culture, and can then cause pressure for members who can not afford all of the extra expenses. These financial burdens can deter lower income college students from joining a chapter. College level extra- curricular involvement statistics within United States Greek membership saw 79% of its members as being in the Upper Middle Class. Greek membership does not require a certain income or social class to join, allowing its lower income members to still be involved despite monetary obligations. One study found that 82% of the working class students worked part-time jobs while 36% were still involved in Greek life. Scholarships are available to members based on their academics and membership. Both nationally, and regionally, alumni will donate to scholarship funds for members who may struggle with the financial aspect of membership.  Class and Identity Creation  Socioeconomic class has an effect on how an individual's identity is created. Because it is based heavily upon the social class and wealth of parents, young people generally have little mobility while in their youth to change their social class. Social class, both high and low, affects the future of youth. For many, it outlines what their future may hold and the availability of opportunity. College education, in itself, is a privilege because of increasing costs. As expectations inflate, more is needed to just meet bare- minimum requirements for success, and a college education has progressively become a norm, instead of a privilege. Upper middle class students in higher education were also more likely to be involved in internships and off-campus studies in conjunction with Greek Life. Factoring in, as well, the opportunities that can arise from being involved in Greek life, such as job opportunities, networking opportunities, and employment through the organization, socioeconomic class becomes a determiner in later success in life Greek letter organizations provide connections to members across the world, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Members. Members are automatically connected to active and alumni members of their own chapters, and of any Greek letter organization across the world. Members' connections gained through these privileged organizations offers opportunities and potential for success outside of just merit based success. Class, in its ability to gain these connections, begins, then, to offer success in life, no longer just relying on merit or advances through individual improvement. Race and Culture Greek letter organizations welcome in an race or culture in their organizations. Because they are national organizations, they are not legally able to discriminate against a potential new member's race or culture. Because race and class are so closely linked when looking at privileged organizations like Greek life, the two both affect the membership. Just like class causes potential new members to be discouraged because of cost or financial pressures, those who do not fit the majority race of Greek letter organizations can also feel discouraged from joining. In the United States, African American youth have lower educational opportunities, creating the gap between races.Greek-Letter Membership and College Graduation: Does Race Matter Severtis, Ronald E. Jr.; Christie-Mizell, C. Andre Page 99-100 Since they are primarily affiliated with upper-middle class members, Greek letter organizations are also affiliated with Caucasian members, since lower income can be linked to those of color. Greek letter organizations are a primarily a Caucasian institution on college campuses. While they may not be outwardly discriminatory, historical links to Caucasian participation in Greek letter organizations causes a racial divide in members and non members. Members of different cultural backgrounds, such as women and men of Asian or Latino descent, may feel excluded or marginalized with the unanimity found in many chapters.Park, J.J. (2008). Race and the Greek system in the 21st Century: Centering the voices of Asian American women. The NASPA Journal, 45(1), 103-132.  Black Greek Letter Organizations  Members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority While many Greek letter organizations allow for any race or culture to be accepted, there are also specific organizations that affiliate with a specific race or culture. These organizations seek to fill the racial gap among black involvement in Greek life in college. Black Greek Letter Organizations are Greek life specifically for those who identify as African American. These organizations are not known as prominently as traditional Greek letter organizations, but consist of many similar attributes such as pledging, sisterhood/brotherhood, hazing, and ritual.Parks, Gregory S., \\"Black Greek Letter Organizations in the Twenty-First Century\\". The University of Kentucky Press. 2008\\" The National Panhellenic Council recognizes nine BGLO's, referred to as the \\"Divine Nine\\", including:Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Delta Sigma Theta sorority, Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, Zeta Phi Beta sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, and Iota Phi Theta fraternity. Black Greek letter organizations hold many of the same expectations and experiences as predominantly white organizations including their recruitment process, involvement in Greek life as a community, and societal norms like hosting parties for other members of the Greek community to partake in. BGLO‚Äôs face different arrangements and expectations than of the predominantly white Greek letter organizations. BGLO‚Äôs have less access to economical resources such as Greek houses and alumni endowments that many other organizations base large portions of their identity upon. These limited resources create a larger divide between white and black Greek letter organization, deepening the institutional unanimity. BGLO‚Äôs also face much higher reputational constraints than predominantly white organizations. There are generally fewer BGLO‚Äôs on college campuses than predominantly white organizations, increasing their visibility among students, staff, and media. Members much be more conscious of their decisions and actions, lacking the higher anonymity that predominantly white Greek letter societies hold. Along with the BGLO, the National AIPA Panhellenic association, consists of sororities with members who come from Asian Pacific Islander cultures. International Greek Letter Societies Greek letter organizations started in the United States, and have been the most prominently publicized and known within the American culture. Many chapters within the United States have expanded internationally, expanding American culture and prompting new, non- American Greek letter organizations to charter in respective countries.  Greek Life in the Philippines  The Philippines has chartered many chapters of Greek letter organizations at their universities. They have both American chapters chartered in their country, as well as new lettered organizations in just their country. These chapters mirror American Greek letter organizations with the cultural importance and competition between chapters.  Greek Life in Canada  Some of the first chapters to be chartered internationally were instituted in Canada, with Zeta Psi being the first at the University of Toronto. These chapters were deemed similar to the American chapters based on their size, reputation, and exclusivity. McGill University in Canada also holds Greek letter organizations, many of the same as the University of Toronto, but hold less weight and campus involvement as many of their American Chapters. The Greek organizations on Canadian campuses hold similar effects to American Greek letter organizations. In a student's first year in college, they will have a higher GPA after being involved in on-campus organizations, like Greek letter societies. Students who are involved in these organizations have more support and are able to gain resources more easily, broadening their intellectual and social education. But, like in American Greek life, involvement also creates opportunity for over-exertion and detrimental involvement in activities such as binge-drinking and bar presence. Both negative and positive forms of involvement have large influences on a youth's changing identity in college. Many American chartered Greek letter organizations, such as Kappa Alpha Theta, have international chapters in Canada.

Youth in the Dominican Republic constitutes just over 30% of the total population. The Dominican Republic's population at roughly eleven million people has grown tremendously with the help of the youth population. In 1960, the youth population was at 3.3 million, and by 2008, it had reached 9.5 million, with two thirds of them in urban areas of the country. The Dominican Republic is considered a middle- income country, and thrives economically through tourism and telecommunications. Tourism is the single best revenue earner and over 25,000 youth are employed in this sector. Although tourism generates large revenues, some scholars and activists argue that the development of tourism has negative impacts on youth by keeping them from pursuing higher education. Primary and secondary education are free to all citizens of the Dominican Republic. Higher education is free in the public sector, most notably at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo, which enrolls 44% of the total tertiary student population. The Dominican Republic is the only country that has a youth-only secretariat. In 2000, the country approved its General Youth Law, which allocates a budget of 1% of the national budget for the youth secretariat. The General Youth Law helps with youth development programs that promote education and development. The country also has multiple governmental laws that protect minors younger than eighteen years old from being arrested, legally processed, and going to jail.  Youth policy and law  Youth in the Dominican Republic face challenges to participating fully and positively in society. The Ministry of Youth and the General Youth Law of 2000 pinpoints Youth Civic Participation as an important part of promoting youth development and well-being. The General Youth Law has a national education-based policy that requires high school students to complete sixty hours of service as a prerequisite of graduation. The Law for the System of Protection regulates the treatment of minors from birth to age 18. This law states that children under the age of 13 are not criminally liable, while youth ages 13‚Äì18 are. The electoral participation rate in the Dominican Republic is higher than the Latin America average, as over 77.3 percent indicated they had voted in the last election. Younger residents between the ages of 18-25 had a 29.2 percent voting rate, compared to 75.6 percent in the 26-35 year age range. Youth Civic Participation Programs attempt to foster youths' positive civic participation and reduce negative and illegal behaviors. Other programs are available to help youth obtain birth certificates and identity documents. As of 2006, there were 17,000 children and youth who have been issued birth certificates, allowing them to attend school and vote in elections. Youth in the Dominican Republic tend to distrust government officials and institutions because they feel exploited. They tend to fear the judicial process; afraid jail will hinder them from reaching adulthood. Young adults in the Dominican Republic say that they believe they have a negative image in society, but ultimately just want their voices heard by older members of the community. Some organizations that seek to empower young people with the specific intent that they will go out and further empower their communities are Fundacion Sur Adelante and the Callegjera-Action Educational Foundation. These organizations work with the youth population to mobilize them to become change agents. They also provide them with access to libraries, computers, and law services to allow them the awareness they need to better organize themselves for the future. There are also set policies that help youth improve their creative and innovative skills for the workforce and reducing barriers that could limit their access to the labor market. These policies are responsible for detecting and removing children from child labor, while also ensuring compliance with labor rights.  Employment  Youth face difficulties when entering the labor market and have unemployment rates considerably higher than adults. In 2008, youth ages 10‚Äì24 represented 24% of the total labor force in the Dominican Republic, and 43% of the total unemployed population. Unemployment in the Dominican Republic appears to be in a slight but steady increase of 14.3 percent since 2010. An unbalanced market of supply and demand limits the number of jobs available to youth. Skill gaps prove to be another obstacle to the youth and jobs are too complex for youth just out of high school or college. The lack of counseling services available to youth often prohibit them from obtaining jobs. Agriculture is the primary source of employment for youth in rural areas while wholesale and retail trade is the primary source of employment for youth in urban areas. Over 75% of the youth labor force is concentrated in five activities: wholesale and retail trade, other services, manufacturing, hotels, bars and restaurants, and agriculture. Self-employment is also a popular option among all age groups in the Dominican Republic. It has increased from 34% in 1991 to about 43% in 2011, leading to a measured increase in familiarity and comfort when working. The labor force participation is lower among young women due to gender stereotypes, which causes them to rely on self-employment. In 2007, the average wage for women was 87% of the average wage for men. One program available for youth trying to find employment is \\"Quesqueya believes in you\\" or NEO in the Dominican Republic, which is a program designed to increase job opportunities for low- income people, aged 15‚Äì29, living in urban areas of thirteen of the country's provinces. Another program available is Espacios para Emprender (EpE), which is designed to equip 14-17 year old adolescents with the strategies required to find a job or establish a micro-enterprise. Work and education, combined early in life, often burden youth. Some youth believe that relocating to a larger city would benefit them and provide more opportunity in the work force.  Crime  In 2011, poverty levels were around 40.4%, compared to 32% in 2000. The World Bank 2006 study conducted a study on youth violence in the Caribbean and the primary motivation identified for committing a crime was the desire to escape poverty. The scarcity of resources may push young people into unsustainable and dangerous survival activities often creating violent neighborhoods. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that over 50% of the population between 12‚Äì24 years is at-risk in participating in illegal and dangerous activities. Youth in the Dominican Republic can find a sense of social support in gangs. Many youth experiencing poverty can be excluded by the wider Dominican society, and gangs are sometimes the only option of acceptance. In the 2012 Latin American Public Opinion Project survey, the Dominican Republic was ranked first of all the Latin American countries, as 48.6% of neighborhoods reported to being affected by gangs. Members of gangs often participate in drug use and fight out of boredom. For many young people, a gang is a social participation space, a system of values in which individual and group identities are affirmed through new communication codes and forms of authority that are different from those that exist in the world of formal institutions.  Education  Education in the Dominican Republic is free and compulsory at the elementary level, and free but not mandatory at the secondary level. Basic education enrollment is 89%, while secondary education enrollment is lower at 50%, as some youth face different constraints to accessing education at this level. Around 55% of children and adolescents do not attend school because their right to enter the system is denied. This restricted access to education affects children who do not have documents, which includes children who were born in the country to undocumented Dominican parents and children of Haitian parents.left Many Haitians migrate to the Dominican Republic increasing the youth population in the school systems. There was an increase of Haitians in the Dominican Republic after an earthquake struck the island in 2010, killing over 200,000 people. Overcrowding is one problem that schools face, especially in urban settings. In public schools with 500 students or more (accounting for 68% of total enrollment), the student-teacher ratio is 78:1 (clarify this). Teachers are not able to work with individual students. Youth spend almost ten years in school, but make progress very slowly because they have to repeat grades. 12.4% of youth repeat the first three grades in urban areas, while 7.7% repeat grades in rural areas. Nearly 25,000 youth ages 15‚Äì19 characterized themselves as unable to read or write. Teachers in the Dominican Republic may only understand around 40% of the material they are teaching.  Health  In the Dominican Republic, the population ages 15‚Äì24 are documented as the healthiest age group. One issue in the health sector is sexual health. 15% of females and 24% of males ages 15‚Äì24 reported have their first sexual relation before age 15. The proportion of youth who have sex at a young age was inversely related to both education and income. Youth that were sexually active early in life had dropped out of school earlier that those who had waited to engage in sexual activity. Fewer than half of the female population that were sexually active used contraception. Because of the limited use of contraception, the Dominican Republic has one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates outside of Africa. Females are more susceptible to HIV and AIDS given that they are more likely to engage in commercial sex work compared to males. The Code for the System of Protection and Fundamental Rights of Children and Adolescents guarantees the rights to health and health services for children and adolescents. The General Law of Health ensures that these rights are preserved for youth, women, senior citizens, and the disabled. 82% of males ages 15‚Äì19 and 73.5% of females reported having consumed alcohol sometime in the prior three months. Although the legal drinking age is eighteen, many young adults begin consuming before that.  References  Dominican Republic society ","title":"Youth in the Dominican Republic"},{"id":"48640148","text":"The effects of genocide on youth include psychological and demographic effects that affect the transition into adulthood. These effects are also seen in future generations of youth. Demographic effects involve the transfer of children during genocides. In cases of transfer, children are moved or displaced from their homes into boarding schools, adoptive families, or to new countries with or without their families. There are significant shifts in populations in the countries that experience these genocides. Often, children are then stripped of their cultural identity and assimilated into the culture that they have been placed into. Unresolved trauma of genocide affects future generations of youth. Intergenerational effects help explain the background of these children and analyze how these experiences shape their futures. Effects include the atmosphere of the household they grew up in, pressures to succeed or act in specific ways, and how they view the world in which they live. The passing down of narratives and stories are what form present day perceptions of the past. Narratives are what form future generations' ideas of the people who were either victimized or carried out the genocide. As youth of future generations process the stories they hear they create their own perception of it and begin to identify with a specific group in the story. Youth of future generations begin to form their identity through the narratives they hear as they begin to relate to it and see how the genocide affects them. As stories are passed down, children also begin to understand what their parents or grandparents went through. They use narratives as explanation of why their parents talk about it in the way they do or do not talk about it all. Psychological effects of genocide are also relevant in youth. Youth who experience an extreme trauma at an early age are often incapable of fully understanding the event that took place. As this generation of children transition into adulthood, they sort out the event and recognize the psychological effects of the genocide. It is typical for these young survivors to experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as other psychological disorders. Transitioning out of youth and into adulthood is an important development marker in the lives of all people. Youth who transition into adulthood during a genocide have a different experience than those who do not transition during a genocide. Some youth transition earlier as means of survival. Others are unable to fully transition, remaining in a youth state longer. Native Americans in the United States Girls at the Albuquerque Indian School (year unknown) Native Americans in the United States were subject to military and land-taking campaigns by U.S. government policies. Disease reduced 95 percent the American Indian population between 1492 and 1900, the worst demographic collapse in human history. There were also frequent violent conflicts between Indians and settlers. Scholarly debates have not resolved whether specific conflicts during US military expansion can be defined as genocide because of questions over the intent. Specific conflicts such as the Sand Creek massacre, the 1851 California Round Valley Wars, and Shoshoni massacres in the 1860s in Idaho have been described as genocidal or genocide. Cultural genocide included the intent to destroy cultural systems like collective land ownership and preventing children from learning the Native culture. Youth and children were included among non- combatants killed by military forces, vigilantes, or disease during US colonization. Cases of girls being raped and children being cut into pieces were documented in the states of Arizona, Ohio, and Wyoming in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Children were taken prisoner after battles between whites and Native Americans.  Youth in boarding schools  Youth were a primary target for many state projects. From 1824 until the 1970s, approximately 100 boarding schools were operated by the United States federal government. Native families volunteered and were forced to send their children to attend Indian Boarding Schools. it has been claimed that this state intention was to keep youth from learning indigenous culture: one boarding school founder described boarding schools as a way to \\"Kill the Indian, Save the Man.\\" Children at these sites experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. However, oral histories also document that youth had good experiences of friendships, skills learned, and sporting events. As adults, they often struggled to raise their own children when returning to Indian cultural contexts.  Intergenerational effects  Brave Heart and DeBruyn, psychologists treating American Indian youth, compare psychological trauma caused by massacres, land allotment, and boarding schools to the trauma experienced by Holocaust survivor descendants. Adults who experienced boarding schools as children seek treatment to be able to adequately bond with their children. American Indian groups have created treatment processes such as the Takini Network: Lakota Holocaust Survivors' Association to treat youth and adults through cultural competence, participation in traditional ceremonies, and grief management. Armenian genocide, Turkey The Armenian genocide began in 1915 when the Turkish government planned to wipe out Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. About 2 million Armenians were killed and many more were removed from the country by force. The Turkish government does not acknowledge the events of the Armenian genocide as genocide. Demographic effects The biggest demographic shift is the number of children that were internally displaced within the Ottoman Empire. During the Armenian genocide, at least 60,000 youth were transferred to many different locations. Children were taken from their homes and transferred to poorly supplied camps where they would be sold. Some children were sold to central Anatolia to wealthy households for education and assimilation into the Turkish culture. Other children were sold to Muslim villagers who would then receive a stipend each month for raising them. In these instances, the displaced children had typically better lives than what they would have had with Armenian parents. Not all went to these types of homes. Some youth were sold for circumstances of exploitation and unpaid hard labor. Other youth were sent to homes in which they experienced physical and sexual abuse. Some young people were placed in homes of the people who were responsible for their parents' deaths. No matter what type of home they were sent to, the transfer of children involved the stripping of their culture identity. Their Armenian culture was erased by being raised in non-Armenian households; the Turkish government was carrying out a cultural genocide. Intergenerational effects Narratives of the stories of the genocide are passed down from generation to generation in order for the story to continue to live on. It allowed the children of future generations to find their sense of ethnic identity through it. There are many different aspects of life in which children begin to form their identity, and in the Armenian culture, an emphasis is placed on the children to identify with the Armenian culture. Though the events of the Armenian genocide are historical facts, the personal stories from witnesses are used as a cultural artifact in the lives of Armenian children. They grow up with this strong sense of belonging to this culture due to these stories of suffering and use them as a uniting force. Armenians are united in this ethnic community, known as the Armenian diaspora. Whether they are Russian or Armenian-Americans, they are part of the Armenian diaspora. The desire for future generations to actively be part of this Armenian diaspora stems from the primary generation and their experiences with the cultural genocide. Future generations of genocide survivors recognize the shift in their geographical location due to the genocide. Future generations of Armenian-Americans have been told and retold the stories of how their ancestors came to America, and they recognize that if it had not been for the Armenian genocide, they might not be where they are today. They see the effect of the genocide in that they might still be in Armenia. Future generations of children that are born in Russia recognize that their geographical location within Russia was effected by the genocide. They feel at home in places such as Krasnodar, Russia because that is where their families have migrated to after the genocide. Although the future generations of Armenian genocide survivors have migrated all over the globe and made their homes in these places, their ancestors have instilled a love for Armenia, the historic homeland. Cambodian genocide, Cambodia The Cambodian genocide began in 1975 when Pol Pot, a Khmer Rouge leader, attempted to build a Communist peasant farming society. About 1.5 million Cambodians died. Demographic effects Many Cambodian youth were taken to Canada in the 1980s. Most came through private sponsorship programs or through the Canadian federal government as refugees. Many of these sponsorship programs were Christian organizations through the \\"Master Agreement\\" made with the Canadian government. Primarily, families became refugees in Montreal and Toronto. Other small groups of refugees went to Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Vancouver. Most refugees were of the lowest economic class in Cambodia, and they had less education. An emphasis was placed on getting the children refugees caught up academically with their peers of the same age by sending them to school. Cambodian Canadians preferred to stay in bigger cities such as Toronto because it allowed the children to attend school together. In these areas where the Cambodian population was higher, racism in schools against Cambodian refugees was less evident. Though they were placed in Canada, there was still a stress to maintain Khmer culture. Many parents continued to speak Khmer to their children, keeping the language alive. Khmer d√©cor was hung in homes and Khmer traditions were carried out within the homes as a way to raise the children in Khmer culture. Intergenerational effects Many second and third generation youth of survivors of the Cambodian genocide recognize the stories they are told as their primary source of information. The stories they hear discuss the Khmer Rouge in a negative way. Survivor stories include talk about harsh living and working conditions in which they were separated from their families, starved, tortured, and even killed. Other households avoid the subject all together. Some survivors do not want to relive the old traumas so they keep silent. Other survivors cannot make sense of it and do not want to be subject to the questions of youth that they cannot answer. Many youth in the generations following the genocide experience broken home life. They live in homes controlled by parents with PTSD. The youth experience their parents' hyper arousal, intrusive recollection, traumatic amnesia, and being easily frightened. Even if the parents do not have PTSD, they still often elicit behaviors of emotional unavailability, over protection, and poor parenting on their children. Some children of survivors experience violence in their home such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. Children in the following generations who have been raised in violent homes because of their parents' experiences have often elicited violent behaviors. School shootings, stabbings, and knifings have become more common among Cambodians following the genocide. Some youth believe that it is because of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide that they suffer from economic hardships. In schools following the events of the Cambodian genocide, youth received mixed interpretations of the events of the genocide. Information about the time period in which these events occurred, known as the Democratic Kampuchea, was severely limited or even taken out of textbooks. Children previously participated in Hate Day, a day in which they were taught to hate Pol Pot and disapprove of the Khmer Rouge. Now, the day has become known as the Day of Remembrance in which they remember those who lost their lives during this time. It was not just the following generations of the survivors that were affected by the genocide, but the youth of the Khmer Rouge as well. Most youth with parents who were members of the Khmer Rouge do not hear of the events from their parents, but rather find information from museums, neighbors, and friends. Once they find out the cruelty that their parents and grandparents exhibited, they often feel embarrassed and do not want to identify themselves as children of the Khmer Rouge. Many Khmer Rouge members are ashamed and fear ostracism from their peers. Psychological effects Cambodian youth who had been a part of the Cambodian genocide experienced high levels of violence early on in their lives. Many youth survivors have shown symptoms of PTSD. The amount of Cambodian genocide survivors with PTSD is five times higher than the average in the United States. Many survivors also experience panic disorder. There are children who survived the Cambodian genocide that may not have experienced the genocide directly, yet they still experienced psychological effects of the genocide through their parents. Parents often elicited anger towards their children following the Cambodian genocide. This anger was frequent and the episodes met the criteria for a panic-attack. When this anger was elicited within the home, trauma recall among the parent and the child was often triggered, resulting in catastrophic cognitions. Groups of Cambodian refugees often fled to highly populated areas in the country in which they fled to. Within these countries, they often resided in poorer areas of the city, which were considered high violence areas. Youth who experienced high violence in Cambodia and then moved to high violence areas in other countries are at greater risk for developing PTSD. Transition to adulthood Military agrarianism was stressed under the Khmer Rouge, meaning young people were expected to be peasants and soldiers as part of the war effort. Prior to this time of war, youth was defined as a time free from responsibilities, typically ages seven to twenty-one. At the end of this time, youth would transition into adulthood via getting a job, having a family, and gaining responsibility. As youth became a part of the war effort, this transition was delayed. Youth were not able to transition into adulthood until almost age thirty. Instead of gaining more responsibility, youth stayed in a time of which they were disciplined, controlled, and homogenized by military leaders. Some child victims of the genocide who were able to escape the Khmer Rouge and flee to other countries were able to stay on track with their transition into adulthood. Many children were put in schools right away in order to keep them on the same academic level as their peers. Parents encouraged children to finish school, find work, and pursue family life in the same manner as their peers. Holocaust, Germany Youth survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camps during the Holocaust. The youth that survived this camp were primarily young Jewish males. The Holocaust began in 1933 prior to World War II in Germany when the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler's rule attempted to wipe out the \\"inferior\\" people of the country. This primarily included people of the Jewish culture, but also included Gypsies, the disabled, some Slavic people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals. By the end of the Holocaust in 1945, more than 6 million Jewish people had been killed. Of these 6 million that had been killed, 1.5 million were children between ages zero and eighteen. By killing off many Jewish children, the Nazi regime hoped to exterminate the core and root of the Jewish culture. Demographic effects Following the Holocaust, many survivors in Europe became displaced persons. Younger survivors had grown up inside concentration camps, Jewish ghettos in Nazi- occupied Europe or in hiding. The destruction of murdered family and community and continuing hatred and violence against Jews often made return to their hometowns impossible. Many survivors went to European territories that were under the rule of the Allies of World War II. Some survivors went legally or illegally to British Mandatory Palestine. Many displaced persons went to the State of Israel, established in May 1948. Quota restrictions on immigration to the United States were gradually loosened, allowing many Holocaust survivors to immigrate to the United States where they were provided with US immigration visas for displaced persons under the Displaced Persons Act. Other destinations included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South America, and South Africa. Intergenerational effects Survivors of the Holocaust lived through very traumatic experiences, and their children and grandchildren felt the repercussions of this trauma. Generations following the Holocaust learned to have a distrust of the world. They were taught that the world and the people in it were inherently bad and could not be trusted, producing an ever-present fear of danger. Parents gave youth a terrifying worldview by failing to provide an effective framework of security and stability. Parents viewed the world as inherently bad, and they often inflicted overprotectiveness on their children. Children of survivors of the Holocaust grew up with many restrictions to their daily lives as parents took on controlling roles in order to protect their children from the outside world. Survivors of the Holocaust received little to no education while in the concentration camps. They lost all opportunity to advance academically. Children of survivors feel the repercussions of the Holocaust by the parents' constant pressure for them to achieve academically. The role of the child within the family was to provide hope for the future, creating a sense of over involvement of the parents in the children's lives. Children viewed their parents as living vicariously through them; the parents were stripped of a childhood experience and must experience it through their own children. Due to the lack of education, survivors sometimes lacked communication skills. The communication skills they passed on to their children could be affected. An inability to communicate feelings was impressed on children when they were never taught the proper way to do so. The communication that occurred within the home also reflected the knowledge of the Holocaust events that were passed down to further generations. Some parents who survived the Holocaust were very vocal about the events, providing accurate stories to their children to allow the survivor to present the traumatic experience without becoming distant from it. Other parents did not directly recount their traumatic experiences to their children, rather young people became aware of the experiences through hearing the conversations their parents had with others. Some parents did not talk about it at all; they did not want to remember it, were afraid of remembering it, and ashamed of remembering it because of how traumatic the experiences were. Second and third generations of Holocaust survivors have also inherited PTSD symptoms. Because their parents or grandparents have developed such severe PTSD, youth in the following generations have a predisposition to developing PTSD. This predisposition could have been due to the way they were raised. Second and third generations of survivors could also experience subsequent childhood traumas inflicted from their parents or grandparents. Depression in parent survivors is very prevalent, and children of these survivors are more vulnerable to developing depression as well. Behavior disorders were also more prevalent in children of survivors of the Holocaust. Psychological effects Youth that grew up as victims of the Holocaust also experienced many psychological effects. One effect was that of learned helplessness. They grew up believing that they were inferior to everyone else, creating a victim mindset. They also had inherent feelings of abandonment, loneliness, and a sense of being unwanted. Being separated from their parents, separated from everyone they knew, they grew up thinking that everyone left them. Being constantly moved around they were not able to make concrete relationships and became lonely. Youth were raised in concentration camps where if they were not valuable they would be exterminated; proving themselves was used as a survival tactic. The feeling of needing to prove themselves carried over in every day life even as the war ended and they were no longer victims of the Holocaust. As another means of survival, children often had to alter their identities. They rid themselves of Jewish names and tendencies in order to survive. During the Holocaust they grew up believing that they should be ashamed of who they were and their identity. When the war ended, they struggled with returning to their Jewish life. Youth questioned who they were and struggled with finding their identity. Many young people that experienced the Holocaust became suicidal. They lost the desire to exist or felt a deep disgust at the idea of living. Germans questioned why Jews in the ghettos did not commit mass suicide because of how hard the Germans had made life for the Jews. Some youth survivors used the Nazi domination to fuel their desire to live and desire to fight back. Transition to adulthood Youth who experienced the Holocaust at an early age were consequently stripped of their childhood in that they were prevented from having a normal childhood. They were forced to transition into adulthood much more quickly than those who were not victims of this genocide. As children, they had to be adults because it was dangerous to be a child. Children were often targeted groups of people to be exterminated during the Holocaust due to the fact that they could not help the Nazi regime. Young people had to prove themselves beneficial in order to survive, which for them meant becoming adults early on in age. Children survivors have grown up and created an alter ego child who desires to live the childish life that they missed out on due to the Holocaust. Some youth transitioned into adulthood in that they became very future oriented and determined to plan for the future. They planned on how they would continue on life after the Holocaust. Their goal was to live in a manner much like how they had lived before the genocide began. They also talked about achieving more than their parents ever had. Some youth talked about travel and studying abroad, becoming well versed in other languages and cultures. Youth were forced to focus on the future and plan for it rather than dwell in the youth years and childish lifestyle.

The details differ greatly: in Uruguay consumption is legal for those that are at least 18 years old; in the U.S. eleven states have legalized cannabis for recreational use for individuals that are at least 21 years old - while in the Netherlands, all drugs are technically illegal, but those 18 years old and older can smoke cannabis within a ‚Äúcoffeeshop\\". Health and cannabis among minors 186x186px Countries tend to regulate cannabis differently depending on the way in which they view cannabis and its potential effects on individuals, including minors. One reason that individuals are concerned about the use among minors is because of the higher chance of dependency that studies have shown. Epidemiologists have found that 9% of people who begin smoking marijuana at 19 years or older satisfy the criteria of dependency and this number triples at ages under 18 years old. The reason for this is that a minor's brain is under rapid development when they are young. Studies have also shown that anxiety and depressive disorders have been the product of cannabis use and exposure among minors. Medical cannabis is used for children with severe illnesses such as cancer and epilepsy. The use of cannabis relieves the pain and is seen as a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù alternative because it is less addictive than drugs such as morphine and Oxycontin. Other pain-relieving medicines that are opioids tend to cause nausea and vomiting, while cannabis reduces these side effects. Because of this, many advocates argue that if opioids are acceptable to treat a minor‚Äôs pain, then cannabis should be as well. As cannabis consumption among minors has increased, the rate at which they consume alcohol and smoke cigarettes has decreased dramatically. In the United States In the United States, marijuana is illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act, but most states have legalized some form of medical marijuana, and a smaller but growing number of states have legalized marijuana for recreational use by adults, with the exception of adults under 21.Tyler Cole, Sarah Trumble & Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, All State Marijuana Laws Are Not Created Equal, Third Way (February 17, 2016). However, \\"it is currently illegal in all 50 states for minors to use marijuana recreationally.\\" In some states (such as Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut) minors may use certain forms of marijuana for medical use if certain specific conditions are met.How to get medical marijuana for minor patients in Pennsylvania, The Express-Times (July 6, 2016).Robert McCoppin, Children will get access to medical marijuana in Illinois, Chicago Tribune (December 23, 2014).Arielle Levin Necker, Malloy signs medical marijuana for minors bill, CT Mirror (May 17, 2016). Uruguay Legality Uruguay legalized cannabis in 2014. Uruguay is the first nation in the world to regulate all aspects of the cannabis market (production, sales, and consumption) for those that are at least 18 years old. The reason for its proposed legalization was to get rid of the organized crime and violence that came along with the illegal drug industry. Their efforts to legalize the drug were not done because of social pressure, but more so out of the efforts to protect society from the dangers that are produced from an illegal market. Uruguay‚Äôs government wanted to seize the market from criminals, not encourage individuals to smoke cannabis. The law that was put into place states that an individual can have up to six plants at their home, cannabis will be sold over the counter, buyers must sign up for a registry that permits the purchase of cannabis, and there is a 40-gram cap per month. Opposition Despite cannabis being legalized in Uruguay, over 60 percent of people in the country believe legalization should be repealed. Many individuals are doubtful that the legalization of cannabis will get rid of criminal organizations, such as the drug cartel. While criminal groups will not be able to compete with the legalized cannabis costs, they will be able to fall back on other activities such as trafficking and selling harder drugs, which can lead to larger crime. Because the purpose of legalization is for public health and safety reasons, publicity or advertising is against the law. Any kind of publicity of cannabis is prohibited, meaning there cannot be any billboards or advertisements for the drug. Because of the strong opposition of legalization within Uruguay, there is no movement towards legalization of cannabis for minors. Effects on minors Despite the skepticism within society, data has shown that among regular consumers, young individuals are most likely to be the ones consuming cannabis. The age in which one can possess and consume cannabis is 18. In comparison to the United States, this is three years younger. The cannabis consumption age in Uruguay is a reflection of the drinking age, because the legal drinking age in Uruguay is 18 years old as well. Like the United States, Uruguay applied the same kind of restrictions to cannabis as they did to alcohol. After the legalization had passed within Uruguay, there was an increase in secondary school students‚Äô prevalence with the drug. In 2003, 8.4% of students had consumed marijuana during the previous twelve months, and in 2014, 17% had. The typical user at this age was much more likely to be male than female. There are many concerns about this increase in cannabis use, which is why new prevention strategies are being suggested, such as drug education courses. The Netherlands Legality All drugs, including cannabis, are technically illegal in the Netherlands. This means it is illegal to produce, possess, and sell the drugs. Dutch police conduct about 5,000 marijuana raids annually throughout the country. But the government designed a drug policy that tolerates cannabis use under strict conditions for those that are at least 18 years old. Coffeeshops are establishments in the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis for personal consumption by the public is tolerated by the local authorities. Coffee shops The only places individuals can smoke cannabis is within \\"coffeeshops\\". In these coffeeshops, they sell cannabis, which is considered to be soft drugs in comparison to hard drugs; drugs such as heroin. The purpose of these coffee shops are to help people who use soft drugs such as cannabis, to avoid contact with hard drugs, such as heroin. The legal age to get into these coffeeshops is 18 years old. While cannabis can be sold legally through coffeeshops, trafficking the drug is illegal under Dutch law, which means that the coffeeshops have to obtain their cannabis secretly and illegally. Criteria for coffee shops: *must not cause any nuisance; *are not permitted to sell hard drugs; *are not permitted to sell cannabis to minors; *are not permitted to advertise drugs; *are not permitted to sell large quantities (over 5 grams of cannabis) in a single transaction. Effects on minors Many children as young as twelve years old are feeling pressured to try cannabis in the Netherlands. The reason for this is because of the tolerance principle that is in place, meaning that authorities cannot prosecute someone for possessing cannabis if it is under five grams. Because of the lack of enforcement in this, it is giving children the opportunity to possess marijuana in small amounts. Dutch youth have reported higher than average availability of cannabis, but no higher compared to the United States. Many coffee shops have been shut down because of how close they are to schools. Local authorities were afraid that the location of the businesses would influence the youth and take advantage of them. Amsterdam's mayor, Eberhard van der Laan stated ‚ÄúI think the more relaxed you look at this phenomena, the easier people will stop with it because there is no thrill in using it [if it‚Äôs tolerated]\\". This is a common perception among many individuals within the Netherlands. While they fear substance abuse, citizens of the Netherlands are accepting of the decriminalization of cannabis because individuals will often start to find it \\"boring\\" and no longer want to consume cannabis. There is currently no movement towards decriminalization or legalization of cannabis for minors.

In 2015, the estimated population was around twenty-seven million, and 19.11% of the population was between the ages of 15 and 24. Religion impacts the lives of Saudi youth. The government enforces a strict form of Islam called Wahhabism as the national religion that affects the areas of family formation, education and political activism. Islam teaches youth that family should be central to their lives and to respect their parents. Education in Saudi Arabia largely focuses on learning Islam and memorization. These focuses contribute to the employment difficulties of youth as they are not learning the skills that employers look for. High cost of living and career opportunities were two primary concerns of youth in 2014. Saudi youth have difficulties being active participants in politics because of the strict Wahhabi religious doctrine and possible punishments. Saudi youth do want a say in their country's political policies and are achieving this by using popular media. The Tenth Development Plan's objectives address ways in which youth would be involved in the development of the country. Two health concerns that are present in Saudi youth are smoking and obesity. A 2011 study done in Riyadh found that smoking rates among Saudi youth were \\"high and alarming\\". Out of 1272 students studied, the percentage of students that were currently smoking was about 19.5% (31.2% of boys and 8.9% of girls), and the percentage of students that had smoked before was about 42.8% (55.6% of boys and 31.4% of girls). Almost sixty percent of the Saudi population over sixteen was considered obese in 2014.  Government's acknowledgement of youth  No official national youth policy currently exists; however, the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the United Nations Development Programme worked together between 2009 and 2013 in order to make a \\"national youth strategy\\". The National Youth Strategy Project received $1,182,720 and aimed at \\"enhancing participation of youth in national development processes\\". The Ninth Development Plan (2010‚Äì2014) has a youth section that talks about factors affecting youth and ways to improve their lives. Under the Ninth Developmental Plan, Saudi Arabia's primary governmental agency that is responsible for youth and youth programming is the General Presidency for Youth Welfare, which has a budget of $1.9 billion. The General Presidency for Youth Welfare promotes multiple cultural activities, including arts and crafts and drama and folklore clubs. It oversees clubs and agencies involved in youth sports and social activities in order to guarantee \\"balanced development across all youth activities\\". The upcoming Tenth Development Plan (2015‚Äì2019) has as some of its objectives to promote and enhance education as well as youth participation in the development of the country.Ministry of Economy and Planning.\\"Objectives of the Tenth Development Plan.\\" 2015-2019. pg 13-15. PDF. http://www.mep.gov.sa/themes/BlueArc/  Religion  The Tenth Development Plan has as one of its objectives to maintain Islamic teachings and values in the lives of its citizens, including youth. In a 2014 survey, the youth which comprise ninety-seven percent of the respondents, said that Islam was either \\"very important\\" or \\"important\\" in shaping who they are as a person. However, sympathy or agreement with the Al-Qaeda vision of Islam or its ideology is not common among young Saudis because the government of Saudi Arabia termed it as a \\"deviant\\" view of Islam.Murphy, Caryle.\\"Saudi Arabia's Youth and the Kingdom's Future.\\" Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 2011: 1-8. PDF.https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Saudi%20Arabia%E2%80%99s%20Youth%20and%20the%20Kingdom%E2%80%99s%20Future%20FINAL.pdf Due to increased media participation and education, young Saudis are forming their own ideas and views about what is religiously acceptable. Younger Saudis \\"do not defer to the clerics' pronouncements to the same extent as their older siblings and parents did\\", according to Caryle Murphy's article, Saudi Arabia's Youth and the Kingdom's Future.  Family formation  The teachings of Islam say that the family is central in a person's life and that youth should always show respect towards parents. Ninety-eight percent of young Saudis that responded to a 2014 survey had as one of their goals to make their parents proud. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the same survey said that they \\"socialize face-to-face with their parents and relatives every day\\". Traditionally, the family in Saudi Arabia was hierarchical, with the male ruling over the female and the old ruling over the young. Women were seen as crucial to maintaining the structure of the family by assuming the tasks of managing the house and taking care of the children. Women, though, are no longer confined to the house because more are receiving an education and working outside the home. Young people are also delaying the age at which they get married, according to Saudi Arabia's Ninth Development Plan.Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. \\"The Ninth Development Plan.\\" 2010-2014: 313-330. PDF file. http://www.youthpolicy.org/wp- content/uploads/library/2010_Saudi_Arabia_Ninth_Development_Plan_Eng.pdf Between the years of 1979 and 2007, there was an increase in the age of marriage, with males being 1.9 years older (27.2 years old) and females being 4.6 years older (24.6 years old). The high cost of marriage ceremonies, and getting and furnishing a home are two reasons that the Ninth Development Plan cites for youth delaying marriage.  Education  Education is overseen by the Ministry of Education. The 2015 budget increased spending on education by three percent, to $58 billion. The adjusted net enrollment rate for primary school age children was ninety-seven percent in 2014, according to the World Bank Group. In 2013, the net enrollment rate in secondary school for both sexes was 91.55%. Students attend primary school starting at the age of six until they are twelve years old. Intermediate school is attended by youth that are ages twelve to fifteen, and fifteen- to eighteen-year-olds participate in secondary school. Schools are segregated by sex: boys are taught by male teachers, while girls are primarily taught by female teachers. Originally, women's education focused on domestic science. They were primarily taught how to be a good mother and wife. Curriculum that is being taught to students in Saudi Arabia has a religious base, specifically Islamic teachings. It emphasizes memorization, rather than solving the problem. Because employers do not always utilize these skills in their business, it is increasingly difficult for young Saudis to find a job. In response to the educational shortcomings, King Abdullah established his Public Education Development Project, which was launched in 2007. This was an approximately $3 billion program designed to improve public education. Some of the goals that this project has for improving youth education are \\"improving the educational environment and preparing to utilize information and communication technology (ICT) in education to stimulate learning. This is in order to achieve a higher level of efficiency in acquiring information and training, as well as strengthening personal and creative capabilities, developing skills and hobbies, satisfying psychological needs of students, and strengthening ideas as well as national and social relations through extra-curricular activities of various kinds\\". The Public Education Development Project and King Abdullah's scholarship seeks to help students develop problem solving skills as well as a comprehensive world view by allowing students to study in other countries of the world. The Ninth Development Plan addresses some policies that can be implemented in order to make the educational system better. For example, it aims to widen the participation of youth in school and university activities, which would make the school more connected to society. Upgrading the academic curriculum so that it is \\"in line with contemporary knowledge\\", \\"developing the curriculum of science, mathematics, engineering and technology\\" and making sure that Saudi university and scholarship graduates end up in the labor market are three educational objectives of the Tenth Development Plan. Even with these plans in place, there is still criticism of the educational system of Saudi Arabia. Almost half of the students at the primary and secondary education level were not learning at the levels they should be, and one in three Saudi youth said that education was in their top three areas of concern, according to a 2014 survey. Saudi youth believed that they were receiving a good education in terms of Islamic teachings and basic academic subjects; however, they did not feel that they were being adequately prepared to do well in the workforce. These feelings emanated from not being taught soft skills, such as problem solving, teamwork and collaboration, effective communication and critical thinking, that are valued by private- sector employers. In 2013, fifty-eight percent (gross percent) of the Saudi population was enrolled in tertiary education. It is estimated that sixty- three percent of the degrees that students get are not \\"useful for private- sector jobs\\".  Economics  In 2015, the estimated unemployment rate for Saudis that are between the ages of sixteen and twenty-nine is twenty-nine percent. Approximately 1.9 million Saudis will enter the labor force in the next decade. Saudi youth cited career opportunities and the high cost of living as concerns in a 2014 survey. Both of these areas had regional disparities. For example, forty-three percent of youth respondents from the northern part of the country said that career opportunities were a great concern. Twenty-three percent of youth respondents from the center part of the country, which includes the capital Riyadh, cited career opportunities as a concern. The differences in responses could be the result of a greater number of jobs being available in the capital. Nearly sixty percent of youth respondents cited the high cost of living as one of their top three concerns in the 2014 survey. A young Saudi commented that \\"currently, salaries are very low, and the cost of living is very high. If a young man earns 3,000 or 4,000 riyals per month, how can he afford the cost of living when he might be spending around 200 or 300 riyals per day?\\" Seventy-seven percent of youth from the east and seventy-one percent of youth from the south compared to thirty-eight percent of youth that resided in the center that participated in the 2014 survey cited high cost of living as a top concern. Youth in this country are concerned with the number of foreigners employed within the country because they limit the number of jobs native Saudis can get. In 2013, it was estimated that about 7.5 million foreigners were legally working within the country. King Salman and the kingdom's ministries are trying to address this situation through a process known as \\"Saudization\\". Saudization is a national movement that seeks to increase the number of citizens employed within the country. Requiring employers to meet quotas of Saudi workers is one way that Saudization will be achieved and affects youth because they are or will be entering the labor force.  Suffrage and political engagement  Men are allowed to vote at twenty-one years old. In 2015, women were allowed to vote in the municipal elections that was held in December 2015. They will only be allowed to vote at the municipal level elections. \\"Arbitrary arrest and long-term detention\\" for anyone that speaks out against government policies are two reasons that youth are deterred from being politically active. Access to any improvements that the government tries to make in regard to unemployment compensation, housing availability and education would also be lost if youth participated in protest or explicit discontent with the government. The Wahhabi religious doctrine, which the country promotes, states that \\"opposition to the government, especially street protests, is religiously forbidden\\". Saudi youth want a say in governmental policies and procedures because of their increased exposure to the world through social media and the difficulties they are facing (unemployment, living costs and education). In 2012, it was estimated that YouTube use in the country increased 260%, and an estimated one-third of Saudis are active Twitter users. Saudi youth will use Twitter in order to voice their discontent over a lack of political rights, and sixty-three percent of youth said that they would like the government to give them increased participation and access to formulating and implementing policy at the local level in a 2011 survey. In order for youth to effectively participate in the country's development process, part of the Tenth Development Plan's objectives seek to speed up the process of implementing the National Youth Strategy as well as conduct surveys asking youth to comment on their issues and needs, so that the country knows what services to provide for them.  Health risks  Smoking is one health concern that affects Saudi youth. Smoking prevalence among sixteen- to eighteen-year-old students in secondary schools located in Riyadh was \\"high and alarming\\", according to a 2011 study published in the Annals of Thoracic Medicine. Out of 1272 students studied, the percentage of students that were currently smoking was about 19.5% (31.2% of boys and 8.9% of girls), and the percentage of students that had smoked before was about 42.8% (55.6% of boys and 31.4% of girls). Smoking habits are linked to males, friends that smoke and parents that smoke. Two reasons why youth in Saudi Arabia smoked were because it made people \\"look more comfortable\\" and made people of the opposite sex more attractive. 88.4% of students believed that smoking is harmful to one's health, but only 31.8% of students wanted to quit smoking, according to the 2011 study. The authors of this study believe that educational programs on the risks of smoking need to be implemented in schools in order to reduce smoking rates. Obesity is another health concern that affects Saudi youth. Almost sixty percent of the Saudi population over age sixteen was overweight. 21.8% of male students (18‚Äì24 years) that were studying at the College of Health and Sciences campus at Qassim University were overweight, and 15.7% were obese, according to a 2010 study. The risk of attaining cardiovascular disease can be high among youth. Out of 523 males students chosen from schools in Arar with a mean age of 16.7 years, 30.4% were obese and 17.2% were overweight. 33.5% of participants in the study were at risk of getting cardiovascular disease. The risk of cardiovascular disease was \\"strongly related to different dietary and lifestyle habits\\".

As of 2011, youth in Hong Kong ages 15‚Äì24 made up 12.4 per cent of Hong Kong's overall population at 875,200 people. Hong Kong is a hybrid culture, influenced by China and Britain, but overall by its international economic ties and neoliberal policies, which plays a role in shaping the lives of the youth in Hong Kong. The youth in Hong Kong is unique in the fact that many are living Transnationalist identities. The demographics are not just ethnically Chinese youth in Hong Kong, but also youth that are ethnically white, Indonesian, Filipino, which can be seen in Demographics of Hong Kong, and that creates a unique society. \\"Although with a dominant Chinese population, Hong Kong is an international city and is a mix of East and West rich in cultures, history, and religions.\\" The disparity between the rich and poor within Hong Kong has been growing wider. The population consists of slightly more female youth than there are males, with the ratio being 858 males per every 1,000 females in 2014. The population of youth in Hong Kong is expected to decrease by 8 per cent in the next couple years. Hong Kong consists of 18 districts, and the youth are not evenly spread throughout these districts. Roughly 56.3 per cent of Hong Kong youth live in the New Territories. The most common cause of death for Hong Kong youth aged 15‚Äì24 is \\"external causes of morbidity and mortality,\\" and within this category the highest percentage died under the cause of \\"intentional self harm.\\" Hong Kong youths' social world is greatly influenced by family and peer relationships which shape functioning, support, social self-concept, and social isolation. The youth scene in Hong Kong includes risk-taking behaviour such as party going, sex, drug abuse, fighting, and high-speed driving. An important aspect of Hong Kong is its transnational education. Having paid work and a stable job allows young people to become independent from their parents, participate in adult forms of leisure, and gives them adult status in society. However, given the city's salient influence by globalisation, neoliberal values, mainland China and its postcolonial condition, the youth are generally characterised by a fluid and ambivalent cultural and social identity that affects how they frame and mediate future opportunities. Political protests led by Hong Kong youth have become more prevalent in recent years, where these young activists have expressed concern for public and developmental affairs in Hong Kong. The most common reasons to why Hong Kong youth go on the internet and engage in mass media were for entertainment, searching for information, and connecting with friends. Family and peer influence In 2006 and 2011, the proportion of youth living with parent(s) only was in a rising trend between 2001 and 2011 and had risen from 91.5 per cent in 2001 to 94.6 per cent in 2011. Youth who have parents who have higher educational attainment are more likely to have higher educational attainment themselves. Hong Kong youths' social world is greatly influenced by family and peer relationships which shape functioning, support, social self-concept, and social isolation. Between 1996 and 2011, the percentage of never-married females aged 20‚Äì24 had risen from 90.1 per cent to 97.3 per cent while the percentage for males had increased steadily from 94.5 per cent to 98.7 per cent in 2011. According to 87.2 per cent of youth surveyed, marriage was still an important institution. As to the fertility rate, the age-specific fertility rate per 1,000 females aged 20‚Äì24 had rebounded since 2008.  Health  For non-engaged youth in Hong Kong, there are higher risks for experiencing poor mental health and becoming involved in criminal activity than their peers who are engaged. With better family support and strong positive peer relationships there is a lower chance for Hong Kong youth to be depressed or suicidal. The suicide rate in Hong Kong has risen from 35 percent from 1999 to 2003, and has since still been on the rise. Suicide has become the leading cause of death in Hong Kongers aged 15 to 24. For Hong Kong youth who have low social support from their parents and peers, they often feel hopeless and have lower self-worth, increasing the risk for suicide. In Hong Kong there is a stigma against homosexuals that is far greater than their counterparts in the West, even from college students who are typically the most tolerant of subgroups. The youth scene in Hong Kong includes risk-taking behaviour such as party going, sex, drug abuse, fighting, high-speed driving. Attending dance parties, such as raves or discos, seems to expose Hong Kong youth to drugs and other risky behaviour due to peer influence. With the availability of illicit drugs at a low price, more youth are inclined to risk-taking. Based on the study by the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong, the proportion of males aged 18‚Äì27 who had sexual intercourse experience had risen from 36.7 per cent in 1991 to 50.0 per cent in 2011, while the proportion of females aged 18‚Äì27 also had risen from 32.7 per cent in 1991 to 42.0 per cent in 2011. Sexual intercourse is far less common in Hong Kong youth than in North American youth. In 2011, the number of males aged 16‚Äì20 arrested per 100,000 respective populations was 1,665.2 while that for females was 318.6. Most males were arrested for burglary, fighting, possession of narcotics, and violent crimes, while most females were arrested for burglary and possession of drugs. Education Hong Kong students boycott classes, in protest of national education, at the 239x239px As of 2011, 64.8 per cent of Hong Kong youth attended education full-time, with the percentage of youth attending post-secondary schooling on the rise. An important aspect of Hong Kong is its transnational education. It is an education \\"in which the learners are located in a country different from the one where the awarding institution is based.\\" This is true for Hong Kong youth who attend local institutions where foreign courses are offered that are considered British, Australian, American, Chinese. Students can then, through an application, get credit from the institution the courses are offered from even though they took the courses at their home institutions. Hong Kong does not directly regulate the quality of the transnational education offered, nor does it shape the content or cost of courses being offered by foreign providers. Being an internationalised territory, students at both the university level and in post-secondary vocational training in Hong Kong receive an education that is often geared towards international knowledge, rather than just local knowledge and practice. Hong Kong youth, therefore, obtain skills and knowledge that make them marketable for jobs worldwide. Most youth who leave school say they do so to find a good job with a good income. They soon realize their opportunities are limited without at least a senior secondary education level and work-related experience. According to the World Bank, the rate of primary education completion from 2010-2016 in Hong Kong was 96 per cent. The rate of secondary education completion was 93.4 per cent, and the rate of tertiary education completion was 67 per cent. Labour and employment  With the decreasing youth population and increasing participation in full-time education within Hong Kong, the labour force of youth aged 15‚Äì24 has continued to shrink since 1997. Having paid work and a stable job allows young people to become independent from their parents, participate in adult forms of leisure and gives them adult status in society. In relation to future educational and career opportunities, Hong Kong youth exhibit a disposition of aspirational ambivalence. For instance, in Hong Kong, there are many \\"non-engaged\\" youth. \\"Non-engaged\\" youth describes young people in Hong Kong who do not participate in education, employment, or training. Hong Kong has been considered an international and prosperous city for a long time and is one of the wealthiest societies in the world in terms of per capita GDP. Since the general public of Hong Kong recently does not receive much of this economic growth, the past 30 so years has seen far more unemployment and under-employed people living in poverty. This high unemployment has greatly affected youth in Hong Kong who have seen unemployment rates hovering between 10-15 per cent in recent years; the government estimated there were about 200,000 young people who were not receiving training, education, or actively participating in the labour force. The Hong Kong government has therefore been implementing pre-employment training to youth, known as the Youth Pre-employment Training Program (YPTP), and educational opportunities in order for them to learn how to market themselves in order to obtain jobs. Youth without at least a senior secondary education level usually enter the labour market with part-time low-skilled jobs, but even that does not necessarily protect them from exploitative practices from their employers such as low wages. While the government uses programs like the YPTP to try to raise aspirations for non-engaged youth in Hong Kong, this does not guarantee future employment. Furthermore, despite the increased economic integration of Hong Kong with mainland China and increased job opportunities available in the mainland, the youth's attitudes toward pursuing transborder opportunities have generally negative. Youth activism 277x277px Hong Kong went through retrocession to China in 1997, but Hong Kong does have democratic aspirations. Human rights and democracy have emerged quickly in Hong Kong, triggered by the political transition toward the handover of sovereignty, and was accelerated by the Tiananmen Square incident. Hong Kong people have participated in large-scale protests many times to express themselves in the past couple of decades. Political protests led by Hong Kong youth have become more prevalent in recent years, where these young activists have expressed concern for public and developmental affairs in Hong Kong. Many Hong Kong youth participate in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, and the 2014 Hong Kong protests were led by two student groups: Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students. In the 2014 Hong Kong protests students rallied outside Hong Kong's government headquarters calling for political reforms to open up nominations for the city's inaugural direct election in 2017. Hong Kong's youth believe their future would be brighter with democracy, since Hong Kong's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy citizens, big business greatly influences government policy, there are high property prices, and wages are stagnant. Young activists in Hong Kong are more confrontational and less respectful of the traditional rules of engagement. They use unconventional tactics, such as clashing with the police in street protests. Their actions create an atmosphere of challenge to the ruling elites and government representatives. They believe that collective confrontational action is the only effective way to get the government to listen to their grievances and act to fix social problems. Young activists also use 'e-mobilisation' to mobilise protesters and scrutinise social issues by creating social media platforms on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. Seventy-one percent of Hong Kong students reported that they had learned how important voting was in school although they are not taught much about democratic elections. Seventy-two percent of Hong Kong students reported that it was important to follow political news in the media. Media Youth in Hong Kong at an internet cafe playing online games Hong Kong is considered to be one of the most sophisticated and successful telecommunications markets in the world, with a household broadband penetration rate of 77.8 per cent, and that does not include Hong Kongers with dial-up internet access. There are also a huge amount of mobile subscribers in Hong Kong, as well as a high level of media saturation. Mass media is found everywhere in Hong Kong. As seen in many other places globally, mass media can harmfully affect young people. In Hong Kong, mass media can influence the formation of different types of behaviours and values such as sexual and deviant behaviour. Factors indicating differences in time spent with and interacting with mass media include gender and family background. Female youth spend more time on television and blogging while male youth spend more time on the internet. Youth who consider their families in a \\"difficult\\" economic status spend considerably more time online than their counterparts from the middle class and rich. Some negative aspects that come out of Hong Kong youth's social media access is cyber bullying, participating in \\"compensated dating\\" and copyright infringement. The most common reasons to why Hong Kong youth go on the internet were for entertainment, searching for information, and connecting with friends. Roughly 29.4 per cent of Hong Kong youth have contributed to Wikipedia in their lifetime. Many Hong Kong youth also use social media in order to communicate with each other during social movements and to gain information about social movements. One news reporter stated, that during the Umbrella Revolution, \\"the predominantly young demonstrators of Hong Kong... also thought of ways to disseminate information with their mobiles should the authorities decide to cut internet reception to these devices.\\" During the Umbrella Revolution Hong Kong youth-created Facebook pages, and used WhatsApp to send out information to the masses.

It stars Anuk Steffen in the title role, alongside Bruno Ganz, Katharina Sch√ºttler, Quirin Agrippi, Isabelle Ottmann and Anna Schinz. Plot synopsis After living for several years with her Aunt Dete (Anna Schinz), young orphan Heidi (Anuk Steffen) is brought to live in the Swiss Alps with her elderly grandfather, Alp√∂hi (Bruno Ganz). Despite being known as a fearsome recluse, he soon grows to love Heidi. She quickly befriends the goatherd, Peter (Quirin Agrippi), a boy slightly older than her. For the next few years, Heidi grows up happily with her grandfather, although she wishes to attend school in the village with the other local children. One day, Aunt Dete unexpectedly returns and tricks Heidi into running away with her to Frankfurt (practically kidnapping her) to become a companion to a young girl from an upper-class family. The girl, Klara (Isabelle Ottmann), is unable to walk and uses a wheelchair; it is implied that she lost use of her legs after the death of her mother. Although her father loves her, he is often away on business and Klara is left with her strict governess, Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier (Katharina Sch√ºttler). Heidi struggles to read and fit into polite society, but she forms a close bond with Klara. Klara's father returns and surprises Klara with a visit from her grandmother, who treats Heidi kindly and encourages her to learn how to read. Despite Heidi showing academic improvement, Klara's grandmother notices that the girl is unhappy in Frankfurt and informs her son. Klara's father initially ignores this as his daughter has been happy since Heidi's arrival. Soon, Heidi's homesickness manifests in sleepwalking around the house at night, scaring the house staff who had mistaken her for being a ghost. On the doctor's recommendation, Klara's father returns Heidi to her grandfather, upsetting Klara who feels that her only friend is abandoning her. Heidi and Alp√∂hi joyfully reunite in the Alps. The two quickly settle back into life with each other and Alp√∂hi allows Heidi to attend school, purchasing a winter residence within the village. Meanwhile, Heidi frequently writes to Klara, who regrets her angry reaction to Heidi leaving. Soon, Klara's grandmother allows her to visit Heidi in the mountains. The two friends happily reunite, inciting the jealousy of Peter who pushes Klara's wheelchair off a cliff. He is scolded by Alp√∂hi and is immediately remorseful of his actions. While playing with Heidi and Peter on the mountains, Klara slowly regains the use of her legs. When her father and grandmother appear to take her home, Klara reveals her ability to walk again. Her father weeps with joy and is grateful to Heidi and Alp√∂hi for taking good care of his daughter. Before Klara's grandmother leaves, she gifts Heidi with a notebook to encourage her dream of becoming a writer. Both families remain good friends and maintain contact with each other.

It is an adaptation of Pavel Bazhov's stories based on the Ural region Russian folklore. The stories were published The Malachite Box collection in 1939.  Production  The film director Konstantin Yershov wanted to change the traditional approach to the fairy tales adaptations. He felt that he did not need to create a magic spectacle, but rather to make a film which would be realistic at heart. He was interested in the characters, life and traditions of the Serfdom era.  Plot  The film loosely follows the plot of Bazhov's folk tale The Mistress of the Copper Mountain. A skilled miner Stepan meets the green-eyed Mistress of the Copper Mountain, the Malachite Lady. Stepan is disrespectful towards her, calling her \\"wench\\", but she appreciates his bravery. She orders him to relay her words to the bailiff Severyan Nazarovich: \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain orders you, ye stinking goat, to get out of Krasnogorka\\". She promises to marry Stepan if he does so. The bailiff is enraged at the miner's impudence. Stepan is flogged, sent to a mine face and fed only dog food. The Mistress visits him and releases him from the mine. She shows him many treasures and the image of his daughter, although Stepan has no daughter and not even married yet. The Mistress says that her real name is Kseniya, and proposes marriage once again. Stepan honestly replies that he already promised to marry another girl, Nastya. The Malachite Lady is upset, but she likes his fidelity and bravery. She promises to solve his troubles with the bailiff and rewards him with a present for his bride, a malachite casket filled with jewellery. She warns him against ever thinking about her. The bailiff soon dies and Stepan is freed from his Master. He marries Nastya, but still has visions of the Malachite Lady and often sees small lizards, her servants. The Mistress continues watching over his family. Stepan's wife Nastya gives birth to a daughter Tanyushka and a son Melesha. The green-eyed Tanyushka likes lizards and gemstones. Stepan starts going to the copper mine to see the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. Sometimes Tanyushka joins them too. One day, watching them, Stepan shoots himself in the chest, but survives. He does not speak to the Malachite Lady again. The second part of the film is based on The Malachite Casket. Years pass, Stepan gets older. He is especially close with his daughter, calling her \\"his remembrance\\". She is a beauty, and a lot of men are infatuated with her, including the new bailiff Parfyon Semyonovich. One day Stepan mentions his dream of seeing the malachite room at the imperial palace. He asks his wife to wear the jewellery from the Malachite Casket, but Tanyushka puts them on instead. She claims that they \\"warm her up\\", as if she is sitting by the fire. After Stepan's death, a young noble man Vasily Turchaninov, the owner of the mines' son, falls in love with Tanyushka. He asks for Nastya's permission to marry her daughter. Tanyushka claims that she is unsure of his feelings and announces that she will agree to the marriage if he shows her the malachite room at the imperial palace. After Vasily leaves, Tanyushka confesses to her mother that she actually likes the man, but she feels that his love will not last and therefore hides behind her pride. At the palace, noble people laugh at the girl's simple clothes, and Vasily is ashamed of her. Tanyushka rejects him, leans against the malachite wall and melts away. She comes back home to her mother and brother.

Culture Food They plant rice, mustard, corn and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses. They hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes. They keep domestics animals like cows, goats, pigs and water buffalo, and birds like pigeons, chickens and ducks. They live close to nature. A group of Tharu people who do not eat pig are said Thokra, and these people have a belief that if they consume such meat their kul devi becomes angry and can cause disease in their family. However, others do not have this belief. Dress Achra Khadki is the name of a traditional attire worn by women. Khadki is a hand-woven piece of cloth which is only made by the Dhimal community. Achra is fine cotton or any other special fabric which has beautiful handmade paintings. Generally it is white in colour but different colours are worn for different occasions. The Achra has a tail-like structure which is called Puccha.http://www.ethnologue.com/language/thq Language The Tharu language differs from other Tharu sub-groups.  Morangiya Tharu Title  Chaudhary, Biswas, Majhi, Sikdar, Thandar, Mandal, Tabdar, Gachhedar, Akela, Khan, Bhagat, Modi, sardar, etc. Religion The spiritual beliefs and moral values of the Tharu people are closely linked to the natural environment. The pantheon of their gods comprises a large number of deities that live in the forest, which the Tharu people ask for support before entering the forest. The Tharu can also be found following Hinduism and Christianity nowadays, although some still have traditional beliefs on kul deuta. Marriage System They practice arranged marriage as well as love marriage.

History  The Villa Pompeo Mariani was born as a cottage. In 1885 the countess Fanshawe had asked the architect Charles Garnier to build a residence for her on the hill of Bordighera. At first it was a one-story cottage with basement, whose main room was lit by a large window that still exists. Pompeo Mariani, a famous painter of the time and nephew of the famous Mos√® Bianchi, bought the property in 1909 and asked the architects Luigi Broggi and Angelo Savoldi (architect) to expand the building. During this first extension, they added a floor to the villa, realized wooden balconies on the north-west wing and a balcony above the main entrance, supported by Doric columns. This expansion saw the collaboration of numerous nationally known craftsmen such as the cabinet-maker Eugenio Quarti, who created much furniture, the bronze worker Giovanni Lomazzi,Giovanni Lomazzi and children (1883-1963) - Historical archives - Lombardy Cultural Heritage who took charge of the brass, and Alessandro Mazzucotelli (it), who made the iron decorations. A particularly valuable addition to the gate entrance, near the street lights that decorate the garden, is the writing on Mariani's bedroom balcony which reads \\"Ave Mariani pictor very famous and to Lisander Ferree\\", still visible on the side south of the villa.[Villa Painter Mariani P. Mastorakis ] The second extension dates from 1914 and was given to the architect and friend Rodolfo Winter, son of the botanist Ludwig Winter. On this occasion the north-western wing was extended, the balconies were closed and a terrace built to admire the lower city, the sea and the French coast. The villa then reached an area of . The interior, which can still be visited, has not only maintained its original furnishings, but also many personal items of Mariani such as clothes, hats, walking sticks, etc. The lounge, which thanks to Winter's expansion, reached , still retains a belief in oak paneling built by Eugenio Quarter. On a piece of furniture there is a clock given by Arturo Toscanini, depicting a scene from the Turandot of Giacomo Puccini, and a friend of the two artists. A trivia is that Turandot, Puccini's unfinished work, was eventually completed by Franco Alfano, who stayed in Bordighera in 1926, in the Villa of the Waves, as he composed the work \\"Madonna Imperia\\". In the dining room there is a brass glass case by Giovanni Lomazzi, created for the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris, which earned him an honorable mention. On the first floor, there is the bedroom which has remained miraculously intact. Above the bed are the message boards, made by Eugenio Quarter, where Mariani always kept the paper sheets on which to sketch something. On the shelf of toiletries, there are his razor and his talcum powder. The Villa's Park, appliances and all the contents of the property are protected by the Ligurian Superintendence for Architectural Heritage and Landscape.  The workshop  The artist's workshop, La Specola, is located in the garden of the villa and was built by the architect Rodolfo Winter in 1911. The origin of the name is uncertain. It could come from the Latin specula, which means observing. Mariani wanted a large studio to work comfortably and to gather his art collections (carpets, porcelain, ancient weapons etc.). Many construction techniques modern for the times were used. Very deep foundations were dug to withstand the upper floors, which were then built in 1925 when a new building hid the beautiful view of the atelier. The workshop was wide, about , and equipped with large windows and skylights that allowed light to penetrate it. The main entrance is dominated by metalwork and a canopy of wrought iron with floral motifs by Alessandro Mazzucotelli. On the left, on the corner of the building, there is a pinnacle of Milan Cathedral and, on the right, a bas-relief as representing Mariani's wife, Marcellina Caronni, made by Paul Troubetzkoy. In the entrance, the atrium is dominated by a bookcase/desk, made by Eugenio Quarter, framing a window. The lobby and the studio are separated by a glass and a wooden wall by Eugenio Quarti. The room, very large, has a sort of apse at the bottom, with a fireplace of the '700. Above the entrance, there is a loft from which one could view both the artist at work and his works. The place is packed with personal belongings of the artist, which also came from his other workshops in 1914, when he retired to Bordighera. There are also the coffers of biennials in which he participated, catalogs of his showings, etc. Particularly original is a box/palette that he used when travelling. On Mariani's death, the property passed to Mary, daughter of Marcellina Caronni, whom he had adopted and then to his grandson, the notary Pompeo Lomazzi. In 1998 the last descendant of Pompeo Mariani, Stefania Scevka, sister of the wife of Pompeo Lomazzi, decided to sell the house to an admirer of Mariani's work, Carlo Bagnasco. After a complete renovation, which lasted two years realized in collaboration with the Superintendency for Architectural Heritage of Liguria, \\"La Specola\\" returned to its former glory. The objects patiently gathered by Carlo Bagnasco, based on a careful study of old photographs, were returned to their place of origin.The villa Mariani and Monet at risk sale|nonsolochimica Today ‚Äúla Specola‚Äù is the official home of the \\"Foundation Pompeo Mariani\\" and permanent home of an exhibition dedicated to the works of Mariani, but also to those of his uncle Mos√® Bianchi, and also of some other artists like Giuseppe Allosia, Arnaldo Esposto and Giannetto Fieschi. Since 2008, Villa Mariani is part of the Italian Historic Houses, and is one of some 200 painter's workshops of the ‚Äò800 and ‚Äò900 which can still be visited in the world.  The gardens  The gardens of the villa, which are developed on a portion of the old Moreno Gardens, have an area of about one hectare and, as often happens in Bordighera, can boast centuries-old trees. Still today you can admire palms, soles of oranges, tangerines, lemons and of course numerous olive trees, many of which are between 200 and 400 years. Near La Specola there are two olive trees which, according to the State Forestry Department, are older than 500 years. All the olive trees in the garden of the villa belong to the taggiasca variety, which has a very slow growth. It is impressive to note that you can still recognize the olive trees painted by Claude Monet in his painting \\"Study of olive trees\\", now in a private collection. Spots used by Monet are marked with panels in which are copies of his paintings. In the garden there is also a fountain with a mask of the 15th century from Tuscany. Since 2008 the gardens are part of the \\"Great Italian Gardens\\". The Liguria region also selected it as one of the 26 most beautiful gardens in the region.The Park's Finest  Trivia  Claude Monet visited the Moreno Gardens in 1884, and some of his paintings were painted right in the area that today corresponds to the garden of Villa Mariani. In a letter dated February 5, 1884 Monet wrote: \\"... a garden like this is indescribable, it is pure magic, all plants in the world grow there in the land and not appear cured, there is a tangle of palm trees of every variety, all kinds of oranges and tangerines ... \\"[Colored words of Silvia Alborno ] One day Queen Margaret of Italy came to the villa unannounced to congratulate the artist for his portrait of King Umberto. Mariani who was painting, took a few minutes to get in order before meeting the queen. When he showed up at the door of La Specola it appears that the queen was already waiting for ten minutes. The meeting went well and Mariani took advantage of the moment to make a quick portrait of the queen. Since then, Mariani was kindly nicknamed \\"the painter who made the queen wait\\". The portraits made by Mariani are still preserved at the International Institute of Ligurian Studies. Photo gallery File: Monet-olivi.jpg|\\"Studio di ulivi\\" Claude Monet, 1884.

Pirani and Hermann Bondi wrote a series of articles (1959 to 1989) that established the existence of plane wave solutions for gravitational waves based on general relativity. During the last half of the 20th century Pirani was politically active, studied disarmament and advocated the responsible use of science. His most famous scientific results include works on the physical meaning of the curvature tensor, gravitational waves, and the algebraic classification of the Weyl tensor, which he discovered in 1957 independently of A.Z. Petrov and is sometimes called the Petrov-Pirani classification. Early life and education Pirani was born in England. Pirani's family moved to Canada at the start of World War II. He studied at the University of Western Ontario (Bachelor 1948), the University of Toronto (Master's degree in 1949). He obtained his D. Sc. at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1951 under Alfred Schild. His D. Sc. dissertation was an early contribution to the quantum theory of general relativity. He also obtained a PhD in physics at Cambridge University in 1956 under Hermann Bondi. Scientific work Pirani performed post-doctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin. In 1958 he started teaching at King's College London (where Bondi was teaching) and in 1968 became professor of rational mechanics there.American Institute of Physics Dean Rickles interview in Institute of Physics history June 2011 In 1957 Pirani independently discovered what was later called the Petrov classification (also Petrov‚ÄìPirani‚ÄìPenrose classification) and separately discovered by Petrov in 1954. In 1959 Bondi, Pirani and Ivor Robinson published a fundamental paper on gravitational wave solutions in general relativity and showed the existence of plane gravitational wave solutions. Pirani's work with Bondi and Robinson resulted in correspondence between Pirani and Albert Einstein, some of whose partially expressed views on the subject had been challenged by the paper.Peter Galison \\"The Roots of Special Relativity\\" 2001 Routledge pp 29Princeton University Albert Einstein Archives Pirani Correspondence with Einstein In 1972 Pirani, J√ºrgen Ehlers and Alfred Schild showed that the space-time geometry of general relativity can be constructed from simple measuring processes with light beams and free-falling particles.Ehlers, Pirani, Schild The geometry of free fall and light propagation, in O'Raifeartaigh (Herausgeber) General Relativity.

Pirani studied disarmament and founded the Science Forum as a group of scientists that met monthly in London to discuss the social problems of science.New Scientist 20 December 1962, pp 699 Pirani's efforts were based on his view that the public belief that \\"science will solve the world's problems\\" is a delusion because funding for research comes from the top levels of the social hierarchy, which controls the direction of scientific progress for its own purposes.

Biography  Ralph Emerson was born in 1912 in New York City, the youngest of five children of Grace and Haven Emerson. Emerson spent his early life in New York City before attending Harvard University to obtain his Bachelors, Masters, and PhD successively. It was during this time that he began his research into aquatic fungi, specifically the Allomyces, a research passion that would continue with him for most of his academic career. Following his PhD, Emerson spent two years as a National Research Council fellow, one year back at Harvard as a research fellow, and in 1940 he began his career as a professor at the University of California ‚Äì Berkeley. He remained at UC Berkeley for mostly the rest of his academic career, minus the two sabbaticals to Costa Rica. He married Enid Merle Budelman in 1942, together having two children, Peter and Grace Emerson. Throughout his life, Emerson contributed greatly to the scientific community, as well as through his dedicated and passionate teaching efforts before passing away after a year-long battle with cancer. Emerson died in 1979, at 67, survived by his wife, two children, and six grandchildren.  Areas of study  Since the beginning of his academic career, Ralph Emerson had an interest in water molds, beginning with the genus Allomyces. His focus was broadly biological, focusing on growth and nutritional requirements, but with an ultimate goal of classification and biosystematics. One of his major contributions was a paper on they cytogenetics and cytotaxonomy of Allomyces. Beyond Allomyces and other common water molds, Emerson made major contributions with his research on Thermophiles, especially in Eumycota, on fermentative water molds, and in looking for low oxygen tolerant tropical water molds on his sabbaticals to Costa Rica.  Honors  Emerson gained many offices and honors throughout his career, both in the United States as well as internationally. He held Guggenheim Fellowships for the academic years 1948‚Äì1949 and 1956‚Äì1957. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences as well as the Academy of Arts and Sciences, and served as president of the Mycological Society of America and Botanical Society of America. He held international positions and was awarded as a fellow in multiple international organizations, and was a keynote speaker for the First International Mycological Congress. At the University of California, Berkeley, Emerson started as an instructor and worked his way up to Professor, Research Professor, and finally Chairman of the Botany department.  Interesting notes  In 1935, Emerson was a photographer for an expedition to the west coast of Mexico whose goal was to gather data and photographs of the local fish in order to put together a book on the Pacific Coastal game fish. According to a distinguished ichthyologist, Emerson's photos were some of the best he had ever seen.  References  * Emerson, Ralph. \\"Mycological Organization\\".

Born in Geneva, Illinois and raised in Princeton, Illinois, he is the fourth child of nine. He achieved popularity by his recurring role on Game of Pawns and his music. His first song \\"The Devil Song\\" was released on Fools Parade in January 2012, followed by the debut album Cock of the Walk in May that year. In October 2012 Tranchita received an award at the Exposure Music Awards in London for Best International Act . Tranchita released the country western song \\"This is America\\" in 2015, which rose to prominence when Ben Carson used it as his campaign song, subsequently the song reached number one on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artist chart in November 2015. He told Billboard magazine, ‚ÄúI really feel strongly about this election. I really want to help the country somehow.‚Äù Tranchita's freshman Country album American Man will be released in January 2016. Life and career Early life and career beginning  Justin was born to Joseph James Tranchita and Julee Ann Child in Geneva, Illinois, on June 22, 1981. His paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Marsala, Italy, while his mother was of Jewish and Irish ancestry. He has four elder siblings, Joe (born 1971), Julie (born 1974), Pam (born 1976) and Angie (born 1978) and four younger siblings, Jonathan (born 1983), Elliott (born 1990), Joshua (born 1995) and Marie (born 2000). He was raised in Princeton, Illinois just past the Red Covered bridge on a farm with animals surrounded by corn fields. He attended Princeton High school and played football for the school but due to his parents religious beliefs he was pulled out of attendance and home schooled after his sophomore year. Tranchita went on several humanitarian trips as a boy taking him all over America and twice to Israel. After his parents divorced his senior year in high school Tranchita had a crisis of faith and left Princeton. He later told the Bureau County Republican that \\"It was kind of a long road out of Princeton but it was the best place a kid could grow up. \\" Justin received a music scholarship to Greenville College and attended in 1999. In 2000 he dropped out of college and relocated to Branson , Missouri where he met Don Williams brother of American singer Andy Williams and Robert Vinton son of American singer Bobby Vinton who helped Justin take the leap into a career in music and television. Television and music Tranchita starred on the television series Game of Pawns which airs on the Discovery Channel globally. The series was filmed in 2013 by High Noon Entertainment and is based on the goings on in a pawn shop in Branson, Missouri. Justin is joined by Scott Velvet and Brian Roman in this television game show which continues to run as re-runs in the United States and around the world on Discovery networks. Recorded with producer and writer Steve Messer, the song \\"This is America\\" features lyrics about American politics. It first became noticed when the Ben Carson presidential campaign heard the song and decided to use it as their campaign song for 2016. Quickly after Ben Carson used the song it had commercial success by reaching number one on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artist chart on November 28th, 2015 where it continued to stay on the chart for weeks. The song was controversial in nature and garnered mixed reviews, digg.com said it was \\"one of the worste campaign songs of all time.\\" Dan Fallon of digg.com wrote \\"Props to Tranchita for almost getting the lyric \\"While governmental power tends to grow continuously\\" to not sound super awkward.\\" Tranchita told The Guardian, \\"When I started to look into Ben Carson and what he stood for...people who have a faith ‚Äì I identify with them because it does separate from people who do not.‚Äù Ben Carson personally thanked Justin for allowing him to use the song publicly in a statement to his Facebook followers, This is America returned to the number one spot again in 2016 after spending ten weeks on Billboards Emerging chart. This gave Tranchita a number one hit with the same song in two different years. Discography *The Devil Song, (single) (2012) *Cock of The Walk (2012) *This is America (single) (2015) *American Man 2016 Michigan State House Run After the song \\"This is America\\" vaulted Tranchita into the political limelight he decided to run for the Michigan State House, district 32 in March of 2016. He was among Macomb County Republicans competing in state House races. Tranchita said the popularity of his song was responsible in part for his run, he told The Detroit News, \\"Millions of people have responded to [the song]... There's some angst, some anger, and people are feeling like their voices aren't heard. I feel that. I'm a blue-collar guy, not some elitist or crony that wants to be in the ruling class.\\" After a very hard fought race Tranchita was narrowly defeated in his first ever political campaign by six percent in the August 2016 primary.

Speakman was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 and the resulting chemotherapy left him $200,000 in debt. On the suggestion of Shannara author Terry Brooks, Speakman reached out to several authors for short stories which are published in the book. The proceeds from the sales of the advanced reading copy of the book would go towards author Dave Wolverton, whose son recently became comatose in a longboarding accident. Publication history The book was initially published in five editions by Speakman's own publisher, Grim Oak Press. The hardcover books included an advanced reader edition, a limited leather-bound and slip-cased hardcover edition (signed and numbered), a limited cloth hardcover (signed) edition and a trade hardcover edition. An ebook edition of the book was also released on Kindle, Nook and Kobo. The book was digitally published in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and other territories by Orbit Books on 20 February 2014. It included an extra tale, The Twilight Dragon, specially written by Shawn Speakman for the UK edition. The rights to the audiobook edition were bought by Audible. A single page excerpt of each story in the book was released on Tor's website on 1 July 2013. A five-story sampler of the anthology was also available to those at the 2013 Phoenix Comicon. Peter Orullian and Primo Pulanco released a power metal single, also named Unfettered, based on the stories in the anthology under the 'Lour Nail' label.

The body was created in 1971 as the Law Reform Commission of Canada and was disbanded in 1992. The body was reestablished as the Law Commission of Canada in 1996. On September 26, 2006, the Conservative government announced it was cutting the LCC's funding.  History   Law Reform Commission of Canada  Decades before it was established, since at least 1955, there were calls for the creation of a federal law reform commission. The federal law commission was preceded by the Ontario Law Reform Commission, which was created in 1964. In 1966, the Canadian Bar Association passed a resolution at its annual meeting calling for the creation of a federal law reform commission. On February 16, 1970, the then Liberal Minister of Justice John Turner introduced Bill C-186, which called for the establishment of a national law reform agency. The bill successfully passed and the Law Reform Commission of Canada was created. The LRCC was meant to provide expert advice on reformations of legislation. It was to study and review on an ongoing basis the laws of Canada, and to make recommendations for their improvement. No legislation based on the LRCC's recommendations were enacted during the first ten years of the Commission's existence. The Commission did not issue a final report until its fifth year. Finally, in 1983, legislation was enacted that implemented one of its reports. In January 1974,Law Reform Commission of Canada published Working Paper 1: The Family Court. On the basis of the recommendations set out in the working paper,the Department of Justice in 1975 endorsed several pilot projects which ultimately led to the establishment of Unified Family Courts in most Canadian provinces. Many of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations on divorce, spousal and child support, and custody and access were implemented in the Divorce Act of 1986. In February 1992, the Conservative government announced that it was to close the LRCC, along with five other organisations, as a cost savings measure.  Law Commission of Canada  In 1996, Liberal Minister of Justice Allan Rock reintroduced Bill C-9 to create the Law Commission of Canada. On May 29, 1996, Bill C-9 received royal assent. The LCC commenced operations during 1997. Its mandate was different than under the former LRCC. The LCC was meant to be inclusive to Canadians, and to adopt a multidisciplinary approach. It was made up of five commissioners appointed by the Cabinet of Canada on the recommendations of the Minister of Justice. The president was a full-time commissioner, while the other four commissioners served on a part-time basis. In 2002, it released a report recommending Parliament remove restrictions on same-sex marriage. In 2004, it released a report on electoral reform that suggested introducing mixed member proportional representation.  Demise  On September 26, 2006, the Federal Government announced it would be cutting funding for the LCC. It said that the cuts would save $4.19 million for the government over the next two years.

Pascal Cuisinier, founder of the gallery  Founder of the eponymous gallery, Pascal Cuisinier was born in 1969 in Saint- Germain-en-Laye. After studying architecture, he specialized in 1930s French Decorative arts and worked at the Antica market of Saint-Ouen. He resumed his studies in plastic arts and art philosophy, and started work on a thesis entitled 'Towards an allographisation of contemporary plastic arts'. In 2006, he returned to Saint-Ouen, at the Paul Bert market, where he is recognized as the design specialist of the French generation born between 1920 and 1930,where the majority of production was produced between 1951 and 1961. In 2011, he opened a space at 13 rue de Seine in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, divided between an exhibition space that displays furniture and rare pieces and a research and documentation office.  The first generation of modern French designers  Since 2006, Galerie Pascal Cuisinier has advocated the generation of French designers born between 1925 and 1930, who all followed a similar path of education. Trained at either the National School of Decorative Arts (√âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs) or the Camondo School (√âcole Camondo), they opened their agency in the early 1950s and then produced their first pieces. Modern and innovative, the pieces they designed were the start of what would become the method of production and distribution of furniture for the following decades, undertaking a shift from Decorative arts to design. Without becoming a group or an artistic movement in its own right, these young designers were a 'generational phenomenon': they shared the same editorial choices and marked their era by participating in an extraordinary artistic revival, typical of the 1950s and 1960s.  International fairs and exhibitions  Galerie Pascal Cuisinier often focuses on thematic or monographic exhibitions presented at its gallery or during international fairs such as PAD Paris, PAD London, Design Miami/ Basel, Design Miami, etc. The exhibition '100 French chairs 1951‚Äì1961' showcased in 2014 is a perfect illustration of the gallery's approach. It unveiled the aesthetic and changes in form, which revolutionized the concept of seating in France during the 1950s. The same year, the gallery also paid tribute to Joseph-Andr√© Motte, on the first anniversary of his death with a solo show which displayed around fifty emblematic pieces created by the designer during his early career. 2015: Jacques Biny, Producer/Designer 2014: 100 French chairs 1951‚Äì1961 2014: Tribute to Joseph-Andr√© Motte 2013: Focus on Andr√© Simard 2012: Focus on Joseph-Andr√© Motte 2012: Pierre Guariche, Creator of Light / 1950‚Äì1959 2012: Cycle of thematic exhibitions 'First French design', episode #3: 'White‚Äô 2011: Cycle of thematic exhibitions 'First French design', episode #2: 'Young generation of the 1950s‚Äô 2010: Cycle of thematic exhibitions 'First French design', episode #1: 'Office‚Äô 2010: 'Meubles TV: Avant-garde designer 1952‚Äì1959‚Äô 2009: ‚ÄòAlain Richard, lighting and furniture 1950‚Äì1970‚Äô  Designers represented by the gallery  Galerie Pascal Cuisinier champions the first generation of modern French designers: * Janine Abraham and Dirk Jan Rol * Ren√©-Jean Caillette * Genevi√®ve Dangles and Christian Defrance * Pierre Guariche * Andr√© Monpoix * Michel Mortier * Joseph-Andr√© Motte * Pierre Paulin * Antoine Philippon and Jacqueline Lecoq * Alain Richard The gallery also has an important collection of French lighting from the 1950s and 1970s and promotes the three main producers/designers of this era: * Pierre Disderot * Robert Mathieu * Jacques Biny  Publications  The gallery has published two standard works:   Bibliography     *  References   External links  * www.galeriepascalcuisinier.com Art museums and galleries in Paris ","title":"Galerie Pascal Cuisinier"},{"id":"48641214","text":"Farmers' advocate Ida Elizabeth Brandon Mathis speaking to a group of farmers ca. 1917. Ida Elizabeth Brandon Mathis (1857‚Äì1925) was a farmer and businesswoman who advocated for methods that would improve conditions for Southern farmers, including crop diversification and rotation and better methods of financing for small farmers. She is credited with reducing agricultural poverty in Alabama and diminishing the state's dependence on imported food. Early life and education Ida Elizabeth Brandon was born in Florence, Alabama, on September 16, 1857, to Mary Baldwin (Munn) Brandon and Washington McClure Brandon. Her father was a farmer, and she became not only a successful farmer herself but also a businesswoman and national farmers' advocate. She was educated at the local Florence Synodical Female College, where she earned her B.A. in 1874 (with honors) followed by her M.A. For several years thereafter, she taught natural science and other subjects at a college in Oxford, Alabama. In 1882, she married Giles Huffman Mathis, a merchant and cotton buyer with whom she had three children. Farming and advocacy career Mathis ran her own farm and bought and sold others, becoming one of the largest landowners in the state and gaining the practical experience that fed her later advocacy career. In the early 1900s, she bought over 1,000 acres of poor land in eastern Alabama hill country at $8 an acre and, working with her tenants, built it up into productive farmland. She then sold the land for $40 an acre and repeated the cycle several more times, continuing to focus on buying poor or run-down land, improving it, and selling it. Most frequently, she sold the improved land to her own tenants‚Äîboth white and black‚Äîthus helping to widen the state's base of landowners. A crucial part of her success was her move away from the one-crop (cotton) system that dominated Alabama at the time, which was destructive to the soil and economically risky for farmers. Mathis developed a plan for her farms under which the farm's basic expenses had to be met from a spectrum of crops and livestock apart from cotton, with cotton planted only to bring in extra cash, not as the mainstay of the farm's existence. She emphasized crop rotation with winter crops like clover and vetch to renew the soil. In the contracts she wrote with her tenants, the year's farming responsibilities were laid out in weekly detail to ensure that they followed her plan. She also worked with bankers, successfully persuading them to lend to farmers on more reasonable terms. Mathis's own efforts, together with those of farmers imitating her practices, are said to have helped raise thousands of Alabama farmers from poverty and bring the state's annual expense for imported foodstuff down from $106 million to $81 million. She is also credited with helping to greatly reduce the ravages of the cattle tick in the state by leading the organization of a massive cattle-dipping campaign. During the latter part of World War I (1915‚Äì1917), Southern cotton farmers suffered through a severe economic depression caused largely by a combination of bad boll weevil infestations and the loss of their prewar European markets. Mathis was appointed by two successive Alabama governors, Charles Henderson and Thomas Kilby, to talk about her methods to Alabama farmers and to represent the state's farmers' situation and needs at national agricultural and economic development conferences. A charismatic speaker, she traveled all around her home state talking to farmers and lectured on her major theme‚Äîsafety in food crops‚Äîacross the entire country, speaking at such gatherings as the Farm Mortgage Bankers Association of America (FMBA) in St. Louis (1915) and the Banker's Farmer Conference in Chicago (1917). Her FMBA speech was so well received that a copy was sent to President Woodrow Wilson together with a resolution expressing the FMBA's appreciation for her efforts to improve conditions for Southern farmers. The flavor of Mathis's vigorous and direct style is evident in this excerpt from an informal interview she gave to a contemporary magazine: \\"We Alabama folks can do more fool stunts to the square inch than any people in America! We work ourselves to death to keep from growing hay. We kill the grass to grow the cotton to buy the grass‚Äîand thus we ride round Poverty Post on a merry-go-round. To think of our buying corn, when right here in Alabama we have set the world's record for growing corn‚Äî232 1/2 bushels to the acre! Why, if you folks don't wake up, you'll sleep yourselves to death.\\" As Mathis's national reputation grew, she was increasingly asked to consult with government officials and Wall Street financiers. In 1917, for example, she consulted with Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, and around the same time the Comptroller of the Currency, John Skelton Williams, told her that with her idea for an improved financing (credit) system for farmers, she had \\"done more toward winning the [First World] War than any other person in the United States\\". She extended her advocacy efforts by writing on farming- related economic issues in the general press and in agricultural and finance journals. Mathis championed a drive to site a nitrate plant in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and was the sole woman on the committee of one hundred citizens that spearheaded that effort. In 1916, she was an invited speaker at the first-ever meeting of the Alabama Chamber of Commerce. For her work, Mathis was referred to as the \\"leader of Alabama's agricultural Renaissance\\" and the \\"economic Moses of the South,\\" and one writer estimated in 1917 that her efforts had been worth $20 million to her home state. DeSoto Caverns DeSoto Caverns are caves near Childersburg, Alabama, that were used for mining saltpeter during the Civil War. In 1912, Mathis and a consortium of friends bought the caverns with the idea of mining the cave system's abundant onyx. They quickly discovered that they could not compete with much cheaper Mexican onyx, and Mathis bought out all the shares in order to keep the caves and their land in her family. Her son Allen would later turn the caverns into a tourist attraction. Mathis died October 19, 1925. Legacy In 1993, Mathis was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame.

It was run as part of the ninth Tour of Chongming Island, which includes both a multi-stage event and a single-stage event. The single-stage race, which was part of the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, was held on 17 May 2015, in Shanghai, China. On wide, mostly flat highways, there were no significant breakaways in the first half of the race, until the duo of Hongyu Liang () and Anastasia Chulkova () established a one-minute lead over the peloton. Their advantage was slowly broken down, predominately due to the work of the Team Hitec Products riders, and they were reabsorbed into the peloton with to go. In a bunch sprint, the Italian rider, Giorgia Bronzini () won, beating 2014 winners Kirsten Wild () and Fanny Riberot (France national team). Entry Ten of the UCI women's team entered the race, each featuring five or six riders. They were joined by eight national teams containing either four or five riders, bringing the total entry up to 93 riders. Nations * France * Russia * Hong Kong China * Taiwan * Thailand * South Korea * China * Indonesia Course The route changed from previous years. The race started at the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center and took place almost entirely on wide, straight highways, with corners predominantly being expansive ninety-degree bends. The course initially followed the Middle Ring Road, the Huaxia Elevated Road and the G1501 Shanghai Ring Expressway, before entering the tunnel under the Yangtze River to reach Changxing Island, shortly followed by a bridge to Chongming Island, from where the route followed the course of previous years, along slightly smaller roads to the finish. Preview After four rounds of the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, there had been four different winners; Jolien D'Hoore at the Ronde van Drenthe, Lizzie Armitstead at the Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio, Elisa Longo Borghini at the Tour of Flanders, and Anna van der Breggen at the La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine. Anna van der Breggen led the World Cup standings as the racing moved to China for the Tour of Chongming Island, with 290 points, but her Rabo-Liv team were not invited to take part in the event. Kirsten Wild won both the stage race and the World Cup event in 2014, and repeated her success in the 2015 stage race. She was the pre-race favourite to win the 2015 World Cup race on a course that favoured sprinters. Race alt=Giorgia Bronzini There were early attacks by two of the Asian teams, China Chongming-Liv-Champion System and the Korean national team, but on each occasion they were caught back up by the peloton reasonably quickly. The first intermediate sprint was won by Simona Frapporti (), while a subsequent Queen of the Mountain climb was won by Lauren Kitchen (). Crossing the Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge, some riders fell off the back of the peloton in the strong crosswinds. Shortly after, two riders, Hongyu Liang () and Anastasia Chulkova (), broke away and established a lead of roughly one minute, during which Chulkova claimed the second intermediate sprint. Team Hitec Products riders were at the front of the peloton to close the gap, though another group threatened to split around from the finish. The peloton caught up with the leading duo with of the race remaining. Closing towards the finish in a bunch sprint, Wiggle-Honda had intended Chloe Hosking to be the sprinter to try and win, but she got caught up behind a crash in the final kilometre, and so Giorgia Bronzini acted as a lead-out for Annette Edmondson. She had initially intended to move out from behind Kirsten Wild () for a sprint with around to go, but there was no room, so she stayed in Wild's draft. She then found that Edmondson had not been able to follow her, and opted to defend her position and launch a late sprint to pass Wild. Bronzini won, followed by Wild and Fanny Riberot, riding for the France national team. The first 74 riders were all designated the same time.

Biography  Pattillo grew up in the 1930s in a segregated Louisiana town, the son of a blacksmith turned railroad worker. He graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree, and received a scholarship to attend medical school at St Louis University, where he studied under Edward Adelbert Doisy and George Gey. Career Pattillo's career and research were driven by his experience of Henrietta Lacks' suffering. After her death, he purchased the headstone for her grave, and became close to her family, serving as an intermediary between them and the many researchers and journalists who wished to contact them. Pattillo became a practicing physician and professor of gynecology for the Medical College of Wisconsin. He later took over Gey's reproductive tract cell bank, moving it from Johns Hopkins to Morehouse School of Medicine. Pattillo served as the interim chair of the OB/GYN department at Morehouse from 1996 to 1998, and began hosting a women's health conference there in honor of the Lacks family (the HeLa Conference). Pattillo has authored more than 100 peer- reviewed journal articles and book chapters, and one book. His research and clinical studies focused on in-vitro cell models that possessed characteristic biomarkers that were then used in multiple experimental designs for assessment of endocrine function, chemotherapy, radiation therapy sensitivity, and differentiation. This research culminated in the first identification of the trophoblast stem cell and the first human hormone synthesizing cell system which scientists worldwide were able to use for new treatment for ovarian cancer. Pattillo retired from his position at Morehouse in 2013, after a career of 20 years at that school.  Awards  Over the course of his career, Pattillo has received several awards and recognitions: * 2003: Medallion of the International Trophoblast Society * Leonard Tow Humanism in Medicine Award * Pioneer Award from the National Institute of Health for Frontiers in Stem Cell research * 2009: St. Louis University Diversity Award ‚Äì Keynote Speaker * 2009: St. Louis University School of Medicine Merit Award * 2009: America's Top Doctor's List, Atlanta Magazine  References  African-American physicians Physicians from Wisconsin African-American academics Living people American gynecologists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Roland Pattillo"},{"id":"48641453","title":"Results of the 1959 Malayan general election by parliamentary constituency"},{"id":"48641542","text":"Lilaios is a shepherd who living in India.

All four bridges were built by James Otis Follett, a local self-taught mason, between 1894 and 1910, and represent the single greatest concentration of surviving bridges he built. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history James Otis Follett was a local farmer, who apparently learned the craft of bridge-building from books and his experiences as a road commissioner. Between 1894 and his death in 1911 he is estimated to have built at least forty stone arch bridges, most in Townshend and immediately adjacent communities. This assemblage is particularly noteworthy, as most bridges of the time were being built using iron and steel. Southwest of Townshend's village center, crossing streams on the west side of the West River downstream of Townshend Dam are four of his bridges. The surrounding area once had seven, but three have been demolished or washed away. Fair Brook Bridge Fair Brook bridge, upstream side Located just upstream of State Forest/West Hill Road (about ), where it cross Fair Brook about west of the intersection with Dam Road, is the largest of the four bridges. The arch has a span of about and rests on abutments that are part on a stone abutment and partly on bedrock. One of the abutments is angled, suggesting it was built for an earlier bridge. Rogers Road Bridge The Rogers Road Bridge is located near off the end of a spur of Rogers Road, that extends northwest from the Scott Covered Bridge. Rogers Road was bisected by construction of the Townshend Dam. This bridge crosses a normally dry channel of Fair Brook, and is one of Follett's smaller bridges. It has a span of and rises about above the stream bed. Buck Hill Road Bridge This bridge crosses another intermittent stream on a logging road (about ) that is a former alignment of Buck Hill Road, which is now a short spur extending south from the Scott Covered Bridge. It has a span of and a height of . Negro Brook Bridge The Negro Brook Bridge, located at about , formerly carried State Forest Road across Negro Brook, right near an entrance to Townshend State Forest. This bridge has a span of and a height of . Like the other bridges, its width is limited to a single modern vehicular travel lane. It is located just upstream of the current State Forest Road bridge.

ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber, who also died in the attack, was identified as Houssem Abdelli. Bombing On 24 November 2015, at least 12 people were killed in a bus bombing in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. The bus was carrying members of the Tunisian Presidential Security guard. The blast happened when the vehicle was parked near a main artery in the Tunisian capital where guard members are typically picked up and dropped off, according to an official in the Tunisian Prime Minister's office. The explosion, described as an \\"attack\\" by presidential spokesman Moez Sinaoui, struck on the capital's Mohamed V Avenue, a ministry official told AFP. An AFP journalist reported seeing the partly burnt out shell of the bus, with police, ambulances, and fire trucks at the scene. The bomber was identified as Houssem Abdelli, a 28-year-old resident of Tunis. The man's mother identified him from a photograph. Response The Tunisian Interior Ministry announced that this was an act of terrorism, using a Semtex explosive traced to Libya. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militant group claimed responsibility for the attack in an online statement, though authorities did not discuss any ties between the bomber and extremist groups. The group has also claimed responsibility for two attacks in Tunisia earlier in the year, targeting the tourism industry: the Bardo museum attack in March and an attack on a beach resort in Sousse in June. After the attack, President Beji Caid Essebsi placed Tunis under curfew and resumed a month-long state of emergency. The Tunisian Interior Ministry reported that national security raids had led to the arrest of 40 people with suspected ties to terrorist groups. Among the people arrested were the suspected bomber's sister and mother. The Tunisian government's Security Council shut down Facebook accounts and websites linked to terrorist groups.

Life in Germany Kurt Hohenemser was born on January 3, 1906, in Berlin, Germany, to the German Jewish musicologist Richard Hohenemser and his English wife Alice Salt.Szab√≥, Anik√≥. Vertreibung, R√ºckkehr, Wiedergutmachung: G√∂ttinger Hochschullehrer im Schatten des Nationalsozialismus. G√∂ttingen, Germany: Wallstein, 2000. He received his secondary education from the Goethe- Schule in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Hermann-Lietz-Schule in Haubinda, and Ziehenschule in Eschersheim. In 1924, Hohenemser received his Abitur. Hohenemser attended university at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt from 1924 to 1929, receiving his Diplom-Ingenieur in 1927 and his Doktoringenieur in 1929. From 1930 until 1933, Hohenemser taught and conducted research at the University of G√∂ttingen under Ludwig Prandtl, one of the most famous aerodynamics physicists during the 20th century. While at G√∂ttingen, Hohenemser and his colleague William Prager organized a political discussion group, to which they invited another colleague who supported the ideologies of the Nazi Party. During these discussions, Hohenemser made comments critical of Nazi ideology. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, the colleague reported these statements, and Hohenemser was dismissed from his position at the university. After his dismissal, Hohenemser worked briefly for aircraft manufacturer Gerhard Fieseler before going to work as a consultant for Anton Flettner's Flettner Flugzeubau GmbH, whose company specialized in the development and manufacture of helicopters. Kurt Hohenemser was an extraordinary engineer who developed the detailed designs required for the success of Flettner's helicopters. Hohenemser stayed with Flettner's company through the end of World War II.Though considered Jewish by the Nazis because of his Jewish father, Hohenemser's role in Flettner's company provided protection for him and his family during the war. While at Flettner Flugzeubau GmbH, Hohenemser was instrumental in the development of the Fl 282 Kolibri. There were plans for BMW to mass-produce 1,000 Flettner Fl 282 helicopters but they were disrupted when allied forces bombed the designated factory. 300px Life in the United States Kurt Hohenemser emigrated from Germany to the United States with his family in 1947. Hohenemser and Anton Flettner were among the first German emigrants into the United States after World War II. Hohenemser and Anton Flettner, who together developed numerous patents in Germany, maintained close contact after both men emigrated to the United States. During 1949, Anton Flettner employed Hohenemser as a consultant to the Flettner Aircraft Corporation. Hohenemser later accepted a position as chief aerodynamics engineer of the helicopter division of McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Missouri. In this role, Hohenemser oversaw work on such designs as the Little Henry, Big Henry, and the XV-1, a precursor of the V-22 Osprey. After working for McDonnell for 18 years, he took a position as professor of aerospace engineering at Washington University in St. Louis in 1966. He retired in 1975 but remained as emeritus professor for two more decades. From 1966 and beyond, Hohenemser shifted his focus from helicopters to wind turbines. Kurt Hohenemser, a longtime colleague and confidant of Anton Flettner, worked his remaining years in the United States to prove Flettner's idea that properly designed flexible helicopter-type rotors are more suitable for producing electricity from the wind than rigid airplane-type rotors. An offshore wind energy project announced in February 2017, involving Seawind Ocean Technology B.V., aims to demonstrate the wind energy applications put forth by Anton Flettner, Kurt Hohenemser, and Glidden Doman (American aeronautical engineer) in harsh wind and sea conditions. Kurt Heinrich Hohenemser died on April 7, 2001, in St. Louis, Missouri. Up until the age of 91, Hohenemser cross-country skied every winter and he rode a bicycle everywhere into his 80s out of concern for the pollution produced by automobiles. Hohenemser received many accolades during his career, among them the Grover E. Bell Award (1957) and the Alexander Klemin Award (1964) from the American Helicopter Society.

In 1942, he volunteered to the Polish Air Force and arrived in the UK via Canada. From May to June 1942 he trained as air-gunner. On 1 August 1942, he was sent to the No. 18 Operational Training Unit (18 OTU) where he joined the crew of Kazimierz Artymiuk. On 1 January 1943 the crew was assigned to the No. 305 Bomber Squadron. Godlewski flew for the first time over occupied France on 26 January. During his 9th bomber raid, on the night of 5 March over Essen his Vickers Wellington was attacked by German night-fighters. As a tail gunner, Godlewski shooting on enemies, gave instructions to the pilot, how to avoid Messerschmitts. He was badly wounded on both arms and transported to the hospital in Bishop's Stortford where his arms were amputated. On 2 April, in hospital, the general Ujejski decorated him with the Virtuti Militari. After leaving the hospital, Godlewski stayed in the UK until the end of 1943, participating in meetings with volunteers and soldiers. Later he returned to his parents in Chicago. His story was made famous by journalists on both sides of the ocean. They mainly pointed out his sacrifice for the country he has never seen. Polish Americans organized a fundraiser for him. Thanks to the collected money, Godlewski became owner of two bars run by his mother. In later years, he lived in California and Florida, where he died in 1989.

Western dressage is an equestrian sport that combines the principles of dressage riding and the use of western tack. Riders typically wear western attire, such as button-up shirts, cowboy boots and jeans. All horse breeds are permitted to compete in western dressage.  Description  Western dressage consists of a basic test performed by horse and rider. At lower levels, competitors must perform a walk, trot or jog, and canter or lope. Higher level tests include lateral work and flying lead changes. Competitors are scored on how well they perform each movement within the test, by means of a score from 0 (not performed) to 10 (excellent). Riders typically wear western shirts, jeans or show pants, and cowboy boots. Chaps are allowed but not always worn. Cowboy hats are traditionally worn, but some riders may choose to wear equestrian helmets. Horse tack typically consists of western saddles, western-style bridles, and saddle blankets. Either a curb or snaffle bit may be used. Any breed of horse, pony, or mule is allowed to compete. Gaited horses may compete using their intermediate gait instead of the trot.  Organizations  In the United States, the Western Dressage Association of America is the largest group devoted to western dressage and is affiliated with the United States Equestrian Federation. North American Western Dressage offers western dressage tests and specializes in virtual competitions which allow people to submit videos of themselves riding in order to compete from home or a local barn. The sport has associations in other countries in the Western Style Dressage Association of Canada, and the Western Dressage Association of Australia.

It was first published in the several issues of the Sverdlovsk newspaper Na Smenu! in September‚ÄîNovember 1938, and in Uralsky Sovremennik (volume 1, 1938). It was later released as a part of The Malachite Casket collection. \\"The Malachite Casket\\" is considered to be one of the best stories in the collection. The story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and by Eve Manning in the 1950s.  Publication  This skaz was first published in the several issues of the Sverdlovsk newspaper Na Smenu! in September‚ÄîNovember 1938, and in the Uralsky Sovremennik almanac (volume 1, 1938).Bazhov 1952, p. 242. It was released as a part of The Malachite Casket collection on 28 January 1939. The story was initially titled \\"Father's Gift\\" (), but the title was changed prior to publication. Bazhov liked the title so much that he named the whole collection after the story. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson as a part of The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals collection. In the 1950s another translation of The Malachite Casket was made by Eve ManningBazhov 1950s, p. 9.  Plot  The talented miner Stepan dies, leaving his widow Nastasya (Nastyona) and their two sons and a daughter. Nastasya becomes the owner of the Malachite Casket, filled with jewellery, which Stepan got from the legendary Mistress of the Copper Mountain. Only Tanyushka likes to play with the Casket, and every piece of jewellery looks good on her. With black hair and green eyes, Tanyushka does not look like her mother at all, as if she was born to different parents. Her appearance resembles that of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. A female vagabond comes to their house and stays for a while, teaching Tanyushka silk embroidering. Nastasya is not happy with the arrangement, because she feels that Tanyushka \\"doesn't want to come to her own mother, but hugs a tramp\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 28. Nevertheless they become very close. One day, when the woman is alone with Tanyushka, the girl shows her the jewellery from the Malachite Casket, and in return the woman shows her a vision of a beautiful room decorated with malachite. She explains that the Malachite Room of the Tsar's palace is decorated with the malachite that Stepan mined. Next day the mysterious woman leaves Nastasya's house. Before she leaves, she presents the girl with a small button for a \\"remembrance\\". Meanwhile Tanyushka grows up. She becomes an incredibly skilled needleworker and a great beauty, but keeps to herself and avoids other girls' company. People start calling her \\"a stone statue\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 31. A lot of young men at the Polevaya factory are attracted to her, but do not dare to approach her because of her coldness. Nastasya blames this behaviour on the vagabond \\"sorceress\\". One day a tragedy occurs in the family: the house is burned to the ground. Nastasya has to sell the Malachite Casket. A lot of merchants are interested in the jewellery. At the same time, a new bailiff arrives at the factory. He is quickly nicknamed \\"Flogger\\" () because he always orders flagellation as a form of punishment. The bailiff is married to the mistress of the local landlord's son, and this rich woman eventually buys the Casket. However she cannot wear the jewellery because every piece of it pains her. She asks various craftsmen to fix it for her, but all of them refuse to touch the gemstones, explaining that none of the masters is willing to quarrel with their maker and they were made to fit one person only. Flogger's wife gives up and decides to resell the Casket at earliest convenience. When the old landlord dies, his son wants his mistress back. Flogger is angry at first, but when he hears of Tanyushka's beauty and comes to see her, he is smitten. He tries to court the girl, but Tanyushka is very cold with him. The landlord's son, the noble man named Turchaninov, finally comes for Flogger's wife. When Tanyushka catches his eye, he forgets about his mistress. He buys the Casket from her and offers it to Tanyushka, but she refuses. Turchaninov then claims that he wishes to marry the girl. She announces that she will only agree to the marriage if he shows her the Tsarina herself at the Malachite Room in Saint Petersburg. Turchaninov agrees. Dressed like a queen, Tanyushka arrives at the Palace, and walks directly to the Malachite Room. Tsarina enters the room, saying: \\"Now then, show me this nigh- handed maid\\". Upon hearing that Tanyushka frowns and says to Turchaninov: \\"What does this mean? I told ye to show me the Tsarina, and you've done it so as to show me to her. [...] I don't want to see any more of ye\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 44. Adding that he is no match for her anyway, Tanyushka leans against the malachite wall and melts away. She is never seen again, but the Mistress of the Copper Mountain gets a twin‚Äîpeople see two maids in malachite robes.  Themes  Most scholars agree that Tanyushka‚Äîliterally or metaphorically‚Äîis the daughter of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain.Sozina, E. \\"O nekotorykh motivah russkoj klassicheskoj literatury v skazah P.

It was suggested that the Casket symbolizes the mystery that connected Stepan and the Mistress, or the secret marriage between the two.Prikazchikova 2003, p. 16. The Casket disappeared from the world of humans together with its owner, Tanyushka. Yelena Prikazchikova commented that Tanyushka is a typical changeling, the child of the mountain spirit and the mortal. Nataliya Shvabauer noted that Tanyushka is obviously the one destined to inherit the Casket, as she is inhumanly beautiful and is more attracted to gemstones than to people. Her mother Nastasya is an ordinary person, while the girl can appreciate the magic of the Mistress's gift. Tanyushka resembles the Mistress in every way, and just like her does not tolerate deceit. On Tanyushka's melting away into the malachite wall, Yelena Prikazchikova said that petrifaction in fiction would normally mean death, but Tanyushka is the Mistress's double, so such act was like coming home for her.Prikazchikova 2003, p. 14. Mark Lipovetsky commented that while the Mistress embodies the struggle and unity between Eros and Thanatos,Lipovetsky 2014, p. 220. Tanyushka inherits the sexual magic: her beauty is striking and blinding men.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 219. Just like the Mistress persistently and spitefully provokes the local administration, forcing the protagonists (\\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\", \\"The Two Lizards\\") to relay offensive messages, Tanyushka puts up resistance to the Tsarina herself.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 222‚Äì223. The Malachite Room is the symbol of magical power of stone in the human world. The magical malachite was used for simple human needs, to decorate the imperial chambers, which displeases the Mistress on principle. Therefore she tries in every possible way to demonstrate her power over it and makes the noble women cower before Tanyushka.Prikazchikova 2003, p. 15. Denis Zherdev commented that the Mistress of the Copper Mountain's female domain is the world of chaos. It collides with the ordered factory world, and brings in randomness, variability, unpredictability and capriciousness. He also pointed out that the most important value in most Bazhov's early stories is family, and those who do not have that (e.g. Tanyushka) are never completely \\"normal\\". Marina Balina mentioned Freud's interpretation of the motif of a double as a symbolic manifestation of death. The theme of the person leaving for the mountains at the end of his life is present in the story. Similar plot device can be found in \\"Two Lizards\\".  Reception  The characters from The Malachite Casket collection in the 2004 Russian stamps (from left to right): Danilo and the Mistress of the Copper Mountain (\\"The Stone Flower\\"), the Mistress and Tanyushka (\\"The Malachite Casket\\"), and the hunter Ailyp and his ladylove Golden Hair (\\"Golden Hair\\"). \\"The Malachite Casket\\" is considered to be one of the best stories in the collection. The style of the story was praised. \\"The Malachite Casket\\" has been a popular subject for analysis. During Soviet times, every edition of The Malachite Box was usually prefaced by an essay commenting on the creativity of the Ural miners, cruel landlords, social oppression and the \\"great workers unbroken by the centuries of slavery\\".Nikulina 2003, p. 76. Maya Nikulina noted that one editor called the Casket a symbol \\"of hard work and persistence\\".Nikulina 2003, p. 80. The later scholars focused more on the symbolism and the relationship of the characters with the mysterious.Nikulina 2003, p. 77. Tanyushka was called Bazhov's classical binary character: on the one hand, she is a truth seeker and a talented person, on the other hand, she is an outsider, who violates social norms.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. Geography Altinure is bounded on the north by Altbrean townland, on the west by Altachullion Lower townland, on the south by Altachullion Upper, Tullynamoltra and Drumbeagh townlands and on the east by Gubrawully townland. Its chief geographical features are a mountain trout stream which later joins the River Cladagh (Swanlinbar); a tributary burn or creek which joins the stream in the south of the townland; forestry plantations and small hills which rise to 160 feet above sea level. Altinure is bisected by the regional R200 road (Ireland)), a minor public road on the south and several rural lanes. The townland covers 265 statute acres. History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, \\"Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate\\". The maps used in the case are viewable online at- Maps of the townland drawn in 1813-1814 are in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, which show the townland belonging to Lord John Beresford and leased to the Reverend J. Pollock.

This deification of Tamil language in the persona of a mother got established during the Tamil renaissance movement of the later half of the nineteenth century. The phrase became popular in the Tamil speaking world after the publication of a song invoking and praising Tamil mother in a play titled \\"Manonmaniyam\\" written by Manonmaniam Sundaram Pillai (1855 ‚Äì 1897) and published in 1891. The song with music composed by M.S. Viswanathan has since been adopted as the state song of Government of Tamil Nadu. Temple for Tamil mother Tamil Thai Kovil is a temple in which the presiding deity is Tamil Thai representing Tamil language. This temple, located in Karaikudi in Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu, is the only temple in the world for worshiping a language as a god or goddess. The temple is situated inside the Kamban Mani Mandabam and the street in which the temple is located has been named Tamil Thai Kovil Street. The idea of establishing such a temple was conceived by Kamban Adippodi Saw Ganesan the founder of Kamban Kazhagam. The Tamil Thai temple was declared open in 1993, by Mu. Karunanidhi. The main shrine is for Tamil Thai. On either side of the idol of Tamil Thai, there are smaller idols of Agathiyar and Tholkappiyar. Outside the main shrine are icons of Oli Thai (the Goddess of Sound) and Vari Thai (the Goddess of Letters). There are separate enclosures for Kamban, Ilango Adigal and Thiruvalluvar. V. Ganapati Sthapati, temple architect and builder from Karaikudi, designed, constructed and did the sculpturing work of the temple. The idol of Tamil Thai installed in the temple is not worshiped in the same way as the idols installed in other temples. The Tamil Thai temple remains closed except during the Kamban Vizha which happens during the month of April every year. Statue of Tamil Thai in Madurai ThamizhA·πâ·πâai (‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç Mother Tamil). Statue installed to commemorate the 5th International Tamil conference, Madurai, held in 1981. In 1981, the then Tamil Nadu Government under M. G. Ramachandran had declared open a Tamil Thai statue in Madurai on the occasion of the Fifth World Tamil Conference in January 1981. On 14 May 2013, J. Jayalalithaa, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, announced in the State Legislative Assembly that an over 300-feet high statue of Tamilththaai (‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç) would be installed in Madurai at an approximate cost of Rs.100 crore. She also announced that the statue would be on the lines of the Statue of Liberty in New York City but till today it was never built. The image of the proposed statue has also attracted some criticism for the likely implications of the underlying iconographic presuppositions. Visual representations of Tamil Thai The goddess of Tamil Thai has been depicted variously in different media. Since the coinage of the concept and terminology of Tamil Thai by Manonmaniam Sundaram Pillai, the persona of Tamil Thai has been presented in a variety of ways in the print media via books, posters, paintings, in textbook illustrations, advertisements and cartoons. Statues of Tamil Thai have benn imagined and sculpted in several different forms. For example, in 1940, as directed by Ganesan, Vaidyanatha Stapathi created a panchaloha idol of Tamil Thai depicting Tamil Thai as seated on a globe to indicate the geographical spread of Tamil. In this statue, Tamil Thai holds in her hands palm leaf manuscripts, a japa mala, the torch of knowledge and a Sengottu yazh. The statue installed to commemorate the Fifth International Tamil Conference, Madurai, 1981, depicts Tamil Thai in a seated position sitting on a lotus flower with one hand in the abhayamudra. A nearly identical statue has been installed as the main idol in the Tamil Thai Temple in Karaikudi. In some areas, Andal is considered to be Tamil Thai due to her work to Tamil literature. The statue proposed to be installed at Madurai represents Tamil Thai in a standing position.

Career After apprenticing under Jeeva, Gurudev made his debut with Yogi (2009), though TN 07 AL 4777 (2009) released earlier. Gurudev's work has often won acclaim, the films he has worked on have often evaded commercial success. For his work in Chikku Bukku (2010), a critic from The Hindu noted that Gurudev \\"proves that he is from the late Jeeva's school, panning his camera in style he offers a brilliant visual treat\\". Likewise in Ameer's Aadhi Bhagavan, a critic wrote \\"whether it is the beaches of Pattaya, the deserts of Rajasthan, scenic Goa or Mumbai, cinematography by K. Devaraj and R. B. Gurudev is an absolute treat to the eye\\", and \\"each and every scene has been picturised tastefully\\". Similarly, his work in Megha (2014), was described as one of the film's few \\"bright spots\\". Gurudev was involved in the making of the successful Kanchana 2 (2015) and completed eighty percent of the film's shoot. However a delay in the film meant that he was unable to continue shooting as he had committed to work on Irumbu Kuthirai (2014). Unwilling to wait, Raghava Lawrence decided to finish Kanchana 2 with another cinematographer, much to the annoyance of Gurudev.http://www.kollytalk.com/cinenews/cinematographer-gurudev-feels- wronged-lawrence-ganga-173840.html Filmography *Urchagam (2007) * Rameswaram (2008) * TN 07 AL 4777 (2009) * Yogi (2009) * Chikku Bukku (2010) * Aadhi Bhagavan (2013) * Vathikuchi (2013) * Megha (2014) * Irumbu Kuthirai (2014) * Kanchana 2 (2015) * 144 (2015) * Mohini (2018) * Kalari (2018) * Genius (2018) * Kennedy Club (2019) *Gorilla (2019) References External links * Living people Artists from Chennai Cinematographers from Tamil Nadu Tamil film cinematographers Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"R.

Born in Kempston in Bedfordshire, Barton began working in a library at the age of twelve. He joined the Socialist League at some point in the 1880s, then in about 1890, he moved to Manchester, where he quickly found work at the John Rylands Library. At this time, Alf was on the anarchist wing of the Socialist League, and was prominent in the protests following the police provocations against Walsall Anarchists. Although he was arrested several times for making speeches, he was firmly opposed to violence in the anarchist cause.Helen Mathers, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VI, pp.21-24 Barton married Eleanor Stockton in 1894, who was to become prominent in the co-operative movement, and the two moved to Sheffield in 1897. Alf joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and quickly became prominent locally through his opposition to the Second Boer War; he later also joined the Social Democratic Federation. He joined the Shop Assistants' Union and was its delegate to Sheffield Federated Trades Council, and within it campaigned for it to affiliate to the Labour Representation Committee. It did so, but resulting disagreements about local candidates led the council to split, Barton being prominent on the local Labour Representation Committee. In 1907, he was elected to Sheffield City Council for the renamed Labour Party, representing Brightside. In 1907, Barton was appointed as secretary of the Sheffield ILP, and he also edited its weekly newspaper, the Sheffield Guardian. However, he lost his council seat in 1910, and in 1911 he resigned from the ILP entirely due to disagreements between himself and Joseph Pointer. The Labour Party would not endorse him in that year's local elections, so he instead ran for the SDF in Heeley, and was not successful. He persuaded Labour not to stand against him in Brightside in following years, and won his seat back in 1913. The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP) and in 1914 affiliated to the Labour Party, Barton becoming an official part of its group on the council once more. He was shortlisted as the party's candidate for the 1914 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, but was not selected. Barton supported British involvement in World War I, but he remained in the BSP rather than joining one of its pro-war splits. He stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Sheffield Park at the 1918 general election, then briefly joined the Communist Party of Britain (CPGB) on its formation, but resigned after less than a month, to rejoin the ILP and, by extension, the Labour Party. He stood in Harwich at the 1922 general election, losing his deposit, and the same year also lost his council seat, although he won a seat in Hillsborough in 1926. In 1929, he moved to represent Owlerton, also becoming an alderman, and served until his death in 1933.

Design and construction The Class 480 was expressly designed for the Brenner Railway, after the First World War had resulted in Italy and the FS taking possession of it up to its summit at the Brenner Pass. Previously the Austrian company S√ºdbahn had worked the line with its powerful 2-10-0 SB 580 locomotives, ten of which had remained south of the new border and had been taken over by the FS as Class 482; these were however insufficient, and the Italian Class 470 locomotive, while powerful, did not have enough steaming to adequately last for the section from Bolzano to the summit. Therefore, it was decided to design a new locomotive based on the Class 482. The Class 480 was fitted with an Italian bogie, the central driving wheels had their flanges reduced, and the last driving axle was given some lateral play to allow the locomotive to deal with sharp curves; because of the need of a boiler with good steaming capacity, a huge firebox (, considered the maximum compatible with hand-firing) was fitted. Coherent with the standard FS practices, the locomotives were superheated and had two simple-expansion cylinders; they also had left-hand drive and multiple Del Papa valves. A standard FS bogie tender was fitted. Given the needs of the Brenner line, only 18 locomotives were ordered, all to the Officine Meccaniche, which delivered them in 1923. Operations The Class 480 was initially allocated on the Brenner line, on which it proved very successful. After it was electrified in 1930 the locomotives were transferred to the sheds of Messina and Catania; in the last years of World War II they were re-transferred to Salerno, but returned to Sicily in the postwar years until the end of their career, although some of them were assigned to heavy shunting duties. The last Class 480 locomotives were withdrawn from duty in the early 1970s. Accidents The locomotive 480.016 was one of the two steam locomotives involved in the Balvano train disaster, the deadliest train disaster of Italy and one of the deadliest to this date. In the night between 2 and 3 March 1944, a freight train illegally ridden by hundreds of people stalled in a tunnel on the line between Naples and Potenza, near the railway station of Balvano; the crews and the passengers were overcome by fumes and killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, with more than 500 victims. The causes were indicated as the poor adherence conditions because of the humid rails, and the poor quality of the coal supplied by the Allied authorities of occupation. Preservation One Class 480 locomotive survived into preservation, the 480.017, which is kept as a static exhibit at the Pietrarsa railway museum.

It was found in the burial place of a high official named Mesdjerw and his wife Hetep-neferet. The Giza writing board is also known today under the name Giza king list because it presents a short list of six pharaohs from different dynasties.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen (√ÑA). Vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, . p. 117. Mesdjerw held the titles of Confidant of the king, Inspector of the auditioners of the treasure house and Overseer of the gold storages.Edward Brovarski: Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza. In: Annales du Service des Antiquit√©s de l¬¥Egypte No. 71. Cairo 1987, p. 29 - 52.  Description  The Giza writing board was made of polished cedar wood and gypsum. The original size of the board is unknown and cannot be reconstructed due to the damaged state of the artefact: the tablet was broken into pieces by grave robbers and the cedar wood has nearly completely decayed away. Originally, it was made of a thin, wooden board that was covered smoothly with white gypsum. It was inscribed with a vast and detailed list, written with red, green and black ink.William Stevenson Smith, William Kelly Simpson: The art and architecture of ancient Egypt. Penguin Books, London 1981, , S. 358 - 359.  Inscription   Overview  Giza writing board; complete view (after Edward Brovarski's Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza., page 52, obj. 1.Edward Brovarski: Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza. In: Annales du Service des Antiquit√©s de l¬¥Egypte No. 71. Cairo 1987, p. 52, obj. 1.). From the right to the left: empty columns (first four rows), king list (following four rows), deity list (12 rows), domain list (27 rows) and the sacrificial animals (in boxes). The list was divided into five \\"chapters\\", each separated by three thicker strokes. The first two chapters were meant to contain a text, but for unknown reasons, these remained empty. The third chapter contains 43 vertical columns. The first 4 columns contain the famous king list, with six names that are repeated verbatim in every column. Each king list ends with the word Ma'at (here with the meaning \\"justified\\"). The next 12 columns contain a list of deities, three different deity groups repeated four times each. The same goes for the remaining 27 columns, which list certain city names. However, the last city group is repeated only three times (which explains the uneven sum of 27 city columns altogether). The fourth \\"chapter\\" is divided into square compartments which contains the depictions of sacrificial birds. The fifth \\"chapter\\" is also divided into compartments, this time filled with depictions of sacrificial fishes.  King list  king list. list of deities. list of domains and places. list of sacrificial animals. The famous king list contains the cartouche names of following kings (from top to bottom): * Neferirkare Kakai (5th dynasty). * Sahure (also 5th dynasty). * Khafra (4th dynasty), builder of the second largest pyramid at Giza. * Djedefra (also 4th dynasty), first pharaoh using the sun symbol in a royal cartouche. * Teti (3rd dynasty), commonly identified as Hor-Sekhemkhet. * Bedjataw (2nd dynasty), commonly identified as king Hor-Hotepsekhemwy. The list names the kings in reverse chronological order, with the earliest king being the last given. Each column ends with the phrase \\"ma'a\\" meaning \\"the justified\\", which was typical for honouring deceased kings. It may be possible that Mesdjerw participated in the mortuary cult for these kings. This would explain why it was important for him to mention and thus honour only these selected kings. The cartouche names Bedjataw (or Bedjaw) and Teti are of special interest to Egyptologists. Indeed, the name \\"Bedjataw\\" is otherwise only known from the Abydos King List dating to the much later New Kingdom period. According to the position given to it on the list, the name \\"Teti\\" seems to designate a king who must have ruled before Djedefre and Khafre. A possible candidate for Teti is Hor- Sekhemkhet whose nebty name is known from ivory stencils to have been Djeserteti. Hence the Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck has proposed that \\"Teti\\" is Sekhemkhet.  List of deities  The list of deities comprises three fix groups of certain deities, each group is repeated four times, which results in twelve columns altogether. Every group comprises eight deities, there were once 24 gods listed. However, the writing board is heavily damaged in this section, many of the names are lost today. ;First group (from top to bottom): * Seker, god of the underworld. Worshipped since predynastic times. * Nemty, another underworld deity, also worshipped since predynastic times. * Sopdu, protector deity of foreign origin, often depicted with one or several captive(s). * destroyed. * Horus, god of the sky, safety patron of the pharaohs. * Geb, earth deity. * Sak, crocodile god which is seldom mentioned and thus little known. * Neith, goddess of war and hunting, worshipped since predynastic times. ;Second group (top to bottom): * destroyed. * destroyed. * destroyed. * Nekhbet, throne goddess in shape of a vulture resting on a basket. * Shezmu, seldom mentioned deity. He was the god of the wine, the gardeners and the dancers. A party god. * Qis, a deity of sumerian origin, worshipped since protodynastic times. He is shown holding two giraffes or lions in each hand. * Selket, goddess of protection and health. Her heraldic animal is the scorpion. * Sobek, crocodile god of the Nile and the swamps. He evoked and controlled the yearly life-spending Nile inundation. ;Third group (top to bottom): * destroyed. * Min, god of potence and fertility. His idol is an erect phallus. He was worshipped since predynastic times. * Onuris, god of war and expeditions. He is shown in Asiatic wardrobes with knotted hair, yellow-ish skin and a long, lush beard. * Seshat, goddess of building, founding and measuring. She was worshipped since Early dynastic period. * Osiris-Khontamenty, god of the underworld. He is the godlike judge of the court of the dead. * Meret, seldom mentioned goddess of dancing, luck and joy. She is depicted standing on a gold collar and clapping her hands rhythmically. * Kherty, god of the underworld. He welcomes the deceased ones and guides them safely to the court of the dead. * Anubis, jackal-headed god of grieve, mummification and burials. He was worshipped since Early dynastic times.  Domain list  The domain list comprises 28 cities and domains. Some of these domains are well known to Egyptologists, because their names were found in numerous Old Kingdom tombs throughout Giza (but also at Saqqara). Others are devoted to certain gods, such as the cities Iret-Nemty (\\"where Nemty works\\") and Tefet-Khnum (\\"where they gather together for Khnum\\"). Another city, Tenmet afefi (\\"hill of the flies\\") is of particular interest, because it shows by far the earliest hieroglyph of a house fly.  Sacrifice lists  The first sacrifice list comprises six birds, most of them goose and duck species. However, despite the detailed and naturalistic drawings, it remains difficult to Egyptologists and ornithologists to identify some of the depicted species. The first bird can be identified as a Sennar guineafowl. This bird is known in hieroglyphic writings as Neh-bird, its signs stands for \\"being attentive\\" or \\"being vigilant\\". The fourth bird might be a greylag and the penultimate bird may be a pintail duck. The second sacrifice list comprises three species of fish, each species repeated twice (which makes a total sum of six fish depictions). The first species can be identified as a Nile perch, the second one is some kind of carp species. The third fish can be identified as a Nile Tilapia.  Discovery  The writing board was found in 1904 by American Egyptologist George Andrew Reisner in chamber \\"C\\" of Mesdjerw's tomb (mastaba G-1011) at Giza. The tomb was badly damaged by grave robbers. Mesdjerw's name and titles were found on a loosened door jamb, the writing board was scattered across the sandy floor.  Function  The exact function of the Giza writing board remains unclear. In normal cases, royal scribes used such writing boards for calligraphic and dictional practices. Or they used them as blueprints for later relief decorations. However, the hieroglyphic design and the depictions of the animals on the Giza writing board are way too detailed and professionally exercised to be a simple blueprint or writing test. For this reasons, some scholars think it was possible that Mesdjerw created his writing board as some kind of notebook for the afterlife. Such things were similar to the offering stelae inside tomb chambers of royal officials and their popularity grew during the New Kingdom period. Old Kingdom examples, however, are extremely rare and in case of the Giza writing board unique in its design.

Trained in the meticulous style of traditional Chinese fine brush painting, Leung's works combine tradition with modern subject matter. Leung's work is subjective and personal as she uses her art to comment on urban city life and its related issues in a witty and imaginative way. Leung's works reflect her strong desire to confront conventional habits and beliefs in order to present new perspective and provoke alternative interpretations of modern life. In most of her paintings, the combination of the subject (which is often a girl), the scenery (which is usually related to nature) and the rhythmic doggerel evokes a poetic space for imagination in the viewers. The girl, which is a dominant motif, in Leung's paintings is imbued with agency to freely interact with the other objects and the environment. It is a reversal of the long-held notion of women taking a backseat and are often the objects to be looked at by men.  Early life and education  Joey Leung received her Bachelor of Arts (2000) and Master of Fine Arts (2007) from the Department of Fine Arts, Chinese University of Hong Kong. At the University, she started to pick up gongbi painting from 1998. Although this realistic technique of ancient Chinese painting is generally considered unimaginative and inexpressive, Leung imbues in it a modern spirit through her choice of subject matter, media and format.  Style  If gongbi painting that often depicts birds and flowers is generally looked upon as uninspired and rooted in the nostalgic, Joey Leung has provided a new twist to it as she integrates tradition with popular culture in her works. Drawing upon her personal experiences of city life, her artworks often represent an ironic twist to mundane everyday happenings. The juxtaposition of words and images in Leung's paintings recalls both the Chinese art form of Lianhuanhua (picture story book) popular in China in the 1920s as well as the pop art of Japanese comics (manhua) in Hong Kong prevalent in the 80s & 90s. Using the sequential structure, it provides a strong narration in her paintings whereby the viewer can derive meanings from both text and images. To comprehend Leung's paintings, it is important that viewer understands the riddle-like doggerels that she writes in Cantonese, the vernacular language to Hong Kong. Leung also expands the art media in her painting to include Chinese ink, gouache, acrylic, pencil, colored pencil, ball pen, drawing pen and markers.  Works Leung's most recent works include Goddess of Luo River„Ää Ê¥õÁ•û„Äã, Fragments of Time „ÄäÊôÇÈñìÁöÑÁ¢éÁâá „Äãand The Listless Lion„ÄäÁçÖÂ≠êÊ≤íÁ≤æÁ•û„Äãthat she completed in 2017. In her Pool of Muscle „Ää‰∫∫ÈñìËÇâÊ±†„Äã(2016), it comprises a series of three paintings titled Dream Balcony, Scenery of the Moment and Firework is Everywhere. In 2015 Leung produced six paintings: Something that Mr. Chow didn't Mention„ÄäÂë®ÂÖ¨Ê≤íË™™„Äã,Worrywart And The Cat with Bell„Ää Ëá™Â∞ãÁÖ©ÊÉ±ÁöÑ‰∫∫ËàáÊéõÈà¥Ë≤ì „Äã,Expired Memory: Weeping Willow And Octopus „ÄäÈÅéÊúüÁöÑË®òÊÜ∂ÔºöÂûÇÊü≥ËàáÂÖ´Áà™È≠ö „Äã,Transient 1 „ÄäÁÑ°Â∏∏Â•π 1 „ÄãTransient 2 „ÄäÁÑ°Â∏∏Â•π 2 „Äãand Wait a Moment„ÄäÁ≠âÁ≠â „Äã. In 2014, her works include Romantic Encounters Happen Only in Movies „ÄäÊµ™Êº´ÂÅ∂ÈÅáÂè™Âú®ÈõªÂΩ±ÁôºÁîü „Äã,Oil fish Melon Soup with Egg Drop „ÄäÁâõÊ≤πÈ≠öÁìúËõãËä±ÊπØ „Äã,The Despised Monday„ÄäË¢´Â´åÊ£ÑÁöÑÊòüÊúü‰∏Ä „Äã, Chicken Stock is Powerless to Help „ÄäÈ∑ÑÊ±ÅÁÑ°ÂäõÊïë „Äã.  Exhibitions   Solo exhibitions  Joey Leung won the prestigious Y.S. Hui Arts Award for her mixed media work in 2000 upon her graduation. In the same year, she held her first solo exhibition Idling Away a Second in Galerie Martini, Hong Kong. From 2008 to 2014, Leung held three solo exhibitions in the Grotto Fine Arts, Hong Kong and one in Aquvii Tokyo in Japan. Her exhibition Beyond Presumption „Ää ÈÇ£‰∫õ‰∫∫Êàë‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÁöÑ‰∫ã„Äã(2008) is about imaginary stories presented in the first-person or third-person narrative to express her feelings about the world she lives in. Leung's paintings in Cloudy Fairy-tales„ÄäÈô∞Â§©ÁöÑÁ´•Ë©±„Äã(2010) were inspired by figures from famous fairy tales in the Western world like Snow White, Cinderella as a way to comment on her observations of city life and its people. This is followed by her Garden of Hesitation „ÄäÁå∂Ë±´Âúí„Äã (2012) and Unpoetic Poems „Ää‰∏çË©©ÊÑèË©©ÈõÜ„Äã (2014) at Grotto Fine Art, Hong Kong.

Jihad terror attacks by Islamist extremists enacted to further a perceived Islamic religious or political cause occur globally. Some of these plots have been successfully prevented. The culprits used tactics such as arson, vehicle rampage attacks, bomb threats, suicide attacks, bombings, spree shooting, stabbings, hijackings, kidnappings and beheadings. The following is a list of thwarted Islamist terrorist attacks that have received significant press coverage since the Iranian revolution in 1979.

He was Minister of Public Works in 1933‚Äì34, and for a few days in 1935. He helped provide infrastructure needed by the alpine tourist industry in his native department of Is√®re, and introduced reforms to railway regulations. He was Minister of the Interior in 1935‚Äì36 during a period when France was struggling to manage an influx of refugees from Nazi Germany, and tensions were rising in the French colony of Algeria. Early years (1880‚Äì1924) Joseph Paganon was born on 19 March 1880 in Vourey, Is√®re. His parents were Marie and Alexandre Paganon from Laval, teachers in Vourey. He spent his childhood in Sainte-Agn√®s, a small mountain village, He studied at the Lyc√©e Polyvalent Vaucanson in Grenoble. He won a scholarship that let him study at the Faculty of Science in Lyon and the School of Chemistry. He graduated with a diploma as a chemical engineer and a Bachelor of Science. Paganon moved to Paris to work as a secretary at the head office of the Poulenc fr√®res company, while studying under Louis Bouveault (1864‚Äì1909) at the Sorbonne. He earned a doctorate in Chemistry with a thesis on artificial silk. This won him a travel scholarship to Germany. There he was attached to the French embassy in Berlin and attended courses of Hermann Emil Fischer at the Faculty of Science. After returning to Paris he became a contributor to the journal Le Temps, writing on economic and social topics. In 1906 Paganon joined the office of the Minister of Agriculture. In 1908 he was appointed adviser on foreign trade. He was secretary general of the National Committee of Advisers on Foreign Trade. Paganon became chief of staff to Jules Pams, Minister of Agriculture from 1911 to 1913. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he served in the chasseurs before being attached as a chemist to the Ministry of Armament, with the status of artillery officer. In 1917 Paganon was recalled to the Ministry of Agriculture, where he was chief of staff until 1918. As an officer, he was also military attach√© to Georges Clemenceau. Soon after the war Pams, now Minister of the Interior, appointed him chief of staff to that Ministry. He was elected mayor of the commune of Laval, Is√®re. Deputy (1924‚Äì37) Paganon ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature on 16 November 1919. On 11 May 1924 he was elected deputy for the Is√®re. He joined the Radical and Radical Socialist group in the chamber. He was elected to the general council of Is√®re representing Goncelin in 1925. He was reelected deputy in April‚ÄìMay 1928 for the first district of Grenoble, and was again elected on 1 May 1932. On 3 June 1932 he was appointed under-secretary of state for Foreign Affairs in the third cabinet of √âdouard Herriot, holding office until 14 December 1932. In this role he participated in the Geneva talks of June 1932 on German reparations for World War I damages. Minister of Public Works (1933‚Äì34) On 31 January 1933 Paganon was appointed Minister of Public Works in the first cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. He retained this post in the cabinets of Albert Sarraut and Camille Chautemps and the second cabinet of Daladier, which fell on 7 February 1934. As Minister of Public Works he reclassified of roads into the national network. He began work on the Chambon and Sautet dams. In Is√®re he created or improved tourist routes, including access to Villard-Notre-Dame, and the link from Uriage to Allevard called the \\"Balcon de Belledonne\\". In the mid-1930s the Alpe d'Huez resort consisted of a few cabins and chalets, one of them owned by Paganon, reached by a zigzag gravel road. Paganon anticipated a boom in winter sports and authorized construction of a new road up to the resort. Fourteen companies shared the task, each building of the road. The ski resort soon began to thrive. In response to requests from the railway companies to allow greater competition with road haulage companies, Paganon introduced what became known as the \\"Paganon amendment\\", The amendment to the act of 1921 was dated 8 July 1933. It gave the government greater power, and allowed for various changes to earlier acts to improve efficiency. The effect was a thorough overhaul of railway operations, tariffs, stock and infrastructure. The reform did little to improve the financial condition of the railways, which continued to lose money. Paganon was also unable to resolve the problem of coordinating rail and road haulage without favoring one or the other. Paganon was very briefly Minister of Public Works in the ephemeral cabinet of Fernand Bouisson from 1‚Äì4 June 1935. On 17 November 1935 he was elected senator for the Is√®re in a by- election. Minister of the Interior (1935‚Äì36) Paganon was appointed Minister of the Interior in the fourth cabinet of Pierre Laval on 7 June 1935. He had to deal with growing numbers of refugees from Nazi Germany and Eastern Europe. The French position on the High Commission for Refugees, Jewish and Other (HCR) of the League of Nations was ambiguous. France wanted a weak organization that would not interfere with French rights to refuse visas and expel refugees, and a strong organization that would force other countries to take more refugees, particularly in the Americas. Paganon observed that the HCR wanted to get France to absorb the refugees already in the country so the HCR could concentrate on placing the refugees who were continuing to flee from Germany. He felt this was \\"unfavorable toward those rare countries like our own, which had committed the imprudence of welcoming foreigners too generously.\\" However, he agreed that France could not return refugees to countries where their lives were in danger. Paganon began to explore the possibility of placing refugees in farming settlements in the south of France. In November he issued two circulars that stated that refugees and stateless foreigners could not be expelled unless they had committed crimes or subversive acts. This did not prevent expulsions, as the S√ªret√© Nationale often refused to recognize that West European Jews were stateless. Some French diplomats warned that France should not give the impression of welcoming opponents of the Nazis. However, Paganon announced at the end of 1935 that he would consider naturalizing some refugees so they could serve in the armed forces. He wanted to follow a humane approach that would avoid putting the refugees in concentration camps or prisons, and would allow most of them to remain in France. This conflicted with popular opposition to letting refugees work in trades and professions where they would compete with the French for scarce jobs. In August 1935 Paganon was informed by the Algerian governor- general George Le Beau of a surge of anti-Semitism by French colons, many of whom had joined the right wing Front paysan and Croix-de-Feu. Poor Muslims were being drawn into clashes with the Jews. Le Beau was concerned that the unrest could lead to violence against Europeans who tried to protect the Jews. On 30 August 1935 Paganon issued a law that aimed to prevent disruption of auctions of land of bankrupt colons. Prefects were afraid that if the government yielded to colon pressure to halt these bankruptcy sales, the indigenous people who were struggling to pay taxes after a poor harvest might revolt against the regime. In September 1935 Paganon observed, \\"the North Africans residing in the Paris region follow the different phases of the Italian‚ÄìEthiopian conflict with a vivid interest. ... They reckon that it is the duty of all Muslims unreservedly to lend their material and moral support to the Ethiopians.\\" Paganon left the Ministry of the Interior on 22 January 1936. With his health undermined, unable to recover through rest in his native Alps, Joseph Paganon died in Paris on 2 November 1937 at the age of 57.

A 14-year-old boy narrates the story of strange events that happen at Alcott-Simpson's, an upscale city department store, and his friendship with a mysterious girl he meets in the store, who turns out to be connected to the unusual events.  Plot  Fourteen-year-old Dion James lives with his charming but improvident father in an apartment in an unnamed city. Dion is forced to work to help support himself and his father. He began working at age eight as a shoeshine boy near Alcott- Simpson's, an upscale department store. He became fascinated with the large, luxurious store, spending many hours there and fantasizing about owning the store or just living in it. An Alcott-Simpson's clerk named Madame Stregovitch befriended him, and he often visits her at the store. Dion notices a tense atmosphere in Alcott-Simpson's, and hears rumors of vandalism and strange events there. He sees a beautiful girl his own age, with black eyes and long black hair, escape from a guard who is chasing her because she is wearing a sweater from the store with the price tag still attached (suggesting she is attempting to shoplift the sweater). One day, Dion hears a scream from the store mezzanine. He tries to see what is causing the commotion, but becomes worried about encountering the store security guards lest he be unfairly blamed, and ends up hiding from them under a bed in the furniture department and getting stuck in the store after closing time. He is found by the girl he saw earlier, who introduces herself as Sara and helps him leave the store. Dion and Sara are attracted to each other, and Dion begins to spend time with her at the store, often hiding and joining her after closing time. Sara seems to live in the store, dressing up in whatever clothing she likes from the racks, and always being able to avoid the guards. With Sara, Dion is able to live out his own fantasies about owning or living in Alcott-Simpson's. Sara says that she watches over a group of her younger siblings, called the Others, who also stay at the store, playing in different departments. Dion is unable to see the Others, but hears from a store clerk about animals being let out of the store pet shop (one of which frightened a customer and caused the screaming incident), sounds of running feet and laughter, and toys moving by themselves. Although Sara is vague about how she and the Others are permitted in the store, Dion eventually figures out that Sara and the Others are ghost children killed by a famine, whom Madame Stregovitch has brought to live in the store using her supernatural powers. The Others' antics are now scaring away the store's customers. Madame asks Dion not to visit the store until she finishes addressing the situation, but Dion, missing Sara, goes to visit her one more time and asks her to stay with him. Sara says she cannot leave the Others and encourages Dion to join her instead, by jumping off the roof of the store (presumably dying from the fall and becoming a ghost). However, at the last second Dion hesitates and Sara stops him from falling. Realizing that they occupy different worlds, Sara and Dion sadly part. Madame later uses her supernatural powers to send the ghosts back from whence they came, but it is too late to save Alcott-Simpson's, which soon closes down. Dion feels bereft, but continues his life.  Characters  Dion \\"Di\\" James ‚Äî The 14-year-old narrator and main character of the story. He plays guitar and is a member of a high school band.

Critical reception  Reviewing Snyder's book, The New York Times describes the author as \\"nimble-fingered craftswoman\\". However, Jane Langton calls Snyder's style of writing \\"sober\\" and states that there are many loose ends in the book that a reader could build \\"a bird's nest out of them.\\"JANE LANGTON. in the New York Times Book Review.

Of her work, Harris explains, \\"My projects often provide a disorienting encounter for the viewer: in my installations I am concerned with destabilization and re-orientation. To achieve this I often create architectural and environmental interventions ‚Äì by using light and reflective surfaces; by inverting subject and object or figure and ground; and/or by reversing up and down, exterior and interior.\\" Harris has stated that her work is influenced by artists like James Turrell, Mark Rothko, and the Hudson River School painters. She also explained, \\"A lot of my interest in light came from being from Los Angeles, where the light is just everywhere. You have these huge expanses of sky\\".

Biography Liesl Herbst (n√©e Westreich) was born on 8 November 1903 in the town of Jaegerndorf (now called Krnov) in Silesia where her family owned the Gessler distillery. She lived in Villa Westreich with her parents and two older sisters. Her father Leo Westreich ran the company together with his brother-in-law Siegfried Gessler. During World War 2, her mother and one sister were killed at Theresienstadt/Terazin concentration camp. Her other sister, Gertruda L√∂wenbein, was murdered in the mass shooting as a result of the Slovak National Uprising at Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia in 1944, along with her husband Rudolph and 16-year-old daughter Anna. Liesl married David Herbst in 1926. He was President of the sporting club Hakoah Vienna from 1928 to 1938.  Career  Herbst became Tennis Champion of Austria in 1930 and the main part of her career spanned the years between 1929 and 1937, when she participated in more than 70 tournaments in Austria, Yugoslavia, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, France, Switzerland, Germany, Greece and Egypt. She also represented Austria in many international tennis matches. She won at least 15 singles tournaments during her career. Between 1930 and 1936, when she took prominent places in the national rankings, the Austrian Lawn Tennis Association didn't send any female representatives to Wimbledon or to the French Championships. Although she did not compete in any Grand Slam tournaments at the time she lived in Austria, she played matches against several Grand Slam champions and international stars: Helen Jacobs of U.S., Simone Mathieu of France and Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling of Germany and Denmark. She won singles matches against former, current and future champions of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary and Italy. In the mixed doubles (when they were popular in the 1930s) she partnered almost every Austrian Davis Cup player of that era. She did not participate in any tournaments in 1938, because after the Anschluss, she and her 13-year-old daughter Dorrit Herbst (later to become a tennis player too) escaped from Austria to live in England where they were joined on 29 March 1939 by her husband David (Dezs√∂) Herbst. David Herbst had been President of the famous sports club, Hakoah Vienna 1928-1938. She returned to competitive tennis in England in 1939, although there were no tournaments in the country until 1946 due to World War II. She played at Wimbledon twice, representing Czechoslovakia in the Ladies Singles in 1939. As well as playing singles she also partnered her daughter Dorrit in the 1946 Wimbledon doubles tournament. Dorrit competed in the Ladies Singles at Wimbledon in 1946, 1947 and 1948.  Retirement  She gave up tennis in her 60s and became a keen golfer, playing at Wentworth Club several times a week for the rest of her life. She was also a talented skier and ice skater - she only gave up skiing in her 70s when her favourite ski boots fell apart and she didn't like the idea of wearing modern boots. During her skiing days she went to many different resorts all over the Alps and competed in several amateur races, gaining the Swiss Gold Test in St Moritz in 1955. Her daughter Dorrit (Dorli) Mills pre-deceased her in 1978 and her husband David in 1987. She died in London on 25 February 1990.
