History Joe Cicerone, Harry Booras and Rich Clements founded The Channel in 1980, choosing the name because the club sat at the edge of the Fort Point Channel, which separates South Boston from the Financial District. The club was on the other side and a little south of where the Boston Tea Party took place (old Griffin's Wharf) in 1773. Cicerone's involvement in the club would be short lived and he would soon be replaced by Jack Burke. Burke and Harry Booras along with Peter Booras as General Manager would run The Channel throughout its heyday of the 1980s. In 1990, Harry and Peter Booras, the last owners of the club, filed for chapter 11. The authorities had revoked the liquor license several times with fines for serving minors. The doors closed on December 31, 1991. There were rumors that mob boss Frank Salemme had a foothold in the club, and these rumors proliferated after The Channel reopened its doors as an exotic dance club, which closed after less than a year. His son, Frank Salemme Jr., was listed for a time as the assistant manager of the club. In the late 1990s, developers demolished the building to make way for Big Dig construction. In the mid- to late 1980s, the club was in its prime. Local up-and-coming Boston bands relished the opportunity to make it to this stage and plug in. David Tedeschi and Peter Vernaglia installed the original sound system at The Channel. Tedeschi would leave about a year later to pursue other interests and Vernaglia would remain as lead engineer. House soundmen included Rocky Marsiano, Lenny Rosengard and Norman Cooke. Vernaglia and crew would remain at the club for some eight years, following which soundman Dinky Dawson would install and maintain a new sound system for The Channel. He had settled in Boston from his native England, where he had made a name for himself in the 1960s and 1970s from his road work with bands like Fleetwood Mac, The Byrds, The Kinks to name but a few. Many of these old acquaintances like Mick Fleetwood or John McVie were seen milling about The Channel visiting with Dinky on the occasion that they were in Boston. The sound system that Dinky owned and brought with him to The Channel was rumored to include the same sound cabinets that first blasted Manfred Mann's \\"Doo Wa Diddy\\" in a recording studio back in London in 1964. Dinky's past is documented in the book Life on the Road published by Billboard Books in 1998. Notable DJs Hugh Munoz was one of the club's first full-time DJs, Many popular Boston DJs would also spin on special occasions including Carter Alan, Albert O, Tami Heide, Bradley Jay , and Peter Choyce. Debbie Southwood-Smith, Mike Idlis and Mod Todd (Todd Nichols/WGIR-FM) ushered in the mid to late eighties' era along with BCN's Metal Mike, DJ \\"Black Starliner\\" and Jim Mitchell. Also included in this category of Channel deejays are Carmelita (WBCN, WAAF) and Janet Planet (circa 1983-1987), who also worked the Nu Musik Nights, Shred (WERS, WBCN) and Hugh Munoz (1980-1983), creator of Metrowave on WERS. Environment The Channel had a legal capacity of 1,700, although management often oversold the venue for major acts. Upon entering the club, the patron faced a large raised wooden corral that provided a view of the stage from the far end. The look of the venue was that of the classic roadhouse. The 4' high stage faced a 20' square sunken dance floor, nicknamed \\"the pit\\", which was surrounded by drink rails and tables with padded stools. For punk rock and metal shows, the management locked this furniture up in the coat room. When the bands were playing and the crowd was jumping, the entire wooden floor often bounced up and down, causing the 15' high PA system, to sway precariously back and forth. In addition to a dozen bar stations, the club had a concession stand/store ran by Doug Abbott that sold hot dogs, candy, soda, and popcorn, as well as official club merchandise (T-shirts, jackets, sweatpants, etc.). Directly behind that was a semi-private game room with a half dozen video games. There was also a back bar area that had the ability to be closed off during all-ages shows by lowering metal grates over the window openings. All ingress/egress was restricted to a single door that was manned by a bouncer who checked for hand stamps to allow the over 21 crowds to enter for a drink, as well as prevent them from bringing alcoholic beverages out into the rest of the club with the underage crowd. To the rear of the back bar area was yet another, smaller room that was usually closed off on nights when the club wasn't sold out. This was known as the VIP room, and regularly played host to artists like Jimmy Page, U2 and Aerosmith when they were in town and wanted a private place to sit with friends and have a few drinks. Depending on who was playing, the pit would become a mass of sweaty skinheads, punks, metalheads, goth kids and the occasional hippie slamming into each other. In the late 1980s, shows would be stopped because kids were getting too violent. The bouncers had a notorious reputation of brutality, and there certainly were a number of incidents where this was the case. Music The Channel started out booking new wave bands such as Human Sexual Response, Jon Butcher Axis, and The Cars. During the early and mid-1980s heyday of hardcore and punk, bands like H√ºsker D√º, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys and Minor Threat were headline acts. Later, local bands such as The Pixies played alongside major touring acts such as Big Audio Dynamite, Los Lobos, The Damned, and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. The Channel was booked by Warren Scott from 1980 to 1991, and was not limited to punk/metal bands. The Godfather of Soul, James Brown played there, as did jazz legend Ornette Coleman. Classic shows of note have included Jerry Lee Lewis, Gregg Allman, Eric Burdon, Meat Loaf, The Go-Go's, The B-52's and Steppenwolf. Live radio station broadcasts also packed in large crowds. Often, the Channel became the first or last stop for many major tours. The club also regularly booked reggae shows featuring acts such as Yellowman, Dennis Brown, Steel Pulse, Toots & the Maytals, Burning Spear, and Black Uhuru. Blues greats B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Charlie Musselwhite, James Cotton, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy (as featured from 1989 as a bonus on the end of the 2007 DVD \\"Junior Wells Live At Nightstage\\"), Pinetop Perkins graced the stage on more than one occasion.

He was a social reformer and later founded the Brahmo Samaj at Comilla. He contributed substantially to the cause of women's education, remarriage of widows, movement against polygamy and consumption of liquor. He joined the Commissioner's office at Dhaka as a clerk in 1840, was promoted as Deputy Collector in 1845 and as Excise Collector in 1851. With the assistance of such noted personalities as Ramkumar Bose and Bhagaban Chandra Bose, he established a press, from where Dhaka Prakash was published. The proposal for the establishment of Dhaka Jagannath College for the spread of higher education amongst the people was mooted in his house. Early life Braja Sundar Mitra's father died when he was rather young. As a result, he had to start working on a small salary before the completion of his education. When Debendranath Tagore started the Tattwabodhini Patrika in 1843, there was one young reader in far away Dhaka. Its message of hope and deliverance roused him. He inspired a number of other young men to set up a Brahmo Samaj in Dhaka in 1846. The form of service adopted for its gatherings consisted of reading of a written Brahmastrotra or form of adoration addressed to Divinity and concluded with the delivery of a written or printed sermon. It was a simple beginning but Braja Sundar Mitra threw so much ardour of soul into it that the Samaj soon succeeded in attracting a pretty large number of followers, mostly people occupying important government positions. The move was not without opposition. The message of the Tattwabodhini Patrika aroused a strong antagonism against conservative ideas. Traditional society started organising opposition to it. Men began to encourage all sorts of evil reports against the promoters of the Samaj. The engines of social persecution were set against them. Braja Sundar Mitra was then living in the house of a well-known citizen. His guardian and protector expelled him. Although most of the members were men of rank, the rising voice of protest told upon them. They decided to conduct their prayer meetings in secret for some time. Later, they started formal prayer meetings in a house in Banglabazar. Reform efforts When Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar raised the storm of widow remarriage, Braja Sundar Mitra printed copies of his books at his own cost and circulated them widely amongst the people of East Bengal. That created a group of core supporters for the movement in that part of the province. His name is bracketed with that of Durga Mohan Das as notable contributors in the field of widow remarriage. He had assisted in many ways in the spread of female education. As a result of Braja Sundar's transfer to Comilla for official work there was slackening in the activities of the Brahmo Samaj. On witnessing this, he bought a house in Armeniatola and lent out a part of it for the activities of the Samaj. At around the same time, as a result of his interest and the efforts of Dinanath Sen, a school for moral and religious instruction of the young was opened under Dhaka Brahmo Samaj. Aghore Nath Gupta and Vijay Krishna Goswami were sent as teachers to that school. That was around 1861-62. The school renamed at present as Jagannath College of Dhaka. The powerful preaching of those two created a major stir in Dhaka. Large groups of young men started joining the Brahmo Samaj. Subsequently, Keshub Chunder Sen visited Dhaka in 1865 and virtually set the place on fire. It gave rise to a massive movement against the Brahmo Samaj. However, the firm footing on which Braja Sundar Mitra had set up the Dhaka Brahmo Samaj helped it tide over all such opposition. The renowned pathologist and Brahmo reformer, Deba Prasad Mitra was his grandson. Debendranath found in Brajasundar his true messenger in East Bengal. Being moved by his sincerity after his own visit to East Bengal, Debendranath established a bonding of friendship by getting Brajasundar's third daughter Umasundari (1854‚Äì1936), married by himself to Prosonno Coomar Biswas (1837‚Äì1921), trusted disciple and dewan of his estates (1866‚Äì1899) as per convention of thakurbari and \\"Brahmo Dharma\\" in 1866/1867. Prosonno Coomar later became trustee of Brahmo Samaj at Bhawanipur along with Rabindranath Tagore (1894) when Debendranath relinquished his interest.

Boshamer Stadium is a baseball stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It is the home of the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team. History Boshamer Stadium before 2007 The previous home of the Tar Heels had been a multi-use venue called Emerson Field, which sat some 2,400 people. The combination baseball/football field was opened in 1916 and had been named for a university benefactor best known as the inventor of Bromo-Seltzer. The football team left Emerson for Kenan Memorial Stadium in 1927. Emerson would continue as the home of the baseball team for another 45 seasons. Its site is now occupied by Davis Library. Boshamer Stadium first opened on March 21, 1972, near the tail end of the 1972 season. It is named for Cary C. Boshamer (class of 1917), a textile industrialist from Gastonia whose donation made the new stadium possible. Although many Tar Heel players and fans speak of the stadium as \\"the Bosh\\", apparently the family survivors favor the \\"Boss-hammer\\" pronunciation.http://www.wbtv.com/story/22525874/how-do-you-say-boshamer-unc- may-have-it-wrong It has hosted five Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournaments, in 1973, 1975, 1981, 1982, and 1983. North Carolina won the 1982 and 1983 tournaments. The Tar Heels' on-field success during the mid-2000s coincided with the decision to rebuild the 35-year-old facility. Following the 2007 season, the stadium was almost completely demolished and rebuilt. UNC won their final game in the old Boshamer Stadium 9-4 over the University of South Carolina. 2008 renovations Due to extensive renovations to Boshamer, the Tar Heels played their 2008 season at USA Baseball National Training Complex in nearby Cary. The rebuilt stadium first opened on February 2, 2009. At that time, the playing surface was formally renamed Bryson Field in honor of former first baseman Vaughn Bryson and his wife Nancy, both longtime supporters of the baseball program. The entrance courtyard of the rebuilt stadium is named for the Steinbrenner family, as the result of a $1 million donation by New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose granddaughter graduated from UNC. Since expansion, the stadium has a listed capacity of 4,100, but has standing room for up to 5,000. Before renovations, it seated 3,000 people from the end of one dugout to the other. Today, seating extends down both the 1st and 3rd base lines. Sections past the dugout on the 1st base line are now reserved for student seating, nicknamed \\"The Bosh Pit\\". Attendance In 2013, the Tar Heels ranked 32nd among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,998 per home game. Dimensions The field dimensions are as follows: *Left Field: 335 ft (102.1 m) *Left Center Field: 370 ft (112.8 m) *Center Field: 400 ft (121.9 m) *Right Center Field: 355 ft (108.2 m) *Right Field: 340 ft (103.6 m) The asymmetry of the field is partly the result of an inward bulge in the fence in right center.

Erdrich revised and expanded the novel in subsequent 1993 and 2009 editions. The book follows the lives of five interconnected Ojibwe families living on fictional reservations in Minnesota and North Dakota. The collection of stories in the book spans six decades from the 1930s to the 1980s. Love Medicine garnered critical praise and won numerous awards, including the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award. Plot summary Love Medicine follows the intertwining lives of three central families, the Kashpaws, Lamartines, and Morrisseys, and two peripheral families, the Pillagers and the Lazarres.Kurup, Seema. Understanding Louise Erdrich. University of South Carolina Press, 2016. pp. 4 Members of the families variously reside on the fictional Ojibwe reservations of Little No Horse and Hoopdance, and in Minneapolis-St.Paul and Fargo. Erdrich employs a non-linear format in Love Medicine, and each chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, using first-person and third-person limited narration. Love Medicine begins with June Morrissey freezing to death on her way home on Easter Sunday, 1981, and ends in 1985, with the reunification of June's former husband, Gerry Nanapush, with June and Gerry's son, Lipsha.Gleason, William. \\"'Her Laugh An Ace':The Function of Humor in Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D.

Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 163-178 Owens states that ‚Äúthe seemingly doomed Indian, or tortured mixed-blood caught between worlds surfaces in Erdrich‚Äôs fiction, but such characters tend to disappear behind those other, foregrounded characters who hang on in spite of it all [‚Ä¶] and, like a story teller, weave a fabric of meaning and significance out of the remnants.‚Äù To illustrate Indigenous cultural endurance, Erdrich superimposes Ojibwe mythological narratives and images onto her characters. Owens identifies Nanabozho, a peripatetic trickster and world-creator, as a key intertextual reference in Erdrich‚Äôs text. Owens points to the first chapter of Love Medicine: true to traditional trickster narratives, in the beginning of Love Medicine, June Kashpaw is seen without a home and on the move. If the purpose of telling Nanabozho stories is to challenge listeners and to obversely remind them of their roots, Owens argues, then the purpose of June‚Äôs absence in Love Medicine is to underscore each character‚Äôs enduring place within the tribal community. Furthermore, in Owen's formulation, Just as the trickster transcends time and space, June‚Äôs death, which occurs on Easter Sunday, disrupts linear Christian time and interweaves it with cyclic/accretive time. Finally, Owens states that the mythic principle of Nanabozho is made explicit in the Nanapush family name; the revealed patrilineal link between Gerry Nanapush, a fugitive culture hero seemingly capable of shape shifting, and Lipsha, who always has a few tricks up his sleeve, ensures the transmission and survival of Indigenous values in the text.  Land and Tribal Identity  Meditations on land as a formative and nurturing source of tribal identity feature prominently in Love Medicine.Erdrich, Louise. \\"Where I Ought To Be: A Writer's Sense Of Place\\" New York Times Book Review, 28 July 1985, pp 23-24 For example, Uncle Eli, with his deep connections to the land, is described as being healthy and robust in his old age, unlike his senile brother Nector, who grew up off-reservation. The primacy of land finds formal expression in Louise Erdrich‚Äôs artistic manifesto, ‚ÄúWhere I Ought to Be: A Writer‚Äôs Sense of Place.‚Äù In it, Erdrich articulates a traditional tribal view of place, where generations of families inhabit the same land, and in doing so, imbue the landscape with history, identity, myth and reality. Erdrich contrasts this relationship with Western culture‚Äôs mutable, progressive view of geography: ‚Äúnothing, not even land, can be counted on to stay the same.‚Äù Western literature's alienation from place, in Erdrich's view, is marked by the impulse to document change in the face of an ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation. She explains how American Indian writers write from a different position: for them, ‚Äúthe unthinkable has already happened,‚Äù and as such, their task is to reconstitute a new birthing place that is capable of ‚Äú[telling] the stories of contemporary survivors while protecting and celebrating the cores of cultures left in the wake of the catastrophe.‚Äù  Indigenous Humor and Survival  In multiple interviews, Erdrich has commented on the importance of humor as a mechanism for Indigenous survival and resistance. She states: ‚Äúwhen it‚Äôs survival humor, you learn to laugh at things [‚Ä¶] it‚Äôs a different way of looking at the world, very different form the stereotype, the stoic, unflinching Indian standing, looking at the sunset.‚ÄùErdrich, Louise and Dorris, Michael.Interview with Laura Coltelli. \\"Winged Words: American Indian Writers Speak\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 155-158 William Gleason argues that in Love Medicine, humor works by cropping up at ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù moments, thereby posing a greater question of belonging. Gleason's examples of out-of-place humor include Nector‚Äôs tragicomic death and Gordie‚Äôs telling of the Norwegian joke in ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Greatest Fisherman,‚Äù as King is heard physically threatening his spouse outside. In light of the historical ‚Äúunthinkable‚Äù perpetrated against Native communities, Gleason quotes from various theorists to point to the regenerative effect of laughter. It is Lipsha‚Äôs comical take on the world that allows him to endure heartache and eventually realize that ‚Äúbelonging was a matter of deciding to.‚ÄùErdrich, Louise. \\"Love Medicine\\" Holt, Rinehart, & Winston, 1984, pp.255 According to Gleason, jokes can also take on an explicitly subversive, if not emancipatory, dimension when they invoke Native American mythology. He identifies Heyoka, a literally and metaphorically backwards facing contrarian jester, and Nanabhozo, a wisecracking trickster, as two incarnations of pan-Indian characters that thrive on jokes. Various characters selectively exhibit different aspects of Heyoka and Nanabhozo in the novel: Lipsha complains of his head being ‚Äúscrewed on backwards,‚ÄùErdrich, Louise. \\"Love Medicine\\" Holt, Rinehart, & Winston, 1984, pp.212 in response to a startling revelation from his grandmother, while Marie employs trickery and dark, aggressive wit to survive in the convent. Gleason argues that laughter isn‚Äôt simply a product of Indigenous longevity in Love Medicine, but rather a key component of it.  Home and Belonging  Noting how Love Medicine ends with the word ‚Äúhome,‚Äù and how every character in the novel has a different idea of what home is, Robert Silberman argues that ‚Äúhome [‚Ä¶] is an embattled concept, as ambiguous as June Kashpaw‚Äôs motives in attempting her return;‚ÄùSilberman, Robert. \\"Opening the Text: Love Medicine and the Return of the Native American Woman\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 136-154 June‚Äôs interrupted homecoming is the subtext that haunts the entirety of the novel; simultaneously, her family members each express a desire for a home of their own. While homecoming is a common theme in Native American literatures, Silberman notes that the way Love Medicine engages with the subject evades easy classification, since home represents freedom for some, but entrapment for others. In his essay, Greg Sarris superimposes such ambiguity and anxiety surrounding homecoming onto moments of his own personal life to explore a possible reading of text that transcends Native borders.Sarris, Greg. \\"Reading Louise Erdrich: Love Medicine as Home Medicine\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 179-210 Unlike Catherine Rainwater, who views the experience of reading Love Medicine as a kind of permanent unhoming arising out of irresolvable conflicts between opposing codes, Sarris focuses on Albertine‚Äôs return to the reservation and Lipsha‚Äôs return to his familial roots to illustrate how his own personal relationship with home is simultaneously made universal and particular through an encounter with text.  Style  Considerable attention has been devoted to the varied genres and forms that Erdrich employs in Love Medicine, and how they interact with each other.Sands, Kathleen M. \\"'Love Medicine': Voices and Margins\\" 'Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 35-42Wong, Hertha D. Sweet. \\"Louise Erdrich's 'Love Medicine': Narrative Communities and the Short Story Cycle\\" 'Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 85-106Jaskoski, Helen. \\"From the Time Immemorial: Native American Traditions in Contemporary Short Fiction,\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 27-34 Kathleen Sands describes Love Medicine as a metafictional novel that consists of ‚Äúhard edges, multiple voices, disjointed episodes, erratic tone shifts [‚Ä¶] incomplete memories‚Äù that are spliced together in a self- reflexive manner. According to Sands, the novel is concerned as much with the process of storytelling as with the story itself. Hertha D. Sweet Wong, on the other hand, questions whether Love Medicine can be considered a novel at all. Instead, Wong quotes Robert Luscher‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúthe short story sequence‚Äù: ‚Äúa volume of stories, collected and organized by their author, in which the reader successively realizes underlying patterns of coherence.‚Äù Yet, Wong argues, even that definition fails to adequately capture the inherent nonlinearity of Native American narratives, which are often multivocal and achronological. Consequently, Wong arrives at a description of Love Medicine as a ‚Äúweb‚Äù of short stories that is ‚Äúinformed by both modernist literary strategies (for instance, multiple narrative voices) and oral traditions(such as a storyteller‚Äôs use or repetition, recurrent development, and associational structure).‚Äù  Oral Form  Hertha D. Sweet Wong points to Erdrich's simulation of Indigenous oral forms in her short story \\"webs\\" as a key narrative innovation. Wong argues that the egalitarian pluralism that is embedded in Native American oral traditions offers new artistic possibilities for writers of multivocal narratives; what was experienced, under conventional post-modern explanations, as an alienation from both self and society, and the indeterminacy of language, can now be reimagined as a vivacious expression multivocal unity. Kathleen Sands further refines critical understanding of the oral form in Love Medicine as a competition between personal narratives: no one voice demonstrates a privileged relationship with the truth, and readers can only catch a glimpse of the real story by ‚Äúpuzzling right along with them [the personal narratives] to the end.‚ÄùSands, Kathleen M. \\"Love Medicine: Voices and Margins\\" 'Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 35-42 Sands writes, ‚Äúthe source of her [Erdrich‚Äôs] story telling technique is the secular anecdotal narrative process of community gossip, the storytelling sanction toward proper behavior that works so effectively in Indian communities to identify membership in the group and ensure survival of group values and its valued individuals [‚Ä¶] Gossip affirms identity, provides information, and binds the absent to the family and the community.‚Äù On a contrasting note, citing a bias towards culturalism in the textual critiques of Hertha Sweet Wong and Paula Gunn Allen, Ojibwe writer and literary critic David Treuer cautions against imposing unqualified notions of Native American \\"polyvocality\\" and narrative egalitarianism on the text of Love Medicine. Treuer argues that the what readers experience as \\"polyvocality\\" is actually a proliferation of personal symbols, and that on the level of language, all the narrators of Love Medicine, in fact, inhabit the same consciousness. Treuer points to a tension between the \\"language of event,\\" marked by stark naturalism, and the \\"language of thought,\\" marked by rich symbolism and metaphors, and how all the chapters of Love Medicine \\"use a mixture of fact and fancy, a mixture of the figure and the figurative, to create its tensions and to resolve them.\\" Thus, according to Treuer, Love Medicine is a product of literary techniques that derive predominantly from Western Fiction. Examining the opening chapter of Love Medicine, Treuer notes that beyond surface similarities, there is little that ties the text to well known Ojibwe Wenabozaho narratives. Treuer takes pain to note that he is not advocating for an understanding of Love Medicine that is devoid of Indigenous cultural context; to the contrary, Treuer argues, Erdrich's genius is in summoning an \\"idea of [Ojibwe] culture,\\" and expressing Indigenous yearning for such culture, in a literary environment that is not its own.  Genres and Literary Traditions  For Helen Jaskoski, the ‚ÄúSaint Marie‚Äù chapter is notable for its reflexive use of Ojibwe Windigo stories to subvert a complex of European romance and fairytale allusions. An embodiment of winter starvation, the Windigo can take possession of human souls and cause cannibalistic cravings. In many stories the ‚ÄúWindigo meets defeat at the hands of a child [‚Ä¶] who must become the Windigo herself in order to defeat the monster.‚Äù Jaskoski points to several passages of ‚ÄúSaint Marie‚Äù where Marie demonstrates childlike intimacy with a supernatural being reminiscent of the Windigo, who is then metaphorically linked to Satan. Fittingly, in effort to counter Marie‚Äôs intimacy with the devil, Sister Leopolda is seen variously hurling her \\"lance\\" and attempting to kick Marie into an oven, actions that, according to Jaskoski, are reminiscent of chivalric legend and fairytales such as ‚ÄúHansel and Gretel,‚Äù respectively. When Marie enters the convent, Jaskoski argues, she is the child that becomes the Windigo herself. She achieves symbolic victory over sister Leopolda when she catches a sense of the pitiful person at the core of Leopolda‚Äôs persona, much like when the vanquishing heroines of Windigo stories discover a person hidden inside the monster‚Äôs icy shell. Robert Silberman redirects critique of Love Medicine back to Western Literary traditions, noting that at the end of the day, Love Medicine is printed and marketed as a novel. He writes: \\"the return to the literary is inevitable.\\" Silberman and Catherine Rainwater both discuss how Love Medicine rises out of the Western family saga, and remains heavily indebted to its conventions. Silberman goes a step further and argues that the realism and naturalness of Erdrich‚Äôs characters, as evinced in their colloquialisms and in their first-person present tense narrations, is ‚Äúas much a construction as the skill at creating a convincing voice that led Hemingway to see in Twain‚Äôs Huckleberry Finn the start of a genuine American literary tradition - an antiliterary, seemingly informal American style.‚Äù Erdrich‚Äôs ‚Äúliterary antinomianism‚Äù has no shortage of precedents, Silberman claims, from Faulkner to Raymond Carver.  Interpretative Duality  James Ruppert and Catherine Rainwater argue that Native forms and Western Literary conventions bring with them opposing codes that make two entirely different interpretations of the same text possible.Ruppert, James. \\"Celebrating Culture: Love Medicine\\" Love Medicine A Casebook, edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp 67-84 Ruppert and Rainwater cite multiple such examples: for example, it is entirely possible to read Henry Lamartine‚Äôs story as either a tragic story about a soldier suffering from PTSD or a moral story about an Ojibwe warrior who is unable to escape the ghosts of his vanquished enemies. Likewise, Rainwater argues, Gordie‚Äôs encounter with June‚Äôs ghost is either a drunken hallucination or a metamorphosis of June‚Äôs spirit that forces Gordie to confront his past abuses. In Rainwater‚Äôs words, this in-between position requires that the reader ‚Äúconsider perceptual frameworks as the important structural principle in both textual and non-textual realms.‚Äù  Structure  Regardless of differences in critical and theoretical approaches, many scholars such as Wong, Ownes, and Rainwater agree that there exists an underlying structure that link Love Medicine's stories together. On an intratextual level, Wong states, there exist many connective devices, from recurring symbolism to coinciding paths. Hertha D. Sweet Wong points out the loosely chiasmic structure of Love Medicine, where symmetrically positioned chapters mirror each other on subject matter. Wong, along with Owens, also notes that on an intertextual level, Love Medicine represents one component of a series of narrative sequences in the Love Medicine Sequence, with each narrative sequence being assigned its own natural element as a dominant image: Water (Love Medicine), Air (The Beet Queen), Earth (Tracks), and Fire (The Bingo Palace). This thematic scheme has been explained by Erdrich herself in multiple interviews.  Background  While she was enrolled as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, Erdrich penned several short stories and poems and submitted them to publishers. Two of the stories that she penned, titled \\"Scales\\" and \\"The Red Convertible\\", later became chapters of Love Medicine. After sending both stories off to publishers, she and her then- husband, Michael Dorris, discussed merging and expanding upon those two stories which resulted in \\"The World's Greatest Fisherman\\", the opening chapter of Love Medicine. \\"The World's Greatest Fisherman\\" proceeded to win the Chicago Tribune's Nelson Algren Fiction Award. Erdrich and Dorris subsequently discussed expanding upon the characters of Nector, Marie, and Lulu. The short story \\"Scales\\", in particular, was inspired by her experience working as a weigher of commercial trucks. In several interviews, Erdrich and her then-husband described their creative relationship as one of primary writer (Erdrich) and editor/contributing writer (Dorris).  Publication History  Critics such as Lorena Stookey have commented on Erdrich's unique view of publication as a means of providing the writer with \\"temporary storage,\\" instead of a \\"final word.\\"Stookey, Lorena Laura. Louise Erdrich : A Critical Companion. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999. pp. 29-31 Erdrich has issued two major revisions of Love Medicine: one in 1993 and another 2009. The 1993 edition expanded upon the initial publication with four new chapters and a new section within the chapter entitled \\"The Beads.\\" Erdrich also made revisions to her language in response to reader reactions to the sexual encounter in \\"Wild Geese.\\" For the 25th anniversary edition, Erdrich decided to remove two chapters: \\"Lyman's Luck\\" and \\"The Tomahawk Factory.\\" In the author's note, Erdrich reasoned that the two stories \\"interrupted the flow\\" of the final pages of the novel.  Reception  Love Medicine has received a handful of awards since it was first published in 1984.Wong, Hertha. \\"Introduction,\\" Louise Erdrich‚Äôs Love Medicine: A Casebook, Edited by Hertha D. Sweet Wong. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2000 pp. 3-10 Kurup and Wagner-Martin state that Love Medicine \\"catapulted [Erdrich] to the front of what Kenneth Lincoln describes as the 'Native American Renaissance' [...] Lincoln [...] suggested that she stands alongside the greats of American letters.\\" In 1984, Love Medicine received the National Book Critics Circle Award for the best work of fiction, the Susan Kaufman Award for best first fiction from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and the Virginia McCormick Scully Award. In the following year, it went on to receive the LA Times Award for Fiction, the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation and the Great Lakes Association Award for best work of fiction. Marco Potales of the NY Times praised the book, stating \\"[...] this is a notable, impressive book of first fiction: the unique evocation of a culture in severe social ruin, yet still aglow with the privilege and power of access to the spirit-world.\\"  Further reading  * Maristuen-Rodakowski, Julie et al.

When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened fire with a semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had died by suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom.

A search of the backpack later recovered duct tape, handcuffs, knives, a stun gun, rope, scissors, massage oil, sex toys, and numerous rounds of ammunition, but no explosives.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" A sixteen-year- old student named Katrina Keller reportedly saw Morrison entering the school before the time specified by police. She stated that she had been walking past a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, apparently angry. Keller did not report the incident to the school office. Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow Jeep in the school parking lot at around 10:45 a.m., almost an hour before he entered the school. Morrison was believed to have been living in the car, camping out near Bailey. Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes, mingling with students as classes changed, 35 minutes before the siege began. Earlier, Morrison had spoken to a male high school student that day and \\"asked about the identity of a list of female students.\\" Morrison entered a classroom on the second floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith asked him what he was doing in the classroom, he pulled out his handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\"\\"Platte Canyon High School Shooting: After Action Report\\" Dead link Park County sheriff Fred Wegener (whose son was in the school building at the time of the incident) informed the media that all seven girls were molested, though he did not know \\"how much or to what degree.\\" Lynna Long, a 15-year-old sophomore and one of the seven hostages, stated that Morrison lined the girls up facing a chalkboard and then sexually assaulted all of them; Long stated that she knew that the other hostages were being molested because of \\"the rustling of clothes and elastic being snapped and zippers being opened and closed.\\" During the sexual assaults, Morrison reportedly held his gun to the hostages' heads and threatened to kill them if they did not cooperate. According to the first hostage released, Morrison would systematically take individual hostages from the blackboard and further into the interior of the classroom before sexually assaulting them.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" Negotiations and evacuations A \\"code white\\" alert was sounded over the intercom and students were instructed to remain in their classrooms. Negotiations with Morrison began with the goal of allowing the six remaining hostages in the room to be released. Initially, he directly spoke to deputies in the hallway while holding one of the hostages at gunpoint, but later spoke via telephone and used the student hostages as relayers between the negotiators and himself, as he did not want to speak directly with officials. After four of the six girls were released between the hours of 12:35 p.m. and 1:45 p.m.,\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" negotiators heightened the intensity of their indirect discussions with Morrison. During this time, 16-year-old junior Emily Keyes, one of the two remaining hostages, managed to send her family a brief text message stating, \\"I love u guys\\" in response to a text message (\\"R U OK?\\") her father, John-Michael Keyes, had sent using his cell phone after receiving word that an incident was occurring at the high school. When Keyes' father sent the message \\"Where are you?\\", he received no response. A total of 800 students from both Platte Canyon High School and the nearby Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request for the police to back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.

Ambulances parked in the end zone of the high school's football field. A 4-mile (6 km) stretch of U.S. Route 285 was closed. At approximately 3:32 p.m., negotiations began to stall.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" Morrison later explicitly stated that he would stop negotiating at 4:00 p.m. Wegener said that police had chosen to storm the second-floor classroom after the man ended negotiations, stating that \\"something would happen at 4 p.m.\\" SWAT team members witnessed Morrison assaulting the girls, and Wegener made the decision to save the hostages by force, stating later, \\"My decision was either wait--[and have the] possibility of having two dead hostages or act and try to save what I feared he would do to them. ... Because I'd want whoever was in my position to do the same thing, and that is to save lives.\\" The police burst through the door at approximately 3:45 p.m. and encountered Morrison and the hostages behind a barricade of desks at a far wall.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\"\\"Platte Canyon High School Shooting: After Action Report\\" After using the hostages as human shields against the Jefferson County SWAT team, Morrison shot at the policemen, and then at Emily Keyes, who was trying to run. Morrison shot and critically wounded himself soon thereafter, simultaneously being shot by police, and died at the scene at 3:57 p.m.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\"\\"Platte Canyon High School Shooting: After Action Report\\" Keyes was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Denver, where she was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. The other hostage survived with no physical injuries. Investigators found no sign of explosives in the man's backpack, but three additional firearms were recovered outside the school campus: a Colt AR-15 rifle found in a clearing adjacent to a river about a mile north of the school, a Browning A-Bolt .270 bolt-action rifle found north of the campus near U.S. Route 285, and a Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver found south of the school near a hiking trail.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, confirmed that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non- fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) was still in the second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.  Perpetrator  Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 ‚Äì September 27, 2006) was eventually identified as the perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed at the time of the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\" Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 53-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.\\"Shooter's letter recounted childhood abuse\\" On August 15, 2006, about one month prior to the shooting, he pleaded guilty to harassment after leaving a voice message to a local Harley- Davidson dealership on November 22, 2004, after receiving a promotional catalog in his mail; the message contained profanities and a threat to visit their headquarters with an assault rifle. Prior to that, he phoned a similar threatening call. An investigation found that Morrison had purchased a motorcycle from the dealership, but became \\"extremely dissatisfied\\" after not receiving certain aftermarket accessories and services promised in his contract, and the dealership reportedly never made any attempt to resolve the dispute. His suicide letter later mentioned the purchase, in which he vaguely claimed that \\"the matter wasn't over\\". On May 31, 2005, Morrison filed a report claiming that fifteen of his firearms were stolen from his residence, and later gained $10,000 from a fictitious insurance claim initiated after the stolen firearms report. Four of the firearms mentioned in his report were among those recovered on or around the school campus; the whereabouts of the remaining 11 firearms currently remain unknown.\\"Emily Keyes Autopsy Report\\"  Aftermath  Platte Canyon High School reopened a week after the shooting on October 5. Memorials had been erected along the highway leading to the school that carried messages such as \\"Be Strong\\" and \\"Random Acts of Kindness\\". A number of students prayed in front of the school before the day began and students were given donated teddy bears as they left. Fifty counselors were present during the day for students. Superintendent Dr. James Walpole noted that of 460 high school students, only 10 were absent. The service for Emily Keyes was held on September 30, the day that Governor Bill Owens later declared \\"Emily Keyes Day\\". About 5,000 motorcyclists took part in the \\"Columbine to Canyon Ride\\", which occurred in memory of the victims of both the Columbine and Platte Canyon shootings. The procession of motorcycles was so long that the first to get to Platte Canyon High School arrived as the final motorcyclists departed from Columbine High School, two riding alongside each other. The efforts initiated toward increased school security had come to a standstill several years after the Columbine High School massacre as federal and state funding toward safety was cut in favor of higher test scores. Although an increase in communication with law enforcement was evident in the Platte Canyon High School shooting, Del Elliot of the University of Colorado noted that \\"[the vast majority of school districts] are so totally absorbed with CSAP and academic requirements that they aren't spending a lot of time and resources on this issue\\". By October 11, investigators had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 pieces of evidence related to the case. They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred five days after the shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular suggestion was outside the current budget.

The plantation is an active farm and was tended perhaps from 1607 on, and more clearly from 1614 on, so it is one of the longest-running agricultural enterprises in the United States. It has an unusual brick mansion in style of Palladio's \\"Roman Country House\\" completed in the 1760s, and was perhaps designed by Thomas Jefferson. It was established in 1616 by Captain John Martin, one of the original leaders of the Virginia Colony at Jamestown in 1607. The plantation was owned by the Harrison family for over two centuries, from 1700-1926\\\\. Restored by Robert Williams Daniel in the early 20th century, it is both a National Historical Landmark open to tours and one of America's oldest continuous farming operations. History Brandon Plantation was part of a 1616 land grant of approximately on the south bank of the James River to Captain John Martin (1560-1632). Captain Martin was one of the original colonists and a member of the first Council in the spring of 1607, when Jamestown was first established. Martin's new plantation built on the 1616 land grant was initially named \\"Martin's Brandon\\", apparently incorporating the family name of his wife, Mary Martin (n√©e Brandon), daughter of Robert Brandon, a prominent English goldsmith and supplier to Queen Elizabeth I of England. They had been married in 1586. In 1619, Martin's Brandon was one of the plantations represented when what became the House of Burgesses, the first representative legislative body in the English colonies, met at Jamestown. The representatives of Martin's Brandon were Thomas Davis and Robert Stacy. During the Indian Massacre of 1622 which occurred on Good Friday, March 22, 1622, there were 7 deaths recorded at Martin's Brandon, including one woman and two boys. 347 deaths were recorded during the coordinated attacks along both shores of the James River, from the mouth of the river at Newport News Point on Hampton Roads, west to Falling Creek. Captain John Martin died at Martin's Brandon Plantation in 1632. His grandson, Captain Robert Bargrave, inherited the plantation on Martin's death. In 1637, merchants John Sadler and Richard Quiney and mariner William Barker, who patented the nearby Merchant's Hope plantation, bought Martin's Brandon. They and their heirs farmed it successfully until 1720 when it was sold to Nathaniel Harrison (1677-1727). After Nathaniel's premature death in 1727, it passed to his son Nathaniel Harrison II (1703-1791) who built the current manor house around 1765. Brandon then came into the possession of American Revolutionary War Colonel Benjamin Harrison (1743-1807). At his death, the property was divided between his two sons, and Upper Brandon Plantation was created. 1898 postcard In 1824 tax records show that Brandon had 93 slaves and Upper Brandon had 94. Brandon Plantation (aka Lower Brandon) remained in the Harrison family until 1926, when it was acquired by Robert Williams Daniel, a Richmond banker. The Daniels undertook the restoration of the house and grounds and purchased several adjacent tracts of land that were part of the original land grant that had been separated from the estate over the previous three centuries. U.S. Congressman Robert W. Daniel, Jr. (1936-2012) inherited the property from his parents. Brandon was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and was further declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1985. and (at Virginia DHR, includes map of the plantation) The restored manor house was, furnished by the Daniels with 1760s era English and American furnishings. Brandon is still a working farm and the agricultural enterprise is one of the oldest continuous farming operations in the United States. The 4487.5-acre property was sold at auction by the estate of Robert W. Daniel, Jr., on 23 June 2013. In late 2013 the purchase contract with the buyer fell through and the estate was put back on the market with an asking price of $20 million. Midway through 2014, a Florida family purchased it for $17.8 million; soon after acquiring it, the new owners announced their intention to continue the agricultural operation and to occupy the historic manor house for part of the year.

He played college baseball at the University of Southern California and later played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from to . During Sutherland‚Äôs big league career, while principally a second baseman (717 games), he also played shortstop (164 games). Sutherland compiled a .243 batting average, but became known for his finesse in turning the double play. Sutherland led all National League (NL) second basemen with 110 double plays turned during the 1969 season. In 1969, he also scored the first run in franchise history for the Montreal Expos and recorded the first putout in a regular season MLB game ever played in Canada. Sutherland's career included stints with the Philadelphia Phillies (1966‚Äì68), Montreal Expos (1969‚Äì71), Houston Astros (1972‚Äì73), Detroit Tigers (1974‚Äì76), Milwaukee Brewers (1976), San Diego Padres (1977), and St. Louis Cardinals (1978). Early years Sutherland was born in Glendale, California, in 1944. His father, Ralph Sutherland, was a left-handed pitcher in minor league baseball in the 1930s and 1940s. His older brother, Darrell Sutherland, was a right-handed pitcher for the New York Mets from 1964 to 1966. Sutherland attended Glendale High School and the University of Southern California. He played college baseball and was selected as an All- American while playing for the USC Trojans baseball team under head coach Rod Dedeaux. In October 1964, Sutherland played on the American team during a 20-game baseball exhibition at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Professional baseball Minor leagues In November 1964, after completing his sophomore year at the University of Southern California, Sutherland was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies to a bonus contract as an amateur free agent. He began his professional baseball career in 1965 at age 20 with the Chattanooga Lookouts in the Southern League. He appeared in 141 games for Chattanooga in 1965, compiling a .285 batting average, and was promoted in 1966 to the San Diego Padres, then of the Pacific Coast League, in 1966. He appeared in 140 games for the Padres and compiled a .254 batting average. Philadelphia Phillies Sutherland made his major league debut with the Phillies on September 17, 1966, at age 21. He appeared in three games for the Phillies at the end of the 1966 season and had no hits in three at bats. In the spring of 1967, Sutherland impressed Philadelphia manager Gene Mauch and began the 1967 season as a left fielder, appearing in 25 games at the position. In the early weeks of his rookie season, Sutherland performed well at the plate, compiling 11 hits in 19 at bats during one stretch in May 1967. On April 30, 1967, he had a pinch-hit double in the ninth inning to drive in the game-winning runs against the Atlanta Braves. By late May 1967, he led the Phillies with a .407 batting average. Sutherland remained with the Phillies throughout the 1967 season, but moved to shortstop, playing 66 games at the position as a substitute for the Phillies' regular shortstop, Bobby Wine. Sutherland's torrid hitting in the first weeks of the 1967 season subsided, as he compiled a .247 batting average in 231 at bats during his rookie season. After the 1967 season, the Phillies sent Sutherland to the Florida Instructional League in an effort to convert him into a catcher. In December 1967, The Sporting News described the strategy in shifting Sutherland to catcher: \\"Sutherland isn't a capable enough gloveman to handle the shortstop job on a big league club on a regular basis and he isn't enough of a slugger to become a full-time outfielder, but he does everything fairly well and could well enjoy a long tenure with the Phillies as a utilityman.\\" In 1968, Sutherland saw limited playing time as a utility player with the Phillies, appearing in 17 games at second base, 10 at shortstop, 10 at third base, five in right field and two in left field. He did not appear in any games at the catcher position. After receiving regular playing time at second base at the end of the 1968 season, following an injury to Cookie Rojas, Sutherland had 12 hits in 17 at bats over five games to raise his batting average from .224 to .290. He also compiled five game-winning hits in his 138 at bats in 1968. Montreal Expos In October 1968, Sutherland was drafted by the Montreal Expos as the eighth pick in the 1968 expansion draft. In the Expos' inaugural season, Sutherland became the team's starting second baseman, appearing in 139 games at the position, while compiling a .239 batting average. On April 8, 1969, Sutherland scored the first run in the Expos' franchise history, on a Bob Bailey double in the first inning of the Expos' inaugural game, an 11‚Äì10 victory over the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. He also recorded the first putout in a major league regular season game in Canada on April 14, 1969, off Lou Brock's line drive in the Expos' first home game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Jarry Park. Sutherland continued as the Expos' starting second baseman in 1970, appearing in 97 games at the position while his batting average dropped to .207. Despite the decline in batting average, manager Gene Mauch continued to express confidence in Sutherland. The Sporting News in October 1970 wrote that Sutherland showed \\"no signs of giving up despite two frustrating seasons,\\" and the paper noted that he turned double plays \\"with great finesse\\" and was \\"one of the toughest men in the National League to strike out,\\" but \\"his soft liners usually drop comfortably in an outfielder's hands.\\" In 1971, Ron Hunt took over as the Expos' starting second baseman with Sutherland splitting his time between second base (56 games) and shortstop (46 games). Houston Astros Sutherland spent most of the 1972 season playing in the minor leagues for the Oklahoma City 89ers (79 games) and the Peninsula Whips (53 games). In June 1972, Sutherland was traded by the Expos to the Houston Astros, but he appeared in only five games for the Astros during the 1972 season. In 1973, with Tommy Helms remaining the Astros' starting second baseman, Sutherland appeared in only 16 games for Houston. He again spent most of the 1973 season in the minor leagues, appearing in 134 games for the Denver Bears of the American Association. Detroit Tigers In December 1973, Sutherland was traded by the Astros with Jim Ray to the Detroit Tigers for Fred Scherman and cash. At the time of the trade, Detroit scout Jack Tighe opined, \\"Sutherland makes the double play as good as anyone who ever played. And that includes Bill Mazeroski and Frankie Frisch and all the rest.\\" Sutherland became the Tigers' starting second baseman in 1974 and began the season with a renewed strength at the plate, batting .417 early in the season. Sutherland finished the 1974 season with a .254 batting average and recorded career highs with 149 games played, 337 putouts, 652 plate appearances, 619 at bats, 157 hits, and 49 RBIs. He ranked third in the American League in at bats and led the Tigers in hits. He also led the American League with 489 outs in 1974. Sutherland credited his defensive improvement in 1974 to having played every day in the minors for the previous two years: \\"Fielding in the minor leagues is just like fielding in the majors. You still have to catch the ball and throw it.\\" Sutherland remained the Tigers' starting second baseman in 1975, appearing in 128 games at second base and ranking second in the American League with 21 errors at the position. He compiled a .258 batting average in 1975. During the 1975 season, Sutherland began experiencing dizziness, and doctors suspected that he may suffer from borderline diabetes. Midway through the season, he began an unusual diet in which he was required to eat peanut butter, soda crackers, and raisins three times a day. 1976 to 1978 seasons Between April 1976 and May 1978, Sutherland played for four major league clubs. He began the 1976 season with the Tigers, appearing in 42 games at second base. In June 1976, he was traded by the Tigers to the Milwaukee Brewers for Pedro Garc√≠a. Sutherland appeared in 45 games at second base for the Brewers, compiling a .217 batting average. He was released by the Brewers in February 1977. In April 1977, Sutherland signed as a free agent with the San Diego Padres, appearing in 30 games at second base and 21 games at third base. He compiled a .243 batting average and was released by the Padres in December 1977. In January 1978, Sutherland was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a free agent. He appeared in only 10 games for the Cardinals and compiled a .167 batting average in six at bats. He appeared in his final major league game on May 19, 1978, and was released by the Cardinals on May 26, 1978. Career totals In 13 major league seasons, Sutherland played in 1,031 games, compiled a .243 batting average, .291 on- base percentage, 239 RBIs, and 754 hits (including 109 doubles, 10 triples, and 24 home runs), scored 308 runs, and drew 207 bases on balls. Later years After retiring as a player, Sutherland continued to remain involved in professional baseball as a scout and administrator. From 1999 to 2011, he served as special assistant to the general manager of the Los Angeles Angels. Sutherland was responsible for coordinating the Angels' scouting organization.

Set in late 15th-century England, the episode takes a humorous look at rivalries with the Kingdom of Scotland and centres the dramatic tension on the doubts cast over parentage of the lead character, Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh. Although \\"Born to Be King\\" was originally broadcast as episode 2 of the series, on later broadcasts and 2009 DVD releases it has been switched with episode 4, \\"The Queen of Spain's Beard\\".  Plot  Alnwick Castle, used for location filming as King Richard's castle The story begins in 1486. The episode opens as King Richard IV departs on a Crusade against the Turks, leaving his elder son Prince Harry to rule as regent. The King's younger son, Prince Edmund, encouraged by his sidekick Baldrick, considers the opportunity to take control of the kingdom. As it turns out, Prince Harry takes most of the power and leaves Edmund to do the duties that remain: namely herding sheep and cleaning out the drains. A year later, Harry plans a feast to celebrate Richard's impending return and entrusts Edmund with arranging the entertainments. Edmund grows increasingly frustrated, as the traditional troupe of eunuchs cancel their participation and he has to consider acts he considers pathetic like Morris dancers, a bear baiter, a flock of chickens which lays eggs, and an act entitled \\"The Jumping Jews of Jerusalem\\". King Richard's military commander from Scotland, Dougal MacAngus, arrives for the feast and mistakes Edmund for a eunuch. Edmund's bad mood worsens when MacAngus asks for land in Scotland as a reward for his service, the Royal burghs of Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles. Ignoring the fact that these lands are possessed by Edmund, Prince Harry grants them to MacAngus, and a furious Edmund plots with Baldrick and Percy to kill MacAngus. After ignoring Baldrick's \\"cunning plan\\" to use a cannon, Edmund decides to try something more subtle. He finds MacAngus hunting in the forest and offers him a part in a play that is being staged at the castle that night as part of the St Leonard's Day (6 November) festivities. The Death of the Pharaoh is hastily re-scripted as The Death of the Scotsman. Edmund replaces the actors' fake knives with real ones, intending to have them kill MacAngus onstage. When MacAngus reveals he has information that throws the legitimacy of Prince Harry's claim to the throne in jeopardy, however, Edmund hastily prevents the assassination. Later, Edmund has the chance to examine the letters himself. They are dated 1460, his brother's year of birth, and Edmund concludes that they prove that Harry is an illegitimate child and placing Edmund first in line to the throne of England. Eagerly, Edmund reveals the letters to the Royal court; his illegitimacy being revealed, Harry renounces the regency. As MacAngus claims that Richard IV was last seen entering Constantinople to face 10,000 Turks alone and armed with only a fruit knife, Edmund has himself announced king: \\"The King is probably dead, long live the King!\\" At that moment, however, Richard IV makes a grand entrance, stating that he survived \\"thanks to my trusty fruit knife!\\". Edmund is surprised but tries to show the letters to his father. It is found that the letters date from November‚ÄìDecember 1460, nine months after Harry was born, and nine months before Edmund was born, thus suggesting that Edmund is a bastard. Suddenly faced with losing his royal title, Edmund is quick to claim the letters to be forgeries and burns them out of feigned disgust. In the heat of the moment, Edmund also challenges MacAngus to a duel; MacAngus quickly disarms him with a single blow of the sword, and while MacAngus holds the sword to his neck, Edmund begs for his life, offering everything he had to Dougal. MacAngus pretends at first to be about to strike but then laughs, showing no hard feelings. Soon afterwards, Harry sees Edmund and Dougal keeping company, and believes them to have become firm friends. However, it is shown that Edmund goes through with Baldrick's plan and MacAngus dies in an \\"accident\\" involving a cannon.

Similarities to the pilot episode The plot of Born to Be King contains a large proportion of material which was originally written for the unaired pilot episode in 1982, in which Prince Edmund arranges the festivities for the Queen's birthday and the Scottish hero Dougal McAngus returns to the court and reveals Edmund's illegitimacy. The pilot episode differs from Born to Be King a number of respects: * The pilot episode is set some 100 years later in the 1580s. * The cast includes different actors playing certain roles ‚Äì The King, Prince Harry, and Baldrick are played by John Savident, Robert Bathurst and Philip Fox respectively. Prince Harry is named Prince Henry. * Edmund's character is much more like that of his descendants in the other series: more sarcastic and cruel. By contrast, Baldrick and Prince Henry are much stupider than their counterparts in this episode. * In the pilot, the King is not at the crusades, but at home. * The event being celebrated is the Queen's birthday, rather than the fictional St. Leonard's Day. The pilot also specifies that the reason the Eunuchs will not attend is because Edmund is refusing to pay them, though he still orders them executed anyway. * MacAngus discovers that Edmund's parentage is in doubt at the same time as the rest of the court, rather than knowingly setting him up to reveal it. Edmund himself is also the person who realises the mistake with the birth dates, rather than Prince Henry/Harry having to point it out. * Edmund's plot to kill MacAngus involves a hanging with a fake rope, not a staged stabbing with a real dagger, although the plan backfires in much the same way. * The King remembers Edmund and his name. * Edmund is Duke of York rather than Duke of Edinburgh. * Edmund and MacAngus have the duel, rather than having MacAngus slicing Edmund's sword in half before it could start. Edmund actually wins the duel, but is prevented from killing MacAngus when it turns out that Baldrick gave him a theatrical sword from the play. * Edmund keeps his dignity and composure when begging MacAngus for mercy, delivering his plea through clenched teeth. In Born to be King, he issues his plea in a tearful, snivelling humiliated state. * Prince Edmund resolves his problem after the duel by apparently getting a Frenchman to confess to forging the letters; in Born to be King, Edmund casts the letters into the fire, merely asserting that they are forgeries. References to Shakespeare As with other episodes in this series, the end credits include an acknowledgement of \\"additional dialogue by William Shakespeare\\". The script parodies certain elements of the Shakespeare's plays, notably the plot to assassinate Dougal MacAngus, Duke of Argyll which draws on the plot against Hamlet by Laertes and Claudius, while the use of daggers as a plot device and the presence of a Scottish antagonist character allude to Macbeth. The presentation of an Egyptian mock tragedy in the castle is itself a play within a play, a dramatic device used frequently by Shakespeare; the drama piece has echoes of Anthony and Cleopatra and the players mention the \\"Ides of June\\", a reference to the Ides of March in Julius Caesar.

Simca do Brasil had responded reluctantly to the demand by the Brazilian government of president Juscelino Kubitscheck that every car manufacturer must offer an affordable basic version within their range. The idea was to give as many Brazilians as possible the opportunity to own a car. New incentive, new version In 1965, the Brazilian government created a new public financing tool through its publicly owned bank Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal that would allow Brazilians to finance their vehicle over four years with a monthly interest rate of 1%. This obviously was to attract a new range of clients and Simca do Brasil looked into how to make the Alvorada even cheaper in order to make it attractive for, for example for taxicab drivers. Plastic replaces leather The Simca Profissional appeared in 1965 with three colour options (yellow, green and cream white), no chrome (even the bumpers were painted in dark gray, no trimmings), the already very simple interior of the Alvorada was downscaled further with plastic seat covers and the door covers were dark and naked cardboard screwed onto the metal. But the Profissional was 30% cheaper than its far posher brother, the all chrome and leather Simca Chambord. The production numbers of this version apparently were never documented and, unlike the Simca Alvorada, the Simca Profissional had no distinct range of chassis numbers so that this version is mixed in with the production figures cited for the Simca Chambord.

Biography Schooled in engineering at New York University and in literature and philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin, Woods joined the Paris office of Le Corbusier in 1948. Assigned to the project for the Unit√© d'Habitation, then under construction in Marseille, France, Woods met the Azerbaijan-born Greek architect George Candilis, with whom he would later form a lasting partnership. With Candilis and the engineer Vladimir Bodiansky, Woods designed and built housing throughout North Africa during his tenure as head of the Casablanca office of ATBAT-Afrique (Atelier des B√¢tisseurs). Ideas developed during the course of this work led to a winning proposal for Op√©ration Million, a public housing competition in France, in 1954. Commissioned by the welfare state to design thousands of suburban housing units, Woods and Candilis joined with the Yugoslavian architect Alexis Josic to create in 1956 the firm Candilis-Josic-Woods. Among the firm's major built projects were the extension of the village of Bagnols-sur-C√®ze and the development of the quarter of Le Mirail in Toulouse in France and, with Manfred Schieldhelm, the Free University in Berlin. Simultaneously, Candilis and Woods participated in the proceedings of Team X, a group of architects that emerged from the meetings of CIAM in the postwar years. Woods is perhaps best known as a thinker and writer. He published numerous essays on urban themes, including explanations of his concepts of \\"stem\\" and \\"web\\", and participated in the 1968 Milan Triennale at the invitation of the Italian architect and fellow Team X member Giancarlo de Carlo. After the breakup of the firm in 1969, Woods returned to New York City. He taught at Harvard and Yale universities and lectured widely. Until his untimely death in 1973, he continued to work as an architect and urban planner on such projects as the Lower Manhattan Expressway and the renovation of the SoHo neighborhood. His book The Man in the Street: A Polemic on Urbanism was published posthumously by Penguin in 1975. Woods' architectural drawings and papers are now held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.

This condition occurs frequently in people in the latency period of HIV/AIDS. The lymphatic system is part of the immune surveillance system. Blood contains fluid and blood cells. The fluid, which may contain suspended foreign material such as bacteria and viruses, seeps through blood vessel walls into the tissues, where it bathes the body cells and exchanges substances with them. Some of this lymph fluid is then taken up by lymphatic vessels and passed back to the heart, where it is again mixed with the blood. On its way, the fluid passes through the lymph nodes, small nodular organs located throughout the body but concentrated in certain areas such as the armpits or groin. These lymph nodes are also known as glands or lymphoid tissue. If they detect something foreign passing through them, they enlarge. This is called lymphadenopathy or swollen glands. Usually this is localized (for example, an infected spot on the scalp will cause lymph nodes in the neck on that same side to swell). However, when two or more lymph node groups are involved, it is called generalized lymphadenopathy. Usually this is in response to a significant systemic disease and will subside once the person has recovered. Sometimes it can persist long- term, even when no explanation for the lymphadenopathy can be found. PGL is often found in cases of autoimmune disease (where the body is attacking itself). These include diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and sarcoidosis. Some forms of cancer will also cause PGL. Sometimes, despite exhaustive investigation, no cause for PGL is found. For the patient and the physician, this can continue to be a source of concern, but many adults have had PGL all their lives and suffered no ill effects. In others, the PGL may persist for a decade or more and then mysteriously subside. Children often have generalized lymphadenopathy of the head and neck, or even PGL, without the finding of a sinister cause. At puberty this usually disappears. The immune system of some people may be sensitized by exposure to a living exogenous irritant such as a bacterial or viral infection, which then results in PGL after the organism has been cleared from the body. In some cases the sensitization is caused by non-living exogenous irritants such as cyclic hydrocarbons (for example, resinous vapours) or pesticides and herbicides.

He pitched all or part of ten seasons in Major League Baseball. His debut game took place on July 2, 1910. His final game took place on October 2, 1920. During his early professional career he played for the New York Yankees and Cincinnati Reds. From 1921 to 1958, he coached the University of Michigan Wolverines baseball team, and served as assistant coach for basketball and football. In 1929 and 1932 he took the baseball team to Japan for a month each time at the invitation of Meiji University, where they played several games against Japanese university teams around the nation.  Early life  Nicknamed \\"Pick\\" (short for the freshwater fish pickerel), Fisher's nickname was for years listed in baseball reference books as \\"Chic\\", though Fisher himself stated that this had never been his nickname and that \\"Pick\\" had been used since his days in college. His given name at birth was simply \\"Ray\\". Fisher was an all-around athlete who played football, basketball, baseball, and competed in track events, though his father permitted sports only if the farm work was done. He played on Vermont's 1904 State Championship football team and was offered multiple college scholarships in football, but his real love was baseball. He stayed on in his hometown, attending Middlebury College.Simon, Tom ed. Green Mountain Boys of Summer: Vermonters in the Major Leagues, 1882‚Äì1993. (2000). pp. 86-87. The New England Press, Shelburne, Vermont. .  Professional career   Semi-pro and minor leagues  After stellar performances on the college mound,In his starting game as a pitcher with the Middlebury Panthers (Freshman, 1907), Fisher struck out 18 Colgate batters, which still stands as a single-game record at Middlebury. Fisher came to Middlebury as a catcher, but his coach wanted to try him out as a pitcher. http://www.vermontsportshall.com/2013fisher.html See also http://sites.middlebury.edu/pttp/ray-fisher/ he was offered a position pitching with a semi-pro team in Valleyfield, Quebec in the summer of 1907.Simon. p.87. In 1908 and 1909 he pitched in the minor leagues for Hartford in the Connecticut League, going 12‚Äì1 in his first partial season (batting .304) and 25‚Äì4 the following year with 243 strikeouts.The National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. (1953) The Story of Minor League Baseball. See pp. 262, 345. The Stoneman Press. Fisher jumped at the first major league opportunity to come his way, thinking it might be the only offer he would get, and his contract was sold to the New York Highlanders (Yankees). He soon learned, however, that the New York Giants and Boston Red Sox were also interested in signing him. He reported to the Highlanders in 1910 following his graduation from Middlebury, bringing along‚Äîto the amusement of his new teammates‚Äîhis homemade bat from off the farm.Simon, p. 88. Fisher stated that he had never seen a game of major league baseball until he joined the Highlanders.  New York Yankees  Dubbed the \\"Vermont Schoolmaster\\" because he taught Latin at Newton Academy in New Jersey during his first offseason,Fisher related that he took the position so that he would not have to go home and tell his father he did not have a job.

Fisher was assistant to the athletic director of the Army training camp's athletics program which was run in cooperation with the YMCA. As a rookie, the newspapers were frequently comparing Fisher to Highlander's spitball pitcher Jack Chesbro,Jones. p. 722. \\"He [Fisher] laughs, talks, acts, and pitches with the same motion as the North Adams farmer [Chesbro]. He has a spit ball which, according to Ed Sweeney, is just as dangerous as the one Chesbro exhibited.\\" and early in his tenure with the Yankees Fisher was also cited by Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie as one of the 12 best pitchers in the American League, both players also listing Ed Walsh, Russ Ford, Walter Johnson and Smoky Joe Wood.As reported in the 18 November 1911 Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Tyrus Cobb and Napolean Lajoie, the greatest batsmen in the American League, if not in the country, were recently given twenty four hours to study the work of the American league pitchers and name the best ones as they appear to them. Cobb named as the best 12: Russell Ford, Joe Wood, Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Ed Walsh, Eddie Karger, Bob Groom, Dolly Gray, Vean Gregg, Harry Krause, Ray Fisher and Jimmy Scott. Larry's selections were: Ed Walsh, Walter Johnson, Russell Ford, Jack Coombs, Chief Bender, Eddie Plank, Joe Wood, Barney Pelty, George Mullin, Bill Donovan, Ray Fisher and Frank Lange.\\" One reporter's reaction to Fisher being selected by both heavy hitters was, \\"Fisher is often overlooked when the fans are studying the stars. But he is a star and belongs right in the Ford-Wood-Walsh class. His fastball is a beauty, and he has a curve that few others can boast of.\\" Quoted in Jones, p. 723. His ERA ranked fifth in the league in 1915.Jones. p. 723. Fisher's ERA ranked in the top 20 in his league in five of his ten playing seasons, three of those in the top 10: 1914, 1915, 1919. Fisher ranks 9th among Yankees in ERA and 20th in Innings Pitched. See and For a recent rating of Fisher's performance with the Yankees, see Fisher was known for his stamina as a pitcher, considered a \\"workhorse\\" for the Yankees,Jones. p. 723. but the following year, 1916, a bout of pleurisy resulted in crippling his effectiveness. (Doctors later thought that Fisher had probably had tuberculosis.)Jones. p. 723. From 1911 to 1915, during the offseason, Fisher was also employed as Middlebury College's first \\"Physical Director\\".Simon., pp. 90-91\\"In 1910, [President] Thomas convinced the board to appoint an athletic director, and he found the man he wanted- Ray Fisher '10, a local farmboy whose strong right arm had made him an outstanding baseball pitcher at Middlebury (and would later see him through ten creditable years in the big leagues).\\" Stameshkin, David M. The Town's College: Middlebury College, 1800-1915. (1985). Middlebury College Press, Middlebury, Vermont. p.268. In 1915 he was hired as athletic director at Sewanee: The University of the South, in which capacity he coached the baseball and basketball teams, and assisted with the football team. However, he soon had to resign due to the prolonged illness of his mother.  Cincinnati Reds  About the time of his discharge from the Army, Fisher was selected off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds, taking a $3,100 cut in pay from his $6,700 with the Yankees.Jones. p. 723. The Yankees may have let Fisher go due to the effects of his pleurisy, but his year in the Army had given him time to build up his strength.Jones. p. 723. Pat Moran, Fisher's manager at Cincinnati noted that, \\"Fisher's speed is fine, his curves are all that could be desired. But, beyond all is his headwork. Fisher knows a lot of baseball, far more than the average pitcher.\\"Jones. p. 723. Fisher pitched for the Reds in 1919 and 1920. He went 14‚Äì5 in 1919 and pitched Game 3 in the infamous 1919 World Series, a game in which the Reds were shut out by Chicago's Dickie Kerr., In one segment Kerr (L) and Fisher (R) can be seen shaking hands prior to Game 3.Proctor, Donald J. Ann Arbor Scene Magazine. Summer 1980, Fall 1980. \\"Ray L. Fisher: Michigan's Captive Coach\\". See Summer issue p. 34. In the spring of 1920 the American and National Leagues agreed to outlaw use of the spitball, though 22 spitball pitchers were exempted from the ban for the season. The following year a permanent ban went into effect, with 17 pitchers \\"grandfathered\\" for the remainder of their pitching careers. Though he had largely discontinued use of the spitter by 1914,Jones. p. 722. Fisher told umpire and Harper's Weekly columnist Billy Evans in 1914 that he feared the spitball would cause the premature loss of his pitching arm: \\"I quit the spit- ball before the spit-ball made me quit. When I stopped using that style of delivery, I had not suffered any inconvenience because of its use. I knew a number of other pitchers who had been put out of business by it. I figured that I was only human and that it would get me sooner or later, if I persisted in its use. I made up my mind to try to get by with the old style assortment. I am succeeding pretty well, and I feel positive I have prolonged my career as a pitcher a number of years.\\" Harper's Weekley, 13 June 1914. Fisher was one of those allowed to continue to use the pitch.See Faber, Charles F. and Faber, Richard B. (2006) Spitballers: The Last Legal Hurlers of the Wet One. pp. 129-136. McFarland & Co.  \\"Lifetime\\" ban  Fisher is one of the few players to be re-instated into professional baseball after being banned for life.See Proctor for a detailed study of Fisher's blacklisting Prior to the 1921 season, the Reds offered him a contract in which his salary was $1,000 less than that of the previous season.Proctor. Summer 1980. p. 36. After making his objections known in a letter to Reds president August Herrmann, Fisher signed the contract. Before the season began, however, Fisher learned that the position of head baseball coach had again become available at the University of Michigan, a position for which he had belatedly applied the previous year on the recommendation of Branch Rickey.Proctor. Summer 1980. pp. 36-37. See also Quoting Fred Wilpon, \\"And when [Rickey] was leaving [University of Michigan], he recommended Ray Fisher, who was the coach for (38) years. [Rickey] liked Ray Fisher a lot, and he was my coach. I liked him a lot, too, and all of our players loved Ray Fisher. Mr. Rickey also had a real affinity for Michigan.\\" Fisher requested, and was apparently given by manager Pat Moran, permission to go and look into the job.Cincinnati Inquirer, 6 April 1921: \\"Fisher received a wire this morning from the Athletic Director at Ann Arbor asking him to come up there for a conference in regards to terms. He requested permission from Moran and asked if he could obtain his release from the Cincinnati club. Pat told him that he had no authority to give releases, but would allow him to go to Michigan to look the ground over. Fisher will leave Indianapolis tomorrow night for Ann Arbor and may not return. If the outlook and the terms are satisfactory he probably will decide to take up college work at once and give up professional baseball. He is in the best condition of any of the Red right-handers and has shown the best form in the exhibition games played to date, so his loss will be felt if he decides to leave the team.\\" Fisher's wife, Middlebury native Alice Seeley, had given birth to their only child in 1919, and Alice was urging Ray to settle into a job that would involve less travel away from home. Proctor, Summer 1980, p. 32. When he was offered the position at Michigan, the Reds' management tried to induce Fisher to remain with the team by offering to restore the $1,000 cut from the previous year's contract.Proctor. Summer 1980. p. 38. Fisher countered the offer, asking for a two or three year contract. He stated years later that he was not really intending to take such an offer but was interested in what Herrmann's response would be. According to Fisher, Herrmann's reply was that surely Fisher would not want a multi-year contract if he were to become too old to pitch. (At the time Fisher was 33.) Fisher thought the Michigan position held greater long-term promise and accepted the job, believing that he would be given his release from Cincinnati or placed on the list of voluntarily retired players (both of which were subsequently reported in the local papers).The April 8, 1921 Cincinnati Post reported: \\"Ray Fisher arrived from Ann Arbor today and asked to be released from his contract. He has decided to accept the offer of coach of the baseball team at the University of Michigan. President Herrmann agreed to place him on the voluntary retired list.\\" On April 11, 1921 the Associated Press reported that Fisher had been given an \\"unconditional release\\" from his contract. Within two weeks, however, Herrmann wrote to league President John Heydler stating that, \\"We have not given this player his release, and the question arises whether we should put him on the Voluntary Retired List or place him on the Ineligible List for violation of contract.\\" Proctor, Fall 1980, p. 37.Proctor. Summer 1980. pp. 37-38. Part way into Michigan's playing season, other teams began contacting Fisher inquiring as to his availability to pitch and coach during the summer, Rickey's St. Louis Cardinals among them.Proctor. Fall 1980. pp. 36-37. Fisher contacted the Reds for clarification on his status, noting that he realized they had first call on his services.Proctor. Fall 1980. p. 37: \\"You informed me at our last meeting\\", Fisher wrote, \\"that you would let me know if you cared for my services for the summer months. I am receiving opportunities to pitch for the summer months... I am desirous of getting located. I realize you have first call and so wish you would advise me at your earliest convenience.\\" He learned that he was being placed on the list of those ineligible to play, the Reds citing his having given them only seven days notice, rather than the required ten, prior to leaving the club.Herrmann's letter to Fisher has not surfaced, but Fisher's response of 26 April 1921 states in part, \\"Your letter of the 25th at hand. I was somewhat surprised that you had not placed me on the Voluntary Retired List rather than Ineligible but that is entirely up to you. Yes, you may have been hurt at my decision but you forget that I had been hurt by some of the things that were handed me. I did regret not being able to give you 10-day notice instead of seven as I have always tried to operate on the square.\\" Fisher's swift departure from the Reds was due to his being told by the University of Michigan that they needed him as quickly as possible since the Michigan team was then departing for its spring Southern trip, and the current coach, Del Pratt, who had only been at Michigan a few months, would be leaving the team when they reached Atlanta. Fisher, in fact, joined the Michigan team as it passed through Cincinnati on its way south on April 9, the day after his meeting with Herrmann. He took over as head coach five days later in Atlanta when Pratt left to join the Boston Red Sox. Proctor, Fall 1980, p.37. Fisher appealed to the commissioner of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and the commissioner promised to look into the matter.Proctor. Fall 1980. p. 38. After obtaining the Reds' version of the negotiations, the commissioner upheld the Reds' position and banned Fisher for leaving the team after having signed a contract.Proctor. Fall 1980. pp. 38-39.A policy that may have had a bearing on the manner in which Fisher's case was handled came between the time he left the Reds and the end of his season at Michigan. The Sporting News reported on 19 April that at a meeting of baseball's major-minor advisory council a decision was made to put in force a rule that was intended to deal more severely with players who were tardy in reporting to their ball clubs. As reported in the News, \\"...any player who fails to report to the club to which he is under contract or reserve within ten days after the opening of the season for that club shall be placed on the ineligible list. Once on such list he can not secure reinstatement except upon application to Commissioner Landis.\\" Landis' decision was influenced, the Commissioners' files show, by his having heard a rumor that Fisher was carrying on negotiations with an \\"outlaw\\" team. Fisher told Landis, however, that this was not true. He had been approached by such a team but had carried out no negotiations with them. It was from this team (Franklin, Pennsylvania), in fact, that Fisher first heard the rumor that he might be blacklisted. See Proctor, Fall 1980, p. 38. Fisher ended his major league career with a 100‚Äì94 record and a 2.82 ERA. His final game was pitched on October 2, 1920, and it was part of the only tripleheader played in the 20th century. Following the determination of his ineligibility, Fisher signed on with one of the \\"outlaw\\" teams, pitching briefly for the Franklin, Pennsylvania, Oilers before the team folded.Proctor. Fall 1980. pp. 37-39. About 1944, as part of a promotion for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Fisher received in the mail a silver lifetime pass to any major league ballpark in the country.From the 1945 Baseball Guide and Record Book (covering events of 1944) published by The Sporting News: \\"Lifetime passes to all parks in both majors have been awarded to 552 long-service men, past and present, of the National and American leagues, 22 in gold to those who were in the majors for 20 years or more and silver to 530 for ten or more years of service. The issuance was first authorized in December 1935... On the bottom are engraved the names of Ford C. Frick, president of the National League, and William Harridge, head of the American League.\\" At the time of writing, 21 of the 22 recipients of gold passes were still living and 444 of the 530 who were awarded silver passes were alive. Fisher had also received a 1936 invitation from the Cincinnati Reds to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club and the 60th anniversary of the league. The pass was signed by the presidents of both leagues and was inscribed \\"To Ray Fisher in appreciation of long and meritorious service\\", which Fisher interpreted to mean that his \\"blacklisting\\" had been lifted. This was his belief for nearly 35 years until he learned late in his life that the blacklisting was still officially on record with the Commissioner's office.Proctor. Fall 1980. pp. 43-44. In 1951 Fisher was called to Washington, D.C., to testify about his blacklisting in a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the alleged monopoly of power in professional baseball.Proctor. Fall 1980. p. 42.Study of Monopoly of Power: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Study of Monopoly Power of the Committee on the Judiciary House of Representatives (1952). pp. 427-441. United States Government Printing Office.  Coaching  Fisher from the 1925 Michiganensian Fisher remained head baseball coach for the University of Michigan's baseball team for 38 seasons. His original agreement with Michigan also assigned him as an assistant basketball coach, a position he held through 1941, and as assistant football coach,Proctor. Summer 1980. p. 37., and Ann Arbor News 9 April 1921. in which capacity he served through 1945. (In football, he coached Gerald Ford and Tom Harmon.) While at Michigan, Fisher led his baseball teams to 15 Big Ten championships and the 1953 College World Series championship, after which he was named Coach of the Year. In 1923, Fisher became Michigan's first coach in the 20th century to integrate a varsity sport.Rudy Ash, the only African American on Fisher's 1923 undefeated Big Ten championship team, related years later, \\"[Fisher] often said, 'Anyone can play on my team who has the ability regardless of race, color, or creed.'\\" See Proctor, Fall 1980, p. 43.

The team returned from Japan in October 1929 aboard the , sailing from Yokohama to San Francisco. Fisher was active in the startup of the National Association of College Baseball Coaches and served as its first vice president.The Official National Collegiate Athletic Association Baseball Guide, 1958. pp. 28-31. During the 1940s he was hailed by sports writers as \\"the Fielding Yost of the diamond\\"\\"Ray Fisher is Baseball's Yost\\". The Michigan Daily, 17 June 1942: \\"A prominent sports writer recently referred to Michigan's baseball coach, Ray Fisher, as the Fielding Yost of the diamond.\\" and by Esquire Magazine as a close second to Jack Barry of Holy Cross as the top college baseball coach in the country.In 1946 the American Association of College Baseball Coaches, which had been formed the previous year, sponsored an All Star Game between the East and Midwest which was played at Fenway Park. Fisher led the coaching staff for the Midwest and Barry for the East. This game was the precursor of the College World Series games which began the following year. See The Official National Collegiate Athletic Association Baseball Guide, 1958. Fisher was generally regarded as one of the nation's premiere instructors of college pitchers.\\"[Fisher] is rated one of the best coaches of pitchers anywhere in the country. In fact, big league teams often recommend to a youngster with major league aspirations that he enroll at Michigan so he can benefit from Fisher's tutoring.\\" The Detroit Times, 26 May 1952. At the 2008 dedication of U of M's Wilpon Complex, Fred Wilpon related that one reason he chose to attend the U of M in 1954 was that Fisher was regarded as the top coach of college pitchers in the eastern U.S. He was known both for his droll sense of humor and his potential for argumentativeness with umpires. The latter may have frequently been strategic;See e.g. Simon pp. 94-95. in his later years at Michigan the press sometimes referred to him as \\"The Old Fox\\". While coaching summer teams in Vermont's Northern League,Simon. pp. 93-95. Fisher mentored Robin Roberts (1946 and 1947), who sent many accolades in Fisher's direction once he was signed into the major leagues.Baseball Digest, June 1949: \\"'You know all the time I've been in organized baseball I haven't heard one big leaguer or one minor leaguer give me any better advice than Fisher did,' Robbie says. 'He kept harping on follow-through, proper footing on the rubber, mixing 'em up and hiding the ball. They're the same things they teach in the big leagues and Ray has every one of those instructions at his finger tips.'\\"; and quoted in Hart's \\"Ray Fisher\\": \\"‚Ä¶ don't think I don't appreciate the help I've received from fellows like [George] Earnshaw and [Schoolboy] Rowe. It is just that I feel I owe so much to Fisher.\\" Later in his career, when he felt his pitching was off, Roberts sought out Fisher at the University of Michigan to assist him in getting his pitching back on track, as had pitcher Johnny Gee. See Time, 28 May 1956 (Roberts) and New York Times, 18 January 1941 (Gee).  Retirement and later life  By the time he retired in 1958, Fisher had compiled a 636‚Äì295‚Äì8 record as a coachJones. p. 723. (.600 or better in 32 of 38 seasons) with only two losing seasons, and he held the record as the University of Michigan's winningest coach for 70 years (1930‚Äì2000).Jones. p. 723., and Hart For five years during the 1960s Fisher coached pitchers for the farm teams of the Milwaukee Braves and the Detroit Tigers, and into his 80s he was still working with pitchers at the request of subsequent University of Michigan baseball coaches.Proctor. Fall 1980. pp. 42-43. After a reinvestigation of the circumstances of Fisher's leaving the Cincinnati Reds,Donald J. Proctor, professor of history at the University of Michigan (Dearborn), researched Fisher's blacklisting and published his findings in Ann Arbor Scene Magazine (Summer and Fall issues 1980) and in an abridged version in Baseball Research Journal (1981). Proctor submitted the original article to the Commissioner's office in 1980. Proctor, April 1986, pp. 26-27. in 1980 Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn declared Fisher a \\"retired player in good standing\\" with professional baseball, nearly 60 years after Landis's declaration of ineligibility.Simon. p. 96. In a twist of fate, following the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the Cincinnati Reds came to the University of Michigan for workouts at Ray Fisher Stadium, where they met the 93-year-old former Reds pitcher.Ann Arbor News, 5 August 1981. In the summer of 1982, Fisher was invited to the yearly Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium, his first visit to the famous facility which had been built after he'd left the team. Approaching age 95, he was then the oldest former Yankee, Cincinnati Red and World Series player.Jones. p. 723. He received two standing ovations from the fans, second only to Joe DiMaggio,Pinstripes, Vol. 9, No. 4. Yankee Alumni Association. and threw out the opening pitch for that day's Yankees-Rangers game.Jones. p. 723., and Simon. pp. 96-97. He died three months later in Ann Arbor, Michigan and is buried in Washtenong Memorial Park.  Legacy  Ray Fisher Stadium view from seats behind home plate Among his honors, Fisher was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1959), the American Association of College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame (1966), the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor (1979), the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame (2013), and the Middlebury Athletics Hall of Fame (2014). Fisher's uniform number has been retired by the Michigan Wolverines baseball team and by the Vermont Mountaineers. At least 19 of Fisher's Michigan players signed with a major league team.Proctor. Fall 1980. p. 43, , and On May 23, 1970, twelve years after FIsher's retirement, the baseball stadium at the University of Michigan, until then unnamed, was dedicated as Ray Fisher Stadium.Ann Arbor News, 22 May 1970 Thirty-eight years later, on May 2, 2008, a renovated Ray Fisher Stadium was incorporated into the university's new Wilpon Baseball and Softball Complex, Fred Wilpon having pitched for Michigan under Fisher.Wilpon, majority owner of the New York Mets, began at Michigan on a baseball scholarship and injured his arm during his freshman year. Fisher kept him on the baseball team in his sophomore year, though he was unable to play. Fisher then arranged for Wilpon to obtain an academic scholarship so that he could finish his college education. See \\"NY Mets Owner Fred Wilpon, '58, Looks Back\\". Michigan Today, 15 April 2013. On 25 July 2003, through the efforts of the Vermont chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research, the State of Vermont placed an historic site marker near Ray Fisher's birthplace, at the intersection of U.S. Route 7 (Court Street) and Creek Road in Middlebury, Vermont.Ann Arbor News 26 July 2003 Fisher's influence on pitchers was still being felt many years after his death. In the 2010 American League Championship Series, Texas Rangers pitcher Cliff Lee gave quite a performance using a cut fastball taught to him by \\"Ace\\" Adams, who had learned the pitch from Fisher at Michigan after the latter's retirement.

It is set in England in the late 15th century, and follows the exploits of the fictitious Prince Edmund as he is invested as Archbishop of Canterbury amid a Machiavellian plot by the King to acquire lands from the Catholic Church. Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire. The script pays tribute to the real-life 12th century Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket. Edmund, faced with the threat of assassination, attempts to escape to France into self-imposed exile; and in a later scene, two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming \\"Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?\\", the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket's death in 1170, and embark on a mission to murder Edmund.Roberts, p.110 \\"The Archbishop\\" won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category.Roberts, pp. 128 & 246Lewis, p.113 The Catholic Church was to be satirized again in the second series, Blackadder II, in the 1986 episode \\"Money\\".  Plot The episode references the death of Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170 In November 1487, the Duke of Winchester, the greatest landowner in the kingdom, is on his deathbed, with King Richard and Godfrey, Archbishop of Canterbury, sitting beside him. Winchester initially plans to leave his lands to the Crown in his will. but Godfrey threatens him with the eternal torments of Hell unless he bequeaths his estate to the Catholic Church. Moments after the will is signed, Winchester dies, and his lands pass on to the Church. Enraged, the King has the Archbishop murdered. Edmund learns of Archbishop Godfrey's death from his brother Harry and reflects on it scornfully with his companions Lord Percy Percy and Baldrick, remarking that Godfrey was the third Archbishop in a year to suffer such a fate, sarcastically referring to the other absurdly obvious murders as \\"tragic accidents\\". Edmund then hears of a rumour that Harry is to be appointed as the new Archbishop and speculates gleefully that his brother will also be brutally murdered, thus leaving Edmund next in line for the throne of England. To his horror, King Richard announces the next day that Edmund will be the new Archbishop. Fearing for his life, Edmund tries to grovel his way out of the job, but Richard refuses, threatening to do to him \\"what God did unto the Sodomites\\" should he anger him. Edmund attempts to flee to France with Baldrick and Percy, but is caught trying to escape by King Richard and Prince Harry, and claims he was going to Canterbury. Harry accompanies Edmund to Canterbury, where he is ordained as Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England. Edmund takes on Baldrick as a monk and Percy is ordained as Bishop of Ramsgate. All three adopt clerical vestments and shave their heads with a tonsure. Some time later, news arrives that the wealthy Lord Graveney is on his deathbed. Edmund, fearing reprisals from his father, rushes to Graveney's castle to convince him to leave his lands to the Crown. However, the Bishop of London (the former Archbishop's brother) is already there, attempting to convince Graveney to bequeath his estate to the Church by threatening him with the pains of Hell, just as his brother had done with the dying Duke of Winchester earlier. Graveney confesses to Edmund that he fears damnation for his many sins, which include killing his father so he could have an affair with his own mother over one thousand times. Edmund convinces Graveney that if he were to go to Heaven he would spend eternity \\"singing, talking to God and watering pot plants\\", contrasting it with a picture of Hell as an opportunity to spend eternity indulging in fornication, murder and pillage. Excited by the prospect of eternal sin, Graveney deeds his lands to the Crown just before dying. In his joy, King Richard embraces Edmund and addresses him as \\"my son\\". Later, Baldrick reveals a plan to profit from their ordination by commercialising religious artefacts ‚Äì selling curses, papal pardons and religious artifacts. He proposes a new product line of holy relics including a set of Shrouds from Turin, a range of anachronistic gifts (such as a pipe racks or a coffee table) purportedly from the carpentry workshop of Jesus Christ, along with a variety of bones and other bodily parts of saints ‚Äì all revealed to be counterfeit items produced by Baldrick himself. Despite his initial displeasure, Edmund starts to settle in as archbishop, given the benefits the position brings him: he is gaining great new wealth for himself and the crown, for the first time his father actually respects him, and even without needing to kill his brother he has already become a politically powerful man in his own right. That night, King Richard and Queen Gertrude drink a toast to Edmund, and Richard remarks that he is grateful that he will never again have to say \\"who will rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" The end of the sentence is overheard by two drunken knights who take it literally as instructions to murder the current Archbishop of Canterbury. The two assassins surprise Edmund, Baldrick and Percy and attempt to kill them. The trio escape by disguising themselves as nuns, for which they are caught by the Mother Superior. Edmund is promptly excommunicated by the pope (and also two other antipopes), and walks away into a bright, holy light ‚Äì revealed to be the glow from the fire he set in the nunnery. In the epilogue, the Mother Superior laments the corruption of the world, and suggestively informs another nun that she won't be needing \\"the unicorn\\" that evening ‚Äì the true nature of which is not revealed.  Production  Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, used as a filming location for King Richard's castle William Russell, best remembered as Doctor Who companion Ian Chesterton, was a last-minute replacement for actor Wilfrid Brambell in the role of the Duke of Winchester. Brambell walked off set after becoming impatient with delays in shooting the scene. Russell was credited as Russell Enoch. Among the scenes cut from the final broadcast version of The Archbishop was a scene in which Prince Harry consults his newly consecrated brother on the pressing ecclesiastical issues of the day, such as the castration of choirboys and the torture of talkative women. Also cut from the programme was a valedictory soliloquy by Edmund as he prepares to go into exile, bidding farewell to the castle turrets,Roberts, pp.109‚Äì110 and King Richard preaching an angry sermon from the pulpit at the funeral of the dead Archbishop Godfrey.Roberts, pp.124 Location shooting for King Richard's castle was at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983.Locations at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 17 April 2008 Brinkburn Priory, an authentic reconstruction of a mediaeval monastery church, was used for the scenes of Edmund's consecration at Canterbury Cathedral.Brinkburn Priory, URL accessed 9 August 2010 Critical assessment The depiction of the medieval world in The Black Adder has been the subject of some critical commentary for drawing on popular perceptions of the period which are not always entirely accurate. While the series uses absurdly comic situations to mock religion and belief, the scripts of both The Archbishop and the later episode Witchsmeller Pursuivant have been attributed to a post- Reformation perception of Medieval Catholicism; Archbishops were not routinely assassinated and hysteria about witches was not widespread in England until the 1640s.Lewis, p.121 Reviewer Katherine J. Lewis draws similarities between Baldrick's relics scene and The Pardoner's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, whose protagonist also has a trade in fake relics. While The Black Adder satirises the supposedly unquestioning credulity of the Mediaeval Christian, Lewis suggests that Chaucer's story, by offering a satirical commentary on the relic trade, shows that the teachings of the Church were open to question and ridicule even in the 14th Century.Lewis, p.122 In the 2008 documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Richard Curtis and Tony Robinson both mention the relics scene as a particular highlight. Curtis was generally critical of the first series, stating that while comedy writers hone their craft first by writing sketches and then progress to writing situation comedy, the most successful parts of The Black Adder were in essence just sketches. He points to Baldrick's scene with the holy relics as an example of one of those sequences ‚Äì entertaining, but ultimately self-contained. Robinson felt that, because he, Rowan Atkinson and Tim McInnerny had just begun to work together, this scene was the first time that the three of them truly \\"gelled\\" as an ensemble of performers.

Superficial dorsal vein The superficial dorsal vein of the penis drains the prepuce and skin of the penis, and, running backward in the subcutaneous tissue, inclines to the right or left, and opens into the corresponding superficial external pudendal vein, a tributary of the great saphenous vein. In contrast to the deep dorsal vein, it lies outside Buck's fascia. It is possible for the vein to rupture, which presents in a manner similar to penile fracture. Deep dorsal vein The deep dorsal vein of the penis lies beneath the deep fascia of the penis; it receives the blood from the glans penis and corpora cavernosa penis and courses backward in the middle line between the dorsal arteries; near the root of the penis it passes between the two parts of the suspensory ligament and then through an aperture between the arcuate pubic ligament and the transverse ligament of the pelvis, and divides into two branches, which enter the vesical and prostatic plexuses. The deep vein also communicates below the pubic symphysis with the internal pudendal vein. Additional images File:Gray585.png|The veins of the right half of the male pelvis.

In cattle, the organism is transmitted to the female vagina and uterus from the foreskin of the bull where the parasite is known to reside. It causes infertility, and, at times, has caused spontaneous abortions in the first trimester. In the last ten years, there have been reports of Tritrichomonas foetus in the feces of young cats that have diarrhea and live in households with multiple cats. Tritrichomonas foetus looks similarly to Giardia and is often misdiagnosis for it when viewed under a microscope. Cause Tritrichomonas foetus is the genus Tritrichomonas within the order Trichomonadida in the Kingdom Protoctista. The parasite is 5-25 ¬µm in size and is spindle shaped with four flagella, which are whiplike projections, and an undulating or wavy membrane. Three of the flagella are found on the anterior end and approximately the same length as the body of the parasite. The fourth is on the posterior end. Their movement is jerky and in a forward direction, and they also do \\"barrel rolls\\". The organisms look like small tadpoles with small tails when viewed microscopically. The parasite interacts with bacteria that normally reside in the intestinal tract by adhering to the intestinal epithelium of the host. Cattle Clinical signs Bulls do not show any clinical signs of infections and can infect females at mating. In cows, there may be infertility, embryonic death and abortion, and reproductive tract infections such as pyometra.Tritrichomonas foetus reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011.Trichomonosis - Cattle reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011. Cows may show outward signs of infection, namely a sticky, white vaginal discharge, which may occur for up to two months after the initial infection. The disease results in abortion of the embryo, often within ten days of conception. Evidence of repeat breeding or infertility may be a sign of trichomoniasis. After the abortion of the fetus and the cow's return to a normal estrous cycle, the cow may come into estrus again, at which point it may be bred again. Eventually the cow will be able to cycle normally and carry a fetus to term. However, the irregularities after initial infection present obvious clinical signs of reproductive inconsistencies, which should be examined by a veterinarian immediately. Bulls remain infected for life, but cows can successfully clear the infection, but reinfection is likely. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be done on both males and females; however, bulls are tested more since they remain carriers. In cattle, a presumptive diagnosis can be made from the signs of infertility and geography. Diagnosis may rely on microscopic examination of vaginal or preputial smears. Complement fixation can be performed to detect parasite antibodies in vaginal secretions. Several related trichomonads may be mistaken for Tritrichomonas foetus, including: Trichomonas vaginalis, Trichomonas gallinae, and Trichomonas tenax. A study by Richard Felleisen found that identification of T. foetus using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted in a more accurate identification. The 5.8S rRNA gene of T. foetus was found to have 12 copies in the T. foetus genome. This indicated that the organism could be identified via amplification of this gene by PCR. Not only would this allow for identification of T. foetus, but also differentiation from other trichomonad species. Diagnosis can also be done using the InPouch TF from a prepuce scraping sample from a bull. Treatment and Control Bulls can be treated in different ways. Various imidazoles have been used, but none are both safe and effective in treatment. Ipronidazole is probably most effective but, due to its low pH, frequently causes sterile abscesses at injection sites. Bulls can also remain carriers for life and can easily be susceptible to reinfection even after successful treatment. Again, keep in mind that bulls can sometimes remain carriers for life once they become infected; they are unable to clear the infection like cows can. Cows can be treated by being left alone for around three months to allow them time to shed the vaginal and uterine lining that is affected. Semen can also be treated successfully with dimetridazole and then used for artificial insemination. Commercially available vaccines (TrichGuard, Tricovac) cannot prevent infection, but confer disease attenuation and some level of protection against complications. In a placebo-controlled trial of TrichGuard with forty prophylactically vaccinated, T. foetus-infected beef heifers, 95% of the heifers in the active treatment group conceived, as opposed to 70% in the placebo group. 50% in the TrichGuard-group gave birth to a live calf, compared to 20% in the placebo group. The most effective control method for eliminating the infection in a herd or an individual remains by culling the animal(s) and replacing them with virgin animals after positive test results. Cows can remain in the herd if given enough time to shed the infection or can be culled like bulls to allow faster turnover and assure the herd is clear of the infection.  Transmission  There are two routes of transmission for Tritrichomonas foetus between cattle: cow-to-bull or bull-to-cow. If a bull naturally breeds an infected cow, the organism can transmit to the bull's prepuce, where the parasite likes to reside. The most common route of transmission is from bull to cow. The cow can get infected either when naturally bred to an infected bull or when receiving semen from an infected bull during artificial insemination. However, in the case of artificial insemination, while T. foetus is capable of surviving the process used to freeze semen after collection, it is usually killed by drying or high temperatures. Tritrichomonas foetus in cattle is unlikely to survive outside the host, so the only way it can successfully directly from one host to another.  Prognosis  The prognosis for cattle is not good. Infected bulls are advised to be culled; cows should also be culled due to easy reinfection even after clearing the initial infection. Trichomoniasis is a reportable disease in cattle, and as of now, there is no effect treatment. Prevention and smart farm practices are the only remedy. Testing should be done on any bull prior to exposing it to the herd. Limiting exposure of the herd to other cattle and limiting the introduction of open cows into the herd are good preventative practices. An estimated 42% of cows will acquire the disease if bred to an infected bull.https://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/2000/spring/bv.shtml accessed 30 April 2014. Cat Jody Gookin \\"Dr. Gookin is nationally recognized for her expertise in gastroenterology with a special emphasis on infectious causes of feline diarrheal disease. Dr. Gookin and her colleagues are credited with identification of Tritrichomonas foetus as a previously unrecognized cause of diarrhea in domestic cats and have dedicated over 15 years of research effort into establishing the pathogenicity, means for diagnosis, worldwide significance, and an effective treatment for this infection.\\" Clinical signs In cats, Tritrichomonas foetus is characterized by diarrhea that comes and goes and may contain blood and mucus at times. The diarrhea is semi formed in a cow pie consistency. In most cases it affects cats of 12 months of age or younger and cats from rescue shelters and homes with multiple cats. Close and direct contact appears to be the mode in which the parasite is transmitted. Tritrichomonas foetus is most common in purebred felines, breeds like Bengals, Persians, etc. Since catteries tend to trade queens and studs to provide greater genetic diversity, the parasite can be spread from one cattery to another. However, just because the cat doesn't show signs of diarrhea, it still could possibly be infected. Adult cats are less likely to develop diarrhea when infected, but they will still serve as a source of infection for other cats. Clinical signs can show up anywhere from days to years after exposure. Diagnosis In cats, Tritrichomonas foetus can be detected by the following four methods: # Direct Fecal Smear ##Fresh feces are examined in saline under a microscope for the presence of trichomonads. This is the cheapest method with poor sensitivity since approximately 14% of infected cats are detected through this method. # Fecal culture ##Feces are incubated in a growth medium for T. foetus. Included in this medium are antibiotics, which suppress unwanted bacterial growth. The culture is then examined microscopically for the presence of T. foetus. ##InPouch TF from a fecal sample of an infected cat is an example of this method. ##this is the second cheapest method at around $5-$7 per culture pouch. The sensitivity is good with approximately 55% of infected cats are detected through this method. # PCR testing - A fecal sample is sent to a diagnostic laboratory for analysis. PCR testing searches the specimen for genetic evidence of the T. foetus organism. This test is the most reliable available at this time. The PCR test can take anywhere from one to three days to complete, so it is the fastest way to get results. This test can detect both living and dead organisms present in a sample. ##This is the most expensive method at around $75 per test. The sensitivity is excellence with approximately twice as many infected cats detected through this method as fecal cultures. Treatment and Control One treatment that has been effective in experimentally infected cats is ronidazole. (Note \\"experimentally\\", therefore it is unknown exactly how the treatment would act in the field.) Neurotoxicity has occurred in some cats treated with ronidazole; sign include lethargy, ataxia, seizures, etc. These side effects usually resolve when the drug is withdrawn immediately; however, if the treatment is not withdrawn for a couple weeks, resulting in costly and intensive emergency veterinary care. Cats need to be monitored closely while on ronidazole. One good way to monitor if the cat suffers from the neurotoxic side effects is to engage the cat each day in a playful activity that involves coordination and agility (playing with laser point). If neurotoxicity is observed, treatment must be stopped immediately; note that neurotoxicity symptoms may continue/worsen a few days after stopping treatment before subsiding. Continuing treatment after signs of toxicity is dangerous and life- threatening to the cat. Ronidazole is currently not FDA approved in companion animals and banned for use in food-producing animals outside the United States due to human hazard. Because of this, veterinarians are advised to obtain informed consent prior to use of this drug in cats. Because is not FDA approved, its usage would be considered an off-label use. Other than this drug, there is no other treatment for Tritrichomonas foetus infections in cats. There is always possible that the T. foetus infection could be resistant to Ronidazole; if this is the case, longer duration or a higher dosage of treatment will not work and will increase the chances of neurotoxicity. During treatment, the feline should be keep isolated from other cats as to prevent the spread to another cat (typically transmitted by an infected cat sharing the same litter box as other cats). The cat should be fed a veterinarian prescribed dry-food diet, preferably of high fiber content. Wet food should be avoided. A common GI diet remedy in cats (boiled chicken breast, white rice, and pumpkin) may be highly beneficial during and after treatment.  Transmission  The primary transmission route is the litter box that is shared by both infected and uninfected cats, where a well-timed use by two cats can transfer the parasite from the feces of one cat to the paws of another where they later become ingested during the act of grooming. In cats, Tritrichomonas foetus is able to live several days in wet stool. Mutual grooming may also transfer the parasite. There is no evidence that T. foetus is sexually transmitted or infects the reproductive tract or mammary glands of cats.  Prognosis  The long term prognosis for cats with TF is generally good, the diarrhoea will usually resolve itself in untreated cats. However this can take many months, and cats which no longer show clinical signs can continue to shed the organism for up to two years. Tritrichomonas foetus in cats It appears that over time the parasite dies off and the infection is remedied on its own. In some cases, the symptoms may improve over time, but the animal is likely to still be a carrier of the parasite, capable of transmitting it to another cat.

Set in late 15th-century England, the episode parodies the practice of political marriages between the royal houses of Europe which characterised European politics during the Middle Ages.Roberts, p.118 Its bawdy humour also deals with taboos surrounding premarital sex, gay stereotypes and the practice of child marriage. The title of the episode is a play on the words attributed to Sir Francis Drake who \\"singed the beard of the King of Spain\\" when he attacked the country in 1587.Lewis, p. 123 As with other episodes in this series, the end credits include an acknowledgement of \\"additional dialogue by William Shakespeare\\". One scene includes a parody of Richard III in which the third messenger announces in deadpan style the death of Lord Wessex. The fictitious King Richard IV retorts, \\"I like not this news! Bring me some other news!\\" echoing Richard III's rebuke to a messenger, \\"There, take thou that till thou bring better news.\\" (Act 4, scene 4) The episode introduces a recurring guest star to the Blackadder series, Miriam Margolyes, who plays the part of the Spanish Infanta betrothed to Prince Edmund. Margolyes would later return to play Edmund's Puritan aunt, Lady Whiteadder, in the 1986 episode \\"Beer\\" and the part of Queen Victoria in Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988). Margolyes's Infanta is accompanied in \\"The Queen of Spain's Beard\\" by an interpreter, played by Jim Broadbent, who would go on to play Albert, Prince Consort opposite her in Blackadder's Christmas Carol. Broadbent was also intended to play Lord Whiteadder in \\"Beer\\", but was unavailable for recording.Roberts, p.201 Although \\"The Queen of Spain's Beard\\" was originally broadcast as episode 4 of the series, on later broadcasts and DVD releases it has been switched with episode 2, \\"Born to Be King\\".Lewis, p. 124  Plot  The year is 1492 and Europe is in disarray as nations go to war and kingdoms rise and fall. In England, Richard IV's court throbs with activity as he and his noblemen plan for war. The King must secure Spain's allegiance in a war with France, and commands his son, Harry, Prince of Wales, to marry the Spanish Infanta. Harry reveals that he is already engaged to a long list of European princesses (and one prince), and so the duty falls to Richard's forgotten son, Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh. Edmund, meanwhile, has been trying unsuccessfully to woo the ladies of the court. After a woman pushes him off the castle ramparts in revulsion because she was expecting Harry, Edmund renounces women. His resolve is weakened when he learns that his father has arranged his marriage to the Infanta Maria Escalosa of Spain and he grows excited when he imagines her as a beautiful princess. The Infanta arrives at court and Edmund is horrified to discover that she is ugly and overweight. Facilitated by her ever-present interpreter, Don Speekingleesh, she declares undying love for Edmund. Terrified by her sexually voracious advances, Edmund retreats to work out a way of getting out of the marriage, which is to take place the following day. Baldrick hatches a plan: if Edmund can convince the Infanta that he \\"prefers the intimate company of men\\", she will not be willing to marry him. Baldrick suggests he follow the example of Earl of Doncaster, which Edmund is initially reticent to do until he realises that nobody would marry the Earl of Doncaster except, perhaps, the Duke of Beaufort. Edmund then puts on flamboyant clothes and makeup, adopts stereotypically camp mannerisms and minces into court - being mistaken for the Earl of Doncaster by his father. Unfortunately, the Infanta misunderstands Edmund's appearance as an attempt to wear traditional Spanish dress to delight her, and her passion is kindled further. Edmund's next strategy is to get out of the marriage by marrying someone else. He sends Percy to find a suitable fianc√©e while Baldrick kidnaps a priest to perform the ceremony. Edmund ‚Äì still wearing his flamboyant outfit ‚Äì attempts to marry a giggling peasant girl, Tully Applebottom, in a clandestine wedding. The ceremony is abruptly halted by Tully's enraged husband, who ejects Edmund by threatening him with a scythe, assuming him to be the Earl of Doncaster. On the eve of the wedding, Edmund's last hope is to make the Infanta lose her virginity, thus making her ineligible for marriage. He sends Baldrick into the Infanta's bedchamber to \\"deflower\\" her. In total darkness, Baldrick is heard struggling desperately, while the Infanta's amorous exclamations are helpfully translated by her interpreter, also present in the tryst. Edmund, feigning sorrow, informs the King Richard that the Infanta is not a virgin. The King brushes the revelation aside ‚Äì only one of them has to be a virgin (that one, of course, being Edmund). The following day, the marriage ceremony begins and the Infanta is impatient. A traumatised Baldrick is seen covered in bruises from the previous night's failed mission. Unexpectedly, and to Edmund's great relief, the wedding is suddenly halted when news arrives that Spain, the Swiss and France have joined forces. Realising the only country in Europe England can ally with now is Hungary, the King ejects the Infanta from the court, and declares that Edmund must now marry a Hungarian princess. Edmund is disappointed once again ‚Äî Princess Leia of Hungary turns out to be an eight-year-old girl. The wedding goes ahead, and Edmund spends his entire wedding night wearily reading fairy tales to his child bride.

His performance was singled out by writer Richard Curtis as particularly memorable. Broadbent later confessed that he had no idea at the time what a Spanish accent should sound like, and improvised with \\"a very bad cod Italian accent\\" ‚Äî which turned out in the end to be a very successful comedic strategy. Curtis remarked that it was an \\"astonishing technical feat, to get the rhythms of the English language so completely wrong.\\"Roberts, pp.118‚Äì120 Natasha King (Princess Leia of Hungary) has remarked on the kindness of the cast and crew to her as a child actor and recalled that, at the end of filming, Rowan Atkinson presented her with a bouquet of flowers.Roberts, p.120 Critical assessment In her assessment of The Black Adder series, the critic Katharine J. Lewis has examined its comedy genre. She cites several aspects of this episode in particular as elements of traditional situation comedy: the use of scheming, plotting and disguises; and the creation of exaggerated, stereotypical characters (such as the sexually voracious Infanta) for comedic effect. However, Lewis points to its connections with the alternative comedy scene which was growing in the 1980s ‚Äì Rowan Atkinson, Richard Curtis and John Lloyd had all collaborated on Not the Nine O'Clock News and several actors from the alternative comedy circuit had cameos throughout the series. The Black Adder is said to draw on the controversial and irreverent material of previous alternative comedy productions to lampoon the customs and practices of the mediaeval world.Lewis, p.116  See also  *Infanta *British-Spanish relations References  External links  * Category:Blackadder episodes Category:1983 British television episodes Category:Fiction set in 1492 Category:Television shows written by Rowan Atkinson Category:Television shows written by Richard Curtis ","title":"The Queen of Spain's Beard"},{"id":"7186641","text":"Bobby Rivas is an El Salvadoran salsa/balladeer singer, composer, actor and musician.

Managed by the Turkish Navy, the project aims at developing multipurpose corvettes and frigates that can be deployed in a range of missions, including reconnaissance, surveillance, early warning, anti- submarine warfare, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air warfare, and amphibious operations. As of 2018, the MILGEM project covers four anti- submarine warfare corvettes and one ELINT corvette, four multipurpose frigates and anti-air warfare destroyers destined for the Turkish Navy, four Jinnah- class frigates for the Pakistan Navy. The name of the project emerged from the phrase \\"National Ship\\" in Turkish - Milli Gemi. History In mid 1990s the Turkish Navy was researching national resources to design, develop and construct a completely indigenous corvette. In 2004, Istanbul Naval Shipyard Command established MILGEM Project Office to execute and coordinate the design, engineering and construction projects. By developing the MILGEM project, Turkey aimed to build a warship using local resources to the maximum extent possible, improve national military shipbuilding capacity and skills. The objectives for the Ada class were set to enhance the littoral warfare capabilities and to meet the operational requirements of the Turkish Navy.Acquisition of Design Services and Platform Construction and Outfitting Equipment for MILGEM Project Prototype Ship and Second Ship, SSM, Turkey, Retrieved 6 December 2010 MILGEM project office focused on building a modern littoral combat ship with authentic anti-submarine warfare and high-seas patrol capability, extensively employing low-observable superstructure and intelligence sensors. In 2005, Istanbul Naval Shipyard Command commenced the construction works of the first vessel of MILGEM project, TCG Heybeliada. In 2014, Turkish defense technology and engineering company STM was selected as a subprime contractor for the construction of remaining Ada class vessels.

It consists of a gas turbine rated at and two diesel engines rated at . Each diesel engine drives one controllable pitch propeller via a two speed main reduction gear. The cross connect gear splits the power from the gas turbine via both main reduction gears to the two shafts. The ship can be operated in Diesel mode, in single gas turbine mode or in CODAG mode where diesel and gas turbine are providing a combined power of . GENESIS (Gemi Entegre Sava≈ü ƒ∞dare Sistemi, i.e. Ship Integrated Combat Management System), a network-centric combat management system developed by HAVELSAN and originally used in the upgraded s of the Turkish Navy, was contracted for the first two Ada-class corvettes on May 23, 2007.MILGEM Project, GENESIS Combat Management System , Havelsan, Retrieved 6 December 2010Havelsan advances MILGEM integration, Jane's IDEX 2011 exhibition news, Retrieved 25 February 2011 The MILGEM ships have a national hull mounted sonar developed by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.Indigenous Sonar Wet-End System Production and Integration Project, SSM, Turkey Sonar dome has been developed by STM's subcontractor ONUK-BG Defence Systems, extensively employing nano- enhanced Fiber Reinforced Polymer.Mƒ∞LGEM Corvette Sonar Dome , Onuk-BG Defence Systems, Turkey The Ada class features an electronic chart precise integrated navigation system (ECPINS) supplied by OSI Geospatial.OSI Geospatial Selected by the Turkish Navy to Provide W-ECPINS for the MILGEM Corvette New Build Program , OSI Geospatial News Release, 4 June 2009 Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), delivered by STM's subcontractor Yaltes JV, monitors and controls machinery, auxiliary systems, electrical power generation and distribution.

It features a slightly longer hull and the Mk.41 VLS, capable of firing Atmaca, HISAR, RIM-66 Standard, RIM-162 ESSM and VL ASROC missiles, along with other systems for improved multi-role capabilities. The experience and technological know-how gained with the MILGEM project will play an important role in determining the design characteristics and the development process of the s, as well as selection of the systems and equipment which will be used on these significantly larger and more capable warships. Export According to a CNN T√ºrk news report on September 27, 2008, the navies of Canada, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine and a number of South American countries have expressed interest in acquiring MILGEM project warships. News video of TCG HEYBELƒ∞ADA being put to sea, CNN T√ºrk TV, 27 September 2008 On 6 April 2011, Indonesia and Turkey signed cooperation agreement on defense industry including the construction of two Ada-class corvettes for the Indonesian Navy. Endonezya liderinden 300 milyar dolarlik davet , Zaman, 6 April 2011 On 5 July 2018, Pakistani military's ISPR announced that a Turkish firm has won the tender to build four MILGEM corvettes for the Pakistan Navy. Turkish defence minister, Nurettin Canikli, described the deal as ‚Äúthe largest defense export of Turkey in one agreement.‚Äù By September 2018, some details have emerged that corvettes for Pakistan Navy will have CODAD propulsion system instead of CODAG, thus increasing the sea endurance from 10 to 15 days. Further, the first vessel is planned to be constructed in 54 months and the remaining vessels will be constructed in 60, 66 and 72 months, respectively. During IDEAS 2018, Pakistan Navy officials stated that, under the agreement, the fourth ship will be entirely designed and constructed in Pakistan which will become first Jinnah-class frigate. This strengthens the idea that the fourth ship will spur a new line of frigates. Coinciding with the commissioning ceremony of TCG Kƒ±nalƒ±ada attended by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, steel cutting ceremony for the first MILGEM ship for the Pakistan Navy was also held there on September 29, 2019.

The park has many statues and monuments regarding the Korean War. There is also a restaurant, an observation deck, a pool in the shape of the Korean peninsula, and even a small amusement park. The park was built to console those from both sides who are unable to return to their hometowns, friends and families because of the division of Korea. Imjingak is where the \\"Freedom Bridge\\" lies. The Freedom Bridge crosses the Imjin river. It is a former railroad bridge which was used by repatriated POWs/soldiers returning from the North. It is more famous, however, and until 1998 was the only point of egress in the western sector other than Liberty Bridge (which was controlled by the South Korean Army) onto the DMZ, and the only direct link to Camp Greaves, Liberty Bell, and Panmunjom. This is not to be confused with the \\"bridge of freedom\\" which is merely an access bridge to the main span that allowed the one way southbound traffic to pass by while northbound traffic stood waiting its turn to cross; it now crosses a stream adjacent to the Imjin river and connects with the North-South railway.

It is set in England in the late 15th century and centres on the fictitious Prince Edmund, who finds himself falsely accused of witchcraft by a travelling witch hunter known as the Witchsmeller Pursuivant. The story satirises mediaeval superstition and religious belief. Academy Award-nominated actor Frank Finlay guest stars in this episode as the Witchsmeller, and Valentine Dyall appears in a cameo.  Plot  In 1495, Europe is being ravaged by the Black Death, with England being no exception. Even King Richard IV has fallen ill with it, rendering him even more deranged and violent than usual; Prince Edmund goes to visit him and is nearly run through by the plague-addled king, who hallucinates him as a Turk. With the king unable to rule, Harry, Prince of Wales summons the Privy Council to manage the crisis. The noblemen exchange tales of evil omens from around the kingdom, and before long mass hysteria sets in and they declare that the realm is in the grip of witchcraft. Ignoring Prince Edmund's objections, they resolve to summon the Witchsmeller Pursuivant. Prince Edmund, accompanied by Percy and Baldrick, goes to find out more about the Witchsmeller from the local village, but discovers the remains of a woman who has already been burned at the stake for witchcraft, along with her cat. Unbeknown to Edmund, the Witchsmeller lurks among the villagers, watching him as he boasts about his plans to give the Witchsmeller \\"a boot up the backside.\\" Returning to the castle, Edmund is confronted by the Witchsmeller, who invites Edmund to undergo a test to determine if he is a witch. Edmund agrees, but the test is rigged and he is accused of witchcraft. Prince Edmund stands trial; Percy and Baldrick are appointed defence lawyers, but the Witchsmeller silences them before they can even start their case by condemning them also as witches. The proceedings rapidly descend into a farcical show trial. The Witchsmeller interrogates Edmund and presents three pieces of evidence in his case: Prince Edmund, who he dubs \\"The Great Grumbledook\\", has a pet cat named Bubbles (which the Witchsmeller says is \\"short for Beelzebubbles\\") who supposedly drinks blood; he has allegedly engaged in acts of bestiality with his horse, Black Satin, who supposedly has the ability to talk (the horse later dies during interrogation, but leaves a signed \\"confession\\"); and he is accused of having sexual relations with an elderly peasant woman who claims to have then given birth to a poodle. Despite their protests, Edmund, Percy and Baldrick are found guilty and sentenced to burning at the stake. Baldrick uses an unexplained teleportation spell to help the trio escape the courtroom, but the spell deposits them in King Richard's chambers, and the three end up having to be rescued from the delusional king by the guards. Edmund is visited by his mother, the Queen, and his child wife, Princess Leia of Hungary. To Edmund's dismay, they offer no escape plan but instead present him with a small doll for comfort. On the day of the execution, Edmund and his companions have their heads shaved and are tied to stakes. Edmund rebukes Baldrick's last-minute \\"cunning plan\\" and offers a feeble confession before the Witchsmeller. When the pyre is lit, Edmund panics and drops the doll ‚Äì a small, hooded effigy which bears a striking resemblance to the Witchsmeller. As the doll burns, the Witchsmeller suddenly catches fire and is incinerated, revealing it to be a voodoo doll. The pyre is mysteriously extinguished and the ropes tying the condemned men break away, freeing them. In the castle, King Richard emerges from his bed-chamber, freshly recuperated from the bubonic plague.

Due to limitations on budget, only selected actors were filmed on location, including Frank Finlay, who filmed scenes there as the Witchsmeller. A production assistant on the series, Hilary Bevan- Jones, recalls that she forgot to pick up Finlay from the location at the end of a shoot and left him behind, until the make-up team found him wandering in the snow in full Witchsmeller costume and brought him back to the hotel.Roberts, p. 111 Despite budgetary limitations, producer John Lloyd's account of this episode was that \\"it felt more like a huge feature film than a BBC comedy\\" on account of the construction of a large set for the village scene and the extravagant use of costume, make-up, animals and pyrotechnic stunts. Actor Tony Robinson singles out \\"Witchsmeller Pursuivant\\" as the episode in which Baldrick's catchphrase, \\"I have a cunning plan\\", was firmly developed. The phrase had featured in previous episodes ‚Äì it had been used in the pilot episode, and in Episode 2, \\"Born to be King\\", Prince Edmund and Baldrick develop it whilst plotting against Dougal McAngus. Robinson recalls that during the filming of episode 5, he realised that re-using the word \\"cunning\\" could be an effective comedic device and he inserted it into his line \\"I have a plan\\" as Baldrick conspires with Edmund to escape from the dungeon.Roberts, p. 113 Although the credits give recognition to William Shakespeare, unlike previous episodes in this series, the script of \\"Witchsmeller Pursuivant\\" does not contain any direct references to Shakespeare's plays.

Set in late 15th-century England, the episode concludes the alternative history of the last years of the House of York with the final adventure of Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh, son of the fictional King Richard IV. The story follows a conspiracy by Edmund to overthrow the King and seize the Throne of England for himself, assisted by a band of violent mercenaries. This episode features a number of guest stars, including Patrick Allen (who also provided the voiceover introducing each episode in this series) and The Young Ones actors Rik Mayall and Roger Sloman.Roberts, p.121  Plot  On Saint Juniper's Day, 29 January 1498, King Richard IV snubs Prince Edmund, taking away his Duchy and leaving him with the sole dignity of Warden of the Royal Privies, while awarding his brother Harry with several important titles. Finally reaching his breaking point, Edmund declares that he will take over the kingdom. He fires Percy and Baldrick, and begins his quest for glory, aided by a retired Morris dancer. Edmund sets forth into England in search of the six other ‚Äòmost evil men in the kingdom‚Äô: *Sir Wilfred Death (John Hallam), a skilled duellist. *Three-Fingered Pete (Roger Sloman), an archer who only has three fingers on his right hand *Guy de Glastonbury (Patrick Malahide), a highwayman who kills his victims after taking their money. *Sean the Irish Bastard (Ron Cook), a thief who preys on beggars. *Friar Bellows (Paul Brooke), who uses his position to deflower peasant girls. *Jack Large (Big Mick), a dwarf, described as \\"Unspeakably Violent Jack, the bull-buggering priest-killer of no fixed abode\\". Edmund plans to ride home and then to summon them all by sending a black-haired messenger. They are to gather in the tavern of the recently deceased old Jasper (slain by Friar Bellows), before heading out to seize the royal courts and thus the kingdom. Edmund suggests they exile the Royal Family for life; however, the rest of the band are surprised, and Glastonbury says they should kill them, to which Edmund reluctantly agrees. After his comrades disperse, Edmund's plan hits a severe setback. The Morris Dancer casts off his disguise to reveal himself as Edmund's childhood rival, Philip of Burgundy, nicknamed ‚ÄòThe Hawk‚Äô (Patrick Allen). Philip has just arrived in England after 15 years of exile in France, an exile for which Edmund was apparently responsible. As revenge, Philip locks Edmund in a prison cell, to be devoured by snails, which he says will take 15 years to happen. There is another inmate in the cell, Mad Gerald (Rik Mayall), who has been incarcerated for 20 years and whose best friend is a rat. After 12 months of rambling insanely to a bored Edmund, in late December, Gerald shows the Prince a key he had made from his own teeth. Edmund seizes the key, successfully opens the cell door and escapes. Gerald opts not to follow him, instead complaining that Edmund had not closed the door behind him. The first person Edmund meets after escaping from prison is a man seeking to sell five black homing pigeons and one black homing chicken. While the seller's initial asking price is six shillings, he generously invites Edmund to beat him up, gag him, tie him to a tree and steal the pigeons, an offer the Prince gratefully accepts. Edmund promptly sends the pigeons to fly to his fellow conspirators. However, Philip of Burgundy beats the gang to the royal castle, and, when they arrive, promptly persuades them to abandon Edmund and adopt him as their leader, after Edmund talks of Philip's bad attributes. Edmund's protestations that Philip is a twisted, ruthless killer who murdered his own family, only increases Philip's standing in their eyes. Philip then forces Edmund into a torture chair, in which he is horribly mutilated (his ears and hands are chopped off, his skull is cracked, a spike rams up into his anus, and he is castrated). Just then, Percy and Baldrick, disguised as serving wenches, serve the conspirators poisoned wine, killing them. Sean survives, but takes another drink saying ‚ÄòIt's got a little bit of sting in its tail‚Äô, and dies. As a bandaged Edmund lies on his deathbed with the entire court mourning over him, his father wakes him up by loudly shouting ‚ÄòEDMUND!‚Äô Edmund, surprised that his father had, for the first time, got his name right, mutters ‚ÄòFather, you called me Edmund.‚Äô Richard answers ‚ÄòSorry, Edgar‚Äô (even though everyone else present was calling him Edmund) and proposes a toast for his son. Asked by Edmund to call him by his nom de guerre, Richard calls a further toast, to ‚ÄòThe Black Dagger‚Äô. As Percy had unwittingly poisoned the entire batch of wine, the entire royal court dies after drinking the wine. Edmund correctly deduces that the wine was what killed them, but foolishly decides to take a sip to check. Believing the wine is not the killer, as he has not immediately died, he declares himself King of England (thus fulfilling the prophecy of the witches from \\"The Foretelling\\"), only for the wine to kill him moments later. After the credits, Percy and Baldrick run in to stop the court drinking the wine, only to find they are too late. Cast The closing credits of this episode list the cast members \\"in order of disappearance\\".Roberts, p.420 The important characters are in bold. *John Carlisle as Murdered Lord *Bert Parnaby as Cain, a Blind Beggar *Roy Evans as Abel, a Blind Beggar *Forbes Collins as the Trusting Father *Des Webb as the Person of Unrestricted Growth *John Barrard as the Retired Morris Dancer *Rik Mayall as Mad Gerald (credited as Himself) *Perry Benson as the Pigeon Vendor *Paul Brooke as Friar Bellows *Big Mick as Jack Large *Roger Sloman as Three Fingered Pete *Patrick Malahide as Guy of Glastonbury *John Hallam as Sir Wilfred Death *Patrick Allen as The Hawk *Ron Cook as Sean, The Irish Bastard *Robert East as Harry, Prince of Wales *Elspet Gray as The Queen *Brian Blessed as King Richard IV *Rowan Atkinson as The Flat Adder (he lost his duchy early on in the episode) *Tony Robinson as Baldrick *Tim McInnerny as Percy the Poisoner *Gareth Milne as Stuntman Production Voiceover artist and actor Patrick Allen, who narrated the entire series, portrayed Philip of Burgundy, the episode's main antagonist Guest actors featured in each of the episodes of The Black Adder to lend both a sense of theatrical gravitas and comedic interpretation. For the final episode, well-known comedy actors were cast to play supporting roles. Rik Mayall, who had established himself in the 1982 comedy series The Young Ones, appeared as Mad Gerald. At his own request, Mayall was not credited in the cast list (Mad Gerald was billed as ‚ÄòHimself‚Äô); as with his appearances as Kevin Turvey in A Kick Up the Eighties (1982), Mayall liked to experiment at this time with a form of performance which blurred the boundaries between fact and fiction, and encouraged the audience to believe the action was really happening. His appearance marked his first collaboration with Rowan Atkinson, and it was noted that their work together took on a competitive edge; Mayall would dominate the set and preferred to rewrite his own lines. The competitiveness continued into their next appearance together in Black Adder II, when Mayall played the role of the overbearing womaniser, Lord Flashheart.Roberts, pp.121‚Äì122 Patrick Allen was cast in the role of Edmund's nemesis, Philip of Burgundy. Allen was an established actor, but it was his prolific voiceover roles in a range of films that had associated his voice with grand, swashbuckling productions, from the 1956 anthology series The Errol Flynn Theatre to Don't Lose Your Head and Carry On... Up the Khyber, two noted British historical comedy movies. By casting Allen, Atkinson sought to create an association with these popular films. In an earlier version of \\"The Black Seal\\", Allen was to play a greater role, disguising himself as a messenger who was to bear tidings of Edmund's accidental beheading in a bear trap; the story was to end with Baldrick remarking that they had fallen victim to \\"someone else's cunning plan\\".Roberts, pp.122‚Äì123 This episode concludes the alternate history of King Richard IV which was set in motion in Episode I, \\"The Foretelling\\", and which diverges from the established history of Henry VII, who reigned as King of England from 1485 to 1509. No mention of Richard's successor is made in Episode 6, but within The Black Adder narrative, it must be assumed that the accidental poisoning of the entire royal court created the opportunity for Henry Tudor to seize power. As with previous episodes of The Black Adder, the end credits of \\"The Black Seal\\" include an acknowledgement of \\"additional dialogue by William Shakespeare\\". In this episode, overt Shakespearian reference is limited to Edmund's rousing address to his gang of mercenaries, in which he declares ‚ÄòWe few, we happy few, we band of ruthless bastards!‚Äô ‚Äì words adapted from Henry V's St Crispin's Day Speech before the Battle of Agincourt (Henry V, Act 4, Scene III). Critical assessment The Black Adder series has been noted for blurring the boundaries between traditional situation comedy and historical drama. This was partly achieved through careful casting (described above) but also through references to classic cinema productions; in \\"The Black Seal\\", Prince Edmund's quest to find the seven most evil men in the land is seen as a deliberate nod to (and satire on) the films Seven Samurai (1954) and its Western remake The Magnificent Seven (1960). It was also Rowan Atkinson's stated aim to draw inspiration from Errol Flynn's 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood, and there are clear parallels between Prince Edmund's band of outlaws and Robin Hood's Merry Men (both of which include an overweight friar character).Marshall, p.118 The presence of Rik Mayall in the episode (albeit uncredited) is one of a number of cameos by established performers on the flourishing alternative comedy circuit of the 1980s, and links Blackadder series with more subversive comedy styles being developed at this time.Marshall, p.116 References  External links  * Category:Blackadder episodes Category:1983 British television episodes Category:Fiction set in the 1490s Category:Television shows written by Rowan Atkinson Category:Television shows written by Richard Curtis ","title":"The Black Seal"},{"id":"7186818","text":"Christina Hattler is an American fashion designer.

They migrated into the area by the seventeenth century, encroaching on the Eastern Dakota people who historically occupied the area. The Ojibwe defeated the Eastern Dakota and had their last battle in 1745, after which the Dakota Sioux migrated west into the Great Plains. While sharing a common culture and Anishinaabe language, this group of Ojibwe is highly decentralized, with at least twelve independent bands in this region. In the nineteenth century, the leaders of the bands negotiated together as the Lake Superior Chippewa with the United States government under a variety of treaties to protect their historic territories against land theft by European- American settlers. The United States set up several reservations for bands in this area under the treaties culminating in one in 1854. This enabled the people to stay in this territory rather than to be forced west of the Mississippi River, as the government had attempted. Under the treaty, the bands with reservations have been federally recognized as independent tribes; several retain Lake Superior Chippewa in their formal names to indicate their shared culture. Origins Sometime earlier than 1650, the Ojibwe split into two groups near present-day Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This is believed to have been one of the stops which their prophets predicted in their migration; it was part of the path of the Anishinaabe, which they had traveled for centuries, in their passage west from the Atlantic Coast. The Ojibwe who followed the south shore of Lake Superior found the final prophesied stopping place and \\"the food that grows on water\\" (wild rice) at Madeline Island. During the late 17th century, the Ojibwe at Madeline Island began to expand to other territory: they had population pressures, a desire for furs to trade, and increased factionalism caused by divisions over relations with French Jesuit missions. For a time they had an alliance with the Eastern Dakota. Beginning about 1737, they competed for nearly 100 years with the Eastern Dakota and the Fox tribes in the interior of Wisconsin west and south of Lake Superior. The Ojibwe were technologically more advanced, having acquired guns through trading with the French, which for a time gave them an advantage. They eventually drove the Dakota Sioux out of most of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota into the western plains.James K. Bokern, History and the Primary Canoe Routes of the Six Bands of Chippewa from the Lac Du Flambeau District , unpublished Masters Thesis, 1987, prepared under supervision at University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.\\"Lac Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\\", Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council, 2005, accessed 1 September 2012 The Sioux (Lakota) were pushed to the west, where they eventually settled in the Great Plains of present-day Nebraska and the Dakotas. The Ojibwe successfully spread throughout the Great Lakes region, with colonizing bands settling along lakes and rivers throughout what would become northern Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota in the United States. La Pointe on Madeline Island remained the spiritual and commercial center of the nation. The island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sub-nation The Lake Superior Chippewa are numerous and contain many bands. A separate sub-nation, known as the Biitan-akiing-enabijig (Border Sitters), were located between the Ojibwe of the Lake Superior watershed and other nations. The Biitan-akiing- enabijig were divided into three principal Bands: *Manoominikeshiinyag (the \\"Ricing Rails\\" or St. Croix Chippewa Indians, in the St. Croix River valley); *Odaawaa-zaaga'iganiwininiwag (the \\"Ottawa Lake Men\\", around Lac Courte Oreilles); and *Waaswaaganiwininiwag (the \\"Torch Men\\", around Lac du Flambeau). Numerous sub-bands also existed. Treaties and reservations In a series of treaties with the US Government in the mid-nineteenth century, the Lake Superior Chippewa were formally grouped as a unit, which included the *Mississippi, *Pillager, *Bois Forte, *Muskrat Portage, *Red Lake *Pembina and *La Pointe bands. The various villages had been politically independent and did not have a centralized tribal authority. In the winter of 1851, President Zachary Taylor ordered the removal of the Lake Superior Chippewa west of the Mississippi River, as had already been forced on most other tribes in the east. During the course of it, the US Army attacked the people in what has become known as the Sandy Lake Tragedy, during which several hundred Chippewa died, including women and children. The La Pointe chief Kechewaishke (Buffalo) went to Washington, DC to appeal to the government for relief. National outrage had been aroused by the many deaths of the Ojibwe, and the US ended attempts at Ojibwe removal. The final treaty in 1854 established permanent reservations in Michigan at L'Anse, Lac Vieux Desert, and Ontonagon. In 1934 under the Indian Reorganization Act, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community was defined as successor apparent to the L'Anse, Lac Vieux Desert, and Ontonagon bands. Government functions were centralized with it, although all three reservations were retained. In 1988 the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa Indians succeeded in gaining federal recognition as a separate tribe.\\"Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa Indian Community\\", Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, 2012 Together with the Keneewaw Bay tribe, it is part of the Inter- Tribal Council of Michigan, which represents 11 of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan. These include tribes of Potowatomi and Odawa peoples who, together with the Ojibwe, have made up the Council of Three Fires. In Wisconsin, reservations were established at Red Cliff, Bad River, Lac Courte Oreilles, and Lac du Flambeau. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands, left out of the 1854 treaty, did not obtain tribal lands or federal recognition until the 1930s after the Indian Reorganization Act. In Minnesota, reservations were set up at Fond du Lac and Grand Portage. Other bands, such as the Bois Forte Band, continued independent negotiations with the US government and ended political affiliation with the Lake Superior Chippewa. Today Today the bands are politically independent and are federally recognized as independent tribes with their own governments. They remain culturally closely connected to each other. They have engaged in common legal actions concerning treaty rights, such as fishing for walleye. Many bands include \\"Lake Superior Chippewa\\" in their official tribal names to indicate their historic and cultural affiliations (Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, etc.) Historical bands and political successors apparent are the following: * Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, merged from ** L'Anse Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (historical) ** Ontonagon Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (historical) * Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa * La Pointe Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (historical): descendants are ** Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa ** Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians * Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians * Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa * St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (historical): descendants are ** Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, merged from *** Mille Lacs Indians (historical) *** Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa (historical) *** Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa (historical) *** Snake and Kettle River Bands of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota (historical) ** St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin * Sokaogon Chippewa Community * Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa * Grand Portage Band * Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, merged from ** Lake Vermilion Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (historical) ** Little Forks Band of Rainy River Saulteaux (historical) ** Nett Lake Band of Rainy River Saulteaux (historical) In addition to the full political Successors Apparent, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (via the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota), Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe (via Removable Fond du Lac Band of the Chippewa Indian Reservation), and the White Earth Band of Chippewa (via the Removable St. Croix Chippewa of Wisconsin of the Gull Lake Indian Reservation) in present-day Minnesota retain minor Successorship to the Lake Superior Chippewa.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1960 to 1969 for the Kansas City Athletics, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Kansas City Royals. Wickersham while playing college ball at Ohio University was scouted by Branch Rickey and George Sisler. The Pittsburgh Pirates signed him in 1955. He was later acquired by the Kansas City Athletics in the 1959 minor league draft. He pitched for the Athletics in part of two seasons from 1960‚Äì61. In 1962 he had an 11‚Äì4 mark and led American League pitchers with a .733 winning percentage, and went 12‚Äì15 and 3.78 in 1963. At the end of that season, he was sent to the Detroit Tigers in the same trade that brought slugger Rocky Colavito to the Athletics. Wickersham enjoyed his most productive season for Detroit in 1964, when he went 19‚Äì12 with a 3.44 ERA and posted career-numbers in strikeouts (164), starts (36), complete games (11), appearances (40) and innings pitched (254.0), being considered in the American League MVP vote. His 19 victories also was a career-mark, missing a 20-win season due to an ejection in his last start from a ballgame which was tied 1‚Äì1 in the 7th inning. Mickey Lolich relieved him and earned a 4‚Äì2 win. Wickersham was ejected after calling time out three times to try to keep a base runner from advancing as Norm Cash argued with the call by Bill Valentine. Wickersham, a born-again Christian, had never been ejected from any game all his life up to the time this took place. Valentine apparently deeply regretted the call for years, saying he had been \\"too impulsive\\" in his ejection; however, Wickersham wrote him a letter in 2004, reassuring the ump that he made the right call, in an attempt to relieve him of his burden. Wikcersham in 1966 Dave Wickersham signed his autograph with a Bible verse, Colossians 3:17: \\"And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\\" Wickersham also pitched for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals. He had been traded by the Tigers to the Pirates for Dennis Ribant on November 28, 1967.Joyce, Dick. \\"L.A.

In a 10-season career, Wickersham posted a 68‚Äì57 record with 638 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA in 1123 innings, including 29 complete games, five shutouts and 18 saves. Notably, Wickersham has been one of four players (fellow pitchers Aurelio Monteagudo, Moe Drabowsky and Ken Sanders being the other three) to play for both Kansas City-based major league teams, the Athletics and Royals.

A maternal uncle to the emperor Aurangzeb, he acted as a key figure during his reign. Shaista Khan initially governed the Deccan, where he clashed with the Maratha ruler Shivaji. However, he was most notable for his tenure as the governor of Bengal from 1664 to 1688. Under Shaista Khan's authority, the city of Dhaka and Mughal power in the province attained its greatest heights. One of this notable achievements was the Mughal conquest of Chittagong. Early life Shaista Khan was of Persian origin. His grandfather Mirza Ghiyas Beg and father Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan were the wazirs of the Mughal emperors Jahangir and Shah Jahan, respectively. He also had familial connections with the imperial dynasty, having been a paternal nephew of the empress Nur Jahan and the brother of the empress Mumtaz Mahal. Jahangir awarded the title of Shaista Khan to Mirza in recognition of his family's service and position in the Mughal court. Shaista Khan trained and served with the Mughal army and court, winning multiple promotions and being appointed governor of various provinces. He also developed a reputation as a successful military commander and grew close to his nephew, the prince Aurangzeb, when the duo fought against the kingdom of Golconda. Confrontation with Shivaji Shivaji attacked Shaista Khan on the night of 5th of April 1663 After Aurangzeb's accession to the Mughal throne in 1659, he sent Shaista Khan as viceroy of the Deccan with a large army to enforce the treaty the Mughals had signed with the Adilshahi of Bijapur. Through the treaty the Adilshahi had ceded territory that it had previously captured from the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, to the Mughals. However,the territory was also fiercely contested by Maratha ruler, Shivaji who had acquired a reputation after his killing of Adilshahi general, Afzal Khan in 1659. In January 1660, Shaista Khan arrived at Aurangabad and quickly advanced, seizing Pune, the centre of Shivaji's realm. He also captured the fort of Chakan and Kalyan and north Konkan after heavy fighting with the Maratha. The Maratha were banned from entering the city of Pune and Mughal distance from the locals turned out to be an error. On the evening of 5 April 1663, a wedding party had obtained special permission for holding a procession. Shivaji and many of his nearly 400 men disguised as the bridegroom's procession members entered Pune. Others entered in small parties dressed as labourers and soldiers of Maratha generals serving under Shaista Khan. After midnight, they raided the Nawab's compound and then entered the palace in an attempt to assassinate him.Jasper, D., 2006. Celebrating a Region through Historical Commemoration. Region, Culture, and Politics in India, p.239. Shaista Khan was unaware and unprepared. The Marathas broke into the courtyard of the palace and slaughtered the palace guards. The Nawab lost three fingers in a skirmish with Shivaji, while his son was killed in an encounter with the Marathas in the palace courtyard. Taking advantage of the confusion and darkness, the Marathas escaped the palace and Pune, despite the widespread camping of Mughal forces. Shocked by the sudden and bold attack in the city, Aurangzeb angrily transferred Shaista Khan to Bengal, even refusing to give him an interview at the time of transfer as was the custom. Subahdar of Bengal Construction of Saat Masjid is credited to Shaista Khan The Choto Katra with its enclosed Mosque, Dhaka (1817) by Charles D'Oyly's and constructed by Shaista Khan. Shaista Khan was appointed the Subahdar of Bengal upon the death of Mir Jumla II in 1663. As governor, he encouraged trade with Europe, Southeast Asia and other parts of India. He consolidated his power by signing trade agreements with European powers. Despite his powerful position he remained loyal to Aurangzeb, often mediating trade disputes and rivalries. He banned the British East India Company from Bengal, sparking Child's War in 1686. Construction projects Shaista Khan encouraged the construction of modern townships and public works in Dhaka, leading to a massive urban and economic expansion. He was a patron of the arts and encouraged the construction of majestic monuments across the province, including mosques, mausoleums and palaces that represented the finest in Indo-Sarcenic and Mughal architecture. Khan greatly expanded Lalbagh Fort, Chowk Bazaar Mosque, Saat Masjid and Choto Katra. He also supervised the construction of the mausoleum for his daughter Bibi Pari.  Conquest of Chittagong  Upon his arrival in Bengal, Shaista Khan was faced with putting down the Arakanese pirates. He began by rebuilding the Mughal navy, increasing its Bengal fleet to 300 battle-ready ships within a year. He also made strenuous diplomatic efforts to win the support of the Dutch East India Company as well as Portugal, which was supporting Arakan with resources and troops. With active Dutch military support, Shaista Khan led Mughal forces on an assault on the island of Sandwip, which lay in Arakanese control. Mughal forces succeeded in capturing the island in November 1665. Shaista Khan gained a considerable advantage when a conflict erupted between the Arakanese and the Portuguese. The Portuguese, led by Captain Moor, set fire to Arakanese fleets and fled to Bhulua where Thanadar Farhad Khan gave them refuge. Farhad then sent them off to Shaista. By promptly offering protection and support, Shaista secured the aid of the Portuguese against the Arakanese. Shaista Khan in later days In December 1665, Shaista Khan launched a major military campaign against Chittagong, which was the mainstay of the Arakanese kingdom. The imperial fleet consisted of 288 vessels of their own and about 40 vessels of the Firingis (Portuguese) as auxiliaries. Ibn Hussain, Shaista Khan's admiral, was asked to lead the navy, while the subahdar himself took up the responsibility of supplying provisions for the campaign. He also ordered Farhad Khan and Mir Murtaza to take the land route. The overall command was given to Buzurg Ummed Khan, a son of Shaista Khan. The Mughals and the Portuguese held sway in the following naval battle. The conquered territory to the western bank of Kashyapnadi (Kaladan river) was placed under direct imperial administration. The name of Chittagong was changed to Islamabad and it became the headquarters of a Mughal faujdar. Khan also re-asserted Mughal control over Cooch Behar and Kamarupa. Upon his victory against the Arakanese, he ordered the release of thousands of Bengali peasants being held captive by the Arakanese forces. Legacy Pari Bibi's tomb inside Lalbagh Fort complex In his late years, Shaista Khan left Dhaka and returned to Delhi. His legacy was the expansion of Dhaka into a regional centre of trade, politics and culture; a thriving and prosperous city from a small township. The Shaista Khan Mosque is a massive standing monument to Shaista Khan, built on his palace grounds. Incorporating unique elements of Bengali and Mughal architecture, it is a major tourist attraction and a valued historical monument protected by the Government of Bangladesh today. Legend The rule of Shaista Khan is, sometimes, considered as golden age of Bengal. It is said that eight 'mon' (around 295 kilogram) processed rice or 'chaal' could be bought with one taka. Still in Bangladesh, cheap price conditions are known as Reign of Shaista Khan ('Shayesta Khan-r aamol').

It retained the status of a city until 1928 when it was merged with Rostov. History Monument to alt=f In the summer of 1778, after the Crimean Khanate was made a Russian vassal state, some 12,600 Armenians of the Crimean peninsula were resettled by General Alexander Suvorov in the Don region. The Russian Empire sought to strengthen Novorossiya, which was vital in completely absorbing the Crimea. Empress Catherine the Great granted some 86,000 ha of land to the Armenians by a November 14, 1779 decree. A third of the Armenians perished en route and during the first winter. The settlement of New Nakhichevan was founded by the survivors. It \\"rapidly grew into an important town with its own cathedral and seminary.\\" In 1894 the Armenian community erected the Alexander Column in Nakhichevan-on-Don to celebrate the Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Around the turn of the twentieth century it was part of the Don Host Oblast. In 1896 it had an estimated population of 32,174, of which 14,618 (45.4%) were native residents and 17,556 (54.6%) were nonresidents. The Armenian Apostolic population was estimated at 18,895 (58.7%), Orthodox at 10,965 (34.1%), others (Jews, Old Believers, Muslims, Catholics, Protestants) at 2,314 (7.1%). According to the 1897 Russian Imperial census the city had a population of 28,427. East Slavic-speakers (Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians) made up around two-thirds of the population (19,224), while Armenians (8,277) comprised a significant minority (29.1%).

Over three decades later, on April 1, 1972, the Suryeo Line closed, though two years later, on December 31, 1975, the Seoul Subway began services to Suwon. The Suin Line and narrow gauge services were both terminated on January 1, 1996. Plans Suin Line will once again be connecting Suwon to Incheon from sometime in December 2019. Building Inside Suwon Station Suwon Station shares a building with AK Plaza. The station itself is above ground (for all services) and underground (for metro services only). There are many stores and restaurants located in the station and outside of the station. Also, there is Lotte Department Store back from the station. The mall consists of a shopping mall and the Lotte Cinema theater. And there is Suwon Station Transit Center connected to Suwon station. In a survey conducted in 2011 by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs on 92 Administrative divisions across the country, it reported that the bus stop, near Suwon Railway Station and AK Plaza, was the most frequently used, with a daily average of 77,326 people boarding and 63,255 people alighting.

Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book, listing it as translated by Mrs. Skavgaard-Pedersen. Synopsis A boy called set out to seek service. He was rude to an old man, refusing to give up the way, but entered his service. The old man set him to keep some rooms clean and scatter sand on the floor, told him where to find food and let him wear clothing that was there, and forbade him to enter one room. The boy immediately cleaned nothing but his own room, and then, after some days, went into the room. He found a heap of bones and some books; he took one book, found it was magical, and learned shapeshifting from it. He ran away to home, but his father thought he had stolen the fine clothing and sent him off. The boy told him to sell the dog he would find by the door the next day, but be sure to take the strap back. The dog appeared, and at his wife's insistence, the father sold it and kept the strap. When the boy appeared again, his father still would not admit him. The boy told him to sell a cow that would appear the next day, and to the king, but he must take its halter and come back by the forest. The cow appeared, and the man sold it, but when the butcher went to kill it, it turned to a dove and flew off. The king sent men after the man, but he had gone by the forest, and they did not find him. The father would still not accept his son. The next day, it was a horse, but because the buyer offered as much for the bridle as for the horse, the father sold it as well. The old man led the horse off to have it shod. The smith offered him a drink first, and the horse persuaded a servant maid to free him. He turned to a dove and flew off. The old man pursued as a hawk, but the boy turned into a gold ring and fell before the princess, and she took him up. He turned into a man alone with her, and they met often for a long time. One day, the king saw him, and had his daughter shut up in a tower. But the princess and the boy fell through a tunnel there, to a golden castle, and when the king opened the tower for the funeral, there were no bodies. He sent a soldier down it. The soldier told them that the king was sorry. The boy went back to him, disguised as a king, and asked what should be done to a king who had buried his daughter alive for loving a peasant. The king said that he should be burned and his ashes scattered. The boy told him that he was the man, but pardoned him, and the wedding was held.

It runs along the east side of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field and empties into the Pacific Ocean, near the town of Caleta Tortel. The river forms a delta, dividing into two major arms, of which only the northernmost one is navigable. Its characteristic turquoise-blue color is due to the glacial sediments deposited in it. It was the proposed site of a controversial major hydro-electric project, involving five dams, to be the biggest in the history of Chile. Called HidroAys√©n, the project was a joint venture between Endesa Chile a subsidiary of the international energy conglomerate Enel, and Colb√∫n S.A. a subsidiary of Minera Valpara√≠so. The series of hydro-electric dams were proposed along both the Baker and Pascua rivers, two of Chile's mightiest rivers.

It is one of twelve graduate schools at Penn and one of several dental schools in Pennsylvania. It is part of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. History Dental students observing in the Oral Surgery Clinic at the former Philadelphia General Hospital, 1910 Penn Dental Medicine's earliest instance was the Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery, which was founded in 1852. The school was renamed the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery in 1878. That same year, Dr. Charles J. Essig founded the Dental Department of the University of Pennsylvania, serving as the first Dean until 1883. Later, in 1909, the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery was absorbed into the Penn. The school's first facilities were housed in Medical Hall, later renamed Logan Hall and now Claudia Cohen Hall. This building was later home to the Wharton School, and currently houses several departments of the School of Arts and Sciences. In 1879, Penn Dental Medicine moved to Dental Hall, its first own building. In 1897, a dentist and native of Philadelphia by the name of Thomas W. Evans left his estate to create and maintain a dental school that would be \\"not inferior to any already established.\\" Evans' generosity made possible the construction of the Evans Building (officially called the Thomas W. Evans Museum and Dental Institute) which opened in 1915, the best-equipped dental building in the nation at that time. In 1909, the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery merged its assets and records with Penn. Facilities Penn Dental's Thomas W. Evans Institute Penn Dental has three main buildings, all of which are connected to each other. The Robert Schattner Center, dedicated in 2002, serves as the main entrance to the Dental campus. It has clinical facilities on three levels dedicated to oral surgery to oral and maxillofacial surgery, an emergency clinic, and a faculty practice. The center bears the name of visionary benefactor and Penn Dental alumnus Robert Schattner (D‚Äô48), whose gift played a leadership role in successfully funding the building project. The Leon Levy Center for Oral Health Research, dedicated in 1969, is the school's hub of research activities, made possible by the generosity of Dr. Leon Levy (D'1915). Levy spent most of his life in the communications field (including helping form the Columbia Broadcasting System). The center plays a pivotal role in Penn Dental, providing a home for basic science faculty and the facilities needed to support research programs. Penn remains among the few dental schools in the country with its own basic science faculty and a leader in oral health sciences research. The Thomas W. Evans Museum and Dental Institute, originally dedicated in 1915, is named for one of Penn Dental's earliest benefactors, Thomas W. Evans. Evans built a dental career on the other side of the Atlantic, becoming the dental surgeon and confidant of Napoleon III. The collegiate gothic, Tutor-style building was considered the most advanced dental teaching facility in the nation when completed in 1915 and helped establish new standards for teaching clinical dentistry in the United States. Today, the Evans Building remains the site of most of the school‚Äôs classroom instruction and clinical training. In the atrium of the Schattner Center sits the carriage that Evans and Napoleon III's wife, Eug√©nie de Montijo, used to escape Prussia's invasion into France. Research The school‚Äôs research enterprise is multidisciplinary, spanning both the basic and clinical sciences, concerned with the structures and functions of tissues and fluids and microbial flora in the oral cavity. Collectively, Penn Dental Medicine investigators contribute to the emerging science and practices shaping dental care. Investigations range from such areas as oral microbiology and virology, inflammation and immunity, tooth development, and the use of analgesics and sedatives, to the cellular biology of connective tissues and bone, the applications for state-of-the-art dental materials, and the causes and effects of periodontal disease. Interdisciplinary research is a hallmark of the University of Pennsylvania, and Penn Dental Medicine investigators collaborate extensively with faculty throughout the Penn campus.

Ford. Plot In the novel, large deposits of dilithium are detected on a colony planet, and delegations are sent by the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire to negotiate for mining rights (neither able to openly fight against the other because of the \\"Organian Lightbulbs\\", a reference to the Organians from the original series). They find the planet Direidi and its inhabitants to be very strange indeed. Planet inhabitants occasionally break into song to explain their narratives or seemingly attack the visitors. Both crews (as well as the three-person crew of the Federation prospector that found the planet in the first place) get into various adventures with the planet's inhabitants and each other. In the end, it turns out that the inhabitants have set everything up according to \\"Plan C\\"--Comedy. All of the adventures the two crews encountered were designed to soften them up so that they wouldn't mine the whole planet, but would be willing to work with the inhabitants and each other. Klingons The Klingons in this novel are based in the historical and cultural backstory created by Ford for his earlier novel The Final Reflection, which differs in many respects from the Klingon culture developed independently in later Star Trek television series. However, Ford uses elements from the Marc Okrand-developed Klingonese (which became the canonical Klingon language) mixed with Ford's own invented Klingonaase. U.S.S.

A new version of Metal-Head was released in 1994 as part of the Battle Corps line and again in 2005 as part of a Convention Exclusive. Comics Marvel Comics In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe series, he first appeared in #114. Metal-Head joined Destro's Iron Grenadier army as his anti-tank specialist. When he began working for Cobra, he was there as a double-agent, spying on Cobra Commander for Destro. The Joes first encountered Metal-Head during the Battle of Benzheen when he personally went up against a group of G.I. Joe armored vehicles on foot, armed with his advanced missile system. Before the battle could be won, it was announced that Benzheen's Emir made a deal with Cobra, putting an end to hostilities. Metal-Head soon reported back to Destro in Scotland, warning that Cobra was planning to attack Castle Destro. Cobra Commander proved him right by launching an attack that led to the destruction of the castle. Metal-Head was not seen working for Destro or Cobra for years after the battle.

Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #25 (October 1993) Animated series DiC Metal-Head had many appearances in the second G.I. Joe animated series produced by DiC Entertainment, voiced by Garry Chalk. Here, he is a madman who liked to blast everything and everyone usually screaming \\"BANG!\\" while firing weapons (although this makes him a lot more faithful to his filecard). He very much served as a comic relief and a source of frustration for Cobra Commander (thereby not making him as formidable as he might seem and easier for G.I. Joe to take on). In the first season, he was frequently partnered with the Dreadnok, Gnawgahyde and appearing in numerous episodes His main weakness appears to be his grandmother, who is clearly disappointed with his lot in life.

However, Metal-Head has admitted to his cohorts that he has been lying to his grandmother through letters that GI Joe is an oppressive organization and he is Cobra Commander. Freefall infiltrates the Fortress and uses his knowledge of Metal-Head's fibs to his Granny to maintain cover. He is soon joined by Pathfinder as the Fortress attacks Chicago. Joe forces are unable to dent the Fortress from outside, but when Metal-head Granny learns the truth and that Cobra Commander is trying to take control of Chicago (and realizes that \\"honorable men\\" like him do not put their feet on the furniture) so she defects by helping Freefall and Pathfinder overload the Fortress's engines while Grid-Iron with others Joes are fighting the Cobra troops and pushing back their attacks.

It was first published as a hardback by Lion Stone Books in 2002, and later published as a paperback by Scholastic Inc. in 2006. Plot introduction Sender Unknown is about a young businessman named Mark, who orders toys from a catalog to give to children of employees of the company he works for. What is delivered is not what Mark expected, and he has to deal with it until he can finally return it.  Setting  Sender Unknown is set far in the future, when technology has progressed greatly. People no longer read books or magazines made of paper; only virtual books. For entertainment, children play computer games, and reading books is unheard of. No children play with toys, or anything that you can feel for that matter. Belief in anything illogical (such as magic) is also gone from the world. Talking to other people about anything mystical is considered rude, and even holidays have been banned from the world. There is also a distinct lack of crime in the world. This is also because technology has evolved so far that nobody is able to commit any crimes. Nonetheless, the world of Sender Unknown is vaguely similar to the world we live in today. People drive in cars, spend their days similarly, and do not have as many automated things as might be expected for the future.  Summary Mark, a young man, has just moved into a grand new house in a new neighborhood so that he can hold a company party at his house. He doesn't like his new house and would prefer living in his small cottage on the outskirts of town, but has no choice. While moving in, Mark discovers that hard copies of magazines are delivered to his house every day except Sunday. Perhaps what is the most curious of the magazines is that they are filled with things that most people wouldn't buy: Toys. For a while, Mark simply ignores the magazines, keeping piles of them in his house. Finally, he decides to order something from them, just to see what happens. He orders ten action figures to give to the children of employees at Cannady and Company In the meantime, Mark is getting ready for a company party that is to be held at his house. His assistant Elliot follows him around trying to convince him that his boss, Mr. Cannady won't be pleased if the company party is held in a house with no furniture. Mark's constant teasing of Elliot during their preparation for the party about how he is never relaxed is one of the book's many sources of humor. One day when Mark gets home from work, he discovers four huge crates on his front porch. He has no idea where they could have possibly come from, after all, he has only ordered small action figures so far. He opens the crates and discovers the first four children, along with a note saying that three more toys are on their way, one is back ordered, and one is recuperating. Desperately, Mark tried to find a way to return the children, but his efforts are futile. Unable to figure out what to do with the children, Mark goes to his sister Kate to ask her for advice. Of course he can't tell her that he ordered the children from a catalog, so he tells her that he is foster parenting them. She is flabbergasted at the idea that Mark would take in children when he is so busy with his new job, but agrees to watch them for a while. Unfortunately for Mark, a while turns out to be only one night. Luckily, he is able to find a new babysitter for the kids: Lady A (Lady Anderson), who owns a quirky store Mark orders from often. Lady A also believes that Mark is the children's foster parent. Lady A also brings a problem for Mark though: she reminds him that the children need to be enrolled in school. For the time being, Mark decides to keep the kids, but he doesn't know exactly what he is going to do yet. One day, when riding in a taxicab to the book store, Mark meets an ex-cop named Pete. Pete and Mark talk for a while, and Mark learns that Pete knows someone who worked in DNA registration. Mark has a revelation and realizes that Pete could hold all of the answers to the questions he has. Mark offers Pete a job: to help him register the children's DNA and get them official identification until he can figure out how to return the children. He also asks Pete to help him track the magazines. Pete accepts. Mark is feeling great right until he gets home that day and sees two more huge boxes on the front porch, and finds two more children. The next day, Pete arrives at Mark's house to collect DNA from the (now seven) children. Pete tells Mark that because he had to quit his job as taxi driver, he and his granddaughter need a place to stay while he works on the project. Mark warmly welcomes Pete into his house. Pete has the DNA checks done, and discovers that all of the children's DNA is synthetic. He then tells Mark about the website where ID records are stored, and that Mark has to figure out a way into the records. It takes Mark about 20 minutes to hack into the records. Once he is done, Pete calls a friend who knows how to access the proper virtual-forms that are required for registering DNA. When Pete's associate has pulled up the necessary forms for Mark, he fills them in and submits them. Much to Mark's dismay, Pete has had no luck tracking down the company that is sending the magazines. When things start to look a little more promising for Mark, he receives a large crate in the mail, with BACK ORDERED stamped across the front. Out of this crate comes yet another child. A few days later, Mark is at a party with Lady A when the last box comes in the mail. Inside this box is Castor, the cyborg. When Mark sees that Castor cannot be in any way from this planet, he begins to think about genetic engineering as a possibility for the appearance of all the children. He uses company funds to pay for viewing rights of secure documents regarding genetic engineering that have absolutely no relation to his current project at work, and discovers that genetic engineering is not only common, but the fine for it is measly, and not likely to stop anybody from doing any of their experiments. The night of the party at Mark's house finally arrives. It is the time for all of Elliot's nagging to pay off. Other than the caterers leaving in the middle of the party because of an impending snow storm, all goes well. Mr. Cannady and the rest of the guests really enjoy the party. Then the snowstorm hits, causing the power to go out, and everyone's cars get snowed in. Luckily, Mark is able to entertain most of the guests. When most people can't stand to wait at the house any longer, the children show their true abilities. Sam flies to peoples' houses to check on their children, Rollo magically fixes the furnace, and Castor starts heating up (and starting) peoples' cars. But the one act that transforms most of the people in the party from non-believers in fairy tales to believers is when Mark is hit by a falling tree, and Sam lifts the entire tree off of him. Although normally most people would consider this a trick of the eyes, those at the party have seen so much that they cannot possibly deny that something unnatural is going on, despite what society may tell them. Mark realizes that he has brought belief in fairy tales back to people in the world who had only believed in logic before. He felt so connected to the children that he finally decided for sure that he was going to keep the children just as they were. If possible, he might even try to find more people with catalog children like him, and share his information. Finally, as Mark was going through a box owned by his father in his attic, he discovered a little tag. On the tag, it said \\"Unknown experiment.\\" In his father's handwriting is \\"My son\\". Mark throws away the tag and it is hinted as he was going to ask Lady A to marry him.  Characters   Humans  ; Mark (Markham) - The youngest employee of the firm Cannady and Company.

Programmes featured a group of experts from various paranormal specialties attempting to find the identity of hidden visitors, resembling a combination of Front Page Challenge, What's My Line? and The Amazing World of Kreskin. This CBC Television series was recorded in Winnipeg. Its first season of 13 episodes began airing on 27 June 1977.  Premise  In each half-hour episode, there are two rounds, each with a hidden guest. The three-member panel usually consists of an astrologer, either a palmist or a graphologist, and a clairvoyant and whose task is to determine the identity of the visiting guest. The astrologer is given only the guest's birth date and time. The palmist only sees a palm print of the guest. The graphologist is given a sample of the guest's handwriting. The clairvoyant is given one of the guest's personal items. Each panelist is seated in his or her own sound-proof booth so that they cannot communicate with each other while attempting to discover the guest's identity. Each panelist is given approximately ninety seconds to make as many statements they believe true about the hidden guest, with one point awarded for every correct assertion confirmed by the guest as true or false. They are awarded an extra twenty points if they correctly guess the guest's identity, with partial points awarded depending on how close their guess of the identity is to reality. The panelist with the most points at the end of the episode is declared the winner of that episode.

At the 2016 census, its population was 34,469, in 10,207 families. Gerashis speak Achomi, a language shared with many neighboring cities including Evaz, Arad, Fedagh, Khonj, and Bastak. The Gerashi variant of the Achomi language includes two accents: Nassagi () and Barqe-Roozi (, commonly known as Belalizi). Despite the high volatility in the population due to seasonal migration, the population is estimated to be at around 50,000. People The people of Gerash were native Persians following the Zoroastrian faith before converting to Shia Islam in the 5th century of Hegira (11th century AD) by Amir Mohi al-Din Ibn Amir Qotb al-Din Ibn Amir Rooh al-Din, a direct descendant of Muhammad, and an aide of Afeef-Addeen Al Musawi, to whom the conquest of certain areas in the South of Iran by Arab Muslim warriors is attributed. It is known that Afeef-Addeen left Hijaz (in present-day Saudi Arabia) along with warriors from two tribes from Medina, namely Hawazin Bani Al-Muntafiq and Banu Tamim, and set for the conquest of the Persian South; areas that, due to their dry conditions and mountainous array, had remained immune to the Islamic conquests during the second Caliphate's time. Prior to its conversion to Islam, Gerash was ruled by a Zoroastrian leader by the name of Sarem Khoora (Persian). Descendants of Amir Mohyeddin today include the Saadat family of Gerash, who are commonly known by the prefix \\"Mir\\", which is a short-form for the word \\"Amir\\" (Arabic for either \\"Prince\\" or \\"Commander\\"; commander in this case). This prefix is set in recognition of the family's ancestry, which, as outlined above, includes Muslim warriors who contributed to the Islamic conquests of Southern Persia. Younger members of the family have generally lost this prefix. Many Gerashis have emigrated to the Persian Gulf countries such as UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, working in micro structural variety stores, manual commodity movements, confidential-exports by motorboats, and other similar professions. Recently, migrating locations have changed to include the United Kingdom, United States, and in some cases Canada.

Being located in the center of the city, this hill has now come to shape the very architecture of Gerash, having residential areas built all around it. Historically, Kalat has been home to fierce warriors who've sought refuge in the now demolished \\"Kalaa\\" or fort that was built at some point in the city's history to protect it from offenders. Of the influential artefacts, Berka has had a special place in Gerashis' hearts. Numerous Berkas have been created by philanthropists to save people from dehydration. Such practice still continues in spite of the creation of modern water-pipe capabilities. ÿ™ŸÑÿßÿ¥‚Äå ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖ⁄ØŸäÿ± ŸÖÿ±ÿØŸÖ‚Äå‚Äå ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ⁄Øÿ±ÿßÿ¥‚Äå ÿØÿ± ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤€å ÿπÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ™‚Äå ÿπÿßŸÑŸäÿßÿ™‚Äå - (In Persian) Berke Kaal (Kal Pond) This water storage (aab- anbaar) is one of the strangest, most glorious and most likely, the biggest one made in Iran. Unfortunately, there does not exist any entries or inscription on the structure of this strange building. And if there has been any, it is now completely destroyed. This aab-anbaar has been built and dedicated by Haaj Asad-o-llah son of Karbalaei Alireza Gerashi and the brother of FathAli Khan named as Biglar Beigi Sab‚Äôeh Larestan. The internal diameter of the pond is 19 meters. The pond‚Äôs depth is 21 meters equal to the height of a seven floor building. As residents say its depth had been 12 heights (ghad) and each height has been equal to 175 centimeters. According to oral accounts of past, the dome of this aab-anbaar has immediately collapsed a few days after it has been built due to raining and its ruins are visible at the bottom of the pond. Despite, in its kind, its structure and even covering the roof of 19-meter diameter with traditional materials are considered as a masterpiece in architecture. The pond includes 6 openings which lead raining water into the water storage and all 6 openings were utilized for withdrawing the water. All entrances have pointed arch but their dimensions are different. The places for entering the water are smaller and are lower than the other entrances‚Äô bottoms. And the curved stone has been used in its materials. At the internal body of one of the portals, stone stairs are embedded for descending and reaching the aab-anbaar bottom. Its tank as existing water storages‚Äô are circle- shaped and the used materials is mortar. It is vital to mention that to facilitate taking the water, the bottom diameter is one meter thicker than the diameter of its top. The body wall (shavereh) which has 1.2-meter diameter at portal floor and 2-meter diameter as reaching the height and the beginning of the dome‚Äôs arch, also the openings and facades‚Äô arch which are pointed, are made of stone and chalk materials. And only the arches of its input and output channels which are pointed are made of stone and mortar. And the stone stairs are placed at the northern part of the building. Salahi, Abdol Ali (2013).

Tag-e-Av historical dam  The city antiquity goes back to ‚ÄúSasanian‚Äù age (224-651 A.D) due to the existence of a historic dam called ‚ÄúTag-e-Av‚Äù. The ‚ÄúTange Ab‚Äù dam in Gersh, Fars province, is located in a canyon with the same name in the south west part of Gerash, in the Black mountain and under the peak called ‚ÄúBon-e-Morok‚Äù. It belongs to Sasanid era and has been reconstructed at Safavid period when three clamps have been built to prevent its destruction. Materials used in dam and the clamps are stone and mortar and a water stream with the same material has been drawn, for irrigation, from the dam up to a plain named as ‚ÄúDasht-e-Baraa‚Äù. On the way of this stream to the mouth of the canyon, two pools made of mortar has been also constructed. Now, behind the dam is fully filled with sediment on which the cedar tree can be seen. This monument has been registered in Iran national heritage index in 2001. Salahi, Abdol Ali (2013). Model Municipality, Superior City Council. Gerash: Anal-Haq Publications, pp. 20-37.  The Gerash Castle (Homayoun Dezh)  The castle, whose ruins are now remained, is placed on a big pile with the height of 1070 meters above sea level, called \\"Kalaat\\" around which the city has been developed. The castle includes a number of houses, a mosque, and a bath in the western part, Narenj castle with azure rhomboid tiles with dimension of 9x1 and 9x2, the prison and some mortar water storages. At the northern part of the castle, there is a big house called Narenj which belonged to the ruler. It includes two garrets in the north, and mirror-worked rooms in the east. In the south, on top of the portal there had been a tower called ‚ÄúBorj-e-Baargaah‚Äù.Salahi, Abdol Ali (2013). Model Municipality, Superior City Council. Gerash: Anal-Haq Publications, pp. 20-37.  Seven water storages [aab-anbaar] (Seven Ponds)  These seven water storages which are made in different periods and sizes, are placed close to each other. And they are located on the way of a seasonal river called ‚ÄúBezerd‚Äù in Nasag Neighborhood. Five of these seven water storages have dome on the roof and two of them have no roof. The greatest and most famous one is called as Haj Abol-Hassan Pond whose features are as below: According to epigraph attached to the north east portal, this monument was constructed by Haj Abol-hassan, son of Haj Hassan (the founder of ‚ÄúChaahaar-taakh‚Äù) and its unique feature is that the tank wall from the south east opening as well as the openings on the other sides goes along to the bottom of the water storage. The tank is circle-shaped and the arches of water input and output channels are placed at the west side of first and fourth openings. Its bottom, unlike other water storages, is placed at the same surface with openings and arches and is crescent shape. Openings and portal arches are pointed, and the second and fifth portal arches have cornice decorations. The facades are higher than the wall and as the main body wall are made of stone and chalk materials. The dome is made of stone and chalk and daubed by mortar. Seven Ponds is one of the limited numbers of heritages which are nationally registered in Pahlavi period. And one of the interesting points about its registration is the signature of Mr. Karim Pirnia in its registration file who is the father of Iran traditional architecture. Salahi, Abdol Ali (2013).

The House of Azimis, the Martyrs (Anthropology Museum of Gerash)  By observing the entrance plan it will be found that it is an L-shaped house. Immediately after passing through the filtering place, we will reach the central yard which is the common place in all traditional houses of Gerash. But what changes the atmosphere of the house is not using an integrated portico which is located from the bottom up to the second floor. In this house, each floor has its own portico (Ivan) with the same plan which is enclosed by the columns and space existing in its depth. So we do not see the integrated portico in this house. Due to the restoration done by the Gerash Cultural Heritage Lovers Society, specially Mr. Salahi, and being nationally registered as a cultural heritage and anthropology museum, this house‚Äô status is one of the best among historical monuments.

He was previously Head of the Office (chef de cabinet) of the President of the European Parliament, Hans- Gert Poettering MEP, from January 2007. He succeeded Harald R√∏mer, a Danish career civil servant, who had reached retirement age. Early life and education Born in Beelen, Germany in July 1964, Welle completed professional training at WestLB in M√ºnster and later studied economics at the Witten/Herdecke University. Career A member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), Welle was a member of the national board of the party's youth organization Young Union (JU) from 1989 until 1998. From 1991 until 1995, he also chaired the Democrat Youth Community of Europe,COCDYC / DEMYC Officers at the Democrat Youth Community of Europe which brought together Christian Democrat and Conservative students from across Europe. From 1991 until 1994, Welle worked as Head of Foreign and European Affairs for the CDU party in Bonn, serving under successive Secretaries General Volker R√ºhe and Peter Hintze. A strong admirer of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he made his political reputation by masterminding an unexpectedly strong CDU performance in the 1994 European elections. Welle then served as Secretary General of the European People's Party (EPP) ‚Äì the transnational, centre-right, European political party ‚Äì before becoming Secretary General of the EPP Group, then known as the EPP-ED Group, in the European Parliament. He was subsequently appointed as the first Director General for EU Internal Policies (DG IPOL) within the general secretariat of the European Parliament, the administrative department which services the 17 parliamentary committees dealing with domestic EU issues. During his time with both the EPP transnational party and EPP Group in the EP, Welle is credited with the strategy of opening the formerly Christian Democrat alliance to a broader range of conservative and liberal political forces, so consolidating most of the mainstream European centre-right under an EPP umbrella. This approach culminated in the EPP Group becoming the largest political group in the European Parliament in June 1999, a position that it has enjoyed ever since. As Secretary General of the EPP party and EPP Group, Welle played a key part in keeping the British Conservative MEPs in the group ‚Äì especially during the period from 1997, when the party moved into Opposition at Westminster ‚Äì by negotiating or suggesting compromise solutions designed to allow them a high degree of autonomy. Since 2004, the EPP has also been the strongest political force in the main EU institutions as a whole, with Welle still perceived as an important behind- the-scenes influence at senior level within EPP politics. In the run-up to the 2014 European elections, for example, he played a particularly important role in advocating the fielding of lead candidates or 'Spitzenkandidaten'President of the European Commission#Spitzenkandidaten by the various European political parties.https://www.ft.com/content/8b347498-d9c4-11e3-b3e3-00144feabdc0 As Secretary General of the European Parliament since 2009, Welle has interpreted his role in a more proactive way than most of his predecessors, strongly emphasising the Parliament's role as a law-making body, especially given the significant boost in powers the institution received under the Lisbon Treaty. He has promoted a long-run shift in the use of staff resources towards policy work, and away from back-office administration and traditional overheads, notably translation and interpretation. He has strengthened the policy staff servicing parliamentary committees, has emphasised the importance of ex-ante and ex-post evaluation, so that the Parliament can insert itself more effectively in the whole EU policy cycle, and has established a new European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) to support such work. He has used his position to strengthen the Parliament's position in inter-institutional relations, not only with the European Commission, but also with the EU Council of Ministers. He also boosted links with the US Congress by opening an EP representative office in Washington DC.

Welle is also an advisor to the Yale University-based transatlantic student think tank, European Horizons. Controversy On 23 May 2010, British newspaper Sunday Times, citing an anonymous source, alleged that Welle intended to provide an Apple iPad to each of the [then] 736 MEPs. The article suggested that earmarking money for iPads was not the best example of austerity, at a time when EU member states were suffering severe budget deficits. However, a Parliament spokesperson interviewed for the article was reportedly unaware of any such initiative.TimesOnline Article on Mr. Welle's alleged iPad initiative Welle, however, has promoted moves to a 'paperless' Parliament, developing, for example, an 'eCommittee' facility, whereby Members can table amendments and undertake some other aspects of committee work electronically.

Segal that offers an alternative interpretation of the Adonis myth. In chapter seven, \\"Adonis: A Greek Eternal Child\\", he puts forth his theory of Adonis, not as a vegetation god but as an archetype of the eternal child, the Jungian puer. In Segal's interpretation, based on the work of Carl Jung, Adonis lives as \\"a psychological infant, ultimately, as a fetus\\". He lives under the spell of the Great Mother archetype and can only live through her. His ego is weak and he seeks to remain surrendered to her. He can put down no roots of his own. He is unable to take on the institutions of work and family which connects one to the community because he is retarded psychologically. He is childlike and a childish puer won't be tied down. He avoids commitment and craves excitement. He is sexually promiscuous because he can never find his fantasy mate. Ultimately he is attached to the archetype of The Great Mother. All women are either manifestations of the mother or unworthy and inferior. Segal mentions Elvis Presley as the \\"consummate mamma's boy who lived the last twenty years as a recluse in a womblike, infantile world in which all of his wishes were immediately satisfied yet who deemed himself entirely normal, in fact 'all-American'\\". In Segal's view, the puer is the opposite archetype of the hero: the hero succeeds where the puer fails, finds a wife and a job, takes risks for those things to which he is committed. The puer commits to nothing so he risks nothing. He has no independent ego so he cannot lose it. Turning to the myth itself, Segal notes that immediately after his birth when Adonis emerges from the tree, Aphrodite puts him into a chest thereby undoing his birth so that she can possess him. Next, Persephone opens the chest, sees him and wants him for herself. Each gets him for four months of the year Zeus grants him freedom for the remaining four months. However, Adonis immediately gives up his freedom to Aphrodite, placing himself in the custody of the mother archetypes. Segal says that a Jungian interpretation of the myth could face the same difficulty as the Frazerian interpretation which is that it must take into account the fact that he eventually dies permanently. Says Segal, \\"Where a normal child needs to be born only once to liberate himself from the mother, Adonis, as puer, continually returns to the mother and so must be born again and again. His final death is simply his permanent rather temporary return to her\\". Segal goes on to explain how Adonis speaks of a distinctively Greek society in which the goal of young men was to become active, participating citizens. Adonis is the archetype of what not to become.

The cover is based on the original artwork created for the show in 1976. A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick) is the title of the first show in what later became the iconic Secret Policeman's Ball series of benefit shows for human rights organization Amnesty International, although it pre-dated by three years the first show to bear that name. The film of the show was titled Pleasure at Her Majesty's which is sometimes mistakenly thought to be the title of the actual benefit show. Background The landmark 1976 show starring the Monty Python, Beyond the Fringe, and The Goodies teams and other top British comedic performers of the 1960s and 1970s, led directly to the 1979 show The Secret Policeman's Ball - which in turn triggered the involvement of major rock stars such as Sting, Bono, Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, and Bob Geldof in working for the human rights cause. It set a precedent that would inspire many subsequent Amnesty galas, as well as Comic Relief. The concept was also the inspiration of similar events in aid of Amnesty International in countries around the world. The show took place on Thursday, April 1, 1976, Friday, April 2, 1976, and Saturday, April 3, 1976 as a series of late-night galas at Her Majesty's Theatre ‚Äì a theatre in London‚Äôs West End theatre district. The show was directed by Beyond the Fringe alumnus Jonathan Miller. The event was audio-recorded and an album featuring highlights of the three nights was released in November 1976 by Transatlantic Records. The album had the same title as the show. The event was also the subject of a film shot by documentary-maker Roger Graef that documented the rehearsals, backstage moments and show performances. The resulting film was titled Pleasure at Her Majesty's. It premiered in November 1976 at the 20th annual London Film Festival held at the National Film Theatre. The film was then screened on British television by the BBC in December 1976. Subsequently, the film received a modest theatrical release at arthouse cinemas in 1977. Though the show included sequences featuring the Monty Python, Beyond the Fringe, and Goodies teams who were billed under their group names on the individual track listing of the resulting album ‚Äî for the show itself, the album cover, and the cast listing on the film credits, the performers were listed under their individual names. The cast included: John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam of Monty Python (with \\"Python girl\\" Carol Cleveland); Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, and Alan Bennett of Beyond the Fringe; Bill Oddie, Graeme Garden, and Tim Brooke-Taylor of the Goodies. Solo performers included: John Fortune, John Bird, Eleanor Bron, Barry Humphries in character as Dame Edna Everage, Neil Innes, and mime artist Desmond Jones. The show consisted primarily of \\"greatest hits\\" of the various performers. Peter Cook and Alan Bennett performed iconic solo routines from their early 1960s revue Beyond the Fringe. The Monty Python team performed several of their most famous skits including the Dead Parrot sketch, the Custard Pie (aka The Japes Lecture), and \\"The Lumberjack Song\\". The Goodies performed their hit single \\"The Funky Gibbon\\". Bird, Fortune, and Bron performed several of the routines they made famous in their appearances in the early 1960s at the satirical nightclub The Establishment. The working title for the show was An Evening Without David Frost ‚Äì a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the fact that David Frost was a common frame of reference for all the performers, most of whom had worked with him ‚Äî or for him ‚Äî early in their careers. Pleasure at Her Majesty's Pleasure at Her Majesty's was the name given to the film release of A Poke in the Eye (With A Sharp Stick), the first of the Amnesty International comedy benefit galas. The show was performed at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, and the title is a play on the phrase \\"at Her Majesty's pleasure\\". In America, the film was originally called Monty Python Meets Beyond the Fringe. The film consists of both on-stage and backstage footage, taken from all three nights of the run (1‚Äì3 April 1976). Co-founders of The Secret Policeman‚Äôs Ball, campaigner David Luff, and executive Lewis, collaborated on producing the successor show ‚Äî videotaped in 1977 as The Mermaid Frolics. Then, Lewis and other co-founder John Cleese teamed up (with Amnesty's new fundraising director Peter Walker) in 1979 to create The Secret Policeman's Ball ‚Äî the first show to carry what became the iconic Secret Policeman's Ball title.

He is best known for his failure to defend Guangzhou (Canton) from British forces during the First Opium War, and for signing the treaties of Kulja and Aigun with the Russian Empire in 1851 and 1858 respectively. Life Yishan was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, towards the end of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. He was a great- great-grandson of Yunti, the Kangxi Emperor's 14th son and the first in line in the Prince Xun peerage. His great-grandfather, Hongchun (ÂºòÊò•; 1703‚Äì1739), once held the title of a junwang (second-rank prince) as \\"Prince Tai of the Second Rank\\" (Â§öÁæÖÊ≥∞ÈÉ°Áéã). His family was under the Bordered Blue Banner of the Eight Banners. In 1821, after the Daoguang Emperor came to the throne, Yishan, then a fourth-grade noble was recruited to serve as a third-class imperial guard (‰∏âÁ≠â‰æçË°õ) in the Forbidden City. Between 1821 and 1838, he held the following appointments, among others: lingdui dachen (È†òÈöäÂ§ßËá£) of Da'erbahatai (Â°îÁàæÂ∑¥ÂìàÂè∞; an administrative region in present-day Xinjiang); deputy dutong (ÈÉΩÁµ±; commander) of the Bordered Blue Banner Han Forces; canzan dachen (ÂèÉË¥äÂ§ßËá£) of Ili (‰ºäÁäÅ; an area within Xinjiang). In 1838, he was appointed as General of Ili to govern and maintain security in the area known as Dzungaria. He was recalled back to the capital, Beijing, two years later. In 1841, when the First Opium War broke out, the Daoguang Emperor dismissed Qishan from his position as Imperial Commissioner overseeing military affairs in Guangdong Province, and appointed Yishan as \\"Jingni General\\" (ÈùñÈÄÜÂ∞áËªç) to replace Qishan. Yishan distrusted the local people in Guangdong Province and strengthened defences against them instead of against the British. He recruited inexperienced fresh recruits from Fujian Province to serve in the Qing military instead of seasoned soldiers. Besides, he also spent his time partying with the officers. On 21 May 1841, Yishan ordered his troops to launch a sneak attack on the British at night, but the attack failed. The British captured all the artillery positions outside Guangzhou (Canton). The Qing forces retreated into the city and did not dare to engage the British. Chaos broke out in Guangzhou when the volunteer militias from Nanhai and Hunan started fighting over supplies. On 26 May, Yishan surrendered to the British and signed the Treaty of Guangzhou with Charles Elliot. During his time in Canton Yishan repeatedly sent lies and misinformation to the Daoguang emperor, making it seem that the Qing forces were stronger than the British. In late 1842, Yishan was detained by the Imperial Clan Court to await trial for his failure to defend Guangzhou. However, he was released in mid-1843 and promoted to second class imperial guard (‰∫åÁ≠â‰æçË°õ) and acting banshi dachen (Ëæ¶‰∫ãÂ§ßËá£) of Khotan (an area within Xinjiang). In 1845, he was appointed to serve as General of Ili for a second term. In 1847, he was awarded the rank of a first class zhenguo jiangjun, the fourth-lowest tier in the Qing dynasty's hierarchy of noble ranks. In mid-1851, Ivan Zakharov started negotiations with Yishan and Buyantai (Â∏ÉÂΩ•Ê≥∞) at Ili to open up Kulja and Chuguchak to Sino‚ÄìRussian trade. The Russians wanted the new treaty to be based on the earlier Treaty of Kyakhta (1727). Yishan agreed to almost all the Russian terms, except for trade in Kashgar. On 6 August 1851, the Russian and Qing Empires signed the Treaty of Kulja. In 1855, Yishan was reassigned to serve as General of Heilongjiang (ÈªëÈæçÊ±üÂ∞áËªç) to oversee Heilongjiang Province. During the Second Opium War (1857‚Äì1860), Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky approached Yishan and offered to provide Russian assistance to the Qing Empire against the British and French, in return for redefining the Sino‚ÄìRussian border along the Amur and Ussuri rivers. The Russians also put up a display of their military power by firing artillery shells along the Amur River. Yishan was terrified but did not want to retaliate for fear of starting another war. In May 1858, the Russian and Qing Empires signed the Treaty of Aigun, which transferred the lands between the Stanovoy Range and Amur River to the Russian Empire. In 1860, the Russians intervened in the Convention of Beijing (which ended the Second Opium War), and forced the Qing Empire to further cede its territories east of the Ussuri River, including Sakhalin, to them. The Xianfeng Emperor was enraged by the territorial losses to the Russians, so he dismissed Yishan from his office as General of Heilongjiang, despite the latter's attempts to explain himself. Yishan returned to Beijing to await further orders but was soon back into service. Yishan died of illness in Beijing in 1878. He was survived by at least two sons, including his second son Zaizhuo (ËºâÈ∑ü).

The adjective \\"almighty\\" applies particularly well to him\\"He is strongest of all the gods and men\\" according to Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning (21). and he had a prominent position by the time of the settlement of Iceland. Ullr The alm√°ttki √°ss can be identified with Ullr for in Atlakvi√∞a (30) Gudr√∫n mentions the oaths Gunnar sworn by Ull‚Äôs ring. Rudolf Simek theorizes that this hypothesis was in contradiction with the insignificance of the cult of Ullr.Simek (1996). Odin The expression could also refer to Odin, as the most important god of the Norse pantheon. But apart from the fact that his cult was not very widespread in Iceland, his unpredictable natureIn H√°vam√°l (110), Odin for instance boasts of having broken an oath sworn on a sacred ring. strongly goes against this solution. T√Ωr Rudolf Simek also suggested that the alm√°ttki √°ss might be T√Ωr. Even if this god was little known in Iceland, the oath was a legal one and T√Ωr was historically linked to law (cf. Mars Thingsus and possibly regnator omnium deus). Christianity Finally, as the oath was transmitted by a Christian author, the alm√°ttki √°ss could have a Christian meaning. John Lindow thus suggested that maybe the author \\"meant the 'almighty √°ss' to be a noble pagan anticipation of the new religion that was to come\\".Lindow (2002). R√©gis Boyer shares this opinion, underscoring that the word \\"alm√°ttki\\" is nowhere else to be found in a pagan context.Boyer (2000).

He was a crusader during the Italian crusades of Guelph against Ghibelline. His son-in-law was Aimery IV of Narbonne, who led the armies of Florence and Anjou in the Battle of Campaldino in 1289 and his brother was the provost of Toulouse. Sometime before his activities in Italy Jordan (Jourdan in contemporary Occitan) participated in a torneyamen, a poetical tournament, with Guiraut Riquier, Raimon Izarn, and Paulet de Marseilla. In 1266, after drawing up a will, he brought a contingent of knights and crossbowmen to Italy with him in support of Charles of Anjou. He was praised by Pope Clement IV and enfeoffed in the Principate and Calabria by Charles, but he soon returned to Gascony. Charles warned him to return or suffer his fiefs to be confiscated and titles revoked, but he lingered until October 1282, when he returned with a new band of soldiers. In 1285, he joined Philip III of France on the Aragonese Crusade. He died in 1288. His first wife was Faydide, heiress of Odo, Lord of Casaubon. His second wife was Vacquerie, daughter of Adh√©mar, Lord of Monteil.

Many of the novels feature \\"clear-thinking, straight-talking\\" forensic geologist Em Hansen and take place in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States. Andrews, her husband Damon, and son Duncan died in a plane crash in Nebraska on the 24th of July, 2019. Her novels have been praised for their combination of science and detective work within the mystery genre. In 2005, Andrews was awarded an Artists and Writers grant by the National Science Foundation and deployed through McMurdo Station, Antarctica to remote field camps to research an eleventh novel featuring fictional glaciologist Valena Walker. Andrews has won numerous other awards for her writings, including the Geological Society of America President's Medal and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Journalism Award, now called the Geosciences in the Media Award. Life and career Sarah Andrews grew up on the East Coast of the United States. Her father was an artist and art teacher and her mother, a teacher of English and comparative religions. Since childhood, she had a passion for exploring the great outdoors, including sailing with her father and wandering solo through the woods and fields during the family's long summers in rural Maine. Andrews left New England to attend Colorado College. In a creative writing class, she discovered that she \\"had a knack for storytelling.\\" Later, inspired by her aunt Lysbeth's profession, Andrews selected a geology course to fulfill a science requirement. She found herself among people who thought the way she did, and that she even excelled \\"taking in graphical information holistically, seeing the patterns, understanding their meaning, and making interpretations from them.\\" Her aptitude inspired her to earn a BA in geology. After college, Andrews stayed in Colorado, working first as a plumber's apprentice on a construction site south of Colorado Springs. When kidded by coworkers about where her \\"fancy education\\" had gotten her, she happily taught them about the ancient seaway that had once existed in the area, sharing the fossils she had found up while digging for drain pipes that had been buried by the backhoe. Andrews next took a job at the U.S. Geological Survey, working under legendary Grand Canyon geologist Edwin D. McKee from 1974 to 1980. In her work, she studied modern sand dunes in order to understand ancient sand dune rock formations. She went on to earn a MS in Earth Resources from Colorado State University, studying with Frank Ethridge, then worked as a petroleum geologist with Amoco and ANGUS Petroleum. After being laid off during the oil \\"bust\\" of 1986, she moved to California, where she worked as an environmental consultant, began to write, and lectured in the Geology Department at Sonoma State University.  Death  She, her husband, and son died in a private plane crash in Chadron, Nebraska, on 24 July 2019 on the way home from an air show in Wisconsin. As of 13 August 2019, the cause of the crash was under investigation.  Inspiration and influences  In one of her jobs as a geologist, Andrews entertained herself during dull meetings by \\"picking someone across the table as a murder victim and then trying to figure out who killed him.\\" These imaginings and her colleagues' positive reception of them led to her publishing mystery novels. The white-collar crimes in Andrews' first three novels are drawn from real events that she or colleagues observed. The murders, on the other hand, are included for the drama. Geologist Gene Shinn \\"worked for years on Andrews\\" incorporate into one of her novels his theory of dust floating from somewhere in Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. On September 11, 2001, she called his office, and the conversation inspired her book Killer Dust. Andrews cites Dorothy Sayers, Tony Hillerman, and Agatha Christie as favorite mystery writers.  Thinking about geology  Beyond her careers as a geologist and a novelist, Andrews has reflected on geology itself from a number of angles. Her whitepaper \\"Spatial Thinking with a Difference: An Unorthodox Treatise on the Mind of the Geologist\\" describes how she uses episodic simulation to understand past and future geologic events. She has considered how geologists act as detectives and how her experience as a woman impacted her approach to geology. And in a short note on geophilosophy, she points out that it is \\"important to know that science involves not just the collection of facts, but also a variety of logics and reasonings, some of which vary from one division of science to another.\\" Bibliography Em Hansen Mysteries * Tensleep - 1994 * A Fall in Denver - 1995 * Mother Nature - 1997 * Only Flesh and Bones - 1998 * Bone Hunter - 1999 * An Eye For Gold - 2000 * Fault Line - 2002 * Killer Dust - 2003 * Earth Colors - 2004 * Dead Dry - 2005 * Rock Bottom - 2012 Other novels * In Cold Pursuit - 2007 References * External links *Official website * Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American women geologists Category:American geologists Category:American mystery writers Category:American women novelists Category:Colorado College alumni Category:Colorado State University alumni Category:Sonoma State University faculty Category:Women mystery writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Herben family ","title":"Sarah Andrews (author)"},{"id":"7187452","text":"Leopold Henri Haimson (1927 - December 18, 2010) was a historian and professor emeritus of Columbia University.

The album is a departure from Dead Poetic's earlier work in many ways. First, only Rike and guitarist Zach Miles remained from the band's lineup on its 2004 breakthrough, New Medicines. Second, Rike does not scream on the record, thus abandoning the band's earlier post-hardcore sound in favor of straight-up rock & roll. Finally, as a result of this shift in styles, Vices is released solely through Tooth & Nail, not through Tooth & Nail's heavier subsidiary Solid State Records, which released the band's first two albums.

The dam and reservoir were built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a response to the disastrous flood of 1965. In addition to its primary purpose of flood control, it serves as one of many water supply reservoirs for the city of Denver, Colorado. In 1966, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission projected a total federal cost of $74 million. Construction of the project was begun in 1967 and the dam was completed in 1975. The massive breastworks of the dam measure approximately in length with a maximum height of the dam of above the streambed. The normal depth of the lake is at its deepest point. This means the dam towers above the mean surface of the reservoir. The lake drains an area of more than 3,000 square miles (8,000 km2).

A secondary inflow from the south is Plum Creek. A tertiary inflow from the west is Deer Creek. There are 212 bird species that are frequently found at Chatfield Reservoir. These birds either permanently live there or just go there to rest after long migrations. There is a Chatfield bird watch list that anyone can access. The bald eagle, white pelican and burrowing owl have been seen. Chatfield Reservoir Reallocation Project The Chatfield Reservoir Reallocation Project, slated to begin in fall, 2017, will create an additional 20,600 acre feet of water storage in the reservoir, raising its level by about 12 feet.

It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims (dhimmis, or \\"people of the book,\\" a type of protected class of peoples recognized by Islam including Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and several other recognized faiths) living under Islamic rule. There are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations. While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second Rashidun Caliph Umar ibn Khattab, other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution with the treaty being attributed to 9th century Mujtahids (Islamic scholars) or the Umayyad Caliph Umar II. This treaty should not be confused with Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia (known as al-  øUhda al- øUmariyya, ). In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims (dhimmis). By abiding by them, non-Muslims are granted the security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to Ibn Taymiyya, one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right \\"to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle.\\" Origin and authenticity The origins of the Pact of 'Umar are difficult, if not entirely impossible, to identify. Western scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, \\"There is intense discussion in the secondary literature\\" about the Pact's authenticity, with scholars in disagreement over whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab ['Umar I] or was \\"a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight\\" Several historians suggest that the Pact was written over the course of several centuries, not all at one time. Bernard Lewis, widely regarded as one of the leading scholars in Jewish history, described the \\"official\\" origin of the Pact of 'Umar: \\"The Muslim historiographic tradition ascribes these regulations to the caliph 'Umar I (634-644).\\" He goes on to doubt the validity of this attribution, writing that the document \\"can hardly be authentic.\\"Several key facets of the document and its history -- including its structure as a letter written from the conquered dhimmi to either Caliph 'Umar I or one of the generals in charge of the conquering Muslim forces, a lack of any physical texts dating back to the time of 'Umar I that either mention the Pact or his relation to it, and certain key phrases within the Pact that could only have addressed issues from a time after the rule of 'Umar I -- make the traditional attribution of the Pact of 'Umar to the Caliph 'Umar I doubtful. The structure of the Pact of 'Umar does not fit the typical format most would anticipate, given the purpose of the document was to restrict the rights of the dhimmi. The Pact of 'Umar has several different translations and versions, but each follow the same general format described above: a peace treaty written from the dhimmi to the conquering Muslim forces. A.S. Tritton includes several of these translations/versions in \\"Caliphs and their Non-Muslim Subjects: A Critical Study of the Covenant of 'Umar.\\" Each of these versions begin with some variation of ‚ÄúWhen you came to us we asked of you safety for our lives‚Ä¶ on these conditions...‚Äù and conclude with some form of ‚ÄúWe impose these terms on ourselves and our co-religionists; he who rejects them has no protection.\\" This format, a letter written from the conquered to the conquerors, is puzzling for a peace treaty. Given the purpose and importance of this document to Muslim rule in the Middle Ages, it is difficult to believe that it was written by the conquered peoples as a list of their own rights and the restrictions on those rights. Mark R. Cohen makes an effort to explain the strange format of the Pact of 'Umar by comparing it to other conquest treaties from throughout the Middle Ages, writing \\"The literary form of the Pact‚Ä¶ becomes less mysterious if we view the document as a kind of petition from the losers promising submission in return for a decree of protection.\\" Cohen thus attempts a comprehensive explanation for the puzzling format of the Pact of ‚ÄòUmar, but does not offer a clear answer to the question of the document‚Äôs origins, instead leaving the origin of the document as a matter of open debate. In leaving the subject open, Cohen supports the notion that the origins of this document are ambiguous at best, and has a format fitting with documents from later in the Middle Ages Another important point to consider when studying the origins of this document is the inconsistency in to whom the document was addressed. The document was typically addressed to the Caliph 'Umar, but not always addressed directly to the Caliphate. In some translations the Pact was written as a peace treaty addressed to the conquering general of the Muslim forces, such as Abu ‚ÄòUbaida, ‚Äúthe chief commander in Syria and apparently from Damascus.‚Äù If the document was not always addressed to the Caliph 'Umar I, there is a strong possibility it was written outside his time despite the traditional attribution of the Pact to his rule. There is a lack of any physical documentation of the Pact of 'Umar from the time of Caliph 'Umar I. Cohen addresses this, writing that although the Pact is ‚Äúattributed to the second caliph (‚ÄòUmar I)‚Ä¶ no text of the document can be dated earlier than the tenth or eleventh century,‚Äù well after the death of ‚ÄòUmar I. Bernard Lewis supports this in his own research, writing ‚Äúit is not unlikely that in this as in many other aspects of early Muslim administrative history, some measures that were really introduced or enforced by the Umayyad caliph ‚ÄòUmar II (717-720) are ascribed by pious tradition to the less controversial and more venerable ‚ÄòUmar I.\\" Lewis thus identifies Caliph 'Umar II as a potential source for portions of the Pact of 'Umar, lending credence to the likelihood that the document was written over the course of time, not under a single ruler. The content of the Pact seems to have developed in response to social and political issues cropping up between the dhimmi and their Muslim rulers over the course of the early and high Middle Ages. Certain portions of the Pact deal with social issues between the dhimmi and the Muslim conquerors that did not exist until the 10th or 11th centuries, well after the time of Caliph ‚ÄòUmar I. An important part of the evolution of the Muslim people during the Middle Ages was their transition from a conquering people to a ruling people. During the time of ‚ÄòUmar I, Islam was in its early years and largely a society of conquering peoples. This meant that the majority of their legal focus was centered around defining their status as a small conquering minority over a larger conquered majority and ensuring that the conquered majority would not be able to interfere with their rule. Legal measures concerning the everyday rule and maintenance of their society only came later in the Middle Ages. Norman Stillman addresses this in an analysis of the content of the Pact of 'Umar, writing ‚Äúmany of the provisions and restrictions of the pact were only elaborated with the passage of time,‚Äù and that ‚Äúcertain provisions of the pact only applied to the early years of the Arab military occupation‚Ä¶ other provisions were added to the pact when the Arabs became permanent settlers.\\" Stillman identifies the document as a type of living document, growing to encompass increasing solutions to issues between the Muslim and dhimmi populations as they became apparent and as circumstances surrounding their relationship changed. As a treaty that likely changed over time, it is difficult to pinpoint a particular date or author as the origin of the Pact, one of the foremost reasons for this longstanding ambiguity. As described, there is significant historical debate over the origins of the Pact of 'Umar. However, there is sufficient evidence to make the validity of the attribution of the Pact to one ruler or leader highly unlikely. Below are several examples of the different opinions historians have over the origins of this debate. A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has \\"suggested that the Pact is a fabrication\\" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. Another scholar, Daniel C. Dennet, believes that the Pact was \\"no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today, as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty.\\" Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that \\"Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms. His name has been erroneously associated‚Ä¶with the restrictive Covenant of Omar.\\"Abraham P. Bloch, One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year, p. 314. . According to Thomas Walker Arnold, the pact \\"is in harmony\\" with Umar's \\"kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith, (https://dl.wdl.org/17553/service/17553.pdf]) (online) \\"A later generation attributed to ‚ÄòUmar a number of restrictive regulations which hampered the Christians in the free exercise of their religion, but De Goeje and Caetani have proved without doubt that they are the invention of a later age; as, however, Muslim theologians of less tolerant periods accepted these ordinances as genuine\\" Content There are several different versions of the pact that differ both in their language and stipulations.

If a Muslim wishes to sit, non- Muslim should be rise from his seats and let the Muslim sit. * Prohibition against preaching to Muslims in an attempt to convert them from Islam. * Prohibition against preventing the conversion to Islam of some one who wants to convert. * The appearance of the non-Muslims has to be different from those of the Muslims: Prohibition against wearing Qalansuwa (kind of dome that was used to wear by Bedouin), Bedouin turban (Amamh), Muslims shoes, and Sash to their waists. As to their heads, it was forbidden to comb the hair sidewise as the Muslim custom, and they were forced to cut the hair in the front of the head. Also non-Muslim shall not imitate the Arab-Muslim way of speech nor shall adopt the kunyas (Arabic byname, such as \\"abu Khattib\\"). * Obligation to identify non-Muslims as such by clipping the heads' forelocks and by always dressing in the same manner, wherever they go, with binding the zunnar (a kind of belt) around the waists. Christians to wear blue belts or turbans, Jews to wear yellow belts or turbans, Zoroastrians to wear black belts or turbans, and Samaritans to wear red belts or turbans. * Prohibition against riding animals in the Muslim custom, and prohibition against riding with a saddle. * Prohibition against adopting a Muslim title of honour. * Prohibition against engraving Arabic inscriptions on signet seals. * Prohibition against any possession of weapons. * Non-Muslims must host a Muslim passerby for at least 3 days and feed him. * Non-Muslims prohibited from buying a Muslim prisoner. * Prohibition against taking slaves who have been allotted to Muslims. * Prohibition against non-Muslims to lead, govern or employ Muslims. * If a non- Muslim beats a Muslim, his Dhimmi protection is removed. * In return, the ruler would provide security for the Christian believers who follow the rules of the pact.

The society also organizes trips and summer camps for children and classes on Islam for new and non-Muslims. The Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center is a related mosque and cultural center in Roxbury, Boston.  Aims and activities  According to its website, the Islamic Society of Boston was established to serve two main purposes. First, the ISB intends to help local Muslims to ‚Äúpreserve their Islamic identity‚Äù and to ‚Äúobserve their obligations as Muslims.‚Äùhttp://islamicsocietyofboston.net/?page_id=2 The Islamic Society of Boston strives to ‚Äúembody the 'middle path' to which the Qur‚Äôan calls‚Äîa path of moderation that is free of extremism.‚Äù Towards this goal, the ISB offers a number of activities for Muslim living in the Boston area that help them ‚Äúto make positive, effective, and organized contributions towards the well being and enhancement of the social and cultural environment in which they live.‚Äù Secondly, the ISB strives to act as an information resource by promoting a comprehensive and balanced view of the Islamic religion. It intends to raise awareness of ‚Äúthe Islamic point of view on issues of contemporary relevance.‚Äù History The society was founded in 1981 by Muslim students as a consolidation of Muslim Students' Associations at Harvard University, Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Suffolk University, and Tufts University. The organization's first location was a hall reserved at MIT where they held prayers and weekly seminars and classes. In 1991, the ISB purchased a Cambridge building as a community center and in 1993 purchased a second location and began to renovate it. In 1994 they opened the second location as a mosque. The ISB has also purchased a rental property to provide income for the annual operating expenses of the center. Reports of ties to radical Islam and terrorism have been controversial and disputed.Boston Herald October 23, 2003 The society had brought suit in 2005 for defamation against individuals and institutions issuing press and other reports of these ties. However, it abandoned the suit in 2007 when \\"one after another of the allegations made by the Islamic Society [in its suit] collapsed.\\" According to prominent First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who served as defense counsel in the suit, documents revealed in the discovery phase of the lawsuit confirmed the accuracy of reports tying the Islamic Society of Boston to radical Islam and terrorism. This mosque shares many of its members and teachers with the nearby mosques of Islamic Center of New England Boston Marathon bombing controversy The ISB came to national attention when newspaper reports noted that it had been occasionally attended by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an Islamic extremist since 2009, and, less frequently, by Dzhokhar, the two brothers accused of committing the Boston Marathon bombing. Boston \\"authorities believe the Chechen brothers ... got their ideas largely online.\\" The organization Americans for Peace and Tolerance (APT) has alleged that several former members of ISB are convicted terrorists and claims that the mosque teaches \\"a brand of Islamic thought that encourages grievances against the West, distrust of law enforcement and opposition to Western forms of government, dress and social values.\\"Dorell, Oren. \\"Terror suspects, fugitives and radical speakers have passed through the Cambridge mosque that the Tsarnaev brothers are known to have visited\\", USA Today )April 24, 2013) However, APT itself has been labeled a hate group by American Muslim and Jewish organizations, which allege that it has consistently targeted the Boston Muslim community through smear campaigns and guilt-by-association tactics. US Attorney for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz has labeled the APT group and its claims \\"incredibly racist and unfair.\\" William A. Graham, dean of Harvard Divinity School, has said that \\"the phobia about it that is generated by a lot of the fearmongers in our community is highly exaggerated\\" and the mosque has been praised by Christian religious leaders as \\"an American Muslim institution, well respected in Cambridge, contributing positively to the community at large.\\" Building project Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Roxbury In the summer of 2009, the ISB opened a new building in Roxbury, called the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, on land purchased from the city of Boston adjoining the campus of Roxbury Community College. The ISB agreed to compensate the city for some of the cost of the land through community service by donating books to and sponsoring lectures about Islam for the college, as well as a 10-year agreement to maintain local parks; in exchange they were able to purchase land valued at $401,187 for $175,000. The building project was surrounded by controversy, such as concerns about the land purchase deal and the dual role of Boston Redevelopment Authority Deputy Director Mohammad Ali-Salaam as both the official overseeing and managing the sale on behalf of the city, and principal fundraiser for the Islamic Society of Boston. Issues related to the legality of the sale and the public's access to information surrounding the sale were the subject of two lawsuits, both of which have failed. The facility can accommodate 3000 individuals in its sanctuary, includes an Islamic school for children, an Islamic library, a morgue with burial preparation facilities, administrative offices, a media center, store, a women's gymnasium, a kitchen, a hall for events, and an underground parking garage. Opening events included an interfaith breakfast with appearances by Boston mayor Thomas Menino and the local heads of many Christian denominations, as well as a Muslim congressional representative. Outreach The ISB is active in dawah, or educating the public about Islam. As part of this, the community engages in an interfaith project with Temple Beth Shalom in Cambridge. The organization participates in civil rights work with the ACLU, and has received a grant from the National Conference for Community and Justice (NCCJ) for civil rights and civics training for the Muslim community in Boston.

Ellsworth (1843‚Äì1899), commonly known as \\"Lightning\\" Ellsworth, was a Canadian telegrapher who served in the cavalry forces of Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. His use of the telegraph to spread disinformation to the Union forces was declared by The Times as the greatest innovation to come out of the war. Biography Born in Upper Canada, Ellsworth was fascinated by the telegraph as soon as it was invented. As a teenager, he travelled to Washington, D.C., to study in Samuel Morse's telegraphy school. He then began working in Lexington, Kentucky, where he became friends with John Hunt Morgan. In 1860, Ellsworth moved to Houston, Texas. Civil War When the Civil War began in the following year, Morgan conceived the idea of using the telegraph to send disinformation to the enemy. Realizing that Ellsworth was perfect for the job, he asked him to join him. Ellsworth accepted and enlisted in Morgan's 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Ellsworth excelled as a telegrapher. Not only could he read extremely fast code messages, but he also could imitate the sending style of other telegraphers (each of whom was slightly different), and he quickly mastered the \\"fist\\" of the Union Army's telegraphers in Kentucky and Tennessee. He gained his nickname \\"Lightning\\" during Morgan's first Kentucky Raid, when he sat on a railroad cross tie in knee deep water near Horse Cave, Kentucky, calmly tapping away at his telegraph key during a thunderstorm. Ellsworth accompanied Morgan on his unauthorized great raid into Indiana and Ohio in 1863, but he escaped capture by swimming across the Ohio River with his portable telegraph, hanging on to a mule, at the Battle of Buffington Island. After Morgan made his escape from a Yankee prison, Ellsworth accompanied him on his last Kentucky Raid in 1864. Morgan was killed, and Ellsworth himself was captured at Cynthiana, Kentucky, but he soon managed to escape and made his way to Canada. Confederate secret agent Thomas Hines met him there, and he enlisted Ellsworth's help in an unsuccessful attempt to free Confederate POWs in the North. Post-war After the war, Ellsworth is said to have worked for Thomas Edison in Cincinnati, Ohio, but his last years are unknown. Edison claimed that Ellsworth found an ordinary telegraph office lacked any adventure and resigned. According to Edison, Lightning Ellsworth died in the Texas Panhandle, after he had become a \\"bad gun man\\".Edison His Life and Inventions ‚Äì Dyer However, George A. Ellsworth appears in the 1880 U.S. Census as a telegrapher living in Kirkwood, St. Louis Co., Missouri. He was unmarried and told the census taker that his father had been born in New York and his mother in Connecticut.U.S. Census, 15 June 1880, Kirkwood, St. Louis Co., Missouri, page 30, Supervisor's District No. 1, Enumerator's District 182.

It is an investigation into the consequences of plutocratic capitalist control of American colleges and universities. Sinclair writes, ‚ÄúOur educational system is not a public service, but an instrument of special privilege; its purpose is not to further the welfare of mankind, but merely to keep America capitalist.\\" (p. 18) The book is one of the ‚ÄúDead Hand‚Äù series: six books Sinclair wrote on American institutions. The series also includes The Profits of Religion, The Brass Check (journalism), The Goslings (elementary and high school education), Mammonart (great literature, art and music) and Money Writes! (literature). The term ‚ÄúDead Hand‚Äù criticizes Adam Smith‚Äôs concept that allowing an \\"invisible hand\\" of capitalist greed to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.  Context  Published in 1923, The Goose-step was written during the post‚ÄìWorld War I Red Scare. It was a time of great political awareness and activism on both left and right in the United States. On the left, there was widespread interest in Socialism and Communism, especially in the results of the 1917 Russian Revolution. Populist ideas were still alive, and Anarchism was in the news, with the Italian anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti arraigned in 1920 for a robbery and murder. On the right, the anti-German jingoism and florid patriotism of the war years had stirred up passions against pacifism and ‚Äòforeign‚Äô ideas such as Socialism and Communism. The Palmer raids against suspected radicals occurred in 1919, and superpatriotic organizations like the business- sponsored, anti-union Better America Foundation worked to shape public opinion. Critiques of higher education had recently appeared, such as Thorstein Veblen‚Äôs 1918 book The Higher Learning in America. Sinclair spent a year traveling the country for the book and interviewed over a thousand persons. Sinclair also used primary sources like letters, and secondary sources like student newspapers. Sinclair had studied at Columbia University in New York City, and the book‚Äôs longest section attacks Columbia and its president, Nicholas Murray Butler. Sinclair originally intended to also critique elementary and high schools, but because of length he saved that material for another book, published in 1924 as The Goslings.  Title  Contemporary readers would have recognized the title, The Goose-step, as referring to the authoritarian Prussian culture of Germany, which the United States had recently helped to defeat in World War I. With the title, Sinclair implies that students in American universities and colleges were being trained to think in unison like German students. This is not surprising, he implies, as the presidents of major universities--Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Yale, University of California-Berkeley and Stanford (p. 115), and the chancellor of New York University (p. 314)--had studied in Germany. ‚ÄúEveryone (sic) of them learned the Goose-step under the Kaiser!‚Äù (p. 115)  Organization  To explain how higher education is controlled by financial interests, Sinclair quotes from a report of the 1913 Pujo Committee of the United States House of Representatives. :\\"Interlocking directorates\\" are \\"the device whereby three great banks in New York, with two trust companies under their control, manage the financial affairs and direct the policies of a hundred and twelve key corporations of America. The three banks are J. P. Morgan and Company, the First National Bank, and the National City Bank; and the two trust companies are the Guaranty and the Equitable. Their directors sit upon the boards of the corporations, sometimes several on each board, and their orders are obeyed because they control credit, which is the life-blood of our business world.\\" (p. 19) The interlocking directorate was equally well represented on the boards of trustees of American universities. Sinclair cites a survey by Evans Clark, \\"a preceptor in Princeton University--until he made this survey.\\" Of the boards of the 29 largest universities, \\"the plutocratic class‚Ä¶composed 56 per cent of the membership of the privately controlled boards, and 68 per cent of the publicly controlled boards.‚Äù In contrast, the board members included 4-6 per cent farmers, no representatives of labor, and no inhouse professors to represent the faculty. (Clark's findings were confirmed by a 1917 study by Scott Nearing.) For each school (see below), Sinclair describes how the interlocking directorate exercises its influence on the school's Board of Trustees. Bankers and powerful local businessmen dominate the boards, ensuring that school policies support their class interest. This occurs in various ways. The school president serves the board rather than the educational interest of the students. Unqualified but politically conservative men are hired as administrators or professors. University funds are invested at artificially low interest rates at favored banks. Schools purchase land from people in their administration. The administration represses radical students and prohibits speeches by Socialists like Sinclair. Students at state universities, which are funded by the public, are nevertheless taught to serve the interests of the rich. A major theme is professors' inability to speak freely in or out of class without fearing for their jobs (academic freedom). Rather, the Board of Trustees, acting through the school's president, suppressed any criticism of the status quo. Many faculty members were dismissed, driven out or denied promotion because of their political activities or views. Sinclair says that academic freedom was suppressed at church-sponsored and tax-supported (state) schools, as well as at private ones. Only one or two faculty members allowed Sinclair to use their names. :\\"I talked with another professor at Chicago, who does not want his name used. I asked him what he thought about the status of his profession, and he gave the best description of academic freedom in America that I have yet come upon. He said, 'We are good cows; we stand quietly in our stanchions, and give down our milk at regular hours. We are free, because we have no desire to do anything but what we are told we ought to do. And we die of premature senility.'\\" (p. 247) Other chapters deal with the importance of keeping the support of wealthy and politically conservative alumni/donors, and the influence of plutocrat-founded policy organizations like Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and John D. Rockefeller‚Äôs General Education Board. A chapter, \\"The Academic Pogrom,\\" concerns some institutions‚Äô efforts to reduce the number of Jewish students and applicants. Final chapters support the alternative of workers‚Äô education and labor colleges. Among his prescriptions for change, Sinclair wanted more professors to unionize by joining the American Association of University Professors (only 2-3 per cent were unionized). He also wanted college students to experience real life: they should visit jails and work in factories, or alternatively have prisoners and labor leaders speak at their schools.  Critical reactions  Critics have usually praised The Goose-step for bringing an enormous mass of information together in an engaging and readable book. It is ‚Äúmuckraking at its best‚Äù,Hicks, Granville, \\"The Survival of Upton Sinclair\\" College English 4 (4) (Jan., 1943), 213-20. an ‚Äúhonest effort to find out the truth‚ÄùAlvord, Clarence W., The Goose-Step (Review), The Mississippi Valley Historical Review 10 (3) (Dec., 1923), pp. 336-7. and \\"indispensable to any student of present American life.\\"Lovett, Robert Morss, \\"Upton Sinclair,\\" The English Journal 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706-14. While they rarely if ever find errors of fact, they criticize Sinclair's interpretation as oversimplified: plutocrats are not responsible for all the problems with higher education. Regarding suppression of academic freedom, one critic argues that ‚Äúmany [cases], perhaps a majority, were the result of war hysteria and should not be regarded as typical.‚Äù  Institutions mentioned  Sinclair's epithet for the school follows; it refers to the major source of plutocratic influence on the Board of Directors or school administration. *Columbia University: The University of the House of Morgan *Harvard University: The University of Lee-Higginson *University of Pennsylvania: The University of U.G.I.

A court title in pre-Norman Ireland, and for a time after the Norman invasions when Gaelic nobility maintained varying levels of tradition. The Muire, or Muiredach is the Marshal of a territory of an Irish noble or free-landholder of the rank of Boaire or higher. He was gifted a portion of land in exchange for service called a Methas, a region of farmland similar to that held by an Ocaire, the subservients of the Boaire, an ignoble free-landholder. His duties included acting as a sheriff and levying the Ceithernn, or warband, during times of war or regional emergency, and during war his rank included a command position on the battlefield, and he was allowed to keep a 'small' court, including his own standard bearer, shield maker, and cup bearer for ceremonies, though he was technically a member of his overlords court. He was the head of his master's Cliarthairi, the 'guards' or 'troopers', professional soldiers inhabiting the territory of a Boaire or noble. He also had the duty of acting as Muire Rechtgi, the intermediary between the local king and his subjects during a legal dispute, appearing in his place at court.

Education  Birnes earned a degree from New York University. In 1974, Birnes earned a Ph.D. in medieval literature from New York University with a dissertation on Piers Plowman. Birnes earned a J.D. degree from Concord Law School, a private online law school.Keppel, Robert D., Birnes, William J.. Academic Press, 2003, p. xii.  Career  Birnes served as a Lily Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and taught literature and linguistics at Trenton State College.  UFOlogy  Birnes believes that Earth has been visited by many different types of extraterrestrials, and that pictures taken by NASA have been airbrushed to remove any evidence of alien activity. Birnes speculates that NASA may have taken missions to the Moon after Apollo 17, but these missions were kept secret from the public due to alien interference and new-found extraterrestrial artifacts. Birnes claims that NASA made three additional trips to the Moon; Apollo 18, Apollo 19, and Apollo 20. Additionally, he claims that the Apollo 13 incident was actually an extraterrestrial attack meant to scare humans away from landing on the Moon. Birnes's credibility was called into question when a UFO sighting over Morris County, New Jersey, on January 5, 2009, featured on the show UFO Hunters as a preview of the show's third season was later recognized as a hoax designed to be a social experiment. The perpetrators of the event, in which they launched Chinese lanterns near a local airport, claimed that they had hoaxed UFO Hunters even though no claims were made on the show with respect to the origin of what local witnesses claimed to be UFO sightings.  Media  As a writer of popular nonfiction, he co-authored The Riverman with detective/academic Robert D. Keppel (1995), an account of serial killer Ted Bundy's involvement in the apprehension of Green River Killer Gary Ridgway. The book was adapted into a made-for-TV film (2004) on A&E.; As a UFOlogist, Birnes collaborated with Philip J. Corso, on The Day After Roswell (1998), appeared on the History Channel's television documentary series: UFO Files (2004‚Äì2007), Ancient Aliens (2009‚Äì2013), NASA's Unexplained Files and I Know What I Saw. He starred in UFO Hunters (2008‚Äì2009) as leader of an investigative team of fellow ufologists, and later wrote a book by the same name documenting his experiences on the show. Birnes has repeatedly appeared as a guest on the late night radio talk- show Coast to Coast AM to discuss UFOs. Birnes most recent nonfiction works are Dr. Feelgood with Richard Lertzman, Wounded Minds and Hearts of Darkness with Dr. John Liebert, The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney with Richard Lertzman, Beyond Columbo, The Life and Times of Peter Falk with Richard Lertzman, Edison v. Tesla, The Battle Over Their Last Invention with Joel Martin, Psychiatric Criminology with Dr. John Liebert, and UFO Hunters Book 2.

It handles user interface elements by using native controls provided by native APIs, such as Windows API in Windows, GTK+ in Linux, and Motif-LessTif in older Unices. It also provides some custom developed controls using graphics APIs such as CD - Canvas Draw or OpenGL. Features IUP's distinguishing features include: * ANSI C API, one of the few plain C-capable toolkits, * Single API for Windows or Linux, * Built in support for Lua scripts calling IUP functions (controlled by Lua script), * Removal of the restriction of class/instance object types, but retaining the prototype Lua- style hierarchy of inheritance. * An abstract layout model, in which sizes and positions are calculated from horizontal and vertical containers, rather than explicit X and Y coordinates. Coordinate-based layout is also supported with a third container type. * Small API, on the order of about 100 functions. * Use of an event loop-callback mechanism. This main loop can be called inside Lua. * Interface elements are created before they are mapped to the native elements. This is the reverse of the usual situation for assembling GUI elements. * Available as source or pre-built static or dynamic libraries for wide variety of compilers, including turnkey example source. The Lua scripting is done by binding Lua and IUPLua in (at least) a small C program called a host application. This program creates a Lua state, passes the Lua state to IUPLua for initialization, and then opens and executes a Lua script against the Lua state. Or, the entire IUP state can be dynamically loaded via use of a Lua \`require\` or \`package.loadlib\` of IUPLua. The script(s) can later be compiled with the Lua compiler if needed. Support for UTF-8 was added to the Windows target in November 2013 with the release of version 3.9.

JHS is a part of the School District of Palm Beach County and is the northernmost high school in Palm Beach County. There are over 3300 students enrolled in the school. The school's mascot is the Warrior, and the school colors are green and gold. History The town of Jupiter was settled in the late 19th century by settlers traveling down the Loxahatchee River. The town was incorporated in 1925, and during the 1930s a two-story school building was constructed for grades 1-12. The bottom level held the lower grades, while the high school classes were held on the upper level. The campus now known as Jupiter High School was first built west of Military Trail in 1967 for students of the town of Jupiter. Initially the complex housed grades 7‚Äì12, with the high school on the South Campus of the school. As the town's population grew, a middle school‚Äînow Jupiter Middle School‚Äîwas constructed a few miles away, and the high school encompassed the North and South Campuses. In June 2001, groundbreaking for a new high school took place. It opened in 2003, costing over $56 million and on August 13, 2003 all students were on one campus for the first time in 20 years. The new high school is on the that was home to the high school stadium, ball fields, tennis courts and practice fields. It is now , housing 60 classrooms and 28 laboratories, in addition to new and improved athletic facilities. The school is wired for computers in every classroom. The auditorium seats 850 and the gymnasium seats about 1,500 people. Academics Jupiter High School is host to a wide variety of Magnet school programs, accredited by the State of Florida Department of Education. They include the Jupiter Environmental Research and Field Studies Academy, Engineering Technology Academy, Medical Academy, and the Criminal Justice Academy. In addition to magnet programs the school also offers 30 AP courses, and a wide variety of fine arts, and diverse academic electives. Clubs and Extracurricular Activities Jupiter High School is host to over 100 registered student organizations. Many of Jupiter High School's clubs have competed and won at State and National levels such as: lacrosse, rugby, softball, baseball, flag football, debate, drama, the competitive robotics team, state-ranked marching band, and the nationally ranked table tennis team. The marching band won the championship title for class AAA in 2014 and for class AAAA in 2015 and 2016 at the Florida Marching Band Championships. The Winterguard won 4th place in class Elite A at the 2015 Winter Guard International championships in Dayton, Ohio. The table tennis team has won state and national acclaim from various sources.

Under his direction, DWR completed its first California Water Plan and initiated the first stage of planning of the California State Water Project (SWP). It was under his term as Director that the California Legislature adopted the Burns- Porter Act authorizing the construction of the SWP in 1959. In 1961 voters approved massive bonds to pay for the construction of the SWP. Banks left the public sector that same year to return to the private sector, where he worked as a consulting engineer until his death in 1996. Banks' papers (1940-1995) are held at the Water Resources Collections and Archives, University of California, Riverside.Inventory of the Harvey O. Banks papers, 1940-1995 Early career Banks was a Magna Cum Laude civil engineering graduate of Syracuse University in 1930. He taught mathematics at Stanford University where he also earned a Masters of Science in hydraulic and sanitary engineering (two civil engineering specializations) in 1933. He then worked for the City of Palo Alto, California for two years before joining the U.S. Soil Conservation Service in 1935. Banks joined the State of California's Division of Water Resources in 1938, but left the public engineering sector in 1942 to serve in the military through the duration of World War II in the US Army Corps of Engineers, with the 382 Combat Engineers. Following the war he joined a private engineering consulting firm. DWR years In 1950 Banks returned to state service working in the Division of Water Resources newly formed Water Quality Program. In 1953 he was appointed Assistant State Engineer and was responsible for administrating water rights and water quality activities. He was promoted to the office of State Engineer in 1955 when he predecessor, Arthur D. Edmonston, retired. Banks primary job as the State Engineer was to promote the authorization and construction of a water supply project that would transfer water from the northern part of California hundreds of miles to then quickly growing Southern California. As a strong advocate of the Burns-Porter Act of 1956, Banks was named the first Director of the newly created California Department of Water Resources. Banks and California Governor Pat Brown campaigned heavily for the next several years for the public approval of the California Water Resources Development Bond Act of 1960. The $1.75 billion bond measure provided the state the resources needed to build the reservoirs, pumping stations, and aqueducts that formed the California State Water Project. The original SWP design plans did not call for the creation of a large off-stream storage reservoir along the California Aqueduct, however, Banks and others advocated that the original design be altered. Their design called for the creation of a large multi-use facility near Los Banos, California that could also tie into the US Federal Government's pre-existing Central Valley Project. This combined facility, later named San Luis Reservoir, would offer both projects flexibility. San Luis Reservoir was instrumental in enabling the complex water marketing that characterizes today's water management in California. Late career In 1961, Banks left the Department of Water Resources, and returned to both the private sector as a consulting engineer and to school in order to pursue a Ph.D. He received his Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964, and joined the University of Washington faculty in 1965. He frequently served as an expert witness in US and state courts on various water resources management and water law cases, and also was a member of many water related committees for organizations including the World Bank, United Nations, and the US Agency for International Development.Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10 Banks continued to work as a consulting engineer until his death from leukemia in 1996.

The company was founded in January 2000 by Hugh Hancock and was headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It originated as a hub for its namesake, machinima, which uses and manipulates video-game technology to create animation, as well as featuring articles on machinima and content about film and technology. The website initially helped to bring attention to machinima as an art form and to encourage productions based on game engines other than those of id Software's first-person shooter computer game series Quake.Marino, 12‚Äì13 Over time, the website's focus shifted to general entertainment programming centered around video game culture, comic books and fandom. In 2016, the company was acquired by Warner Bros. Digital Networks. In turn, Warner Bros. was acquired by AT&T; in 2018. That December, the company would be re-organized into Otter Media and eventually subsumed by its multi- channel network Fullscreen. In January 2019, Machinima abruptly discontinued their YouTube channels, with their videos set to private. In February 2019, Machinima officially ceased operations. History 2011 Inside Gaming Awards presented by Machinima In December 1999, id Software released Quake III Arena. According to Paul Marino, executive director of the Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences, filmmakers who had been using prior versions of the Quake series to record animated videos, then called \\"Quake movies\\", were initially excited, but the enthusiasm dampened when id announced that, in an attempt to curtail cheating in multiplayer video games, it would take legal action against anyone who released details of Quake IIIs networking code, which was included in the game's game demo file format. This precluded the use of custom demo-editing tools that had facilitated the creation of videos that used the older Quake and Quake II demo file formats, slowing the release of new Quake movies. Another contributing factor to this decline was that the self-referential nature of the gameplay-related situations and commentary of Quake movies was losing novelty. Marino explained bluntly that \\"the joke was getting old\\".Marino, 10‚Äì11. Therefore, the Quake movie community needed to reinvent itself.Marino, 11. Machinima VS logo In January 2000, Hugh Hancock started Machinima.com, a resource for video makers who used computer and video games as a medium. The site's name was foreign to the Quake movie community. The term machinima was originally machinema, from the words machine and cinema. However, Hancock had misspelled the term in a previous email, and the new name stuck because he and Anthony Bailey, who had worked on Quake done Quick, liked the now-embedded reference to anime.Marino 12. The site opened with multiple articles, interviews, and tutorials, and was soon able to acquire exclusive releases of new productions. One such work, Quad God, was the first to use Quake III Arena and the first to be released in a conventional video file format instead of a demo file format exclusive to a certain game. The switch to conventional media offended some machinima producers, but Quad God, by Tritin Films helped to introduce machinima to a wider audienceKelland, Morris, & Lloyd, 30. and to solidify Machinima.com's launch. Matt Kelland, Dave Morris, and Dave Lloyd called the release of Quad God \\"a key moment in the development of machinima. In turn, as Machinima.com became more popular throughout 2000, other game engines, such as that of Unreal Tournament, became the basis of new productions and the focus of new software tools for machinima. 2006‚Äì2016 On January 30, 2006, Hancock announced his resignation as editor-in-chief of Machinima.com and that control of the site would be transferred to the staff of Machinima, Inc. Among the reasons cited for the change were differences in approach to the site and a desire to devote more time to Strange Company's 2006 machinima production BloodSpell. Hancock called the decision \\"possibly the biggest step I've taken since I founded Strange Company nearly nine years ago\\". Towards the end of 2010, Machinima revamped its website and removed the forums (wanting users to use the Facebook page instead), and the ability to upload videos. Since the revamp of their website, Machinima had shifted focus away from actual machinima content. The network now focused on gamer lifestyle and entertainment programming, broadcasting solely through their YouTube channels. In January 2012, Machinima discontinued podcast feeds on iTunes without an in-feed announcement. Back episodes remained available but no new episodes have appeared on the feed since moving to YouTube exclusively. In June 2012, Machinima partnered with Meteor Entertainment to promote Hawken, a highly anticipated free-to-play online game which was later released in December 2012. In the same month, Microsoft announced the inclusion of Machinima programming on Xbox Live during the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo. In May 2012, Google invested $35 million into Machinima. It was the first time Google has openly backed a content company by taking an equity stake. In December 2012, Machinima.com announced it was letting go of 23 staff from its workforce. Machinima said the lay-offs were due to re-organizing as part of its global growth strategy, but were still hiring other key divisions whilst these layoffs were happening. In late 2012, Machinima reached 4th place in YouTube's subscriber rankings with over 5 million subscribers. The only channels preventing Machinima from becoming #1 at the time were Smosh, nigahiga and RayWilliamJohnson, all three of which at the time had over 6 million subscribers. As of December 2018, the channel had over 12 million subscribers. In early 2014, the main channel briefly returned to uploading original machinima series and movies. In March 2014, Warner Bros. led an $18 million round of funding for Machinima. Around the same time, founder Allen DeBevoise stepped down as CEO and became the new chairman. Former Ovation COO Chad Gutsein was installed in his place. In November 2014, Machinima announced plans to rebrand their network, with a revamped logo and new tagline, \\"Heroes Rise.\\" A video ID was produced by the Matthew Finio Creative agency with the word \\"Machinima\\" whispered by jazz singer Melissa Morgan. In February 2015, the company raised an additional $42 million in funding led by Warner Bros. Machinima said that the additional funding would be used to accelerate growth through more investments in content and technology to better serve the firm's audiences, advertisers, creators and distributors. On October 12, 2016, sources told media sites that Warner Bros. was nearing a deal to acquire Machinima and its branded properties. On November 17, 2016, Warner Bros. confirmed the news, thus making Machinima a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros. Digital Networks. 2018‚Äì2019 On February 14, 2018, after being integrated into Warner Bros. Digital Networks, Machinima unveiled a new logo and plans to shift its programming back towards game-centric content, and away from the multi-channel network model. In June 2018, Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner was acquired by AT&T; and renamed WarnerMedia. AT&T; owns Otter Media, which runs the multi-channel network Fullscreen, Rooster Teeth‚Äîwhich similarly produces gaming-oriented content and web series, and the anime-oriented streaming service Crunchyroll. After the purchase, AT&T; bought out Chernin Group's stake in the company, making WarnerMedia the sole owner. In November 2018, Deadline Hollywood reported that AT&T; was preparing to reorganize Machinima into Otter Media. The following month, the merger went ahead as part of a larger reorganization of Otter Media, which resulted in layoffs of 10% of the company's workforce. On January 18, 2019, following the consummation of the reorganization, all content was abruptly set to private on Machinima's YouTube channels. Fullscreen explained that Machinima would now be a unit of Fullscreen, producing content under the Machinima banner while Machinima's partners would migrate into Fullscreen's creator network. Fullscreen GM Beau Bryant stated in an email sent to Machinima partners that they were \\"going to great lengths 'behind-the-scenes' to ensure a smooth and efficient transition\\". On February 1, 2019, Machinima officially announced that it had laid off its 81 employees and ceased remaining operations. The company stated that certain employees were being retained to work for Otter Media, and that Russell Arons was \\"assisting with transitional activities as she explores new opportunities\\". Shortly afterward, it was announced that a number of former Machinima series and shows would move under Rooster Teeth, including a revival of Inside Gaming. Programming Machinima's content was primarily hosted on various YouTube channels. Content uploaded onto these channels are either produced in- house or by signed directors. Machinima has also utilized social media platforms to provide fans with featured uploads, interactive questions, and live event coverage. Inside Gaming Inside Gaming was the main editorial brand of Machinima. Coverage of gaming news, previews, and reviews was provided for more than 600,000 weekly viewers through daily and weekly shows on its YouTube channel hosted by then-employee Adam Kovic under the alias \\"The Dead Pixel\\". He was often seen in a Halo 3-themed machinima form in his lava- red Recon helmet. Inside Gaming is the successor to Machinima's discontinued segment, Inside Halo, which was less successful because of the lack of news surrounding the Halo series. Inside Halo was developed and hosted by \\"Soda God\\" who alternated weekly hosting with Adam Kovic who became the only host. Eventually an official co-host, Matt Dannevik, joined Kovic on the set of Inside Gaming Daily; he was laid off in December 2012. Producers Bruce Greene and James Willems regularly co-hosted with Kovic, and have started their own YouTube channel under Inside Gaming. Inside Gaming also hosted its own annual awards show, the \\"Inside Gaming Awards\\" in Los Angeles. The awards show celebrates the biggest developers and achievements in the video-games industry, and features top gaming choices by viewers and the staff of Inside Gaming. Categories in which games are selected include, among others: Game of the Year, Best Online Multiplayer, and Best Original Games. On January 26, 2015, Inside Gaming employees Adam Kovic, Bruce Greene, Lawrence Sonntag, Joel Rubin, Sean \\"Spoole\\" Poole, James Willems, and Matt Peake announced that they were leaving Machinima. The group is now known as Funhaus, a subsidiary of Rooster Teeth Productions. On April 9, 2015, Matt Dannevik announced in a video that he would be returning to Machinima and taking over the Inside Gaming channel, with help from other members of Machinima. In February 2019, following the sunset of Machinima, it was announced that Inside Gaming would be revived as a merger with Rooster Teeth's The Know, with Sonntag as editor- in-chief, and Kovic and Greene returning as hosts alongside former IGN journalist Alanah Pearce. It was also announced that Rooster Teeth would also manage the archives of the series. ETC News ETC News, otherwise known as simply ETC, was Machinima's entertainment news show that started in 2010. The name originally stood for \\"Entertainment, Technology, Culture.\\" It was originally hosted by Khail Anonymous, who later left the company in 2014 and currently works for Yahoo! News. It was most recently hosted by Machinima employees Ricky Hayberg and Eliot Dewberry, before their departure from the company. Originally airing on the primary Machinima channel the show was moved to its own channel on June 30, 2016, though Ricky and Eliot still worked for Machinima and the show was still owned by them. ETC Daily was the main show, with weekly shows such as TechNewsDay (originally Tech Tuesday, but renamed in order to remove the inherent deadline) for technology news, Weekly Weird News for exploring odd headlines and going deeper into \\"crazy\\" news stories, News Dump for covering film news, and T.U.G.S. (The Totally Uninformed Gaming Show) for gaming news meant to satirize what the hosts considered to be game journalists who were far too soft on gaming companies, though the show was later moved to the specialized gaming channel, ETC Party Time. Outside of news, the channel hosted the ETC Podcast, where the hosts interviewed creators such as Dan Harmon & Justin Roiland, Mike Shinoda, Tony Hale, Ed Skrein, Elijah Wood, Kill The Noise, Verne Troyer, Alicia Malone, Kristian Harloff & Mark Ellis, and Dillon Francis. On June 27, 2018 the duo officially cut ties with ETC News and launched a new YouTube channel known as Internet Today, taking many shows from ETC and continuing them there. ETC Daily was renamed to Internet Today and T.U.G.S. was officially canceled. The ETC Podcast was reworked into Idiots Watching Anime, a full series version of a few episodes they did of the ETC Podcast where the two hosts watched a few episodes of Dragon Ball Z, a show they were both unfamiliar with, and discussed it with the friends who suggested the episodes. Machinima Live Machinima previously held livestreams on the Machinima Live YouTube channel. Currently, the network streams on Twitch, with their channel hosting gameplay events, convention coverage, and more. Machinima Live also had 24-hour live streams, such as one that took place in 2010 after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops. Machinima staff, directors, and guests took part in playing the game in four-hour shifts in an attempt to reach the 15th prestige. A similar event also occurred after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Machinima VS In 2012, Machinima branched out to the competitive side of gaming with the inclusion of Machinima VS, a channel featuring event coverage from some top-ranked players, teams, and casters. It served as Machinima's Esports channel. The channel has since become inactive. Machinima Respawn On December 7, 2009, the Machinima Respawn channel was launched as Machinima's gameplay-focused channel. It had a host of shows about games and related topics as well as the show Respawn hosted by Adam Montoya, Scott Robison, and Shaun Hutchinson. Inbox was a later show that gained a cult following for its comedy and the funny personalities of the hosts Scott Fisher and Scott Robison. At one point Machinima Respawn was one of the most subscribed channels on YouTube. Due to budget cuts at Machinima, the lack of views of the newer programming on Respawn in later years, and the departure of Scott Robison, Shaun Hutchinson and Adam Montoya along with Scott Fisher, Machinima Respawn was discontinued, not having been active since February 22, 2015. The efforts from Respawn were shuttered, and company focus in terms of gameplay driven series were put further more into Machinima Realm, which was later renamed Realm Games. Realm Games Originally launched as Machinima Realm in 2010, Realm Games was one of Machinima's key primarily gameplay- focused franchises. Originally only focusing on MMOs and real-time strategy games among other genres, it has since become Machinima's primary hub for content creator gameplay content after the closure of Machinima Respawn. Realm also developed original animation series, and one-off creations, such as 'Beyond the Rift' a League of Legends cinematic, focusing on a two character fight scene between Jax and Veigar. Beyond the Rift hit 1,000,000 views within a 52-hour period, and reached the front page of Reddit as a viral hit. The channel also was home to the most successful League of Legends gameplay series of all time on YouTube called 'Random LoL Moments.' Amassing over 500 episodes, across a 5-year span. The Realm Games franchise was operated by Shane Burruss (Shibby) from 2013, up until the company closed its doors in January 2019. Before the Machinima channels, including Realm went private, the focus was mostly Overwatch and League of Legends content. Original programming Terminator Salvation: The Machinima Series On May 18, 2009, Machinima released Terminator Salvation: The Machinima Series, an animated web series set before the video game and leading to the events of the film, comprising six episodes.

List of series Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn : Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn is a live- action web series that debuted on October 5, 2012 and continued until the release of Halo 4 on November 6, 2012. The series represents the largest monetary investment Microsoft has made in a live-action Halo project. The goal of the web series was to introduce the franchise to people unfamiliar with the games. In this series, Halo fans would be taken back to the infamous beginning of the Human/Covenant war, when the Master Chief inspired a young cadet who would eventually become the commander of the UNSC's greatest vessel ever: the UNSC Infinity. XARM : XARM is a combat-sports concept reality show series produced by Endemol USA in which fighters compete.

Eventually, the channel and block were shelved, with the channel being inactive since August 18, 2015, with no new episodes from any of its exclusive shows since July 28, 2015. The shows moved from the primary Machinima channel and were moved back after Happy Hour's discontinuation.

The series is a comedy, but has also adopted a dramatic narrative style starting with its fifth season. The series initially ended after its third season, with a movie titled Endgame, but was later spun-off as Arby 'n' the Chief in LA by Machinima. Due to the poor reception of In LA, Graham brought back the show for a fourth season that ignored the events of in LA and Endgame and instead took place after the third season. Graham sought to end the show again with its seventh season, which ended on August 17, 2013. However, on October 6, 2014, Jon Graham revealed that he was contemplating producing an additional season, feeling dissatisfied at the original ending he created.

Expansion of distribution media Machinima, Inc. had expanded on to many websites and platforms to distribute its content currently maintaining the main website, eleven YouTube channels, an iPhone/iPad application, an Android application, Facebook applications, Facebook/Twitter/Google+ feeds, and a newsletter that distributes news content. Previously, Machinima had an application on both the Xbox One and Xbox 360. Both consoles have since removed the Machinima app from their app store. Social media integration Machinima used a variety of social networking services including Facebook and Twitter as distribution platforms for its productions. It was integrated with Apple IOS and Microsoft Xbox Live service. Machinima frequently posted content on various social networks core to the concept of sharing and generating hits for Machinima videos. Machinima's partnership with Google included Google's ¬£30 million investment in Machinima. Criticism As a multi-channel network, Machinima had over 5,000 partners worldwide who were contracted to produce video content under the Machinima brand. The company had been criticised for the use of perpetual contracts. Ben Vacas, known to the YouTube community as 'Braindeadly', attracted media attention in January 2013 over contractual issues with Machinima. Under the terms of his contract, Machinima was permitted to place advertisements on Vacas's videos and in return he would receive a percentage of the profits generated. However, the contract also disclosed that it existed \\"in perpetuity\\" meaning Machinima would hold the rights to any content created by Vacas, published on his partnered YouTube channel, in his lifetime, a detail Vacas failed to read. In January 2014, Machinima was alleged to be paying its YouTube video partners for showing Xbox One content. According to reports, the content must be at least 30 seconds long and the Xbox One must be mentioned by name. An accompanying legal agreement also states that the partner \\"may not say anything negative or disparaging about Machinima, Xbox One, or any of its games\\". Additionally, the agreement states that the video producer must keep the details of the promotional agreement confidential, or they do not qualify for the promotional payment. Videos participating in this promotion would tag their videos with the tag: XB1M13. Microsoft claims that it had no knowledge of the promotion. Machinima has faced criticism from YouTube members and viewers for a lack of transparency with its associates, placing advertisements on their associate channels' videos without permission, and a lack of transparency on the revenues side. One associate member, Clash, also criticised Machinima for insensitively placing an ad on a video dedicated to his ailing dog. On September 2, 2015, Machinima agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it engaged in deceptive advertising by paying ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù to post YouTube videos endorsing Microsoft's Xbox One system and several games. The FTC claimed that the influencers failed to adequately disclose that they were being paid for their seemingly objective opinions. Under the proposed settlement, Machinima was prohibited from similar deceptive conduct in the future, and it was required to ensure its influencers clearly disclosed when they are compensated for their endorsements. According to the FTC's complaint, Machinima and its influencers were part of an Xbox One marketing campaign managed by Microsoft's advertising agency, Starcom MediaVest Group. Machinima guaranteed Starcom that the influencer videos would be viewed at least 19 million times. On May 9, 2018, Arby 'N' The Chief creator Jon Graham tweeted that most of the series was removed from Machinima's YouTube channel for unspecified reasons. In January 2019, Machinima abruptly discontinued their YouTube channels, with all their videos set to private (largely in part due to the AT&T; acquisition of Otter Media, Rooster Teeth, FullScreen and more, leading to an executive decision consolidating digital assets which closed Machinima's doors). Several Machinima series were later uploaded to Rooster Teeth's website.

An Anglican priest, he served as the President of King's College (predecessor of today's Columbia University) from 1763 to 1775, and was a public opponent of the American Revolution. Early life Cooper was educated at The Queen's College, Oxford where he later served as chaplain. Ordained as a priest in the Church of England in 1761, he attracted the influence of several high clergymen, including Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who recommended him for service in the American colonies. Cooper was thereby sent to New York in 1762 to assist Samuel Johnson, president of King's College, which was an Anglican establishment. Cooper was appointed professor of mental and moral philosophy, and a year later he had assumed the college presidency. Presidency of King's College Cooper was chosen to replace his predecessor in the position of College President primarily because the Governors of the institution believed he would be far easier to control. Indeed, Cooper was not entirely engaged in the educational mission of King's, possessing a larger cache of alcoholic beverages than books, and more frequently engaging in the urban life of New York. Still, the college prospered under Cooper's tenure, creating, among other things, the second medical college in the Americas, in 1767. Judge Thomas Jones wrote that \\"under his tuition was produced a number of young men superior in learning and ability to any that America had ever before seen,\\" and George Washington, whose stepson John Parke Custis attended King's, wrote of Cooper that he was \\"a gentleman capable of instructing him [Custis] in every branch of knowledge.\\" He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1769. Proposals While in the American colonies Cooper floated several grandiose schemes that were never realized: The American Bishoprics Cooper was reportedly more enamored with the Southern colonies than New York, and frequently took to \\"rambles\\" there. Desiring to resettle there, he proposed to his ecclesiastical superiors, in both 1768 and 1774, that two Anglican sees be established in North America, and that he be appointed bishop of the more southernly one. The American University Though he was in the thrall of King's College's governors during much of his tenure, Cooper had novel plans for the fledgling institution. He proposed that the Colonial Colleges be merged into an \\"American University\\", the structure of which would be similar to Oxford or Cambridge. Under this scheme, the constituent colleges, including Harvard, Yale, and the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), would remain quasi-independent but would be controlled by King's, which would be elevated to university status and sanctioned as the only degree-granting institution in the colonies. Although Cooper obtained the support of the King's College Governors for the plan and left for England with a delegation to persuade King George III of its virtues and ask for his sanction in the form of a royal charter, neither Parliament nor the governing bodies of the other colleges ever took Cooper's plan seriously. Revolution and flight Cooper, who was a conservative with Tory sympathies, did not take warmly to the growing revolutionary spirit in the colonies. He authored, with several other Anglican clergy in New York, political tracts arguing that all forms of resistance to the Crown constituted treason. His pamphlet A Friendly Address to all Reasonable Americans on our Political Confusions; in which the Necessary Consequences of violently opposing the King's Troops, and of a General Non-importation, are fairly stated was later answered in best-selling tracts by Alexander Hamilton and Charles Lee. For his Loyalism, Cooper, along with other prominent New York Tories, were issued death threats admonishing them \\"to flee for your lives, or anticipate your doom\\". Of Cooper, in particular, this party evidenced a desire of \\"seizing him in his bed, shaving his head, cutting off his ears, slitting his nose, stripping him naked, and setting him adrift\\". In May 1775 Cooper was confronted by an angry mob from which he managed to escape by boarding a British naval ship anchored in New York harbor. Rumors persist that this was due to the assistance of Alexander Hamilton, though these have been shown to lack the weight of substantive evidence. Cooper fled to England that same month, where he engaged in numerous professions.

In modern scholarship, the term 'Punic' ‚Äì the Latin equivalent of the Greek- derived term 'Phoenician' ‚Äì is exclusively used to refer to Phoenicians in the Western Mediterranean, following the line of the Greek East and Latin West. They included mainly the inhabitants of its core homeland Ancient Carthage (modern Tunis), as well as those colonial inhabitants of the settlements that acknowledged Carthaginian leadership elsewhere in North Africa, western Sicily, southern Sardinia, Malta, Ebusus, and southern Hispania. Their language, Punic, was a dialect of Phoenician. The first Phoenicians settled in the western Mediterranean in the twelfth century BC and formed part of trading networks linked to Tyre and Sidon in Phoenicia. Although links with Phoenicia were retained throughout their history, they also developed close relations with other peoples of the western Mediterranean and developed cultural traits distinct from those of the Phoenician motherland. Some of these were shared by all western Phoenicians, while others were restricted to individual regions within the Punic sphere. The western Phoenicians were arranged into a multitude of self-governing city-states. Carthage had grown to be the largest and most powerful of these city-states by the fifth century BC and gained increasingly close control over Punic Sicily and Sardinia in the fourth century BC, but other communities remained outside their control. In the course of the Punic wars (264‚Äì146 BC), the Romans challenged Carthaginian hegemony in the western Mediterranean, culminating in the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, but the Punic language and Punic culture endured under Roman rule, surviving in some places until Late Antiquity. Terminology A Carthaginian coin from Sicily depicting a horse in front of a palm tree (called Phoinix in Greek), fourth century BC. The English adjective Punic is used in modern scholarship exclusively to refer to the Western Phoenicians. The proper nouns Punics and Punes were used in the sixteenth century, but are obsolete and in current usage there is no proper noun. Punic derives from the Latin poenus and punicus, which were used mostly to refer to the Carthaginians and other western Phoenicians. These terms derived from the Ancient Greek word Œ¶Œø·øñŒΩŒπŒæ (Phoinix), pl. Œ¶ŒøŒØŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ (Phoinikes), which was used indiscriminately to refer to both western and eastern Phoenicians. Latin later borrowed the Greek term a second time as phoenix, pl. phoenices, also used indiscriminately. Numismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term Phoinix, but it is not clear what term (if any) they used for themselves. A passage from Augustine has often been interpreted as indicating that they called themselves Chanani (Canaanites),Augustine Unfinished Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Romans 13 but it has recently been argued that this is a misreading. In modern scholarship, the term 'Punic' is exclusively used to refer to Phoenicians in the Western Mediterranean. Specific Punic groups are often referred to with hyphenated terms, like 'Siculo-Punic' or 'Sardo-Punic'. This practice has ancient roots: Hellenistic Greek authors sometimes referred to the Punic inhabitants of North Africa ('Libya') as 'Liby-Phoenicians'. Overview Like other Phoenician people, their urbanized culture and economy were strongly linked to the sea. Overseas, they established control over some coastal regions of Berber Northwest Africa in what is now Tunisia and Libya as well as Sardinia, Sicily, Ebusus, Malta and other small islands of the western Mediterranean. In Sardinia and Sicily, they had strong economic and political ties to the independent natives in the hinterland. Their naval presence and trade extended throughout the Mediterranean and beyond, to Atlantic Iberia, the British Isles, the Canaries.The Phoenicians retrieved 12 October 2009 Technical achievements of the Punic people of Carthage include the development of uncolored glass and the use of lacustrine limestone to improve the purity of iron. Most of the Punic culture was destroyed as a result of the Punic Wars fought between Rome and Carthage, from 264 to 146 BC,Chris Scarre, \\"The Wars with Carthage\\", The Manawy Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome (London: Penguin Books, 1995), 24‚Äì25. but traces of language, religion and technology could still be found in Africa during the early Christianisation, from AD 325 to 650. After the Punic Wars, Romans used the term Punic as an adjective meaning treacherous. Distribution Tunisia Tunisia was among the areas settled during the first wave of Phoenician expansion into the west, with the foundation of Utica and Hippo Regius taking place around the end of the twelfth century. Further Phoenician settlements, were established in the following centuries, including Hippo Diarrhytus and Hadrumetum. The foundation of Carthage on the site of modern Tunis is dated to the late ninth century BC by Greek literary sources and archaeological evidence. The literary sources attribute the foundation to a group of Tyrian refugees led by Dido and accompanied by Cypriots. Archaeologically, the new foundation is characterised by the focus of religious cult on the gods Tanit and Baal Hammon, by the development of a new religious structure, the tophet, and by a marked degree of cosmopolitanism. Carthage gained direct control over the Cap Bon peninsula, operating a sandstone quarry at El Haouaria from the middle of the seventh city and establishing the city of Kerkouane in the early sixth century. The region was very fertile and allowed Carthage to be economically self-sufficient. The site of Kerkouane has been extensively excavated and provides the best-known example of a Punic city from North Africa. Punic control was also extended inland over the Libyans. Punic influence on inland regions is seen from the early sixth century, notably at Althiburos, where Punic construction techniques and red-slip pottery appear at this time. Armed conflicts with the Libyans are first attested in the early fifth century, with several revolts attested in the fourth century (398, 370s, 310-307 BC). In the late fourth century, Aristotle reports that the Carthaginians dealt with local discontent by resettling poor citizens in cities in Libya.Aristotle, Politics 2.1273b: 19-20 These settlements had to provide tribute and military manpower when required, but remained self-governing. There is some onomastic evidence for intermarriage between Punic people and Libyans in the fourth and third centuries BC. Sardo-Punics Ruins of the Punic and then Roman town of Tharros From the 8th century BC, Phoenicians founded several cities and strongholds on strategic points in the south and west of Sardinia, often peninsulas or islands near estuaries, easy to defend and natural harbours, such as Tharros, Bithia, Sulci, Nora and Caralis (Cagliari). The north, the eastern coast and the interior of the island continued to be dominated by the indigenous Nuragic civilization, whose relations with the Sardo-Punic cities were mixed, including both trade and military conflict. Intermarriage and cultural mixing took place on a large scale. The inhabitants of the Sardo- Punic cities were a mixture of Phoenician and Nuragic stock, with the latter forming the majority of the population. Sardinia had a special position because it was central in the Western Mediterranean between Carthage, Spain, the river Rh√¥ne and the Etruscan civilization area. The mining area of Iglesiente was important for the metals lead and zinc. The island came under Carthaginian dominance around 510 BC, after that a first attempt at conquest in 540 BC that ended in failure. They expanded their influence to the western and southern coast from Bosa to Caralis, consolidating the existing Phoenician settlements, administered by plenipotentiaries called Suffetes, and founding new ones such as Olbia, Cornus and Neapolis; Tharros was probably the main centre. Carthage encouraged the cultivation of grain and cereals and prohibited fruit trees. Tharros, Nora, Bithia, Monte Sirai etc. are now important archaeological sites where Punic architecture and city planning can be studied. In 238 BC, following the First Punic War the Romans took over the whole island, incorporating it into the province of Corsica et Sardinia, under a praetor. The existing power structures, infrastructure, and urbanized culture continued largely unchanged. In 216 BC, two Sardo-Punic notables from Cornus and Tharros, Hampsicora and Hanno, led a revolt against the Romans. Punic culture remained strong during the first centuries of the Roman domination, but over time the civic elites adopted Roman cultural practices and Latin became first the prestige language and then the speech of the majority of the inhabitants. Ibiza The island of Ibiza derives its name from , , \\"Dedicated to Bes\\"). (Latin Ebusus). A city, the Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement, which has been excavated, was established in the mid-seventh century. Diodorus dates this foundation to 654 BC and attributes it to the Carthaginians.Diodorus Bibliotheca 5.16.2-3 History 814‚Äì146 BC The Punic religion was based on that of their Phoenician forefathers, who worshiped Baal Hammon and Melqart, but merged Phoenician ideas with Numidian and some Greek and Egyptian deities, such as Apollo, Tanit, and Dionysus, with Baal Hammon being clearly the most important Punic god. Punic culture became a melting pot, since Carthage was a big trading port, but the Carthaginians retained some of their old cultural identities and practices. The Carthaginians carried out significant sea explorations around Africa and elsewhere from their base in Carthage. In the 5th century BC, Hanno the Navigator played a significant role in exploring coastal areas of present-day Morocco and other parts of the African coast, specifically noting details of indigenous peoples such as at Essaouira. Carthaginians pushed westerly into the Atlantic and established important settlements in Lixus, Volubilis, Chellah and Mogador, among other locations. Greek‚ÄìPunic and Roman‚ÄìPunic Wars Being trade rivals with Magna Graecia, the Carthaginians had several clashes with the Greeks over the island of Sicily in the Sicilian Wars from 600 to 265 BC. They eventually also fought Rome in the Punic Wars of 265‚Äì146 BC but lost because they were limited in numbers, and talented commanders, had a misguided strategy in Hannibal's invasion of Italy, and misjudged the strength of their navy, especially in the first Punic War. They were soundly defeated by Scipio Africanus in Africa in 202 BC. That enabled Roman settlement of Africa and eventual domination of the Mediterranean Sea. Cato the Elder famously ended all his speeches, regardless of their subject, with the imperative that Carthage be utterly crushed, a view summarised in Latin by the phrase Praeterea censeo Carthaginem esse delendam meaning, \\"Moreover, I declare, Carthage must be destroyed!\\". Although the Carthaginians were eventually conquered in 146 BC, with their city destroyed, Cato never got to see his victory, having died 3 years earlier. 146 BC‚ÄìAD 700 The destruction of Carthage was not the end of the Carthaginians. After the wars, the city of Carthage was completely razed and the land around it was turned into farmland for Roman citizens. There were, however, other Punic cities in Northwest Africa, and Carthage itself was rebuilt and regained some importance, if a shadow of its ancient influence. Although the area was partially Romanized and some of the population adopted the Roman religion (while fusing it with aspects of their beliefs and customs), the language and the ethnicity persisted for some time. People of Punic origin prospered again as traders, merchants and even politicians of the Roman Empire. Septimius Severus, emperor of Rome and a proud Punic, was said to speak Latin with a Punic accent. Under his reign Carthaginians rose to the elites and their deities entered their imperial cult. Carthage was rebuilt about 46 BC by Julius Caesar and settlements in the surrounding area were granted to soldiers who had retired from the Roman army. Carthage once again prospered and even became the number-two trading city in the Roman Empire, until Constantinople took over that position. As Christianity spread in the Roman Empire, it was especially successful in Northwest Africa, and Carthage became a Christian city even before Christianity was legal. Saint Augustine, born in Thagaste (modern-day Algeria), considered himself Punic, and left some important reflections on Punic cultural history in his writing. One of his more well known passages reads: \\"It is an excellent thing that the Punic Christians call baptism itself nothing else but ‚Äòsalvation‚Äô, and the sacrament of Christ's body nothing else but ‚Äòlife‚Äô\\". The last remains of a distinct Punic culture probably disappeared somewhere in the chaos during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The demographic and cultural characteristics of the region were thoroughly transformed by turbulent events such as the Vandals' wars with Byzantines, the forced population movements that followed and the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century AD.

The mnemonic was introduced by Gabe Mirkin in 1978.Sportsmedicine () He has since recanted his support for the regimen. In 2014 he wrote, \\"Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that both ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping. In a recent study, athletes were told to exercise so intensely that they developed severe muscle damage that caused extensive muscle soreness. Although cooling delayed swelling, it did not hasten recovery from this muscle damage.\\" RICE is considered a first-aid treatment rather than a cure for soft-tissue injuries. The aim is to manage discomfort.  Evidence  There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of RICE therapy for acute ankle sprains. Treatment decisions for ankle sprains must be made on an individual basis and relies on expert opinions and national guidelines.  Primary 10 terms   Rest  Rest is a key component of repairing the body. Without rest, continual strain is placed on the affected area that is injured, leading to increased inflammation, pain, and possible further injury. Rest is recommended during the initial 24‚Äì48 hours after an injury, but after that modified activities can be started. Additionally, some soft tissue injuries will take longer to heal without rest. There is also a risk of abnormal repair or chronic inflammation resulting from a failure to rest. In general, the period of rest should be long enough that the patient is able to use the affected limb with the majority of function restored and pain essentially gone.  Ice  Ice is excellent at reducing the inflammatory response and pain associated with heat generated by increased blood flow and/or blood loss. A good method is apply ice for 20 minutes of each hour. Other recommendations are an alternation of ice and no-ice for 15‚Äì20 minutes each, for a 48-hour period.RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries on the website of the University of Michigan Health System, retrieved 28 July 2008 To prevent localised ischemia or frostbite to the skin, it is recommended that the ice be placed within a towel or other insulating material before wrapping around the area. Exceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as it has been shown to delay healing. In 2015, Dr. Gabe Mirkin, M.D., the doctor who initially coined the term R.I.C.E in his 1978 book \\"The sportsmedicine book\\", has eliminated his recommendation for ice, as it as since been shown to reduce healing. Why Ice Delays Recovery  Compression  Compression aims to reduce the edematous swelling that results from the inflammatory process. Although some swelling is inevitable, too much swelling results in significant loss of function, excessive pain and eventual slowing of blood flow through vessel restriction. An elastic bandage, rather than a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, non-elastic bandage will result in reduction of adequate blood flow, potentially causing ischemia. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood. Compression stockings or sleeves are a viable option to manage swelling of extremities with graduated compression (where the amount of compression decreases as the distance to the heart decreases). These garments are especially effective post-operatively and are used in virtually all hospitals to manage acute or chronic swelling, such as congestive heart failure.  Elevation  Elevation aims to reduce swelling by increasing venous return of blood to the systemic circulation. This will result in less edema which reduces pain and/or swelling. Variations Variations of the acronym are sometimes used, to emphasize additional steps that should be taken. These include: * \\"RICE\\" - Rest, Immobilize, Cold, Elevate * \\"HI-RICE\\" ‚Äì Hydration, Ibuprofen, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation * \\"PRICE\\" ‚Äì Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation * \\"PRICE\\" ‚Äì Pulse (Typically Radial or Distal), Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation * \\"PRICES\\" ‚Äì Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, and Support * \\"PRINCE\\" ‚Äì Protection, Rest, Ice, NSAIDs, Compression, and Elevation * \\"RICER\\" ‚Äì Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, and Referral * \\"DRICE\\" ‚Äì Diagnosis, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation * \\"POLICE\\" ‚Äì Protection, Optimal Loading, Ice, Compression, and Elevation Alternatives As the cold or ice component of RICE and its variations reduces blood flow to the injured area and delays healing, some people argue that for certain types of injuries (such as damage to ligaments and tendons) a protocol that increases blood flow, such as MEAT (Movement, Exercise, Analgesics and Treatments), should be used instead.

Lake Spenard, Spenard Road, and the city of Spenard, Alaska (now incorporated into the Municipality of Anchorage) bear his name. Biography Joseph A. Spenard was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1879. He came to Alaska about 1910, working for the Alaska Securities Company in Valdez before striking out on his own as a pushcart vendor.Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: User Home Pages: Eastern Ky Roots; Austrian, Norwegian & French Canadian ties at familytreemaker.genealogy.com In 1916, Spenard came to Anchorage, which had only been named the previous year. He is credited with bringing the first automobile to Anchorage, a truck manufactured by the REO Motor Car Company. He also owned a 1915 Ford Model T which served as the city's first taxicab. Spenard started a hauling business called the City Express. Flamboyantly decked out in a yellow suit and a top hat, he promoted his services with the slogan, \\"Time and Tide will Not Wait, But City Express Is Never Late.\\" A newspaper ad for the service contained the following poem: > Four bits is my middle name, > Truck and passengers just the same > No matter from whence you came, > City Express is in the game. He built a logging road from the Anchorage city boundary at Ninth Avenue and L Street, across Chester and Fish Creek, to what was then called \\"Jeter Lake\\" after homesteader Thomas Jeter. The trail and lake would later come to be known respectively as Spenard Road and Lake Spenard. As the area attracted settlers, it became known as the city of Spenard. Spenard came under the scrutiny of the National Forest Service for clearing an area on the lake's edge and constructing a dance pavilion in what was then part of the Chugach National Forest. In 1916, he held the first Anchorage Ice Carnival there.The History of Anchorage, Alaska at www.ci.anchorage.ak.us In 1917, the pavilion burned down, but the lake continued to be known as a recreational hot spot. Spenard's health failed and he sold his business and moved to Sacramento, California, where he died in 1934.

The Latin name does not imply a Romano-Italic origin, as Romans and Lombards in the eighth century tended to take either Lombard or Latin names. She was probably a Lombard, the daughter of Verissimo and sister of King Hildeprand, Arechis, and Donnolo, and niece of King Liutprand. San Salvatore, Brescia, internal In or around 753, she founded the monastery of St. Michele and St. Pietro at Brescia.G.Bognetti, La Brescia dei Goti e dei Longobardi, in Storia di Brescia, I, Brescia 1963, p. 435, Her husband meanwhile, had become a royal officer and the couple moved first to the royal court, and then to Tuscany, when Desiderius became 'Duke of Tuscia'. After the death of King Aistulf, Desiderius managed to take the throne and Ansa become queen, actively collaborating with her husband, especially in religious matters. In Brescia, she expanded the previously founded monastery, which became the Monastery of San Salvatore, endowed it with exceptional wealth and made her daughter Anselperga the abbess. The jurisdiction of San Salvatore subjugated an entire network of monasteries in Lombardy, Emilia and Tuscany, creating a federation directly controlled by the sovereign.J√∂rg Jarnut, Storia dei Longobardi, p. 120. After 759, she appeared frequently in Desiderius' diplomas and was probably the architect of his religious policy.C. Helbling, Ansa, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. ¬£, Rome 1961, p. 361. On 5 June 774, she was presented along with her husband to Charlemagne, who had conquered Pavia.

A local tradition, however, states that she was buried in the monastery she founded; so it is possible that, after the death of her husband, Ansa, then elderly, received permission to retire to Italy.A.

The Festival is the longest-running community event of its kind in New Zealand. History The first blossom festival began on Friday, 27 September 1957 and the first attraction was the Horticultural Society‚Äôs spring flower show. The next day saw the climax of the festival, as the frequently termed \\"big day\\" was held then. It was then that the now famous parade of floats first took place and they showcased themselves by moving along the main street of Alexandra. There was also entertainment during and after the parade at Alexandra's Pioneer Park. From then on, the parade and other main event attractions would take place usually in the last week of September during the weekend. The parade is always held on the Saturday. Alexandra's annual celebration of Spring is New Zealand's longest-running festival. The Alexandra Blossom Festival has raised many thousands of dollars to provide amenities for the town of Alexandra. This popular event encourages community spirit and attracts interest from all over the Country. 2006 marked the event's 50th anniversary. Activities and Exhibits Typically the types of available activities and exhibits vary from year to year. However, activities usually include things such as shearing championships, music festivals, blossom drives, musical productions and much more. Exhibits range from art exhibitions to flower shows. The most anticipated showing of the festival is the annual parade. Here a wide range of vehicles, objects, groups and people are on show including trucks, handmade floats, classic cars, street entertainers, marching bands and horse-driven vehicles. The \\"Saturday in the Park\\" which follows at the conclusion of the parade includes entertainment & relaxation for local & visiting families. Attractions include carnival rides, children‚Äôs Stage & circus entertainers, all age music concerts, stalls, food and beverage tents and interactive games such as rock climbing. The year 2006 also saw the return of the \\"Party in the Park\\" concert. The concert was held at night in a Grand Marquee. Six bands from New Zealand played here, including the well known Elemeno P and Goodnight Nurse. The other bands were Minuit, Eggs, Solaa and Twinset.

Life and career  Vallin was born at Herb√©viller, and studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Nancy. He was apprenticed in the studio of his uncle, also a furniture maker, beginning in 1881. His first projects were for church interiors and furniture but quickly he became a disciple of Art Nouveau, in part under the influence of √âmile Gall√©, for whom he created the door of Gall√©'s new studios. But he was most famous for his furniture, designing entire living rooms and dining room ensembles for notable personalities in Nancy, including Jean-Baptiste \\"Eug√®ne\\" Corbin, Charles Masson, Albert Bergeret, and others. In 1895-6, he built a new studio and his own house on the Boulevard Lobau in Nancy, which became what is now considered (in a crude form) the first Art Nouveau edifice in the city with the help of his friend, architect Georges Biet. In return, Vallin was responsible for the furniture that adorned Biet's house at 22, rue de la Commanderie, in Nancy. In 1901, along with Antonin Daum and Louis Majorelle, Vallin became one of three vice-presidents of the board of directors of the √âcole de Nancy. In architecture, he was one of the pioneers of construction in concrete reinforced by steel, a technique he used for the construction of the pavilion of the √âcole de Nancy at the International Exposition of the East of France in 1909.

She enrolled at the State University of New York at Albany, earning a master of arts and doctorate in sociology in 1985 and 1989, respectively. Zhou started her teaching career as an assistant professor at Louisiana State University in 1990, then moved to the University of California, Los Angeles (ULCA) in 1994, where she was promoted to associate and later full professor. After four years as chair of the Asian American studies interdepartmental degree program, Zhou became the founding chair of the university's Department of Asian American Studies in 2005. The Walter and Shirley Wang Endowed Chair in U.S.-China Relations and Communications was established at UCLA in 2008. Zhou assumed the position in 2009, and has also served Singapore's Nanyang Technological University as Tan Lark Sye Chair Professor between 2013 and 2016. Zhou has worked with Carl L. Bankston to expand the definition of social capital to not only include the resources held by individuals or groups, but also the processes of social interaction leading to constructive outcomes. This work and redefinition has helped spur the modern understanding of social capital and its interplay between power groups. Zhou's other sociological insights have been primarily within the fields of immigrant life and ethnic assimilation, particularly focused on the Asian American community. She has authored or co-authored two noted books spotlighting various sociological aspects of immigrant life‚ÄîChinatown: The Socioeconomic Potential of an Urban Enclave (Temple University Press, 1992) and Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States (Russell Sage Foundation Press, 1998).

He was one of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives to save other soldiers during the sinking of the troop transport during World War II. Life George L. Fox was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1900, one of five children. At 17 he ran away to join the army and served on the Western Front during World War I as a medical orderly, receiving the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and the Croix de Guerre for his meritorious service. Following the war, Fox completed high school and briefly worked for a Trust Company. Fox married in 1923 and his son, Wyatt Ray was born a year later. Fox studied at Moody Bible Institute and Illinois Wesleyan University, graduating in 1931. Following graduation, Fox became an itinerant Methodist preacher, holding posts in Downs, Illinois and Rye, New Hampshire before joining the Boston University School of Theology and becoming an ordained minister in 1934. That same year, he took over the church in Waits River, Vermont, and his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born. He remained in Vermont, moving church twice and becoming the state chaplain and historian for the American Legion. Fox joined the army again in 1942. His son enlisted in the Marine Corps on the same day. Fox was united with the other Four Chaplains for his voyage to Europe later that year following a position in the chaplain's school in Harvard, and departed with over 900 soldiers on the Dorchester in January 1943. Death right In late 1942, Fox was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. There he met fellow chaplains Alexander D. Goode, Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington. In January 1943, Fox and his fellow chaplains boarded the SS Dorchester, which was carrying some 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom. On February 2, 1943 the German submarine U-223 spotted the convoy and fired a torpedo which struck the Dorchester shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize the passengers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the Dorchester sank with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together. Remembrance Four Chaplains stamp, 1948 The four chaplains were each awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and Purple Heart medals, receiving national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951 by President Harry S. Truman at Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. The Four Chaplains' Medal was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker in 1961. Fox is honored with a feast day along with the other Four Chaplains on the liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on February 3.

The venture was a collaboration between Canadian and US engineers, pilots, and mechanics. In 2013, they had hoped to reach , or Mach 1.058. In a land speed record attempt on 27 August 2019, the North American Eagle crashed killing driver Jessi Combs. The future of the project is unclear. Description The vehicle was based on the fuselage of a Lockheed F-104A-10 Starfighter jet fighter aircraft, tail number 56-0763, The aircraft was built for the United States Air Force and assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base from August 29, 1957 until 1970 when it was retired. Initially the aircraft was used as a GE test platform for the J79 engine. It was later used as a chase plane for the North American X-15, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird and North American XB-70 Valkyrie test programs. It was flown by Joe Walker, Scott Crossfield, Pete Knight, Bill Dana, Chuck Yeager, Joe Engle and Bob Gilliland among other notable pilots. North American Eagle has designed road suspension and has carried out the necessary systems integration for it. The vehicle was long and weighed . Powerplant The engine was a General Electric LM1500 turbojet (a civilian variation of the aircraft's original J79). A stock engine for low speed testing is rated at 42,500 hp (31.7 MW). The vehicle had an enhanced engine for record attempts, rated at 52,000 hp (52,700 metric horsepower). At idle the stock engine consumes of fuel per minute, rising to per minute at 100% military power and per minute in afterburner mode. Braking systems , four methods were in use to decelerate the vehicle. It had high-speed air brakes which were original equipment on the F-104, high-speed drogue parachutes to be deployed at , and low-speed drogue parachutes for deployment below . The vehicle also had an anti-skid neodymium rare-earth magnet eddy- current brake. The vehicle failing to stop has been suggested as a factor in the crash of the North American Eagle in an August 2019 land-speed record run. Runs Fourteen engine test runs were conducted on a test stand, the first in June 2004, with the last two using full afterburner. In December 2004, the first test runs of the vehicle were performed. A total of 23 test runs were completed with the vehicle between March 2006 and June 2008. Speeds as high as were claimed but not verified by outside official automobile speed record authorities. Testing in the US was conducted at Sanderson Field in Shelton, Washington; Toledo Airport in southwest Washington state; Edwards AFB, California; El Mirage Dry Lake, California; and Black Rock Desert, Nevada.

It was published in 1917, and remains Cahan's best known work. Plot summary The book is told in the form of a fictional autobiography of David Levinsky, a Russian Jew who emigrates to America and rises from rags to riches. Book I: Home and School The main character, David Levinsky, is born in 1865 in Antomir, a city of 80,000 in the Kovno district of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania). His father dies when he is three, leaving him and his mother to fend for themselves. He grows up in abject poverty. Better off relatives send him to a private cheder for elementary instruction in Judaism and the Torah. From abuse by some rich kids, he becomes one of the tougher kids, but also excels academically. Book II: Enter Satan At age 13 David finishes his cheder education and begins Talmudic studies in a yeshivah. He meets and befriends Reb (Rabbi) Sender who has been supported by his wife while he spent sixteen hours daily studying the Talmud. Reb Sender is one of the most \\"nimble-minded\\" scholars in the town, and well liked. He also befriends Naphtali, another student two years ahead of him. David and Naphtali often study together at nightly vigils until morning worshippers come. David begins to feel an inner conflict between the religious instruction he receives and his growing interest in girls. He also thinks of his childhood dislike for Red Esther, the daughter of one of the other families in his basement home. Meanwhile, a Pole moves to Antomir and becomes a regular reader at the synagogue. The Pole has memorized 500 pages of the Talmud and recites by memory, provoking David's jealousy. He begins memorizing sections of the Talmud, but Reb Sender finds out and questions his motivation. This leads to a physical confrontation between David and the Pole. Book III: I Lose my Mother David is harassed in the Horse-market during Passover by a group of gentiles celebrating Easter; one gentile punches him. His mother sees his split lip and goes out to set straight the gentile who hit him, though advised not to. She is beaten to death and dies that night. After mourning he moves into the synagogue, as was often customary for poorer Talmudic students, and continues his studies. As was also customary for poor talmudic students, he \\"eats days\\" at the houses of benefactors, who invite Talmudic scholars for one meal per week. By and large, however, he goes hungry, until Shiphrah Minsker-- a rich Jewish woman--hears of his plight. Finally well-fed, he reapplies himself to his studies. He has, however, lost interest in the Talmud. After the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1881 and anti-Jewish riots, many Jews participated in the \\"great New Exodus\\"; David thoughts turn to seeking his fortune in America. Book IV: Matilda David's thoughts and attention have turned from his Talmudic studies towards America. He falls ill and is visited by Shiphrah every day in the hospital. After discharge, Shiphrah takes into her home while her husband is out of town on business long-term. He meets her daughter, Matilda, who has studied at a boarding school in Germany as well at secular Russian schools. Matilda taunts him in Yiddish while conversing with her friends in Russian, a language David does not understand. She urges him to get an education at a Russian university, but he insists on going to America to work so he can finance his studies. Matilda is convinced and offers to finance his journey. He realizes he is \\"deeply in love\\" with her. Matilda floats the idea of his studying at a Russian university. When word arrives that Matilda's father is returning from his business trip, David returns to the synagogue. She stops by to give him the 80 rubles the trip would cost and wishes him luck. On the eve of the one-year anniversary of his mother's death, he goes to the train station, and is seen off by his friends. Book V: I Discover America 1885: David boards a steamer from Bremen to New York. He spends most of the journey praying, reading Psalm 104, and thinking about Matilda. He meets a fellow passenger, Gitelson, and wanders through the city. A man recognizes Gitelson to be a tailor and offers him work. David wanders about and is repeatedly called a greenhorn. At a synagogue he asks to sleep there for the night, but is told repeatedly that \\"America is not Russia.\\" There he meets Mr. Even, a wealthy Jewish man, gives him money, clothing, dinner, and a haircut--including the removal of his sidelocks and arranges for lodging. He asks David not to neglect his religion and his Talmud. David spends the money on dry goods and begins to work as a peddler, managing to pay for rent and food, and makes no headway. He changes to selling linens, but his heart isn't really in it. He is terribly homesick. He spends many of his free evenings reading at the synagogue, but still gradually sheds his Russian- Jewish traits. His overall impression is that America is an impious land. Book VI: A Greenhorn No Longer David's reflects on other peddlers, and their coarse and exaggerated stories. One Max Margolis tells him he's a \\"good- looking chap\\", and recommends he learn to dance, adding that \\"every woman can be won.\\" David tries to with his landlady who rejects him and says that he is no longer a greenhorn. He tries his former landlady, who kisses him once but rejects further advances. Work is only an obligation which he doesn't like. He enrolls in night school, learns English and tries to copy his teacher's mannerisms. His teacher gives David a copy of Dombey and Son by Charles Dickens. He neglects his work peddling and spends his time reading the book. David is fired but impressed by his own progress learning English. He spends a lot of time in a music shop where he borrows a lot of nickels, dimes, and quarters he is unable to repay. Book VII: My Temple After nearly two years in America, David has a chance encounter with Gitelson, the tailor from the ship. Gitelson is now successful and well-dressed, while David is poor and shabbily dressed. On Gitelson's urging, David begins a 6am-9pm apprenticeship. He begins earning and saving, attending local Jewish theater, and practicing his English. Working 16 hour days and saving aggressively, David hopes to save enough money to support himself so he can attend the City College of New York, to which he refers as his new \\"temple\\". During the garment industry's idle season he resume his studies. He shows little interest in socialists and the garment workers union. Book VIII: The Destruction of My Temple He \\"destroys\\" his temple by using the money he saved up to start his own business in the garment industry. One order he filled went to a company that went bankrupt, so he is terribly in debt. After a while, he gets a check from the company stating they had re-formed themselves, and he is sent his payment for the cloaks/coats or whatever. His business slowly starts taking off and he trades his studies for his business. Book IX: Dora David meets Max's wife Dora, and becomes close with the entire family. He moves in with the family and begins to develop feelings towards Dora. David and the family move to a larger apartment up town, as was the trend to move up in society through the northern development of New York City. During their secretive affair David begins to become successful, having received an overdue paycheck and is finally able to afford materials for his shop. Orders begin to increase. David travels to acquire new business. He buys a bracelet for Dora, but she rejects him, partly from fear of being found out. Dora asks David to move out and he continues to focus on his business. Book X: On the Road He set up his business to run while he goes across the country trying to sell his garments, and he goes on and on about selling cloaks. Book XI: Matrimony He visits a marriage broker and is set up with some woman. His fortune continues to grow. He also has to deal with socialists because he doesn't pay his workers (mostly orthodox Jews) terribly well but they don't complain. He's set to marry this woman but then the next chapter happens. Book XII: Miss Tevkin Since the woman he is supposed to marry belongs to a religious family, on his trip to visit them, he realizes he can't arrive so they'll notice he traveled on the sabbath, so he stops at a resort for a night. There, he is smitten by this chick, miss Tevkin, who doesn't want him. He still falls in love with her because he's been doing that pretty regularly for the past 400 pages, that is, falling in love with women who don't reciprocate his love. He breaks it off with his fiancee. Book XIII: At Her Father's House He befriends their family and supports their socialist causes (she is a socialist) to try and win her favor. She marries some other guy. Book XIV: Episodes of a Lonely Life He reflects on how lonely he is and wishes he had been a socialist rather than a capitalist. He says he isn't happy and in spite of the women who want him, the only girl he can think about is Miss Tevkin.

Its mission is to provide a high-quality, STEM-focused and college-preparatory education through a network of charter schools, while offering exceptional programs, comprehensive services, and opportunities to partner in education. Its vision is to be the leading educational network and dedicated partner in preparing future generations by creating opportunities to unleash their potential for a more productive and peaceful society. The group currently operates or manages thirty tuition-free science, technology and math-focused schools in six Midwest states. Serving more than 13,500 students, Concept-managed schools are located in urban areas in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri.Concept Schools Member Schools Out of roughly 13,500 students, 86% are minority students and 85% come from economically disadvantaged families. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year, Concept Schools is the charter operator for Horizon Science Academy McKinley Park, Horizon Science Academy Belmont, and Horizon Science Academy Southwest Chicago. Concept entered into a management agreement with local school boards to provide operational and academics services to manage an additional 27 charter public schools. School Governance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors of each school. Each Board is the charter holder and is held accountable by a charter authorizer. Each Board provides oversight and accountability in the management of the school, including financial oversight exercised by a review of financial updates at each Board meeting.  Ohio schools  In 2009, Horizon Science Academy Cleveland received a National Blue Ribbon Award from the US Department of education. Three years later, the Horizon Science Academy High School in Columbus received a National Blue Ribbon as well. In 2014, Concept Schools in Ohio and two other states were served search warrants alleging embezzlement of federal grants, though no criminal charges were filed by 2016. In March 2020, the Ohio Auditor of State reported that 14 institutions run by Concept Schools in Ohio had clean audit records. Schools with \\"clean\\" audit reports submit financial reports did not contain any findings for recovery, material citations, material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, Uniform Guidance findings or questioned costs. Two of those schools‚ÄîHSA Denison Middle School and HSA Columbus Middle School‚Äîwere awarded the 2019 Momentum Award by the Ohio Department of Education. The Momentum Award recognizes institutions that exceeded expectations for learning outcomes of for students in certain demographics. Concept Schools in the Media In 2014 schools run by Concept in three states were been raided by the FBI. In total, nineteen search warrants were executed by the FBI on June 4, 2014. The Concept Schools have known links to the Gulen Movement and its schools. Both the schools and Concept Schools Vice President Salim Ucan appear in the 2014 documentary Love is a Verb, which details the history and activities of the movement. However, Ucan denies any connection between Concept Schools and the Gulen movement in the film.  School Openings  Like many charter public schools, those within the Concept network struggle to find safe and secure facilities within the historically underserved communities that need another choice than their local schools. Concept Schools partners with a variety of charter authorizers and facilities developers to identify the best possible sites for students. In 2014, Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett prohibited the opening of a Concept School in Chicago due to visible mold, water-damaged floors, damaged ceilings, and asbestos.  E-Rate Investigation  In June 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Education, and Federal Communications Commission conducted joint raids on Concept Schools and several Concept network schools in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio for \\"allegations of white collar crime,\\" according to FBI spokesperson Vicki Anderson. The raids were in connection with E-Rate, which provides discounted technology resources to schools, and alleged that Concept Schools diverted $5 million of federal grants away from schools.

These portrayals have frequently reflected an ethnocentric perception of East Asians rather than realistic and authentic depictions of East Asian cultures, colors, customs, and behaviors. Yellowface, a form of theatrical makeup used by European-American performers to represent an East Asian person (similar to the practice of blackface used to represent African- American performers), continues to be used in film and theater. In the 21st century alone, Grindhouse (in a trailer parody of the Fu Manchu serials), Balls of Fury, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Crank: High Voltage, and Cloud Atlas all feature yellowface or non-East Asian actors as East Asian caricatures.\\"The Practice of Yellow Face,\\" by Vickie Rozel, TheatreWorks Silicon Valley In The Works theatreworks.commercialmedia.com  Early East Asian American film actors   Sessue Hayakawa  The Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa began appearing in films around 1914.www.goldsea.com Sessue Hayakawa: The Legend Signed to Paramount Pictures, he had roles in more than 20 silent films including The Wrath of the Gods (1914) and The Typhoon (1914), and was considered to be a Hollywood sex symbol. When Hayakawa's contract with Paramount expired in 1918, the studio still wanted him to star in an upcoming movie, but Hayakawa turned them down in favor of starting his own company. He was at the height of his popularity during that time. His career in the United States suffered a bit due to the advent of talkies, as he had a heavy Japanese accent. He became unemployable during the World War II era due to anti- Japanese prejudice. He experienced a career revival beginning in 1949 in World War II-themed films, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Even though she was internationally known by 1924, her film roles were limited by stereotype and prejudice. Tired of being both typecast and passed over for lead East Asian character roles in favor of European-American actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe.

Philip Ahn  Korean-American actor Philip Ahn, after rejection for speaking English too well, braved death threats after playing Japanese villains. Ahn would go on to have a prolific career. Some East and South Asian-American actors nonetheless attempted to start careers. Merle Oberon, an Anglo-Indian, was able to get starring roles after concocting a phony story about her origins and using skin whitening make-up. There were others pioneering East Asian-American actors like Benson Fong (who played the Number Three son in the Charlie Chan films), Victor Sen Yung (who played the Number Two son in the Charlie Chan films), Richard Loo (who also played many Japanese villain roles), Lotus Long (known for her role as Lin Wen opposite Keye Luke in the Phantom of Chinatown), Suzanna Kim, Barbara Jean Wong, Fely Franquelli, Chester Gan, Honorable Wu, Kam Tong, Layne Tom Jr., Maurice Liu, Rudy Robles, Teru Shimada, Willie Fung, Toshia Mori and Wing Foo, who all began their film careers in the 1930s and '40s. With the number of East Asian- American actors available, actor Robert Ito wrote an article that described that job protection for Caucasian actors was one reason Asians were portrayed by Caucasians. \\"With the relatively small percentage of actors that support themselves by acting, it was only logical that they should try to limit the available talent pool as much as possible. One way of doing this was by placing restrictions on minority actors, which, in the case of Asian actors, meant that they could usually only get roles as houseboys, cooks, laundrymen, and crazed war enemies, with the rare \\"white hero's loyal sidekick\\" roles going to the big name actors. When the script called for a larger Asian role, it was almost inevitably given to a white actor.\\"www.brightlightsflim.com A Certain Slant  Recent East Asian American film actors  The 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians starred Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh, Gemma Chan, Lisa Lu, Awkwafina, Harry Shum Jr., Ken Jeong, Sonoya Mizuno, Chris Pang, Jimmy O.

Madame Butterfly \\"Madame Butterfly\\" was originally a short story written by Philadelphia attorney John Luther Long. It was turned into a one- act play, Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan, by David Belasco. Giacomo Puccini re-made the play into the Italian opera Madama Butterfly, set in 1904. The 1915 silent film version was directed by Sidney Olcott and starred Mary Pickford. All the versions of Madame Butterfly tell the story of a young Japanese woman who has converted to Christianity (for which she is disowned by her family) and marries Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton, a white lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. For him, the marriage is a temporary convenience, but Butterfly's conversion is sincere, and she takes her marriage vows seriously. Pinkerton's naval duties eventually call him away from Japan. He leaves Butterfly behind and she soon gives birth to their son. Pinkerton eventually meets and marries a white American woman (the fact he stopped paying the rent on Butterfly's house amounted to a divorce under Japanese law at the time). Pinkerton returns to Japan with his new wife, Kate, to claim his son. Butterfly acquiesces to his request, and then kills herself as Pinkerton rushes into the house, too late to stop her. In the original story by Long, Butterfly is on the point of killing herself when the presence of her child reminds her of her Christian conversion, and the story ends with Mr and Mrs Pinkerton arriving at the house the next morning to find it completely empty. Early film Americans have been putting Asian characters into films since 1896; however, it was historically common to hire white actors to portray Asian characters. Although some Asian characters are played by Asian actors in early films that surround an Asian story or setting, most of the main characters are played by white actors, even when the role is written as an Asian character. Mr. Wu (1913) Mr. Wu was originally a stage play, written by Harold Owen and Harry M. Vernon. It was first staged in London in 1913, with Matheson Lang in the lead. He became so popular in the role that he starred in a 1919 film version. Lang continued to play Oriental roles (although not exclusively), and his autobiography was titled Mr. Wu Looks Back (1940). The first U.S. production opened in New York on October 14, 1914. The actor Frank Morgan was in the original Broadway cast, appearing under his original name Frank Wupperman. Lon Chaney Sr. and Ren√©e Ador√©e were cast in the 1927 film. Cheekbones and lips were built up with cotton and collodion, the ends of cigar holders were inserted into his nostrils, and the long fingernails were constructed from stripes of painted film stock. Chaney used fishskin to fashion an Oriental cast to his eyes and grey crepe hair was used to create the distinctive Fu- Manchu moustache and goatee. The Forbidden City (1918) The Forbidden City is a 1918 American silent drama film starring Norma Talmadge and Thomas Meighan and directed by Sidney Franklin. A copy of the film is in the Library of Congress and other film archives.The plot centers around an inter-racial romance between a Chinese princess (Norma Talmadge) and an American. When palace officials discover she has fallen pregnant she is sentenced to death. In the latter part of the film Talmadge plays the now adult daughter of the affair, seeking her father in the Philippines. Broken Blossoms (1919) The film Broken Blossoms is based on a short story, \\"The Chink and the Child\\", taken from the book Limehouse Nights by Thomas Burke.www.tcm.com Spotlight: Broken Blossoms It was released in 1919, during a period of strong anti- Chinese feeling in the U.S., a fear known as the Yellow Peril. Griffith changed Burke's original story to promote a message of tolerance. In Burke's story, the Chinese protagonist is a sordid young Shanghai drifter pressed into naval service, who frequents opium dens and whorehouses; in the film, he becomes a Buddhist missionary whose initial goal is to spread the dharma of the Buddha and peace (although he is also shown frequenting opium dens when he is depressed). Even at his lowest point, he still prevents his gambling companions from fighting.  Tea House of the August Moon (1956) The original story of this film was from a novel version written by Vern Sneider in 1952. Tea House of the August Moon film version was adapted in 1956 from the play version in 1953, written by John Patrick. This American comedy film is directed by Daniel Mann. The plot is surrounded by the concept of the United States military government trying to establish power and influence over Japan, specifically in Okinawa, during wartime. Although the cast does include actual Japanese actors and actresses that fit the Japanese characters in the film, such as Machiko Ky≈ç, Jun Negami, Nijiko Kiyokawa, and Mitsuko Sawamura, the main character, Sakini, is played by a white American actor, Marlon Brando. Flower Drum Song (1961) Flower Drum Song is a 1961 film adaptation of the 1958 Broadway play of the same title. This adaptation tells the story of a Chinese woman emigrating to the U.S. and her subsequent arranged marriage. This movie featured the first majority Asian cast in Hollywood cinema, setting a precedent for the following The Joy Luck Club and Crazy Rich Asians to have a majority Asian casting. It became the first major Hollywood feature film to have a majority Asian cast in a contemporary Asian- American story. The Joy Luck Club (1993) The Joy Luck Club is a 1993 American drama directed by Wayne Wang. The story is based the novel of the same name by Amy Tan.

It was directed by Rupert Sanders and featured Scarlett Johansson as the main character. This movie was set in the future and revolved around a story of a cyborg discovering her past. This film was controversial due to the fact that the casting featured a Caucasian with the movie being accused of racism and Whitewashing in film. After the controversy erupted, after it was reported that Paramount Pictures examined the possibility of using CGI to make Scarlett Johansson appear ‚Äúmore Asian.‚Äù Crazy Rich Asians (2018) Crazy Rich Asians is a 2018 film adaptation of the book by the same name by Kevin Kwan. Despite being a critical and commercial success, the film received controversy over the casting of mixed race actors and non-Chinese actors in ethnically Chinese roles, as well as portraying the characters speaking British English and American English over Singaporean English. The movie was also criticized for its lack of diversity, with critics stating that the movie did not properly depict the variety of ethnic groups in Singapore. Lead actress Constance Wu responded to criticisms, stating that the film would not represent every Asian American given that the majority of characters depicted in the movie were ethnically Chinese and extremely wealthy. Time magazine also noted that the film was the \\"first modern story with an all-Asian cast and an Asian-American lead\\" since the release of the 1993 film The Joy Luck Club.

The show follows a martial arts prodigy and his involvement in the Tong Wars of 1870s San Francisco. Bruce Lee developed the show in 1971, but had trouble pitching it to Warner Bros. and Paramount.\\"From The Pierre Berton Show December 8, 1971 (comments near end of part 2 & early in part 3) Lee's concept was retooled as Kung Fu, with David Carradine, a white actor, cast in the lead role; Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. The show premiered on Cinemax on April 5, 2019 and was subsequently renewed for a second season. Classic Hollywood cinema Fu Manchu In 1929, the character Fu Manchu made his American film debut in The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu played by the Swedish-American actor Warner Oland. Oland repeated the role in 1930s The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu and 1931's Daughter of the Dragon. Oland appeared in character in the 1931 musical, Paramount on Parade where the Devil Doctor was seen to murder both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes. In 1932, Boris Karloff took over the character in the film The Mask of Fu Manchu. The film's tone has long been considered racist and offensive,Gregory William Mank, Hollywood Cauldron: 13 Horror Films from the Genres's Golden Age. McFarland, 2001 (pp. 53-89); Christopher Frayling, quoted in \\"Fu Manchu\\", in Newman, Kim (ed.), The BFI Companion to Horror. London, Cassell,1996, pp. 131-32; but that only added to its cult status alongside its humor and Grand Guignol sets and torture sequences. The film was suppressed for many years, but has since received critical re-evaluation and been released on DVD uncut. Charlie Chan In a series of films in the 1930s and '40s, Chinese-American detective Charlie Chan was played by white actors Warner Oland, Sidney Toler and Roland Winters. The Swedish-born Oland, unlike his two successors in the Chan role, actually looked somewhat Chinese, and according to his contemporaries, he did not use special makeup in the role. He also played East Asians in other films, including Shanghai Express, The Painted Veil, and Werewolf of London. (Decades later, Afro-European American TV actor Khigh Dhiegh, though of African and European descent, was generally cast as an East Asian because of his appearance, and he was often included on lists of East Asian actors.) The Good Earth American actor Luise Rainer as O-Lan in 1937 film The Good Earth The Good Earth (1937) is a film about Chinese farmers who struggle to survive.www.asian-studies.org What's So Bad About \\"The Good Earth\\" by Charles W. Hayford. It was adapted by Talbot Jennings, Tess Slesinger, and Claudine West from the play by Donald Davis and Owen Davis, which was itself based on the 1931 novel The Good Earth by Nobel Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck. The film was directed by Sidney Franklin, Victor Fleming (uncredited) and Gustav Machaty (uncredited). The film's budget was $2.8 million, relatively expensive for the time, and took three years to make. Although Pearl Buck intended the film to be cast with all Chinese or Chinese-American actors, the studio opted to use established American stars, tapping Europeans Paul Muni and Luise Rainer for the lead roles. Both had won Oscars the previous year: Rainer for her role in The Great Ziegfeld and Muni for the lead in The Story of Louis Pasteur. When questioned about his choice of the actors, producer Irving Thalberg responded by saying, \\"I'm in the business of creating illusions.\\" Anna May Wong had been considered a top contender for the role of O-Lan, the Chinese heroine of the novel. However, because Paul Muni was a white man, the Hays Code's anti-miscegenation rules required the actress who played his wife to be a white woman. So, MGM gave the role of O-Lan to a European actress and offered Wong the role of Lotus, the story's villain. Wong refused to be the only Chinese-American, playing the only negative character, stating: \\"I won't play the part. If you let me play O-Lan, I'll be very glad. But you're asking me‚Äîwith Chinese blood‚Äîto do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all- American cast portraying Chinese characters.\\"www.asiaarts.ucla.edu Profile of Anna May Wong: Remembering The Silent Star by Kenneth Quan MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as \\"one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s\\". The Good Earth was nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Direction (Sidney Franklin), Best Cinematography (Karl Freund), and Best Film Editing (Basil Wrangell). In addition to the Best Actress award (Luise Rainer), the film won for Best Cinematography.tcm.com Spotlight: The Good Earth The year The Good Earth came out, Wong appeared on the cover of Look magazine's second issue, which labeled her \\"The World's Most Beautiful Chinese Girl.\\"Corliss, Richard.

Breakfast at Tiffany's The 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's has been criticized for its portrayal of the character Mr. Yunioshi, Holly's bucktoothed, stereotyped Japanese neighbor. Mickey Rooney wore makeup to change his features to a caricatured approximation of a Japanese person. In the 45th-anniversary- edition DVD release, producer Richard Shepherd repeatedly apologizes, saying, \\"If we could just change Mickey Rooney, I'd be thrilled with the movie\\".Breakfast at Tiffany's: The Making of a Classic Director Blake Edwards stated, \\"Looking back, I wish I had never done it ... and I would give anything to be able to recast it, but it's there, and onward and upward\\". In a 2008 interview about the film, 87-year-old Rooney said he was heartbroken about the criticism and that he had never received any complaints about his portrayal of the character.  Sixteen Candles  The 1984 American film Sixteen Candles has been criticized for the character of Long Duk Dong. This Asian character became an \\"Asian American stereotype for a new generation\\". Long Duk Dong displayed a variety of stereotypes in the film such being socially awkward and difficult to understand, and the \\"lecherous but sexually inept loser\\". The idea of Asians being more feminine and therefore \\"weaker\\" is further exemplified through Long Duk Dong's romantic relationship with one of the characters in the film. He assumes the more feminine role while the American girl becomes the more masculine of two in the relationship. This shows how the Asian characters are far inferior compared to their Western counterparts. Theater \\"Yellowface\\" in theatre has been called \\"the practice of white actors donning overdone face paint and costumes that serves as a caricatured representation of traditional Asian garb.\\" Founded in 2011, an organization known as, \\"The Asian American Performers Action Coalition\\" or the AAPAC work in an effort to, \\"expand the perception of Asian American performers in order to increase their access to and representation on New York City's stages.\\" This group works to address and discuss \\"yellowface\\" controversies and occurrences. Miss Saigon Miss Saigon, a musical with music by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, lyrics by Alain Boublil and Richard Maltby Jr. and book by Boublil and Sch√∂nberg, is a modern adaptation of Giacomo Puccini's opera \\"Madame Butterfly\\". Miss Saigon tells the story of a doomed romance involving a Vietnamese woman and an American soldier set in the time of the Vietnam War. When Miss Saigon premiered at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London on September 20, 1989, Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce wore heavy prosthetic eyelids and skin darkening cream in playing The Engineer, a mixed- race French-Vietnamese pimp. Once the London production came to Broadway in 1990, Pryce was slated to reprise his role as The Engineer, causing a major rift in American theater circles and sparking public outcry. Tony Award- winning playwright David Henry Hwang wrote a letter to the Actors' Equity Association protesting this portrayal of a Eurasian character being played by a White actor. Despite these protests, Pryce performed the Engineer to great acclaim and Miss Saigon became one of Broadway's longest-running hits. The Mikado The Mikado is a comic operetta, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert, premiered in 1885 in London and still performed frequently in the English-speaking world and beyond.Kenrick, John. \\"The Gilbert & Sullivan Story: Part III\\" , Musicals101.com, accessed November 11, 2016Steinberg, Neil. \\"Updated Mikado promises to be as rousing as ever\\". Chicago Sun-Times, December 6, 2010 In setting the opera in a fictionalized 19th-century Japan, Gilbert used the veneer of Far Eastern exoticism to soften the impact of his pointed satire of British institutions and politics.\\"Mikado Genesis\\", Lyric Opera San Diego Numerous 21st-century U.S. productions of The Mikado have been criticized for the use of yellowface in their casting: New York (2004 and 2015), Los Angeles (2007 and 2009), Boston (2007), Austin (2011), Denver (2013), and Seattle (2014) The press noted that the Seattle Gilbert & Sullivan Society cast the 10 principal roles and the chorus with white actors, with the exception of two Latino actors. In 2015, the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players cancelled a production of The Mikado that was set to feature their repertory company of mostly White actors, due to complaints from the East Asian-American community. The company redesigned its production in collaboration with an advisory group of East Asian-American theater professionals and debuted the new concept in 2016, receiving a warm review in The New York Times.Fonseca-Wollheim, Corinna da. \\"Is The Mikado Too Politically Incorrect to Be Fixed? Maybe Not.\\", December 30, 2016 After Lamplighters Music Theatre of San Francisco planned a 2016 production, objections by the East Asian-American community prompted them to re-set the operetta in Renaissance-era Milan, replacing all references to Japan with Milan.Tran, Diep. \\"Building a Better Mikado, Minus the Yellowface\\", American Theatre, April 20, 2016 Reviewers felt that the change resolved the issue. The King and I The King and I is a musical by Richard Rodgers (composer) and Oscar von Hammerstein II (lyricist). Based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, the story illustrates the clash of Eastern and Western cultures by relaying the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict and constant bickering throughout the musical, as well as by a love that neither can confess. The 2015 Dallas Summer Musicals' production of the musical caused controversy in the casting of a European-American actor as King Mongkut. In an open letter to Dallas Summer Musicals, the AAPAC criticized the choice, saying \\"the casting of a white King dramaturgically undermines a story about a clash between Western and Eastern cultures\\"; moreover, \\"Asian impersonation denies Asians our own subjecthood. It situates all the power within a Caucasian- centric world view.\\"  Asian representation in American animated films   Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips (1944)  Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips is an eight minute animated short directed by Friz Freleng and produced through Warner Bros. Cartoons as part of the Merrie Melodies cartoon series. It portrays Japanese stereotypes of the Japanese Emperor, military, sumo wrestler, and geisha through Bugs Bunny and his interactions with a Japanese soldier on an island.  Siamese Cats in Lady and the Tramp (1955)  Lady and the Tramp is an animated musical film directed by Clyde Geronimi Wilfred Jackson. Voice actors include Peggy Lee, Barbara Luddy, Larry Roberts, Bill Thompson, Bill Baucon, Steve Freberg, Verna Felton, Alan Reed, George Givot, Dallas, McKennon, and Lee Millar. Although this animation is about dogs, the portrayal of the Siamese cats with buck-teeth and slanted eyes was criticized by many who believed that it was a racist representation of stereotypical Asians. The exaggerated accents were also mocking of the Thai language.  Mulan (1998)  The animated film, Mulan, was produced by the Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures in 1998. It is based on an old traditional Chinese folktale about a young girl, Hua Mulan, who disguises as a man to take his father's spot in the army. It boasts international popularity and distribution. This film was so successful that in 2004, Mulan II, its sequel was produced. However, this is not the first or only animation to adapt Mulan's story. In 1998, United American Video Entertainment produced an animation called, The Secret of Mulan, that uses six-legged caterpillars to represent the characters in a friendlier way for young children.  Bao (2018)  Bao is one of Pixar's animated shorts produced in 2018 and directed by Domee Shi. It portrays the importance of family and culture in the Chinese American community. The plot surrounds a story about a Chinese mother who creates a baby dumpling that comes to life to help her cope with the loneliness and grief in missing her son who has grown up. Other examples in Western media Actors Nancy Kwan and David Carradine in the 1970s TV series, Kung Fu A prominent example of the whitewashing of Asian roles is the 1970s TV series, Kung Fu, in which the leading character‚Äîa Chinese monk and martial arts master who fled China after having accidentally slain the emperor's nephew‚Äîis portrayed by European-American actor, David Carradine. The film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story describes to some extent the struggles that ensued when Hollywood moguls attempted to cast Bruce Lee in the starring role of Caine but were overruled. American actress Emma Stone played a half-Asian character in the film Aloha. In the film Cloud Atlas every major male character in the Korean story line was played by a non-Asian actor made up in yellowface makeup. Michael Derrick Hudson, an American poet, used a Chinese female nom de plume.

At Last the 1948 Show  MacDonald came to national attention in At Last the 1948 Show, for which she had been spotted by David Frost. At the opening and closing of the show and between longer sketches, she would present short pieces on the theme of her loveliness.

I shall probably live in sin for the rest of my life\\".Quoted in The Oldie, March 2007 She owned a racehorse named Weep No More. Her name was linked to politicians, including Labour Minister John Stonehouse (whose secretary and mistress Sheila Buckley named her as one of his lovers) and future Conservative Prime Minister John Major. MacDonald has denied relationships with either man, or ever having met \\"poor John Major\\", though she did recall Stonehouse as \\"tall, dark\\" and \\"very attractive to women\\". In her sixties, she observed that \\"everyone gets hysterical if I say hello to a politician today... It's very annoying to be branded a scarlet woman\\".

Frame semantics, best exemplified by the FrameNet project, views words as evoking frames of knowledge and frames as typically involving multiple components, called frame elements (e.g. buyer and goods in an acquisition). The term null refers to the fact that the frame element in question is absent. The logical object of the term instantiation refers to the frame element itself. So, null instantiation is an empty instantiation of a frame element. Ruppenhofer and MichaelisRuppenhofer and Michaelis 2014 postulate an implicational regularity tying the interpretation type of an omitted argument to the frame membership of its predicator: \\"If a particular frame element role is lexically omissible under a particular interpretation (either anaphoric or existential) for one LU [lexical unit] in a frame, then for any other LUs in the same frame that allow the omission of this same FE [frame element], the interpretation of the missing FE is the same.\\" (Ruppenhofer and Michaelis 2014: 66) Definite null instantiation Definite null instantiation is the absence of a frame element that is recoverable from the context. It is similar to a zero anaphor. Indefinite null instantiation Indefinite null instantiation is the absence of the object of a potentially transitive verb such as eat or drink. Constructional null instantiation Constructional null instantiation is the absence of a frame element due to a syntactic construction, e.g. the optional omission of agents in passive sentences.

When she was only six, her mother died in a domestic accident. Costanza was then entrusted to the care of the nuns of St. Clare of Charity in the Monastery of Ferentino. She drew inspiration from the Lives of the Saints and periodicals describing the life of the missionaries. At the age of 16, she felt a vocation to be a member of the small monastic congregation which had raised her and she was quickly accepted and given the name Sister Mary Catherine of St. Rose of Viterbo.\\"Brief History\\", Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Shortly after her religious profession, she was named as Secretary of the monastery and of the Abbess. Her prayers and work then supported the Abbess in their efforts to help the development of their small religious congregation, which was struggling to follow a more strictly cloistered life. Thoughts of working in the foreign missions, however, never left her mind. It was at this time in her life that Father Joseph Modena, O.F.M., became the confessor to the nuns of the monastery (1851). Father Joseph had recently returned from a period of missionary service in Alexandria, Egypt. While there, he had learned from the Apostolic Delegate to that nation about the great need for education among the children of that country. He sought to find religious sisters to fill this need and spoke to various monasteries in search of volunteers. The community in Ferentino chose to support his quest and to send some of the nuns to Egypt. Several years of preparation were spent seeking the various approvals needed from both ecclesiastical and civil authorities for such a step. Finally, all permissions had been received, a house in Cairo had been purchased through the help of a relative of Sister Catherine, thus a party of six nuns set out for Egypt, led by the Abbess herself. They arrived in Cairo on September 14, 1859 and immediately set about gathering children to teach and going out among the poor to care for the sick. Sister Mary Catherine worked to establish houses for orphans.\\"100 years in the Holy Land. The Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary\\", Custodia Terrae Santae, April 30, 2019 The sisters soon learned Arabic to make their mission effective. Sister Catherine provided much of the leadership of the new foundation, due to the poor health of the Abbess. In the Chapter of 1863, she herself was elected as Abbess, and from that time was addressed as Mother Mary Catherine. It was at this juncture that the monastic community in Ferentino chose to withdraw from its support of the Mission. Faced with either returning to Italy or closing a Mission that was just beginning to flourish, she and her companions decided to separate from their monastic congregation. They chose to re-organize under the Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis and received formal approval of the Holy See on November 10, 1868, under the name of the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of Egypt. Sisters of Cairo Immediately after receiving the approval of the new congregation by Pope Pius IX, Mother Catherine and nine members of the original community made profession of religious vows under the new Rule. They were joined by nine new novices in taking the new habit. Around 1869, Mother Catherine made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and decided to establish a convent in Jerusalem. Soon new missions were founded throughout Egypt, and then abroad, in Milan, and Malta and. The work of the congregation developed under Mother Catherine's leadership for nearly two decades, until she fell ill while in Cairo during Eastertide 1887. She died there the following May 6. Mother Catherine was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1985. The congregation today The congregation is now called the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The work of the sisters continued to spread through the continent of Africa, expanding to West Africa, and then to both North America and to South America as well as to Asia. In 2019, the community celebrated the 100 anniversary of the establishment of the Province of the Child Jesus in the Holy Land.

It was built originally for the Etobicoke Board of Education and is now a part of the Toronto District School Board. The school is located at the corner of Fordwich Crescent and Islington Avenue. The split-level school is located next to the western branch of the Humber River (Ontario). The motto of the school is \\"Scientia Crescat Vita Colatur\\" (Let knowledge grow so that life may be enriched). History Thistletown's first school, made of one frame schoolhouse was opened in 1874 on the east side of Islington Av., just south of Albion Rd. but was moved eastward to Village Green in 1901. Over the last century the school was expanded to reflect the growth in the village and a new building was built in 1947 and the school was renamed to Thistletown Middle School. Since closing in 1985, it became the Thistletown Multi-Service Centre and now houses a daycare, a seniors centre, and Parks and Recreation programs, as well as a number of community agencies. In need for a high school in Thistletown, construction of the school began in 1956, and its first students were admitted in September 1957 as Etobicoke‚Äôs seventh secondary school. The school building, designed by Gordon Adamson Architects, was inspired by a similar one found in Switzerland. The late 1960s witnessed a notable expansion, mainly of technical and vocational facilities. Thistletown has a very diverse student population and its students have consistently performed adequately in both athletic and academic endeavours. Thistletown C.I. offers many resources to its students, from a free daily breakfast programme that started in 2008 to multiple after-school clubs, and an in school police officer. Thistletown C.I. has also launched its well-known charity event \\"Cuts for Cancer\\" where students donate and shave their hair in efforts to raise cancer awareness. This event has raised on average of $2500/year in donations to the Canadian Cancer Society. Other student philanthropy initiatives include the annual World Vision 30 Hours of Famine, the UNICEF CN Tower Climb, and Red Cross Relief Efforts. Outside of school hours, Thistletown C.I. is the location of 700 David Hornell V.C. Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets for its Squardron Training Night. Campus Thistletown Collegiate is a white-bricked, two-storey secondary school on a 14.5 acre campus containing 34 composite classrooms, four science labs, a home economics room, three arts rooms, a library, guidance offices, three gymnasiums, seven vocational and technical shops, a cafeteria with a professional kitchen, and a curved auditorium. The layout and architecture is unique as the main entrance is located on the second level with a hill-like landscape oriented towards east to Islington Avenue. Similar to all other schools in the former city of Etobicoke, the auditorium is located west of the school. Lockers are colored with the accent tones of red, black and white. It has 8 fire exits. Athletics In 2009, Thistletown C.I. started its football program up with a very successful season. They were crowned champions in 2015, primarily due to not letting a single touchdown occur. They won for a consecutive time in 2016. In 2005, Thistletown C.I.'s varsity hockey team won the city championship and the year before, they went undefeated all season. Athletic triumphs include the Etobicoke senior football championship, earned in 1969 by defeating the Etobicoke H.S. Rams, led by John Villiers, Al Thomas, John Griffin. The senior basketball team reached the T.D.I.A.A. finals (consisting of all the outlying boroughs of the metropolitan Toronto area in those days, including Etobicoke, Scarborough, North York, East York, and York) in 1972 and 1975, only to suffer defeat at the hands of the George Harvey Hawks. Prominent contributors from that era include Edgar Jaunzarins, Steve and Ross Quackenbush, Trevor Bennett, and Ken King.

The Bearsville Records label was under the same ownership. History The studio was opened in 1969 by Albert Grossman, manager of Bob Dylan, The Band, Janis Joplin and Todd Rundgren. Grossman served as the director until his death in 1986, after which time directorship was assumed by his wife, Sally Grossman. The studio did a great deal of demo work, and very little commercial advertising work, catering to its star- powered pedigree. The two-hour drive from New York City, a \\"retreat\\" for some artists, combined with residences owned by Albert Grossman, amplified this value. The Replacements had recording sessions at Bearsville for their Don't Tell a Soul album but the recordings were not used for the album. They were eventually released as part of the Dead Man's Pop box set in 2019. During the Bearsville recording session, the band trashed the recording studio and living quarters and played a game they called \\"Dodge knife\\" that was like dodgeball but using knives.

It is one of two 'Daerah Tingkat II' that have the name 'Kediri' (The other is the Regency of Kediri). Archaeological artefacts discovered in 2007 appeared to indicate that the region around Kediri may have been the location of the Kediri Kingdom, a Hindu kingdom in the 11th century.Kediri archeological discovery offers clues on ancient kingdom , The Jakarta Post, 24 March 2007. The city is a major trade centre for the Indonesian sugar and cigarette industry.Kediri, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Kediri is the second largest city by economy in East Java, after Surabaya, with a 2016 estimated GDP at Rp76.95 trillion. History Traditionally, the city of Kediri is said to have been founded on 27 July 879, and today the city's anniversary is celebrated on that date. The Brantas River valley was known as the site of classical Javanese culture, particularly between the 10th and 15th centuries. The town of Kediri was established by King Airlangga on the banks of the upper Brantas river in 1042. It was originally called Dahanapura or Daha. After the death of Airlangga his kingdom was divided into two parts: the kingdom of Panjalu in the west, and the kingdom of Janggala in the east. Daha became the capital of Panjalu, and later the capital of the Kediri kingdom. Over the centuries, control of the city passed to the Singhasari, Majapahit, Demak and Mataram kingdoms. The name \\"Kediri\\", or \\"Kadiri\\", is derived from the Sanskrit word Khadri, meaning Indian Mulberry, indicative of the mulberry trees (locally known as pac√© or mengkudu) which grew in the area. storming Kediri ‚Äì then the capital of Trunajaya ‚Äì in 1678 during the Trunajaya War. Depicted in an 1890 Dutch children's novel. After the era of the Javanese kingdoms, Kediri went into decline, becoming a small rural settlement, which was later annexed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as part of the Dutch conquest of Java. East Java in the 1740s was controlled by Cakraningrat IV, a Madurese regent who was favorably disposed toward the VOC, as he believed the Dutch would help him in securing the independence of Madura from the Kasunanan Kartasura kingdom. However, when his plans were rejected by the VOC, Cakraningrat rise against the Europeans. The rebellion was ultimately suppressed by the VOC, assisted by two generals sent by Pakubuwana II, Sunan Kartasura. Kediri then became part of the VOC and remained under Dutch control until the independence of Indonesia in 1945.History of Kediri by City Council Kediri began to flourish when the Dutch East Indies founded the autonomous Gemeente Kediri in 1906. Zelfstanding Gemeenteschap (self-government with full autonomy) was granted in 1928. During the Indonesian National Revolution in 1945‚Äì1949, Kediri became a target of General Sudirman's guerrilla campaign. In 1965, after the failed 30 September Movement coup, Kediri suffered terrible bloodshed in which thousands of people were killed. The Gudang Garam kretek tobacco industry was established in 1958 by Chinese Indonesian Tjoa Ing Hwie. He purchased vast lands in Kediri and established a kretek cigar factory. Today, Gudang Garam is the major employer of the city, with more than 40,000 workers.  Administrative divisions  City of Kediri is divided into three kecamatan ('districts'), each is headed by a camat. The districts are * Kecamatan Pesantren * Kecamatan Kota * Kecamatan Mojoroto  Society and culture  Being the site of an ancient capital of Javanese kingdoms, the city is one of the major cultural center for Javanese people, the city also contains some ancient ruins and candis that dates back to the era of Kediri and Majapahit kingdom.  Sport  Kediri is home of Persik Kediri which plays in Premier Division of Indonesian Football League. Persik Kediri has won total two title of Premier Division of Indonesian Football League, last occurring in 2006.  Education  Kediri city has Three National Universities, they are Universitas Brawijaya (branch III Kediri), STAIN Kediri, Politeknik Negeri Kediri.

Tourism  City of Kediri hardly has natural tourist destination. A few amusement parks are present, e.g. Paggora Amusement Park, Tirtayasa Water Park, Selomangleng Water Park. Selomangleng Cave is a man-made cave, allegedly used by the princess Dewi Kilisuci to meditate, according to folk tales.

Background  Arcturus's first work published on an actual record label, My Angel represents a halfway point between band leader Steinar Sverd Johnsen's original project Mortem, a death metal band, and Arcturus's later symphonic black metal and avant-garde metal albums. Although symphonic metal and black metal elements are evident throughout the EP, the overall style is gloomy, down-tempo death/doom metal with low, growled vocals by Mortem's vocalist Marius Vold. Although the songs are simplistic compared to Arcturus' later works, traces of what would become the band's signature style are evident. My Angel was released with three different cover colors: green, yellow and blue. It is unknown how much of each were printed, but 1100 copies of the EP were printed in total. Along with four other Norwegian bands this EP was later repackaged as the True Kings of Norway compilation in 2000 by Spikefarm Records  Style  Joel McIver, author of Extreme Metal II, described the album as \\"a dark work focusing less on traditional black metal fury than on the ambient bombastics of the synths.\\"  Track listing  # \\"My Angel\\" ‚Äì 5:57 # \\"Morax\\" ‚Äì 6:29  Personnel  ; Arcturus * Marius Vold ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar * Steinar Sverd Johnsen ‚Äì electric guitar, keyboards * Jan Axel Blomberg (credited as \\"Hellhammer\\") ‚Äì drums, percussion  References   External links  * Category:Arcturus (band) albums Category:1991 EPs ","title":"My Angel (EP)"},{"id":"7188601","text":"The Harvey O.

The Banks Pumping Plant initially flows into the Bethany Reservoir. It is from the Bethany Reservoir that the South Bay Aqueduct begins. The John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility is located 2 miles upstream from the facility and prevents fishes from reaching the pumping plant. Limits on water pumping from the Sacramento Delta is a politically contentious issue.http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and- drought/delta/article122434249.html In dry years, water pumped from the Delta creates a hazard to spring-run salmon. As the Banks Pumping Plant pulls water from the Sacramento River southward across the Delta, it disrupts the normal flow direction of east to west that salmon smolt follow to the Pacific Ocean. Populations of salmon and steelhead trout have reached critically low levels in the decades after SWP water withdrawals began. The fish migration issue has become hotly contested in recent years, with rising support for the construction of the Peripheral Canal, which would divert water around the Delta, restoring the natural flow direction.

Life Coon was born to a family of Kent landowners and had five brothers. She left home at 16 and moved to London to find a job. She lived in Notting Hill and began by doing some modelling work, including making a softcore porn film.Jan Moir \\"What Caroline Coon did next\\", in: The Guardian; 17 March 1983, Sixties, p. 6 Trained as a figurative painter, she became involved in the 1960s underground movement in London while still attending art school. In 1967, with Rufus Harris, she co-founded Release, an agency set up to provide legal advice and arrange legal representation for young people charged with the possession of drugs. She remains politically active, campaigning primarily for feminist causes, including the legalisation of prostitution and the legalisation of drugs.Caroline Coon. The Hyman Collection. Retrieved 23 November 2017. In the 1970s, she became involved in the London punk scene, writing about bands for Melody Maker and providing artwork for groups such as The Clash, whom she briefly managed, and The Police. Her interviews and reviews were noted for interrogating the attitudes of leading punk bands toward gender and sexuality. In the \\"Punky Business\\" episode of the BBC comedy series The Goodies, Jane Asher plays a parody of Coon (\\"Caroline Kook\\"), the dream lover of Tim Brooke- Taylor's aspiring punk rock star. Coon also inspired Robert Wyatt's lyrics for the Matching Mole song \\"O Caroline\\", The Stranglers' \\"London Lady\\" and, according to herself, Bob Dylan's \\"She Belongs to Me\\", though this claim is highly questionable. Coon's artwork is provocative and is particularly concerned with the human nude. In 1995 her painting, Mr Olympia, was not shown at Tate Liverpool because the male subject had a semi-erect penis.

Merrymeeting Bay (also formerly known as Maremiten) is a large freshwater tidal bay in Sagadahoc, Lincoln, and Cumberland counties, in the U.S. state of Maine. Merrymeeting Bay's unusual geography defies common landform terms. It is not what is usually meant by the word bay. It is somewhat like an estuary but it has fresh water with very little salt. Geologically it is described as an \\"inland delta\\" and biologically as \\"tidal riverine.\\" The head of Merrymeeting Bay is generally considered to begin at the southernmost point of Swan Island, adjacent to the town of Richmond. Additional bordering towns and cities include Bath, Brunswick, Topsham, Bowdoinham, Bowdoin, Dresden, Pittston, and Woolwich. Public access to the bay is gained mainly from public docks on one of the contributing rivers in Brunswick, Bath, Richmond, and Bowdoinham. Geology Six rivers flow into the bay, the two largest being the Kennebec River and the Androscoggin River. The four other rivers are the Cathance, Eastern, Abagadasset, and Muddy River\\\\Muddy. The bay receives water from nearly 40% of Maine's land area as well as from part of New Hampshire. The watershed is just under . Merrymeeting Bay is linked to the Gulf of Maine and the Atlantic Ocean by the Lower Kennebec River, a long saltwater tidal channel. The Lower Kennebec River and Merrymeeting Bay are known collectively as the Kennebec Estuary. Merrymeeting Bay's connection to the Lower Kennebec River is via a slot in the bedrock called The Chops, an area of converging water flows known to be hazardous to boaters. The waters of the bay flow out through The Chops at low tide, while high tide brings a mix of fresh water and seawater back up the Kennebec. The river flow volume from six rivers typically exceeds the volume of the incoming tide. Combined with the bottleneck of The Chops, the result is a tidal waterbody with very little salt, known as brackish. Located about from the ocean, Merrymeeting Bay has many river delta characteristics. The tides average about . The unusual combination of a large body of freshwater and strong tides results in an intertidal habitat that harbors a variety of rare plant species. Habitat Large numbers of migrating birds use Merrymeeting Bay as a stopping point along their flyway. For the east coast of the United States, the concentration of waterfowl at Merrymeeting Bay is second only to that at Chesapeake Bay. The bay is also home to a large population of bald eagles. The strong tidal currents and saltwater in the Lower Kennebec River prevent the river below The Chops or Thorne Head from freezing, making it an ideal wintering habitat for waterfowl. The freshwater in the bay and the Kennebec above The Chops freeze thoroughly. The bay and Kennebec above were once the source of winter ice for a thriving ice harvesting industry. In the early 20th century, Kennebec ice was shipped as far away as India, protected by being packed in sawdust to keep it from melting. Merrymeeting Bay also supports runs of migratory fish, including the endangered Atlantic salmon and shortnose sturgeon. Other species include Atlantic sturgeon, shad, alewives, American eel, and others. History The origin of the name is uncertain. Some suggest that it comes from an Abenaki language term, as this tribe established seasonal camps near the bay. But their name for the bay does not have this meaning. Abenaki names recorded for this bay were Chisapeak (\\"at the big part of the river\\")C .Allen 1931, p.281 and Quabacook, meaning \\"duck watering place\\". The 17th-century English name for this bay is a symbolic reference to periodic festive gatherings known in the colonial period as \\"merry meetings\\" (such as the traditional annual spring fairs in England known as May Fairs when people played games, held archery contests, danced around the maypole, and often got drunk). These \\"rabble-rousing festivities\\" were headed by a popular elected leader known as a \\"Robin Hood,\\" after the mythic leader. Puritans in New England, who were Calvinist Protestants, denounced these folk festivals as vulgar revelries with \\"light, lewde, and lascivious dancing.\\" The English dismissed the Abenaki on the Lower Kennebec as \\"wild men,\\" and gave them English nicknames, generally derogatory. Chief Rawandagon, the 17th-century sagamore (headman) of the lower Kennebec, including Merrymeeting Bay, was known as Robin Hood. As in the May Fairs, he was said to head a band of \\"merry men.\\" A village on Georgetown Island on the lower Kennebec was located at the entrance of what was known as Robinhood Cove, named after this chief. According to historian Frank Burroughs, the name may have been related to the annual springtime rendezvous of fur traders and trappers, at which time drink flowed freely as goods were paid for and exchanged. But he thinks the name was intended to attract a certain kind of English colonist and repel Puritans, as the bay was host to rum importation. Variant early colonial English names of Merrymeeting Bay include New Somerset Lake and Swan Pond.

When SPCC was created, the school replaced Anson Community College and Union Technical Education Center; through these predecessors the college can trace its roots back to 1962. * In 1962, the Ansonville unit of the Charlotte Industrial Education Center was founded in order to assure quality education was available to local Anson County, North Carolina residents.

Dr. Ben Carson, current Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Donald Trump and Emeritus Professor of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins Medicine, said of Bishop Boone's latest book Black Self-Genocide: What Black Lives Matter Won't Say, \\"\\"In his riveting book, Black Self Genocide, Bishop Wellington Boone provides great insight into the belief systems and behaviors that have kept black people in America in a dependent position. More importantly he provides sage advice for how to empower the black community in America and consequently to help strengthen the entire nation.‚Äù Bishop Boone is the founder and chief prelate of the Fellowship of International Churches and has been a successful church planter for more than 40 years. As an author and public speaker he is celebrated by major Christian leaders like Bill McCartney, co-founder of Promise Keepers, which filled football stadiums and held some of the largest gatherings of Christian men in history. Bishop Boone personally spoke at 50 Promise Keepers events under Coach McCartney, who said of Bishop Boone, \\"This is an incredible man of God. Every time I'm in the presence of this guy, I sense two things: This is a man who is truly a man of tremendous faith, and he's a man who is truly fearless.\\" Bishop Boone has been married to his high school sweetheart Katheryn for 44 years. History Bishop Boone was born in 1948 and came of age during the Vietnam War, where he served in the United States Army in- country in 1968. He was ordained into ministry in 1973 and began his ministry with Word of Faith seminars and churches he founded in Ettrick and Richmond, Virginia, combining articulate biblical content with a disciplined Christian lifestyle in the holiness tradition. His approach had a strong appeal to athletes and students at historically black colleges and universities and other college campuses so he founded New Generation Campus Ministries beginning at the nearby Virginia State University and Virginia Commonwealth University. In 1983 he incorporated the Living Word Evangelistic Association, and later changed the name to Wellington Boone Ministries. His first church was Manna Christian Fellowship of Ettrick, Virginia, and the second church was Manna Christian Fellowship of Richmond, Virginia which was incorporated in 1985. After transitioning from Richmond, Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1995, he founded The Father's House Church in Atlanta, Georgia, and served as senior pastor until March 2015 when he commissioned Bishop Garland Hunt to replace him as senior pastor, along with his wife Pastor Eileen Hunt. In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention celebrated its 150th anniversary by issuing a \\"Resolution On Racial Reconciliation\\" that stated, \\"Our relationship to African-Americans has been hindered from the beginning by the role that slavery played in the formation of the Southern Baptist Convention.\\" To further demonstrate their commitment to racial reconciliation the Southern Baptist publishing arm of Broadman and Holman published the first book by Wellington Boone called Breaking Through: Taking the Kingdom Into the Culture by Out-Serving Others. Bill Bright, late founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, stated, \\"America's need today is for revival that comes from fasting, prayer and seeking God's face. Wellington Boone is modeling and preaching this mandatory message.\\" The next two books by Wellington Boone were published by Doubleday: Your Wife Is Not Your Momma (1999) and The Low Road to New Heights (2002). Also in 2002 he published the first edition of his Christian self- accountability journal My Journey with God that has since been revised and expanded in other editions such as Your Journey with God and A Man's Journey with God. In 2009 he published Dare to Hope where he challenged readers to learn how to say, \\"I will never go another day in my life without hope!\\" This was followed by Holy Ghost Is My Friend in 2011. When Bishop Boone wrote Your Wife Is Not Your Momma to show men how to change their ways to \\"really love your wife,\\" they encouraged him to write a book for women and that became Women Are Kingmakers! and launched a national women's movement. One reviewer wrote on Amazon, \\"I enjoyed the book on my own, and as part of a Bible study. The layers of wisdom within these pages kept unfolding when I discussed it with others. This book will inspire and energize you to serve because you will understand, not only the eternal purpose behind serving as a kingmaker, but the effectiveness of doing so. This book is more than just information; it is indeed revelation. If every woman was a kingmaker, what a wonderful world this would be.\\" In October 2016, after 30 years of preparation, Bishop Boone was a TV guest of Fox & Friends when he debuted his book Black Self-Genocide: What Black Lives Matter Won't Say. The message and his explanation of the content immediately prompted intense debate on social media. Another TV interview with the author was called \\"Reversing the Curse of Black Self-Genocide\\" and shown on CBN News. The book quickly rose to the leading best-seller on Amazon in four different categories of book sales as people of all races made a commitment to be problem-solvers for the Black community and take revival to the inner-cities. The momentum is still building in a movement for Black Americans to become international ambassadors for their country. Although Bishop Boone is a Black American, people of all races applaud him because he is culturally conscious but not culturally controlled. More than 20 years ago, during a Promise Keepers meeting in Indianapolis that is available on YouTube, he declared before 70,000 mostly White men, \\"We are one!\\" Wave after wave of applause and celebration followed his call to unity. His messages on racial unity in America elicit the same response from people of all races today. He has been a host and guest on the Christian television networks CBN and TBN, and has been a platform speaker for Promise Keepers, Focus on the Family, American Association of Christian Counselors and the Family Research Council. He has also been a member of the board of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability and the Board of Trustees at Regent University. He founded the Network of Politically Active Christians (NPAC) with headquarters in Washington, DC; Kingmakers, a national ministry of Christian women in leadership where Pastor Eileen Hunt is president; The Fellowship of International Churches, Goshen International, which established Learning Centers in South Africa for Black African and Colored children, and Global Outreach Campus Ministries. Bishop Boone is the Founder and Chief Prelate of the Fellowship of International Churches founded in 1994 when the founding pastors conferred on Pastor Boone the title of Bishop Boone. Views Bishop Boone has said that Black Americans are suffering from \\"self-genocide\\" because many more Blacks are killed by other Blacks than by policemen, especially through abortion and inner-city murders. He has also stated that \\"I want to boldly affirm Uncle Tom. The black community must stop criticizing Uncle Tom. He is a role model.\\" One of the first magazines to publish this revolutionary message was Ministries Today, where Bishop Boone challenged Blacks to read the book Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe where the character of Uncle Tom gave his life to save other slaves. He was a real Christian following the example of Jesus Christ. Bishop Boone said of African-American slavery in the United States, \\"I believe that slavery, and the understanding of it when you see it God's way, was redemptive.\\" As a pastor, he has emphasized that bitterness and resentment are not solutions. He has encouraged states to apologize for slavery and presents honest historical facts about America's faults, but he also urges those who have been wronged to forgive others even if they do not apologize, or to accept the apologies instead of saying \\"too little too late.\\" Bishop Boone has been describe succinctly by his critics - of all races - as a \\"preternatural Sambo for white folks, uncanny in his self- hatred for blacks, and a debased booty scratcher for white supremacists.\\" He has been critical of comparisons between the Gay Rights Movement and the Civil Rights Movement. He called it the \\"Rape of the Civil Rights Movement\\". As a biblicist, he understands the difference between race and gender. They are not the same, according to creative order based on the Bible.

Portrayed by Santiago Cabrera, he has the ability to paint the future. Character overview Genesis Isaac M√©ndez's story begins in the first episode, where he is a struggling, tortured artist living in New York City. His girlfriend and art dealer is Simone Deveaux. Mendez is addicted to heroin, and has had little success quitting permanently, putting a strain on his relationship with Simone. This strain is worsened when Isaac realizes he can see ambiguous future events and paint them‚Äîbut only when high on heroin. Isaac at first assumes the paintings to be \\"evil\\" and tries to destroy them, but Simone sees them as artistically impressive. Near the end of the pilot, Isaac overdoses. Simone brings help in the form of nurse Peter Petrelli, who realizes that Isaac has painted a picture of him without having previously met him. With Peter's help, Isaac survives the overdose. After he recovers, Isaac seems to have accepted his \\"destiny\\" to save New York from a large, nuclear- level, mushroom cloud explosion he saw in one of his precognitive trances and painted on his loft floor during his overdose. Isaac has also come to believe he needs the heroin to \\"paint the future\\". Simone doubts Isaac's powers and refuses to stand idly by while he ruins his life using heroin, so she leaves him. During their conversation, Simone also mentions that Isaac's comic book, 9th Wonders!, may be late as he continues with his precognitive painting. In the fourth episode, Simone comes to Isaac requesting new paintings for a showing at her art gallery. Isaac offers earlier works instead, saying that he needs the newer ones to tell the future. Simone doubts she can even sell the older ones and is still unconvinced of Isaac's powers. Isaac proclaims he knew about her kiss with Peter the previous evening. Simone assumes that Isaac had followed her, but he shows her his drawing, saying he made it seven weeks prior. Isaac then said he needs money for \\"painting supplies,\\" by which he means heroin, which he hopes will help him find a way to stop the nuclear explosion. After shooting up, he experiences a vision of Claire Bennet at her school around Homecoming time, being chased and cornered by a shadowy figure. In the fifth episode, Peter visits Isaac to find images of \\"the cheerleader\\" that a future version of Hiro Nakamura told him to save. Peter finds the unfinished painting he is looking for, though Isaac explains he cannot finish it, as he is out of both heroin and money to buy more. Peter still believes they should keep trying and, through his ability to mimic other people's powers, manages to finish the painting himself. The phone rings after he finishes. Isaac explains that it's just some Japanese man that he can't understand, and Peter realizes that it's Hiro. In \\"Better Halves\\", Isaac and Peter realize they don't know who the cheerleader was or where she lives. They notice that one of Isaac's canvases of the future is missing. Isaac realizes that Simone has taken it to sell with his other paintings. He doesn't remember what he painted since he was high at the time. After Peter leaves to try to track down the painting another way, Eden McCain visits Isaac's apartment, claiming to be a fan. In the following episode, Isaac and Eden are in a paper plant in Odessa, Texas where Mr. Bennet works. Bennet tells Isaac that he helps people with special powers to better use them, and suggests that he teach Isaac to use his powers without heroin. Bennet explains that he desperately needs Isaac to create another painting of the cheerleader's attack, as he believes it will let him protect his daughter Claire. Isaac tries again to paint without the drugs, but after that proves unsuccessful, Mr. Bennet has Eden persuade Isaac to take heroin and paint an image. In \\"Homecoming\\", Isaac paints a picture of a man glowing brightly, which Isaac later describes as \\"a man exploding\\", rather than anything related to Claire. Then, in \\"Fallout\\", he begins painting again, though he doesn't believe the paintings to be anything more than art since he hadn't taken any drugs since painting the previous image. After Eden tells him that Claire has been saved, he realizes that the future can be changed. He calls Hiro and arranges a meeting. After meeting Hiro, seeing the future issue of 9th Wonders!, and realizing that his most recent drawings were in fact of events from the then- future, he decided to again paint without heroin. Relaxed and advised by Hiro to concentrate, he successfully activated his powers, painting a picture of Hiro, brandishing a katana, encountering a dinosaur. Hiro mentions that he found Isaac killed by Sylar in the future. Two weeks later in \\"Godsend\\", Isaac is doing well and has returned to New York. At his loft, Isaac is visited by Simone and Nathan Petrelli, as Nathan wants to check out the \\"future paintings\\". Simone hadn't realized Isaac is home. Now clean and able to paint without heroin, Isaac professes his continued love for Simone. She's speechless. Suddenly, Hiro returns, disappointed that he was not able to find the real Kensei sword. Hiro then excitedly greets Nathan (\\"flying man\\"), who he had met once previously. After introductions and catching up, Hiro states that Linderman has the sword he wants. Simone remembers that Linderman is an avid art collector, as she has sold him several of Isaac's paintings. To this end, Simone recommends Hiro travel to Las Vegas with one of Isaac's paintings and meet Linderman. During the events of \\"Distractions\\", Isaac is revealed to be actively seeking Peter Petrelli via his power because he has seen that Peter explodes. Isaac is later revealed to be working with Mr. Bennet when he calls him to notify him of Peter's whereabouts. Later, during the episode \\"Unexpected\\", Mr. Bennet visits Isaac at his apartment, where Isaac tells him about the search for Peter and how he has discovered that Peter has been invisible. Mr. Bennet then tells him about how this means that Peter has met an old friend of Mr. Bennet's, referring to Claude. He then gives Isaac a gun and tells him he expects him to be a hero. Later, after Peter escapes Bennet and the Haitian, and Claude abandons him, he appears in Isaac's apartment blaming Isaac for \\"turning him in\\". He attacks Isaac with his telekinesis, then turns invisible when Isaac pulls out the gun. As he dodges around Isaac's apartment, taunting him, Isaac tries to listen to where he is and shoot him. He finally hears a distinctive sound, but when he fires it is revealed he has shot Simone, who collapses into Peter's arms. Isaac blames Peter for Simone's death and tries to shoot him, but Peter escapes. Isaac places Simone's body on his bed. Later, the police, having been sent by Nathan Petrelli, come to his home, saying that Simone was reported missing and neighbors heard a disturbance and gunshots. Then Mr. Bennet and Candice, disguised as Simone and hiding Simone's body, come in and the police excuse themselves. Bennet says they have created an alibi in which Simone will be in Europe for months. Isaac is clearly distraught and begs Bennet to take him with him. After they refuse and leave, Isaac decides to go back to using heroin.

In the episode \\".07%\\", Isaac gives a messenger that works for the publishing company, the next issue of 9th Wonders. As a gift, he also hands over his sketch book. As the man leaves, Isaac looks at the pictures of himself with his head sliced open. Later, Sylar locates and confronts Isaac, who has just finished painting another picture of his death. When Sylar comments that most people start screaming at that point, Isaac calmly states that he has accepted his fate. He also reveals that he has also painted a vision of Sylar's death. When Isaac refuses to give Sylar the drawings, Sylar flings him to the ground and impales Isaac's wrists and ankles with paint brushes. Isaac states that he sent the painting away and that all his life he has destroyed everything he has loved. He goes on to say that he can now die content and, through this final act, can \\"finally get to be a hero.\\" Sylar stands over Isaac, the camera pans away, and Isaac screams as Sylar slices into his skull. Later Isaac's body is seen, dead on the floor, the top of his skull missing as Sylar uses his ability to paint the future, albeit in a twisted, more nightmarish style. Generations In \\"Lizards\\", Noah Bennet reveals that Isaac Mendez has painted eight as-yet- unfulfilled prophetic paintings and had sent them out to unknown locations prior to his death. Noah Bennet is the first to receive one of the eight paintings which depicted Kaito Nakamura lying dead on the ground after falling off a building. In \\"Kindred\\", Mohinder Suresh discovers another painting in Isaac Mendez's loft which has yet to be sent out. This painting depicts Noah Bennet lying dead on the ground from a gunshot wound to the head, while Claire stands nearby with an unknown shadowed character. In \\"The Line\\", the other six paintings in the series of eight are discovered by Noah Bennet and The Haitian. The remaining six depict a bleeding Claire Bennet lying on a staircase; a man holding a vial of clear liquid; Niki Sanders pounding on a door; Peter Petrelli and an unknown man standing together looking out of a window, with a biohazard symbol visible; Hiro Nakamura and Kensei sword fighting; and Mohinder Suresh with a broken nose after firing a pistol, possibly one issued by The Company. Villains When Hiro Nakamura loses his memory thanks to the interventions of Arthur Petrelli in season 3, he and Ando travel to Kansas to find the latest issue of 9th Wonders. The owners of the store uncover hidden in the first issue an image of Hiro with Claire sixteen years in the past. At the comic store, Ando laments that there are no more issues left to help guide them, but the comic book owner tells them he heard a legend about the last 9th Wonders story. He tells Ando, Matt, and Daphne that he heard that Isaac bequeathed his sketchbook to a publisher's messenger- and that sketch book contains the last 9th Wonders story. This is the same sketchbook and messenger he left his book to in the episode \\".07%\\" from season 1.The Eclipse Pt 2 Before losing his memory, Hiro compares Usutu to Isaac, calling him \\"Mr African Isaac\\" before they meet. Redemption In \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\", Noah is getting a call and gets to hear that Isaac has made new paintings. When Noah is talking to him he gets to hear that the little girl that he has painted is Noah's daughter. Then Noah explains to him that he is not the only person with special abilities and that there is also someone who is assassinating them one by one. Isaac asks why Noah doesn't stop him if he knows who it is. Noah replies by saying that nobody knows how he looks, and that Isaac can help him with that. Webisode: Dark Matters, Part 5 One of the Primatech files that Quentin Frady sees on the Renautas root directory is titled \\"Mendez Paintings\\". Heroes Reborn In \\"Game Over\\", Emily and Tommy find a 9th Wonders! comic book and Tommy claims that there is a legend that the author of these comic books was an evo and that the events in them actually came true. Powers and abilities Isaac has the power of precognition, which allows him to depict images of the future, usually while in a trance-like state. While in this state, his pupils and irises fade into light white color and he becomes unresponsively focused on painting the images in his mind. Very little context comes to Isaac when he sees the future. He can't tell anything about the people, places, or events involved beyond what he specifically sees at that moment. Thus, he is often surprised to find out weeks later what his work is actually depicting. Also due to the previous heroin use, Isaac was not able to clearly remember certain images after he painted them, as he stated in \\"Better Halves\\". It would seem that his precognitive abilities also augment his natural abilities as a painter, as Simone once complimented how much she appreciates the works he creates when he is high, and from the way Peter completed the unfinished portrait in \\"Hiros\\" when he first actively duplicated Isaac's power despite the latter having no innate talents whatsoever as a painter. It showed that Peter was painting an image he could partially see, so it could be suggested that Isaac's power allows one to trace an image from the future, rather than paint it from scratch Originally, Isaac's powers were triggered by the use of heroin, and he was unable to use his powers without it. During the episode \\"Hiros\\", Peter Petrelli mimics Isaac's precognitive ability without the use of heroin to finish a picture when Isaac was out of drugs. A TV Guide article from early October, 2006, revealed that he would eventually try to find out if his power works without using heroin. In \\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\\", Isaac attempted just this, but was unsuccessful. He does so successfully in \\"Fallout\\", after relaxing and taking advice from Hiro Nakamura to concentrate. Neither Peter, nor Sylar, after acquiring Isaac's abilities, needed heroin to paint the future. In \\"Distractions\\", it is revealed that it's possible for Isaac to paint specific people and places if he honed his powers. This honing skill is used to find Peter but Isaac thought it did not work when he drew what seemed to be random scenery when actually Peter was invisible at that location. As evidenced in the episode Isaac reveals that he can interpret his drawings far better than while on heroin. Artwork Genesis\\", which forms the primary story arc of the first season. Each piece is made for the show by comic book artist Tim Sale, who uses an ink wash paint style on paper media. Isaac is only shown painting the beginning outline or adding final coloring to the paintings. The events depicted in each painting are often straightforward and recognizable, but others can be more subjective and open to interpretation. It is common to see a painting with seemingly no significance to the story, only to see it come to fruition in a later episode. For example, a painting of a hand holding a glass of boiling water appeared in pilot episode, \\"Genesis\\". This comes to pass seven episodes later during Ted Sprague's interrogation. It was originally supposed to have happened in the 2 hour pilot episode, where a terrorist had the same powers, when he was cut, Ted Sprague was thought up. Legal issues On March 19, 2007, Clifton Mallery and Amnau Karam Eele filed suit against NBC and Tim Kring claiming that the idea for Isaac Mendez, who can paint the future was stolen from a short story, painting and short film that they had produced. The suit was dismissed. On December 11, 2007, the New York Law Journal reported on Mallery v. NBC Universal, quoting from Southern District Judge Denise Cote's opinion that \\"the line between mere 'ideas' and protected 'expression' is 'famously difficult to fix precisely'\\", and stating that Heroes was not close to infringing.Smack Talk: Heroes Accused of Thievery References Category:Heroes (American TV series) characters Category:Fictional artists Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional characters with precognition Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Male characters in television pl:Postacie z serialu Herosi#Isaac Mendez fi:Luettelo televisiosarjan Heroes hahmoista#Isaac Mendez ","title":"Isaac Mendez"},{"id":"7188733","title":"Chris Lewis (footballer)"},{"id":"7188745","text":"Flintstones Chewable Vitamins are supplemental multivitamins for children based on the animated sitcom The Flintstones.

Vitamin D is necessary for the maintenance and growth of bones in children. Vitamin D deficiency is a concern for infants, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because infants often have very limited exposure to sunlight, which is the main source of endogenous Vitamin D production. Vitamin D deficiency can result in rickets, a disease in which bones become soft and pliable. Vitamin E is a potent anti-oxidant in the body. Vitamin E deficiencies leads to neuromuscular, vascular and reproductive abnormalities.Mahan, K.L. & Escott-Stump, S. (Ed.). (2008). Krause's Nutrition Therapy. Missouri: Saunders Elsevier The chewable form of Flintstones Complete contains higher amounts of vitamins and minerals than the gummy version. The chewable form, unlike the gummy version, contains: Vitamins B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), Niacin, Calcium, Iron, Copper and Selenium. Flintstones with Iron Flintstones with Iron has a similar vitamin profile as Flintstones Complete gummy version. The iron content meets 75% of the Daily Value of iron for children over 2 years of age. Flintstones Plus Immunity Support Flintstones Plus Immunity Support has a similar vitamin profile as Flintstones Complete gummy version. However, Flintstones Plus Immunity Support provides 250 mg of Vitamin C, which far exceeds the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for children.

It uses the energy that is stored in the electrochemical gradient of sodium (Na+) by allowing Na+ to flow down its gradient across the plasma membrane in exchange for the countertransport of calcium ions (Ca2+). A single calcium ion is exported for the import of three sodium ions. The exchanger exists in many different cell types and animal species. The NCX is considered one of the most important cellular mechanisms for removing Ca2+. The exchanger is usually found in the plasma membranes and the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of excitable cells.  Function  The sodium‚Äìcalcium exchanger is only one of the systems by which the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions in the cell is kept low. The exchanger does not bind very tightly to Ca2+ (has a low affinity), but it can transport the ions rapidly (has a high capacity), transporting up to five thousand Ca2+ ions per second. Therefore, it requires large concentrations of Ca2+ to be effective, but is useful for ridding the cell of large amounts of Ca2+ in a short time, as is needed in a neuron after an action potential. Thus, the exchanger also likely plays an important role in regaining the cell's normal calcium concentrations after an excitotoxic insult. Such a primary transporter of calcium ions is present in the plasma membrane of most animal cells. Another, more ubiquitous transmembrane pump that exports calcium from the cell is the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), which has a much higher affinity but a much lower capacity. Since the PMCA is capable of effectively binding to Ca2+ even when its concentrations are quite low, it is better suited to the task of maintaining the very low concentrations of calcium that are normally within a cell. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger complements the high affinity, low capacitance Ca2+-ATPase and together, they are involved in a variety of cellular functions including: *control of neurosecretion *activity of photoreceptor cells *cardiac muscle relaxation *maintenance of Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac cells *maintenance of Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum of both excitable and nonexcitable cells *excitation-contraction coupling *maintenance of low Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondria The exchanger is also implicated in the cardiac electrical conduction abnormality known as delayed afterdepolarization.Lilly, L: \\"Pathophysiology of Heart Disease\\", chapter 11: \\"Mechanisms of Cardiac Arrhythmias\\", Lippencott, Williams and Wilkens, 2007 It is thought that intracellular accumulation of Ca2+ causes the activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The result is a brief influx of a net positive charge (remember 3 Na+ in, 1 Ca2+ out), thereby causing cellular depolarization. This abnormal cellular depolarization can lead to a cardiac arrhythmia. Reversibility Since the transport is electrogenic (alters the membrane potential), depolarization of the membrane can reverse the exchanger's direction if the cell is depolarized enough, as may occur in excitotoxicity. In addition, as with other transport proteins, the amount and direction of transport depends on transmembrane substrate gradients. This fact can be protective because increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that occur in excitotoxicity may activate the exchanger in the forward direction even in the presence of a lowered extracellular Na+ concentration. However, it also means that, when intracellular levels of Na+ rise beyond a critical point, the NCX begins importing Ca2+. The NCX may operate in both forward and reverse directions simultaneously in different areas of the cell, depending on the combined effects of Na+ and Ca2+ gradients. This effect may prolong calcium transients following bursts of neuronal activity, thus influencing neuronal information processing. Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the cardiac action potential The ability for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger to reverse direction of flow manifests itself during the cardiac action potential. Due to the delicate role that Ca2+ plays in the contraction of heart muscles, the cellular concentration of Ca2+ is carefully controlled. During the resting potential, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger takes advantage of the large extracellular Na+ concentration gradient to help pump Ca2+ out of the cell. In fact, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is in the Ca2+ efflux position most of the time. However, during the upstroke of the cardiac action potential there is a large influx of Na+ ions. This depolarizes the cell and shifts the membrane potential in the positive direction. What results is a large increase in intracellular [Na+]. This causes the reversal of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger to pump Na+ ions out of the cell and Ca2+ ions into the cell. However, this reversal of the exchanger lasts only momentarily due to the internal rise in [Ca2+] as a result of the influx of Ca2+ through the L-type calcium channel, and the exchanger returns to its forward direction of flow, pumping Ca2+ out of the cell. While the exchanger normally works in the Ca2+ efflux position (with the exception of early in the action potential), certain conditions can abnormally switch the exchanger to the reverse (Ca2+ influx, Na+ efflux) position. Listed below are several cellular and pharmaceutical conditions in which this happens. *The internal [Na+] is higher than usual (like it is when digitalis glycoside medications block the Na+/K+ -ATPase pump.) *The sarcoplasmic reticulum release of Ca2+ is inhibited. *Other Ca2+ influx channels are inhibited. *If the action potential duration is prolonged. Structure Based on secondary structure and hydrophobicity predictions, NCX was initially predicted to have 9 transmembrane helices. The family is believed to have arisen from a gene duplication event, due to apparent pseudo-symmetry within the primary sequence of the transmembrane domain. Inserted between the pseudo-symmetric halves is a cytoplasmic loop containing regulatory domains. These regulatory domains have C2 domain like structures and are responsible for calcium regulation. Recently, the structure of an archaeal NCX ortholog has been solved by X-ray crystallography. This clearly illustrates a dimeric transporter of 10 transmembrane helices, with a diamond shaped site for substrate binding. Based on the structure and structural symmetry, a model for alternating access with ion competition at the active site was proposed. The structures of three related proton-calcium exhangers (CAX) have been solved from yeast and bacteria. While structurally and functionally homologus, these structures illustrate novel oligomeric structures, substrate coupling, and regulation. History In 1968, H Reuter and N Seitz published findings that, when Na+ is removed from the medium surrounding a cell, the efflux of Ca2+ is inhibited, and they proposed that there might be a mechanism for exchanging the two ions. In 1969, a group led by PF Baker that was experimenting using squid axons published a finding that proposed that there exists a means of Na+ exit from cells other than the sodium-potassium pump. Digitalis, more commonly known as foxglove, is known to have a large effect on the Na/K ATPase, ultimately causing a more forceful contraction of the heart. The plant contains compounds that inhibit the sodium potassium pump which lowers the sodium electrochemical gradient. This makes the pumping of calcium out of the cell less efficient, which leads to a more forceful contraction of the heart. For individuals with weak hearts, it is sometimes provided to pump the heart with heavier contractile force. However, it can also cause hypertension because it increases the contractile force of the heart.

He began performing in clubs in Nice after being encouraged by Blaise Cendrars who was a friend of his mother. His career was boosted in 1957 when he worked with Miles Davis on the soundtrack Ascenseur pour l'√âchafaud. In 1959, Wilen wrote his two soundtracks Un T√©moin Dans la Ville and Jazz sur sc√®ne with Kenny Clarke. He wrote a soundtrack for Roger Vadim's film Les Liaisons Dangereuses two years later, working with Thelonious Monk. Wilen returned to composing for French films in the 1980s and 1990s. In the mid-to-late 1960s he became interested in rock, and recorded an album dedicated to Timothy Leary. Wilen toured in Japan for the first time in 1990.Harrell, Bryan (27 March 1990) \\"Tenor Sax Great Makes Japan Debut\\". The Japan Times. p. 16.

They were founded in 1987 by Mother Angelica, who also founded the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) and the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville, Alabama. The primary residence of the Friars is in Irondale, Alabama, and is next door to EWTN. They also have residences in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where their seminarians attend the seminary at Mount Saint Mary's University, and in Hanceville, near the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament. The Friars' apostolate is to communicate the Catholic faith by word and example. It involves using the media: television, radio and the Internet, as well as publishing and conducting retreats. Currently, they focus their attention on the television and radio ministry, in addition to providing for the spiritual needs of the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration, the EWTN employees, and the visitors who come to EWTN and the Shrine. Many of the Friars take classes during the school year, either at Mount Saint Mary's University or in their own House of Studies adjacent to the Friary in Birmingham. In contrast to Franciscan communities that focus on the corporal works of mercy, the Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word devote themselves to the spiritual works of mercy. Therefore, they study to gain a deep knowledge of the Catholic faith and practice communicating it effectively. Adapting to the needs of the time, they have developed into an active religious institute, but still maintain elements of the contemplative life. In addition to praying the Liturgy of the Hours, the Friars devote an hour each day to Eucharistic Adoration and pray the daily Rosary. The community is composed of priests and seminarians, as well as consecrated brothers.

It was notable for being the first mass-produced aircraft in Germany following the end of the Second World War. The Do 27's precursor, the Do 25, was developed by Dornier at the firm's facilities in Spain in order to satisfy a Spanish military requirement that called for a light utility aircraft with short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance. However, the Do 25 was not selected for production by Spain. Despite this, the aircraft was developed further to produce the Do 27, which was produced in quantity in both Spain and Germany. In addition to domestic sales, a large number of export customers, such as Portugal, emerged for the Do 27, and it had a lengthy service life with some examples still being used into the twenty-first century. The aircraft was appreciated for its relatively wide, comfortable cabin and excellent short-field performance. In terms of its configuration, the Do 27 was a classic high-wing, \\"tail-dragger\\" aircraft with fixed landing gear. History Background Shortly following the end of the Second World War, Germany's extensive aerospace industry was dismantled and largely dissolved due to the country having been forbidden to either possess or manufacture military aircraft.Fredriksen 2001, p. 301. Despite this, in both East Germany and West Germany, as the nation had been divided into during the Cold War era, efforts to revive the nation's aerospace industry became widespread during the 1950s.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 357-358. German aircraft manufacturer Dornier GmbH managed to retain its independence in the conflict's aftermath, and was keen to resume its aviation activities as soon as permissible.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 110. During January 1951, the company chose to establish a new technical office in Madrid, Spain, and began bidding for contracts from Spain's Ministry of Aviation; prior to this, Dornier had developed strong ties to Spain via the licensed production of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 342-343. During 1951, a development contract was secured for a commuter aircraft that possessed short takeoff and landing (STOL) characteristics.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 342. Dornier opted to develop a new aircraft, designing a monoplane with a high-mounted wing fitted with oversized flaps, a wide wraparound windscreen, a fixed undercarriage and a relatively spacious cabin. This new aircraft was powered by a single ENMA Tigre G.V; capable of generating a maximum of , this engine proved to be too weak to achieve satisfactory performance. The first prototype of the Do 25 performed its maiden flight during July 1954. Due to the Tigre's performance deficit, it was decided to equip the second prototype with an alternative powerplant; it used the American-sourced Continental O-470 engine instead. The second prototype would subsequently function as a demonstrator for an improved derivative of the aircraft, designated Do 27. Redesign and production Dornier Do 27 flying overhead Ultimately, the Do 25 was not selected for production. Despite this setback, Dornier decided to continue refining its design to develop the Do 27, which was sized to seat between four and six personnel. On 27 June 1955, the original prototype performed its maiden flight in Spain.Jackson 1976, p. 10. A total of 40 Do 27s were manufactured in Spain by Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA, designated CASA-127. However, the majority of production aircraft were constructed at Dornier's main base in Germany; the first German-built aircraft conducted its first flight on 17 October 1956. A total of 428 Do 27s would be produced in Germany. A significant portion of the Do 27's production run were acquired by the German military. By the mid-1950s, West Germany had been permitted, and even encouraged, to reequip itself as tensions rose between East and West in what is commonly referred to as the Cold War; due to its ability to operate from compact and unprepared airstrips, the Do 27 quickly garnered favour with military planners. Both the German Air Force and the German Army placed a combined order for 428 aircraft of the Do 27A and Do 27B variants, the latter being equipped with dual controls for use as a trainer aircraft.Donald 1997, p. 341. The Do 27 was widely employed as a general purpose aircraft, frequently being used for utility transport and liaison duties. Late on in the type's production run, a modified model of the aircraft, known as the Do 27Q-5, was developed; it had the same basic specifications but was equipped with a wider-track landing gear. Furthermore, the aircraft was offered as a twin-float seaplane, the Do 27S-1; another model proposed was furnished with the larger Lycoming GSO-480-B1B6 engine, capable of generating a maximum of 254 kW/340 hp, which was matched with a three-blade propeller, the Do 27H-2. In addition to the aircraft's adoption by military operators in Germany and Spain, Portugal received 40 new-build and 106 ex- German Do 27s. From 1961 to 1975, the Portuguese Air Force made extensively operational use of the type in the three African theatres of the Portuguese Overseas War. During April 1973, two Do 27s were shot down in Portuguese Guinea by insurgents equipped with SAM-7 Grail Man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS).Canongia Lopes, Mario. High Winged Workhorses: Broussards and Dorniers in Portuguese Service. Air Enthusiast, #75, May‚ÄìJune 1998. p. 44. During 1966, it was decided to terminate production of the Do 27. By this point, the aircraft had been widely exported to numerous international operators, including Israel, Nigeria, Belgium, Turkey, and Congo. The type was extensively used by the German military into the 1980s, gradually being succeeded in its role by increasingly capable helicopters; many ex-German aircraft were subsequently exported and used by other operators.

This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their DNA during mitosis in a random manner, adult stem cells divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining the same set of template DNA strands, adult stem cells would pass mutations arising from errors in DNA replication on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally differentiate (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell). Passing on these replication errors would allow adult stem cells to reduce their rate of accumulation of mutations that could lead to serious genetic disorders such as cancer. Although evidence for this mechanism exists, whether it is a mechanism acting in adult stem cells in vivo is still controversial. Methods Two main assays are used to detect immortal DNA strand segregation: label-retention and label-release pulse/chase assays. In the label-retention assay, the goal is to mark 'immortal' or parental DNA strands with a DNA label such as tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). These types of DNA labels will incorporate into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells during S phase. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they have not yet delineated an immortal DNA strand. During these conditions, the adult stem cells are either dividing symmetrically (thus with each division a new 'immortal' strand is determined and in at least one of the stem cells the immortal DNA strand will be marked with DNA label), or the adult stem cells have not yet been determined (thus their precursors are dividing symmetrically, and once they differentiate into adult stem cells and choose an 'immortal' strand, the 'immortal strand' will already have been marked). Experimentally, adult stem cells are undergoing symmetric divisions during growth and after wound healing, and are not yet determined at neonatal stages. Once the immortal DNA strand is labelled and the adult stem cell has begun or resumed asymmetric divisions, the DNA label is chased out. In symmetric divisions (most mitotic cells), DNA is segregating randomly and the DNA label will be diluted out to levels below detection after five divisions. If, however, cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, then all the labeled DNA will continue to co-segregate with the adult stem cell, and after five (or more) divisions will still be detected within the adult stem cell. These cells are sometimes called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the label-release assay, the goal is to mark the newly synthesized DNA that is normally passed on to the daughter (non-stem) cell. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they are dividing asymmetrically. Under conditions of homeostasis, adult stem cells should be dividing asymmetrically so that the same number of adult stem cells is maintained in the tissue compartment. After pulsing for long enough to label all the newly replicated DNA, the DNA label is chased out (each DNA replication now incorporates unlabeled nucleotides) and the adult stem cells are assayed for loss of the DNA label after two cell divisions. If cells are using a random segregation mechanism, then enough DNA label should remain in the cell to be detected. If, however, the adult stem cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, they are obligated to retain the unlabeled 'immortal' DNA, and will release all the newly synthesized labeled DNA to their differentiating daughter cells in two divisions. Some scientists have combined the two approaches, by first using one DNA label to label the immortal strands, allowing to adult stem cells to begin dividing asymmetrically, and then using a different DNA label to label the newly synthesized DNA. Thus, the adult stem cells will retain one DNA label and release the other within two divisions. Evidence Evidence for the immortal DNA strand hypothesis has been found in various systems. One of the earliest studies by Karl Lark et al. demonstrated co-segregation of DNA in the cells of plant root tips. Plant root tips labeled with tritiated thymidine tended to segregate their labeled DNA to the same daughter cell. Though not all the labeled DNA segregated to the same daughter, the amount of thymidine-labeled DNA seen in the daughter with less label corresponded to the amount that would have arisen from sister-chromatid exchange. Later studies by Christopher Potten et al. (2002), using pulse/chase experiments with tritiated thymidine, found long-term label-retaining cells in the small intestinal crypts of neonatal mice. These researchers hypothesized that long-term incorporation of tritiated thymidine occurred because neonatal mice have undeveloped small intestines, and that pulsing tritiated thymidine soon after the birth of the mice allowed the 'immortal' DNA of adult stem cells to be labeled during their formation. These long-term cells were demonstrated to be actively cycling, as demonstrated by incorporation and release of BrdU. Since these cells were cycling but continued to contain the BrdU label in their DNA, the researchers reasoned that they must be segregating their DNA using an immortal DNA strand mechanism. Joshua Merok et al. from the lab of James Sherley engineered mammalian cells with an inducible p53 gene that controls asymmetric divisions. BrdU pulse/chase experiments with these cells demonstrated that chromosomes segregated non-randomly only when the cells were induced to divide asymmetrically like adult stem cells. These asymmetrically dividing cells provide an in vitro model for demonstration and investigation of immortal strand mechanisms. Scientists have strived to demonstrate that this immortal DNA strand mechanism exists in vivo in other types of adult stem cells. In 1996 Nik Zeps published the first paper demonstrating label retaining cells were present in the mouse mammary gland and this was confirmed in 2005 by Gilbert Smith who also published evidence that a subset of mouse mammary epithelial cells could retain DNA label and release DNA label in a manner consistent with the immortal DNA strand mechanism. Soon after, scientists from the laboratory of Derek van der Kooy showed that mice have neural stem cells that are BrdU-retaining and continue to be mitotically active. Asymmetric segregation of DNA was shown using real-time imaging of cells in culture. In 2006, scientists in the lab of Shahragim Tajbakhsh presented evidence that muscle satellite cells, which are proposed to be adult stem cells of the skeletal muscle compartment, exhibited asymmetric segregation of BrdU-labelled DNA when put into culture. They also had evidence that demonstrated BrdU release kinetics consistent with an immortal DNA strand mechanism were operating in vivo, using juvenile mice and mice with muscle regeneration induced by freezing. These experiments supporting the immortal strand hypothesis, however, are not conclusive. While the Lark experiments demonstrated co-segregation, the co-segregation may have been an artifact of radiation from the tritium. Although Potten identified the cycling, label- retaining cells as adult stem cells, these cells are difficult to identify unequivocally as adult stem cells. While the engineered cells provide an elegant model for co-segregation of chromosomes, studies with these cells were done in vitro with engineered cells. Some features may not be present in vivo or may be absent in vitro. In May 2007 evidence in support of the Immortal DNA Strand theory was discovered by Michael Conboy et al., using the muscle stem/satellite cell model during tissue regeneration, where there is tremendous cell division during a relatively brief period of time. Using two BrdU analogs to label template and newly synthesized DNA strands, they saw that about half of the dividing cells in regenerating muscle sort the older \\"Immortal\\" DNA to one daughter cell and the younger DNA to the other. In keeping with the stem cell hypothesis, the more undifferentiated daughter typically inherited the chromatids with the older DNA, while the more differentiated daughter inherited the younger DNA. Experimental evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis is sparse. In one study, researchers incorporated tritiated thymidine into dividing murine epidermal basal cells. They followed the release of tritiated thymidine after various chase periods, but the pattern of release was not consistent with the immortal strand hypothesis. Although they found label-retaining cells, they were not within the putative stem cell compartment. With increasing lengths of time for the chase periods, these label-retaining cells were located farther from the putative stem cell compartment, suggesting that the label-retaining cells had moved. However, finding conclusive evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis has proven difficult.  Further models  After Cairns first proposed the immortal DNA strand mechanism, the theory has undergone several refinements. In 2002, he proposed that in addition to using immortal DNA strand mechanisms to segregate DNA, when the immortal DNA strands of adult stem cells undergo damage, they will choose to die (apoptose) rather than use DNA repair mechanisms that are normally used in non-stem cells. Emmanuel David Tannenbaum and James Sherley developed a quantitative model describing how repair of point mutations might differ in adult stem cells. They found that in adult stem cells, repair was most efficient if they used an immortal DNA strand mechanism for segregating DNA, rather than a random segregation mechanism. This method would be beneficial because it avoids wrongly fixing DNA mutations in both DNA strands and propagating the mutation. Mechanisms The complete proof of a concept generally requires a plausible mechanism that could mediate the effect. Although controversial, there is a suggestion that this could be provided by the Dynein Motor. This paper is accompanied by a comment summarizing the findings and background. However, this work has highly respected biologists among its detractors as exemplified by a further comment on a paper by the same authors from 2006. The authors have rebutted the criticism.

The name of the community evokes the French-Canadian and M√©tis history of the Red River Trails and the Pembina settlements of Assiniboia. History The location of Huot was originally dubbed the Old Crossing. In the 1840s and 1850s, this was a ford or crossing of the Red Lake River used by Red River ox cart trains en route from Pembina and Fort Garry in the Red River Colony to St. Paul, Minnesota. After negotiating the difficult and sometimes dangerous crossing, these cart trains typically camped overnight nearby, and the location became known as a regular stopping place on the \\"Woods Trail\\". In the 1850s, Joe Rolette, one of the colorful promoters of trade between British Assiniboia and St. Paul, established a trading house at the Old Crossing. Rolette also proposed to establish a city named \\"Douglas\\" at the same location. Rolette's compatriots in the Minnesota state legislature actually designated Douglas the county seat of Polk County in 1858. This designation was quickly withdrawn when the Ojibwe, who had been contesting the Dakota Sioux for hunting rights in the vicinity over many decades, refused to grant permission for a ferry or a town in their territory. Not coincidentally, the Old Crossing soon became the situs of the Treaties of Old Crossing, whereby the Ojibwe were induced to cede most of northwestern Minnesota to the United States. This cession was originally to be consummated at Old Crossing in September 1862, but events of the Dakota War of 1862 intervened. A large contingent of Ojibwe chiefs and their family members were encamped at Grand Forks several miles below Old Crossing, when hostilities of the Dakota War of 1862 spread to the Red River Valley. The Ojibwe remained calm while panic swept through the nearby white settlements and outlying farms and trading posts, but the United States treaty negotiators fled to safety at Fort Abercrombie. The Ojibwe treaty negotiations were postponed to the following year until the Sioux were subdued. Eventually, the Treaty of Old Crossing (1863) and the Treaty of Old Crossing (1864) were consummated and signed at the site of the Old Crossing. After the land was opened to non-native settlement in the early 1870s, a M√©tis contemporary of Joe Rolette, Pierre Bottineau, promoted immigration to the Red Lake River area by French-Canadian settlers. A substantial French-Canadian farming community developed nearby in what later became Red Lake County. One of these settlers, Louis Huot, arrived from Quebec in 1876. He established a ferry at the Old Crossing, just below the Black River, in 1877. The resulting village site and surrounding Louisville Township both were named after Louis Huot. As the neighborhood was homesteaded by other farmers, the village grew to include a Catholic church, a school, general store, a creamery (which later became the town hall) and a post office, as well as several houses. A bridge was built across the river, replacing the ferry, around 1900. Following a brief period of prosperity, the town of Huot began to decline after the Northern Pacific Railroad bypassed Huot and much of the business and trade activity of Louisville Township moved to the town of Dorothy, about north. The church building (St. Aloysius) was relocated to Dorothy in 1919, while the cemetery was left in its original location, where it still remains in use. The post office (operated in the Huot store) was discontinued in 1936. The old creamery building burned in 1940, and the town meetings were moved to the school house. In 1966 the bridge collapsed and later that year, the school house was burned down by vandals. Huot Store continued in operation for a few more years, but in 2008, Huot is barely recognized or ascertainable as a village. The tiny community appears by name on some maps as the site of the Old Crossing Treaty Park. Parks and recreation The Old Crossing Treaty Park in Huot was established on an on the west bank of the Old Crossing site in 1933, and a memorial to the 1863 Treaty of Old Crossing was erected there on June 25, 1933. At about the same time, an additional on the north side of the river, which included portions of the old Pembina Trail, was acquired by citizens of Polk and Red Lake counties. Today the park includes primitive camping and picnicking facilities, seasonal historical exhibits, a boat landing and the monument to the Ojibwe treaties and Red River cart trails. It is managed by Red Lake County. * Cultural events www.frenchcanadianafran.org The annual Old Crossing Chautauqua and French-Canadian/Metis Festival is a three-day event held at Huot and is sponsored by AFRAN (Association of the French of the North).

Legally, they held the lowest rank in medieval Korean society. Like the slaves, serfs, and indentured servants of the Western Hemisphere, nobi were considered property or chattel, and could be bought, sold, or gifted. Classification The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen other than the ruling yangban class, and some possessed property rights, legal entities and civil rights. Hence, some scholars argue that it's inappropriate to call them \\"slaves\\", while some scholars describe them as serfs. Furthermore, the Korean word for an actual slave, in the European and American meaning, is noye, not nobi. Some nobi owned their own nobi. History Some people became nobi as legal punishment for committing a crime or failing to pay a debt. However, some people voluntarily became nobi in order to escape crushing poverty during poor harvests and famines. Household nobi served as personal retainers and domestic servants, and most received a monthly salary that could be supplemented by earnings gained outside regular working hours. Out-resident nobi resided at a distance and were little different than tenant farmers or commoners. They were registered officially as independent family units and possessed their own houses, families, land, and fortunes. Out-resident nobi were far more numerous than household nobi. The hierarchical relationship between yangban master and nobi was believed to be equivalent to the Confucian hierarchical relationship between ruler and subject, or father and son. Nobi were considered an extension of the master's own body, and an ideology based on patronage and mutual obligation developed. The Annals of King Taejong stated: \\"The nobi is also a human being like us; therefore, it is reasonable to treat him generously\\" and \\"In our country, we love our nobis like a part of our body.\\" In the chakkae system, nobi were assigned two pieces of agricultural land, with the resulting produce from the first land paid to the master, and the produce from the second land kept by the nobi to consume or sell. In order to gain freedom, nobi could purchase it, earn it through military service, or receive it as a favor from the government. In 1426, Sejong the Great enacted a law that granted government nobi women 100 days of maternity leave after childbirth, which, in 1430, was lengthened by one month before childbirth. In 1434, Sejong also granted the husbands 30 days of paternity leave. See also *Yangban *Chungin *Sangmin *Cheonmin References  * External links *Slavery in Traditional Korea (James B.

The usage of the word Pict Popular etymology has long interpreted the name Pict as if it derived from the Latin the word Picti meaning \\"painted folk\\" or possibly \\"tattooed ones\\"; and this may relate to the Welsh word Pryd meaning \\"to mark\\" or \\"to draw\\". Julius Caesar, who never went near Pictland, mentions the British Celtic custom of body painting in Book V of his Gallic Wars, stating > \\"Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt, quod caeruleum efficit colorem, > atque hoc horridiores sunt in pugna aspectu\\" (\\"In fact all Britanni stain > themselves with vitrum, which produces a dark blue colour, and by this means > they are more terrifying to face in battle.\\") Robert E. Howard The Picts were an especial favourite race of Robert E. Howard and are mentioned frequently in his tales, having a continuity from the Thurian Age tales of King Kull of Valusia, where they are his allies, to the Hyborian Age of Conan the Barbarian, where they are the mortal enemies of the Cimmerians (who are actually descended from the old Atlanteans, though they don't remember their ancestry or old alliance). Howard also wrote tales about the last King of the Picts Bran Mak Morn set in real historical time, and they figure commonly as enemies of Cormac Mac Art. Of all the races and civilizations in Howard's writings, the Picts are the race or civilization with the longest history. They even appear in his story \\"The Valley of the Worm\\", set long before Kull, where a tribe of Picts help the protagonist, Niord, battle a giant snake and a creature which resembles a shoggoth. Howard gave the Picts a sense of continuity between different ages by making Bran Mak Morn a descendant of Kull's ally Brule the Spear Slayer, and then describing how the king's soul had been affixed to a black stone statue worshiped by the medieval Picts. The status of the Picts and their civilization generally declined over time; the Picts of the Thurian Age were far more sophisticated than their primitive, brutish descendants. Howard's Picts are said to have originated on \\"islands far out on the Western ocean\\"Howard, Robert E. and De Camp, L. Sprague: \\"The Hyborian Age, Pt.1\\", Conan, page 22. Ace Books, 1967(original publication date) and gradually migrated into the Mediterranean area. At one time, they spread across large areas of the world, but gradually vanished except for several splinter groups. Although some of these groups lived in remote jungles and southern continents, the most prominent body of Picts settled in the British isles, where they displaced a supposedly mongoloid race that had been the initial residents of the isles (though their origins were elsewhere). This previous race sought refuge underground, and over long millennia they evolved into stunted and hideous creatures, who were the initial subjects of tales concerning elves and dwarves, as described in the Bran Mak Morn short story \\"Worms of the Earth\\", as well in \\"The Children of the Night\\". The Picts were in turn displaced some thousands of years later by the invading Celts, and driven northward into Scotland where they interbred with a tribe of 'red haired barbarians,' resulting in a genetic shift toward diminished height. Following subsequent Roman, Breton, and Saxon invasions, the Picts too sought refuge underground, just like the natives they had displaced before. An interesting point is that, in the Hyborian age stories such as Beyond the Black River,Howard, Robert E., edited by De Camp, L. Sprague: \\"Beyond the Black River\\", Conan The Warrior, page 157. Ace Books, 1982(original publication date) when they populated the Western edge of Europe and share a border with Aquilonia, which tries to push them further west to colonize new provinces, the Picts show clear Native American influence, in their appearance, dress, armament, manner of conducting wars, and even the place names of the new Aquilonian provinces. It's hard to tell whether this is a case of inconsistency on the part of Howard, or a throwback to their earliest origins and savagery, as the Picts who Conan battled during the Hyborian Age are definitely more primitive than those Kull knew many millennia earlier. The story \\"Kings of the Night\\", in which Kull is summoned forward in time to help battle a Roman army, references a decline of the Picts after the age of Kull, specifically noting the Picts lost the skills of metalworking. The Picts described in stories such as \\"The Dark Man\\", set in the early Middle Ages, portray them as more primitive yet, with a Neolithic level of technology such as flint arrowheads. These Picts are clearly a people at the last stages of decline, and are living as a hidden tribe of savages of whom their neighboring Norse, Scottish, and Irish peoples are not aware. Howard's descriptions of the later Picts portray them as very small in height, squat and muscular, adept at silent movement, and most of all brutish and uncivilized, quite unlike the Picts of Kull's day.Howard, Robert E. and De Camp, L. Sprague: \\"The Treasure of Tranicos\\", Conan The Usurper, page 13. Ace Books, 1967(original publication date) They painted themselves with woad, much like the historical Picts, and lived in very large caverns, some natural and some artificially expanded. They had a custom of burning enemy prisoners alive, a ceremony usually presided over by their druid-like 'wizards' or priests, whom Howard portrayed as having a twisted philosophy and mindset produced by many years of hatred, in direct opposition to the Pictish warrior- king Bran Mak Morn, who attempted to restore the Picts to their honourable place in the world and drive out the Roman invaders. Bran Mak Morn's mindset was very unusual for his time and location, because he favored an alliance of the \\"native\\" British populations, including the Picts, Bretons, and Celts, against the Romans, in a setting when each of these tribes fostered an intense hatred and mistrust for all the others. Robert E. Howard also mentions that some warriors among the Picts could assume the forms of wolves, in the manner of werewolves, on their own free will. These Picts were a \\"race\\" with whom Howard felt the most affinity, and for this reason they were one of his favourite subjects, despite being almost wholly fictitious and deviating from historical fact. Terry Pratchett The Nac Mac Feegle (also known as Pictsies, the Wee Free Men, the Little Men, 'Person or Persons Unknown, Believed to be Armed', and occasionally 'The Defendants') are a type of fairy appearing in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels Carpe Jugulum, The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky and Wintersmith. Aside from being six inches tall, they largely invert the Victorian concept of mystical and refined fairies, and hark back to the fairies of folklore, who were generally seen as occasionally helpful thieves and pests. The Nac Mac Feegle's skin appears blue because it is heavily tattooed and covered with paint, and all have red hair. The tattoos identify a Feegle's clan. Wings or similar features of any kind are out of the question. Their speech can only be described as some sort of variation on the Scots language, usually Glaswegian in the clans encountered, although William the Gonnagle (from a different clan) has a softer, Highland accent. They are notably strong and resilient, which comes in handy given that male Feegles (almost all of them) tend to be notoriously rowdy as a lifestyle. Other references The antagonist of renowned writer Anne Rice's The Mayfair Witches trilogy, Lasher, is revealed to be a \\"Taltos\\" which is the name given to the Picts in the Anne Rice literary universe. Rice's Pictish Taltos people are not people or humans per se, rather they are a similar looking but vastly genetically different primate which can therefore engage in sexual acts with humans which rarely produces viable offspring, Taltos or Taltos-human hybrids, and usually resulting in the death of female mothers birthing them with the exception of human \\"witches\\" which have genetic predispositions that allow some to survive such inter-species breeding. The Stonehenge of the Salisbury Plains are attributed to Rice's humanized, complex mythological Taltos Pictish character of Saint Ashlar. Taltos can live for thousands of years but can die from blunt force trauma and trances induced by dancing or music. They are said to be a \\"childlike\\" people, as any sexual acts between fertile heterosexual Taltos couples instantaneously results in the rapid conception and birth of a new Taltos, all of which mature within hours to sexual maturity as described in Anne Rice's novels Lasher (book 2 of the trilogy) and Taltos (3rd and final book). In the roleplaying game Pendragon, a supplemental book entitled Beyond the Wall: Pictland & The North depicts a Pictish kingdom called Caledonia during the legendary era of King Arthur. Picts appear as characters in the Nancy Farmer's Norse-Medieval fantasy novels, The Sea of Trolls and The Land of the Silver Apples. Picts also appear in the film Centurion, with Michael Fassbender. In Rudyard Kipling's book Puck of Pook's Hill, a Roman soldier stationed in Britain describes the Picts as wily adversaries. The Picts also appear in John Cowper Powys' Arthurian novel Porius (1951) as the Ffichti, a tribe in Wales of Greek descent. Powys‚Äô Picts are allied to the ancestors of the Irish people (Gwyddylaid) and are usually referred to as ‚ÄúGwyddyl-Ffichti‚Äù throughout the novel. Powys‚Äô Nineue is also described as a Pict.Powys,John Cowper, Porius,pgs. 3-4,72. 1994 Colgate University Press,1994. See also W.J.

It sold for 10 cents. The character appeared primarily in the newspaper comic strip Dan Dunn, syndicated by Publishers Syndicate beginning Monday, September 25, 1933, with a Sunday page added soon afterward. The strip, which ran through Sunday, October 3, 1943, eventually would appear in approximately 135 papers.

Comic strip and other media On September 25, 1933, Publishers Syndicate began distributing Dan Dunn as a comic strip that eventually peaked at 135 newspapers. The Sunday color page began on October 1, 1933. Marsh both drew and wrote Dan Dunn from 1933 to 42, One critic describes the artwork as the weaker aspect, calling it \\"arid\\", with a chronic, wintry aspect\\", \\"cavernous spaces\\" and \\"huddled, stiff-jointed postures.\\" Assistants included Jack Ryan c. 1937, Ed Moore c. 1937‚Äì38, and Dick Fletcher. The Dan Dunn Sunday page ran a topper strip, Dan Dunn's Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, from March 4 to July 22, 1934. Marsh left the strip in 1942 following a disagreement with Publishers Syndicate. Allen Saunders, the syndicate's comics editor, took over as writer from 1942 to 43, with art first by Paul Pinson (June 1942 - January 1943) and then by Alfred Andriola (January to October, 1943). Saunders and Andriola subsequently replaced Dan Dunn with a new detective strip, Kerry Drake, in 1943. Starting in 1934, Dan Dunn appeared in seven Big Little Books: # Dan Dunn, Secret Operative 48: Crime Never Pays (1934) # Dan Dunn on the Trail of Counterfeiters (1936) # Dan Dunn and the Border Smugglers (1937) # Dan Dunn and the Crime Masters (1937) # Dan Dunn on the Trail of Wu Fang (1938) # Dan Dunn and the Dope Ring (1940) # Dan Dunn and the Underworld Gorilla (1941) In 1936, Dan Dunn became the title character of a pulp magazine that lasted for two issues. In 1944, Dan Dunn, Secret Operative #48 was produced as a 15-minute syndicated radio program which ran for a total of 78 episodes. It was produced by Kasper-Gordon, Inc. Reprints In 2017, The Library of American Comics reprinted one year of the strip (1933) in their LoAC Essentials line of books. Analysis Markstein calls the square-jawed Detective Dunn an imitation of Dick Tracy, killing criminals with the same direct resort to violence during the gangster era. Dunn never approached Tracy's popularity. The strip's successor writer, Allen Saunders, believed the comic rivaled Dick Tracy in pioneering themes and techniques of the American detective comic.

Pietrarsa is an area among these villages in the past known as ‚ÄúPietra Bianca‚Äù (white stone) but it was renamed Pietrarsa (burnt stone) after the eruption of the Vesuvius in 1631. The museum is housed in what was originally the old Bourbon workshop Officine di Pietrarsa, founded in 1840 at the command of Ferdinand II of Bourbon where steam machines for ships and boilers for locomotives were built. The workshop was organized in pavilions (where the collection is today displayed) which housed the various departments, each specializing in a different part of the production cycle. Overview In 1830, Ferdinand became king of the Kingdom of the two Sicilies. At the beginning, he had a small factory built in Torre Annunziata to produce steam engines for ships and ammunition for military use. This factory was part of the so many projects he undertook to renovate the Kingdom. Ferdinand II wanted to abandon the reactionary politics of his predecessors; he wanted to emancipate his Kingdom from foreign industrial and technological supremacy. In 1837, Ferdinand decided to relocate the factory, in order to better oversee the operations, and it was transferred next to the Royal Palace of Naples. The year 1836 was so important for Italy and Italian railways. The King met the French engineer Armand Bayard, who proposed to build the first stretch of line from Naples to Nocera. On 3 October 1839, the first part of that line, from Naples to Portici, was inaugurated. Two locomotives arrived from England on this occasion: the Longridge and the Vesuvio, while the locomotive called Bayard arrived on December of the same year. The development of the railways was so important that soon the King faced the problem of having a larger space to build a new and bigger workshop. He opted for Pietrarsa where, in 1842, the Royal Workshop for Mechanical works, nautical and locomotive production was born. The workshop run at full speed: in the middle of XIX century employed 1100 workers and it became the largest industrial pole in Italy. With the unification of Italy, the production was taken over by industry in the north, the Bourbon realm fell and Pietrarsa was handed over to the Italian Government first and to private companies later. These companies started a restrictions policy that caused a fall of the production and protests among workers. After World War II, the emergence of diesel and electric traction resulted in the rapid decline of steam locomotives and the decline of the factory too. In 1975, the Workshop of Pietrarsa was closed because it didn‚Äôt meet the new technical needs. The location underwent some restoration and, on 7 October 1989, the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa was officially inaugurated.  Structure  The size of the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa (36.000 m2) and the quantity of rolling stock exhibited places it amongst the major railways museums in the world. The collection is displayed in the pavilions of the ancient factory. The pavilion A, once used for assembly and reparation of locomotives, displays 26 steam locomotives and 4 three-phase electric locomotives. The most famous piece is a reproduction of the Bayard locomotive, the twin of Vesuvio. It was built in 1939 for the 100th Anniversary of the Naples-Portici line. Along the walls the steam locomotives are displayed following the evolution of steam traction. Then, here is the ‚ÄúFranco-Crosti‚Äù, the 910 and 740 locomotives. The pavilions B and C housed the furnaces and now are displayed many carriages (a Centoporte wagon, three Littorine, the E.623 and E.626) One important example is the n.10 of the Royal Train built by Fiat for the marriage of Umberto II of Savoy and Maria Jos√© of Belgium. It was one of 11 wagons and is renowned for its internal furnishing. The Pavilion D housed the forges and today there are diesel locomotives, while the Pavilion E is dedicated to the cinema hall and the pavilion F showcases a selection of giant machinery from the old factory. The last Pavilion is the oldest one, built in 1840. It is known as ‚ÄúCathedral‚Äù because of its arches. It displays train models and railway memorabilia as the famous Trecentotreni model.

Wells novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth. Michael Medved gave it the Golden Turkey Award for \\"Worst Rodent Movie of All Time\\". Plot The film reduced Wells' tale to an \\"Ecology Strikes Back\\" scenario, common in science fiction movies at the time. The \\"food\\" mysteriously bubbles up from the ground on a remote island somewhere in British Columbia. Mr. and Mrs. Skinner (John McLiam and Ida Lupino) consider it a gift from God, and feed it to their chickens, which grow larger than humans as a result. Rats, wasps, and grubs also consume the substance, and the island becomes infested with giant vermin. One night, a swarm of giant rats kill Mr. Skinner after his car tire is punctured in the forest. A professional football player named Morgan (Marjoe Gortner) is on the island for a hunting trip with his buddies when one of them is stung to death by giant wasps. After ferrying his friends back to the mainland, Morgan returns to investigate. Also thrown into the mix are Thomas and Rita (Tom Stovall and Belinda Balaski), an expecting couple; Jack Bensington (Ralph Meeker), the owner of a dog food company, who hopes to market the substance; and Bensington's assistant Lorna (Pamela Franklin), a bacteriologist. After Morgan locates and dynamites the giant wasps' enormous nest, he and the others become trapped in the Skinner's farmhouse, surrounded by giant rats. Mrs. Skinner, Morgan's friend Brian (Jon Cypher), and Bensington are killed by the rats. Morgan blows up a nearby dam, flooding the area and drowning the rats, whose size and weight renders them unable to swim. After the waters clear, the survivors pile up the bodies of the rats, spilling the jars of \\"F.O.T.G.\\" and gasoline on them before burning them. However, several of Mrs. Skinner's jars of \\"F.O.T.G.\\" are swept away, drifting to a mainland farm. The substance is consumed by dairy cows, and in the film's closing scene, schoolchildren are shown unwittingly drinking the tainted milk, implying that they will also experience abnormal growth.

P. Collins (born November 19, 1976) is a former American football running back for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). Early years Collins attended Leesville High School in Leesville in Vernon Parish in western Louisiana. There, he amassed 99 touchdowns and 7,833 yards over his high school football career including 3,079 yards during his senior season. Leesville was the 4A state runner-up that year and Cecil was selected as Louisiana's very first \\"Mr. Football\\". Collin's struggles began during his senior season at Leesville when the NCAA Clearinghouse declared that he would be required to retake his ACT Test. Cecil had taken the test during his Junior year and had not scored well enough to qualify for Division I schools. At the beginning of his Senior season he retook the exam and improved five points giving him an acceptable score. After reviewing his case however, the NCAA Clearinghouse notified his family that this improvement was unusual and that it would be necessary for him to retest. On his third attempt, Collins failed to make the required score by one point and was forced to sit out his first year at LSU. College career After sitting out his freshman year he began his football career at LSU in less than grand fashion, sitting out the first game of the season serving a suspension for breaking team rules. After this ignoble beginning, however, Collins compiled 596 yards in his first four games before breaking his leg in the game against Vanderbilt. He was kicked off of the LSU squad before the start of his second season after having been twice arrested for illegally entering dwellings. He claimed he was sleepwalking and had no recollection of entering the girls' rooms. He received probation as his sentence and made a second attempt at college football at Division I-AA (FCS) McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana but violated his probation when he failed a drug screen and was kicked off of the McNeese squad as well. NFL career Collins was selected as the first pick in the fifth round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the Dolphins out of McNeese State University by then coach-general manager Jimmy Johnson. Signing a three year contract, His nickname with the Dolphins was 'Cecil the Diesel'. He appeared in eight games in the 1999 season, accumulating 414 yards and two touchdowns. Collins was suspended indefinitely after his burglary arrest, then released shortly afterward.

Hence, the air waybill is non- negotiable. Description The air waybill is the most important document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorized agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document that covers the transport of cargo from airport to airport. By accepting a shipment, an IATA cargo agent is acting on behalf of the carrier whose air waybill is issued. Air waybills have eleven digit numbers which can be used to make bookings, check the status of delivery, and a current position of the shipment. Air waybills are issued in eight sets of different colours. The first three copies are classified as originals. The first original, green in colour, is the issuing carrier's copy. The second, coloured pink, is the consignee's copy. The third, coloured blue, is the shipper's copy. A fourth brown copy acts as the Delivery Receipt or proof of delivery. The other four copies are white.PDF file Functions The main functions of an air waybill are: * Contract of Carriage: Behind every original of the Air Waybill are conditions of contract for carriage documents. * Evidence of Receipt of Goods: When the shipper delivers goods to be forwarded, he will get a receipt. The receipt is proof that the shipment was handed over in good order and condition and also that the shipping instructions, as contained in the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, are acceptable. After completion, an original copy of the air waybill is given to the shipper as evidence of the acceptance of goods and as proof of contract of carriage * Freight Bill: The air waybill may be used as a bill or invoice together with supporting documents since it may indicate charges to be paid by the consignee, charges due to the agent or the carrier. An original copy of the air waybill is used for the carrier's accounting * Certificate of Insurance: The air waybill may also serve as an evidence if the carrier is in a position to ensure the shipment and is requested to do so by the shipper. * Customs declaration: Although customs authorities require various documents like a commercial invoice, packing list, etc. the air waybill too is proof of the freight amount billed for the goods carried and may be needed to be presented for customs clearance The format of the air waybill has been designed by IATA and these can be used for both domestic as well as international transportation. These are available in two forms, viz. the airline logo equipped air waybill and the neutral air waybill. Usually, airline air waybills are distributed to IATA cargo agents by IATA airlines. An air waybill shows: *the carrier's name *its head office address *its logo *the pre-printed eleven digit air waybill number It is also possible to complete an air waybill through a computerized system. IATA's e-Air Waybill (e-AWB) programme and multilateral e-AWB Agreement remove the requirement for an air waybill to be issued as a paper document and therefore allow for electronic air waybill documentation.IATA, e-AWB, accessed 28 February 2018 Agents all over the world are now using their own in-house computer systems to issue airlines' and freight forwarders' own air waybills. IATA cargo agents usually hold air waybills of several carriers. However, it gradually became difficult to accommodate these pre-numbered air waybills with the printed identification in the computer system. Therefore, a neutral air waybill was created. Both types of air waybills have the same format and layout. However, the neutral air waybill does not bear any pre-printed individual name, head office address, logo and serial number. Validity An air waybill is a contract‚Äîan agreement enforceable by commercial law. To become a valid contract it has to be signed by the shipper or his agent and by the carrier or its authorized agent. Although the same individual or organisation may act on behalf of both the carrier and the shipper, the air waybill must be signed twice one each in the respective carrier and shipper boxes. Both signatures may be of the same person. This also implies that the air waybill should be issued immediately upon receipt of the goods and letter in instructions from the shipper. As long as the air waybill is neither dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within the terms of the conditions of the contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. The validity of the air waybill and thus the contract of carriage expires upon delivery of the shipment to the consignee (or his authorized agent). Responsibility for completion The air waybill is a contract‚Äîan agreement between the shipper and the carrier. The agent only acts as an intermediary between the shipper and carrier. The air waybill is also a contract of good faith. This means that the shipper will be responsible for the haul also be liable for all the damage suffered by the airline or any person due to irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of insertions on the air waybill, even if the air waybill has been completed by an agent or the carrier on his behalf, except when the shipper (as vendor) has delivered the goods to a purchaser (consignee) on an Ex Works basis, and the agent has been hired by the consignee to act in its name as contracting carrier, and responsible for overseeing the regularity, correctness or completeness of the air waybill, pursuant to the freight terms and conditions agreed between the consignee and the agent (as contracting carrier), including, without limitation, whether the freight is NVD (Non Value Declared) or VD (Value Declared). When the agent acts in such conditions, the agent shall be liable for the haul and all the damage suffered by the consignee due to irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of insertions on the air waybill (when the shipper includes freight on the purchased item, in any other INCOTERM sale, the shipper is the sole responsible, since there will be no agent acting on behalf of the consignee for the relevant freight). When the shipper signs the AWB or issues the letter of instructions he simultaneously confirms his agreement to the conditions of contract. Non- negotiable Waybills are non-negotiable documents unlike bills of lading which are negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly at the top of the air waybill. This means that the air waybill is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity of goods. The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value of) the goods and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods. Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The air waybill executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the air waybill to the bank and collect the billed value of the shipped goods from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods. At the destination the carrier will only hand over the goods to the consignee on receipt of a bank release order from the consignee's bankers. The goods in the air consignment are consigned directly to the party (the consignee) named in the letter of credit (L/C). Unless the goods are consigned to a third party like the issuing bank, the importer can obtain the goods from the carrier at destination without paying the issuing bank or the consignor. Therefore, unless a cash payment has been received by the exporter or the buyer's integrity is unquestionable, consigning goods directly to the importer is risky. For air consignment to certain destinations, it is possible to arrange payment on a COD (cash on delivery) basis and consign the goods directly to the importer. The goods are released to the importer only after the importer makes the payment and complies with the instructions in the AWB. In air freight, the exporter (the consignor) often engages a freight forwarder or consolidator to handle the forwarding of goods. The consignor provides a Shipper's Letter of Instructions which authorizes the forwarding agent to sign certain documents (e.g. the AWB) on behalf of the consignor. The air waybill must indicate that the goods have been accepted for carriage, and it must be signed or authenticated by the carrier or the named agent for or on behalf of the carrier. The signature or authentication of the carrier must be identified as carrier, and in the case of agent signing or authenticating, the name and the capacity of the carrier on whose behalf the agent signs or authenticates must be indicated. International air waybills that contain consolidated cargo are called master air waybills (MAWB). MAWBs have additional papers called house air waybills (HAWB). Each HAWB contains information of each individual shipment (consignee, contents, etc.) within the consolidation. International AWBs that are not consolidated (only one shipment in one bill) are called simple AWBs. A house air waybill can also be created by a freight forwarder. When the shipment is booked, the airline issues a MAWB to the forwarder, who in turn issues their own house air waybill to the customer.  House Waybill (HAWB) vs Master Air Waybill (MAWB)   House Air Waybill (HAWB)  House air waybill (HAWB) is a transport document, which is used in air shipments, issued and signed by a freight forwarder, generally on a natural air waybill format, evidences the terms and conditions of the carriage of goods as specified by the freight forwarder. Neutral air waybills, without pre-printed identification of the issuing carrier can be used to issuance of house air waybills. The Main Features of a House Air Waybill (HAWB): * House air waybill generally issued on a natural air waybill format. * House air waybill issued and signed by a forwarder without indicating any signing authority either carrier or as agent of the carrier. * A house air waybill (HAWB) may or may not be subject to IATA Rules and one of the international air conventions (Warsaw Convention, Hague amendment, Montreal Convention, etc.) * House air waybill is signed by the forwarder and states the terms and conditions of carriage for the forwarder company‚Äôs perspective. House air waybill does not contain actual carrier‚Äôs carriage contract, as a result shipper stated on the house air waybill is not the direct participant of the carriage contract indicated on the master air waybill.  Master Air Waybill (MAWB)  Master air waybill (MAWB) is a transport document, which is used in air shipments, issued and signed by the air cargo carrier or its agent, generally on a pre- printed carrier‚Äôs air waybill format, evidences the terms and conditions of the carriage of goods over routes of the carrier(s). Master waybills can also be identified as an airline air waybills, with pre-printed issuing carrier identification. Main Features of a Master Air Waybill (MAWB): * Master air waybill generally issued on a pre-printed air waybill form of an issuer carrier. * Master air waybill issued and signed by the carrier or an agent on behalf of the carrier. * A master air waybill (MAWB) is subject to IATA Rules and one of the international air conventions (Warsaw Convention, Hague amendment, Montreal Convention, etc.) * Master air waybill is signed by the actual carrier and states the terms and conditions of the carriage, as a result consignee may have protection in case the goods are damaged or lost in transit. Air Waybill Number The AWB number has 11 digits and 3 parts. *The first 3 digits are the Airline PrefixUtopiax.orgAirline codes and ticketing codes *The next 7 digits is the Serial Number of the AWB *The last digit is the Check digit **The check digit is derived by dividing the 7 digit Serial Number by 7. The remainder determines the Check Digit. Example: Serial Number 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 with remainder 3. To easily calculate the remainder you can divide the 7 figures by 7, then subtract it with its integer, i.e. 8114074 divided by 7 = 1159153.428571429; 1159153.428571429 - 1159153 = 0.428571429; multiply the result by 7 and you will get the check digit by rounding it up or down to its closest integer. Here 0.428571429 x 7 = 3,000.... therefore the Serial Number + Check Digit is 81140743.

It is however the first novel published by the author. Faulkner was working on two manuscripts while finishing Soldiers' Pay.Blotner, Joseph. Faulkner: A Biography. New York: Random House, 1984. Print. (Blotner, 169) Plot overview The plot of Soldiers' Pay revolves around the return of a wounded aviator home to a small town in Georgia following the conclusion of the First World War. He is escorted by a veteran of the war, as well as a widow whose husband was killed during the conflict. The aviator himself suffered a horrendous head injury, and is left in a state of almost perpetual silence, as well as blindness. Several conflicts revolving around his return include the state of his engagement to his fianc√©e, the desire of the widow to break the engagement in order to marry the dying aviator herself, and the romantic intrigue surrounding the fianc√©e who had been less than faithful to the aviator in his absence. Soldier's Pay is one of only a few of the author's novels not set in his fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. Publication history William Faulkner was a friend of American writer Sherwood Anderson and a member of his literary circle in 1920s New Orleans. As the story goes, it was Anderson who agreed to send the Soldiers' Pay manuscript to his publisher as long as Anderson himself did not have to read it. In a 1950 letter from Faulkner's lifelong friend Phil Stone to Glenn O Carey, Stone acknowledges that it was Anderson who was instrumental in getting Soldiers' Pay published. \\"With all the efforts we made, I was not able to get Faulkner published and Sherwood Anderson was the one who got him started as far as publication goes.\\"Faulkner, William, Louis Daniel.

Early career  Schacher was born in Owosso, Michigan, and was raised in Flint, Michigan. He became interested in music at the age of seven playing with his father's banjo. By age twelve he had moved to playing guitar and then bass. By age fourteen, Schacher was part of a trio playing mostly wedding receptions and talent competitions while playing with other local bands.  Professional career  At sixteen, Schacher caught his first professional break when he was invited to replace bassist Frank Lugo in Question Mark and the Mysterians, and he supported their hit \\"96 Tears\\" (1966) on their 1967 tour.http://www.grandfunkrailroad.com/bios/Mel_bio.html During this stint, he was approached to join former Terry Knight and the Pack drummer Don Brewer and singer/guitarist Mark Farner ‚Äì who had been working as the Fabulous Pack but sought to change musical direction ‚Äì to form a new power trio. Intrigued by the power trio concept, Schacher joined the new lineup, and almost from the moment they played the 1969 Atlanta International Pop Festival, inspiring a rousing reception and fast-spreading word of mouth, they achieved international fame as Grand Funk Railroad. From 1969 through 1975, Grand Funk was one of the U.S.'s top rock groups, managing to hold on despite an acrimonious parting with manager/producer Terry Knight and a musical shift toward a more commercial hard rock. They achieved ten platinum-selling albums and two number 1 hit singles as well as several more top forty hits. In 1976 Grand Funk broke up over musical differences. Farner, Brewer, and Schacher decided to give Grand Funk another try in 1980. However, Schacher had developed a distaste for flying and elected to stay behind. Schacher spent the intervening years making his way as an investor and occasional musician until, almost by chance, he reteamed with Farner and Brewer in a reunited Grand Funk Railroad in 1996. They recorded a live concert set, Bosnia, and a few new selections for a major anthology project. The original lineup toured until 1998, when Farner left to pursue his solo music career. Schacher and Brewer enlisted veteran musicians Max Carl (38 Special), Bruce Kulick (Kiss) and Tim Cashion (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) and have continued touring as Grand Funk Railroad from 2000 to 2012 performing 40 shows a year to large audiences all across North America.

History The \\"Christmas Spectacular\\" began in 1933 when the Music Hall presented lavish live stage shows along with the latest Hollywood feature films. The first Christmas show was produced December 21, 1933, along with the RKO musical movie Flying Down to Rio and The Night Before Christmas, a Walt Disney Silly Symphony, and ran for two weeks.Mordaunt Hall, \\"Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Others in a Musical Film\\".

It consisted of an overture with Ern√∂ Rap√©e and the Radio City Symphony; a solo on the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ; a performance by Jan Peerce; a Toy Shop Ballet; The Rockettes' performance of \\"Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\\", choreographed by their founder, Russell Markert; and \\"The Living Nativity\\". These last two scenes have continued in every edition of the annual show up to the present day. The Christmas show, like all the Radio City stage shows, continued to be produced and choreographed by Leonidoff and Markert through the early decades of the Music Hall's history. Later, Peter Gennaro and others produced the annual show.Radio City Music Hall History, November 3, 2012. In addition to the annual Christmas show at Radio City, road companies have presented a touring version in theaters throughout the United States. The first Christmas Spectacular outside of Radio City was presented in Branson, Missouri at the Grand Palace Theatre in 1994. The Rockettes, having been founded in St. Louis (where they were called the Missouri Rockets), returned home for the extravaganza. The successful show launched a national tour the following year. The original touring show was presented in conjunction with Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation and ran from 1994 to 2003. In 2008, a new tour consisting of the 2007 edition was launched, playing at select theaters and arena venues around the country. In 2007, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Christmas show, an entirely new edition of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular was updated, designed, and choreographed under the direction of Linda Haberman. For a brief time, it was one of the few shows playing in New York in December 2007, during a strike which closed most Broadway theaters.Lawrence Van Gelder, \\"A Nimble 75-Year-Old Gets a Little Nip and Tuck\\". The New York Times, November 16, 2007. This edition of the show was filmed and has been released on DVD. In 2011, the show was titled The Rockettes Magical Journey. The production featured an updated 3DLIVE scene and new musical numbers in addition to \\"The Parade of Wooden Soldier\\" and \\"The Living Nativity.\\" The 2011 program's story focused on the Rockettes as they traveled through the Northern Forest to the castle of the Humbug King who had stolen toys from Santa Claus' workshop. In 2012, a slightly altered version was titled The Rockettes Celebration!, celebrating the 85th anniversary of the Rockettes with an additional scene. In 2013, an updated finale entitled \\"Snow\\" replaced \\"Let Christmas Shine.\\" In 2014, Julie Branam was hired as director and choreographer of the Christmas Spectacular. The 3DLIVE scene was removed and restoring the number \\"Rag Dolls\\" as well as adding an updated subplot surrounding Ben and Patrick, two young boys trying to find a Christmas present for their younger sister. Spring shows Radio City Spring Spectacular A spring show corresponding to the \\"Christmas Spectacular\\", titled the Radio City Spring Spectacular, was produced for several years until 1997. It included the traditional \\"Easter Parade\\" number with the Rockettes. Heart and Lights In September 2013, Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden attempted to produce an annual spring corresponding show titled Heart and Lights, which was to be directed and choreographed by Linda Haberman who had been director, choreographer, and artistic director of the Rockettes and the Christmas Spectacular since 2006. The show was scheduled to be performed from March 27 through May 4, 2014; however, one week before previews were to start, the program was canceled. Following several revisions, the show opened as the New York Spring Spectacular, which was directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle and ran from March 12 to May 7, 2015. Alongside the Rockettes, the show starred Derek Hough and Laura Benanti. Summer shows After the closing of the \\"New York Spring Spectacular,\\" it was announced the show would return the following year, shifting its run from the spring to the summer months. Directed and choreographed by Mia Michaels and written by Douglas Carter Beane, the program, now called the New York Spectacular, performed from June 15 to August 7, 2016 and is scheduled to return in the summer of 2017.

They have been actively involved in the education of boys and young men, primarily on Long Island, New York, serving the Diocese of Brooklyn (and later also the Diocese of Rockville Centre) since their founding. The Brothers of the congregation use the postnominal initials of O.S.F.. Numbering 80 members as of 2008, they are the largest congregation of Religious Brothers founded in the America. Formerly a diocesan congregation, in 1989, they became an Institute of Pontifical right. History Irish roots Ireland had been the home of 47 monasteries of friars, both priests and laybrothers, of the Franciscan Third Order Regular, which were centers of learning. These communities were suppressed under the Penal Laws put in place in their land under English rule. The Order continued in hiding, with only lay members. Their ministry was that of instructing Catholic boys in the faith in underground \\"bog schools\\". After the ban on education by Catholics was repealed in 1782, two Brothers established themselves as the Franciscan Brothers of Ireland, a congregation of Religious Brothers, and opened a monastery and free primary school for poor boys in Milltown, Dublin. Several foundations soon followed. In 1818 they were given land in Mountbellew, County Galway, to which the monastery moved and opened a primary school, now the Mountbellew Agricultural College. New York In 1847, the Brothers accepted the invitation of the Bishop of Pittsburgh and established a monastery there, the first community of Religious Brothers in the United States. John Loughlin, the first Bishop of Brooklyn, issued a similar invitation to the Brothers to operate schools for the boys of his diocese in 1858. Under the leadership of Brother John McMahon, O.S.F., and Brother Vincent Hayes, O.S.F., a group of six Brothers, sent from the monastery in Roundstone, County Galway, soon arrived and opened St. Francis Monastery on Butler Street and St. Francis Academy (now the site of St. Francis College), the first Catholic school in Brooklyn. The monastery served as the base of operations for the Brothers as they spread out over the City of Brooklyn in their ministry of education. Over the subsequent decades, the Brothers staffed local parochial schools. In 1882, at the request of Archbishop John Ireland, a group of Brothers left Brooklyn and opened a new monastery in Spalding, Nebraska, whose Brothers operated a school for Native Americans boys. The Brothers opened St. Anthony's High School in Smithtown, New York in 1933.\\"St. Anthony's History\\", St. Anthony's High School They also founded schools as far away as Florida and California and helped to found St. Bonaventure University and were among the first teachers there.Corry, Emmett, O.S.F. \\"The History of the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn in Ireland and America.\\" (New York: St. Francis College. 2003. ) They founded Camp Alvernia in Centerport, New York, in 1888, which remains the oldest Catholic summer camp in continuous operation in the country. They now also operate several facilities for spiritual retreats on the grounds, including Mount Alvernia Retreat Center. In the early 1920s, the camp was the site of an anti-Catholic demonstration by the Ku Klux Klan, which conducted a cross burning on its grounds. Division By the beginning of the 20th century, a desire had grown among the Brothers for closer ties to the wider Franciscan Third Order Regular. In addition, some of the Brothers had felt the call to become priests and saw the utility of having priests in the community to serve the spiritual needs of the Brothers and of their students. In 1906 the Brother Superior of the monastery, Brother Raphael Brehenny, O.S.F., and later his successor, Brother Linus Lynch, O.S.F., asked the bishop for permission to have some of the members of that community sent to be prepared for ordination. The bishop refused this request, as the community had been introduced into the diocese for the care of parish schools, and he feared that in the event of its members becoming priests this work would suffer. The following year some 25 Brothers gave up their religious vows to the Brooklyn monastery and joined the Brothers in Nebraska, whose bishop had approved their incorporation into the friars of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance headquartered in Rome. This led to the establishment of that Order in the United States in 1910. Pontifical status From the time of their founding, the Brothers had lived as a religious congregation of diocesan right, which put them entirely under the authority of the Bishop of Brooklyn, who served as their Superior General. In 1989 Pope John Paul II issued a Decree of Praise, which established the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn as an Institute of Pontifical right. This removed them from the direct authority of the local bishop and made them subject instead to the Holy See. They were then able to operate outside their home dioceses of Brooklyn and Rockville Centre anywhere in the world. Ministry The Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn are primarily involved in educational and pastoral ministries.Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn At present the Brothers help to staff Catholic high schools in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Raleigh, North Carolina.

Besides Socrates (the main speaker) the other interlocutors are Philebus and Protarchus. Philebus, who advocates the life of physical pleasure (hedonism), hardly participates, and his position is instead defended by Protarchus, who learnt argumentation from Sophists. Socrates proposes there are higher pleasures (such as those of the mind) as well as lower ones, and asks if the best life isn't one that optimally mixes both. Manuscripts of the work give it the subtitle \\"peri hƒìdonƒìs, ƒìthikos\\" (\\"ethics/moral concerning pleasure\\") implying that its topic is \\"concerning pleasure\\" and it is a work on ethics ‚Äî that is, the question of what way of life is best. However \\"there are large parts in the dialogue that deal with dialectics and ontology but have nothing to do with pleasure and ethics, or if so, only indirectly\\". page 306. Date of composition It has been proposed that the work was composed between 360 and 347 BC, and that it is among the last of the late dialogues of Plato, many of which do not figure Socrates as the main speaking character.Schofield, 'Plato', Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Edward Craig. Routledge. page 419. The dialogue is generally considered to contain less humor than earlier dialogues, and to emphasize philosophy and speculation over drama and poetry.Jowett, Chapter 1.Schofield. Contents The dialogue's central question concerns the relative value of pleasure and knowledge, and produces a model for thinking about how complex structures are developed. Socrates begins by summarizing the two sides of the dialogue: > Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight, and the class > of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living being, whereas I > contend, that not these, but wisdomPhronein meaning thoughtfulness (see > Benardette translation page 2.) and intelligence and memory, and their > kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better and more desirable > than pleasure for all who are able to partake of them, and that to all such > who are or ever will be they are the most advantageous of all things.Jowett, > Chapter 5. This contest between a life of ease and pleasure and a life of the mind was already a \\"rich tradition\\" among earlier Greek philosophers, and was also dealt with in other dialogues of Plato such as the Gorgias and the Republic. But Socrates and his interlocutors go on to dismiss both pleasure and knowledge as unsatisfactory, reasoning that the truly good is a third type, one of a measured and rational mixture of the two. Socrates already hints that this will be the conclusion in the first lines of the dialogue. The discussion however then turns to a complex discussion of which of the two types of life should be awarded second prize. Thought and reason are declared to be winners of this second prize, but in order to reach and explain this conclusion, Socrates expounds a proposed connection between reason and thought and nature, the orderliness of being itself, including the being of happiness and good. Socrates and Protarchos agree that \\"the body of the universe had a soul, since that body has the same elements as ours, only in every way superior\\".Philebus 30a on Perseus project This argument was also put in the mouth of Socrates by Plato in his Phaedo where Socrates explains that this was a belief he always found lacking in the philosophy of Anaxagoras. Very similar beliefs are reported of Socrates by Plato's less well-known contemporary Xenophon of Athens.For example in his Memorabilia 1.4.8 Xenophon describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion \\"Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (nous) alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while - as you think - those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?\\" and later in the same discussion he compares the nous which directs each person's body, to the good sense (phronƒìsis) of the god which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure. (1.4.17). The translation quoted is from Amy Bonnette's translation: . Philebus 28d, uses the same words nous and phronƒìsis in the same way. Commentators such as Friedrich Schleiermacher have noted that \\"the initial question is by no means the only and perhaps not even the main tendency of the conversation\\" and Paul Friedl√§nder notes further that the dialogue goes beyond not only the \\"simple question\\" but also its \\"simple answer (that the truly good and perfect is above both reason and pleasure, but thought and intelligence are incomparably closer to perfection than pleasure and enjoyment can ever be)\\". pages 307-8. One of the major ontological themes of the work is that there are four kinds of being, or four \\"elements\\": :1. The limitless. These are the types of things of which we make relative comparisons such as more or less. :2. The limited. These are the types of things which can be given a definite measurement of number. :3. The mixed kind of being, mixes the first two, limiting and various types of limitless beings in the \\"world of becoming\\" and change which people experience, or at least that aspect of it which is not arbitrary and aimless, but a more genuine kind of becoming that aims at being. :4. The cause of such genuine mixture, which limits the unlimited beings and orders nature. This, Socrates argues, is reason itself - not only human reason, but the greater reason of nature itself.

This compound is an odorless white solid, soluble in water. It has surfactant, antiseptic, and anti-infective properties, and it is used as a topical antimicrobial agent in first aid antiseptics. It is also found in cosmetics and toiletries such as soap, mouthwashes, anti-itch ointments, and antibacterial moist towelettes. Benzethonium chloride is also used in the food industry as a hard surface disinfectant. Uses Antimicrobial Benzethonium chloride exhibits a broad spectrum of microbiocidal activity against bacteria, fungi, mold and viruses. Independent testing shows that benzethonium chloride is highly effective against such pathogens as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and norovirus. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that the safe and effective concentrations for benzethonium chloride are 0.1-0.2% in first aid products.Tentative final monograph (21CFR 333) Aqueous solutions of benzethonium chloride are not absorbed through the skin. It is not approved in the US and Europe for use as a food additive. Being a quaternary ammonium salt, it is more toxic than negatively charged surfactants.Data Sheets However, in a two-year study on rats, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity. It is available under trade names Salanine, BZT, Diapp, Quatrachlor, Polymine D, Phemithyn, Antiseptol, Disilyn, Phermerol, and others.Sciencelab.com, Benzethonium chloride MSDS It is also found in several grapefruit seed extract preparations and can be used as a preservative, such as in the anaesthetics ketamine and alfaxalone.https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=2a8e4d17-3ff3-4aa3-a990-7cb012a3123a&type;=display Other uses In addition to its highly effective antimicrobial activity, benzethonium chloride contains a positively charged nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four carbon atoms. This positive charge attracts it to the skin and hair. This contributes to a soft, powdery after-feel on the skin and hair, as well as long-lasting persistent activity against micro-organisms. Also, this positively charged hydrophilic part of the molecule makes it a cationic detergent.TOXNET Benzethonium chloride is also used to titrate the quantity of sodium dodecyl sulfate in a mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, using dimidium bromide-sulphan blue as an indicator. It precipitates as turbidity with anionic polymers in aqueous solution, allowing it to be used to estimate the amount of such polymers present in a sample. This test is used in commercial and industrial water treatment, where polyacrylates, polymaleates, and sulfonated polymers are commonly employed as dispersants. Methylbenzethonium chloride A related compound () is used to treat Leishmania major infections. Regulation Some data has suggested that long-term exposure to antibacterial ingredients could contribute to bacterial resistance or hormonal effects. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the use of such ingredients in consumer soaps is actually more effective than plain soap and water. In September 2016, the Food and Drug Administration issued a ban on nineteen consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. A ruling on benzethonium chloride, along with two other similar ingredients, was deferred for a year to allow for more data collection.

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1943, where he studied under Shinkichi Hashimoto. He was professor emeritus at Gakushuin University. Career ≈åno is best remembered by fellow professional linguists for his work, following in the wake of his mentor Shinkichi Hashimoto, on the kana writing system and phonology of Old Japanese, published in 1953. He became known to the general reading public in 1957 with his popular book The Origins of the Japanese Language, which, together with Kindaichi Haruhiko's The Japanese Language, published the same year, created a lively interest in the nature, origins, and peculiarities of the language. He also collaborated with Takai Ichinosuke and Gomi Tomohide in the production of important editions of two early classics of Japanese literature, the Man'y≈çsh≈´ (1957-1962) and the Nihon Shoki (1965-1967). In addition, he co-edited a standard dictionary of early Japanese, the Iwanami Kogo Jiten (1974, second revised edition, 1990), and co-edited a new edition of the complete works of Motoori Norinaga, the greatest scholar of Kokugaku (1968-1993). As a result, he became one of the best-known linguists in Japan. His 1999 book for general readers, Nihongo Rensh≈´ch≈ç (, Japanese Exercise Book), sold 1.8 million copies. ≈åno made a significant contribution to the field of Japanese quantitative linguistics by indicating a statistical relationship, known as \\"≈åno's lexical law\\", between the category of classical Japanese literary works and the rate of usage of word classes in their lexicons. Hypothesis on a genetic link with the Tamil language Over the last three decades, ≈åno has won notability, though not always complimentary, for his support of the hypothesis, first put forward by Susumu Shiba in 1970, and developed by Akira Fujiwara, most notably in 1981,Nihongo wa doko kara kita kaK≈çdansha, Tokyo that the Japanese and the Tamil languages share a common ancestry.Susumu Ohno. The Genealogy of the Japanese Language: Tamil and Japanese His theory has been severely criticized by prominent Japanese Indologist Tokunaga Muneo,Tokunaga Muneo,Nihongo to Tamirugo Gengo Kenky≈´ No. 2 and by other comparativists like Kazama Kiyoz≈ç.\\"Kotoba to keit≈ç\\" in„ÄÅT≈çky≈ç Daigaku K≈çkai K≈çza Kotoba, T≈çky≈ç Daigaku Shuppankai, 1983 Generally speaking, like many other \\"amateur hypotheses\\" about the origins of the Japanese language, his theory \\"collapses\\" because the author, though a top-ranking scholar of Japanese, is thought to have presented his theories without taking into consideration the intricate complexities of the comparative methodologies of philology. ≈åno's attempt to confront his critics, in the article cited here, is successful in disarming Roy Andrew Miller's critique but said to be failing to answer the general charge, made much earlier on his previous theories about an Austronesian origin for the language.Murayama Shichir≈ç, Kokubu Naoichi Genshi nihongo to minzoku bunka, San'ichi Shob≈ç, Tokyo 1979 pp.32f., 50ff., The argument for a similar word order in Tamil and Japanese, for example, also holds for Japanese and some Papuan languages.

A TV presentation of the show was seen by someone in the Toronto casting department Miss Saigon who arranged for an audition for the role of Kim in the musical. She won the award and was a celebrated success, earning nominations for the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1994 and in 2011.Canadian Who's Who 2003 Dionisio has since performed as Kim in British, Australian and American productions of Miss Saigon. She played the role of √âponine in the U.S. touring company of Les Mis√©rables, joining Lea Salonga as the second Asian to play √âponine in western theater. She played Bertrande de Rols in Martin Guerre in London, performed in West Side Story as Maria at the Stratford Festival in 1999, and appeared on Broadway as Little Girl in the 2002 revival of Flower Drum Song. In July 2008, Dionisio reprised her original role as Kim in the seated production of Miss Saigon at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri. In July 2010, she also reprised this role again in the second Toronto, Ontario, Canada production. She originally played this role in the original Toronto production in 1993, which also launched her career. She is a founding artist of Theatre 20, a musical theatre company in Toronto formed by artists in 2009, and performed in Theatre 20's 2011 Concert Series at the Panasonic Theatre. She has also had occasional film and television roles, including guest appearances in Flashpoint, Remedy and Schitt's Creek and a lead role in the film The Waiting Room.

It is used for timber, and is notable as a model organism in plant biology.  Description  It is a large tree, growing to a height of and a trunk diameter over , which makes it the largest poplar species in the Americas. It is normally fairly short-lived, but some trees may live up to 400 years.Forbes 2006 A cottonwood in Willamette Mission State Park near Salem, Oregon, holds the national and world records. Last measured in April, 2008, this black cottonwood was found to be standing at tall, around, with 527 points. The bark is grey and covered with lenticels, becoming thick and deeply fissured on old trees. The bark can become hard enough to cause sparks when cut with a chainsaw.Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996. The stem is grey in the older parts and light brown in younger parts. The crown is usually roughly conical and quite dense. In large trees, the lower branches droop downwards. Spur shoots are common. The wood has a light coloring and a straight grain. The leaves are 7‚Äì20 cm long with a glossy, dark green upper side and glaucous, light grey-green underside; larger leaves, up to 30 cm long, may be produced on stump sprouts and very vigorous young trees. The leaves are alternate, elliptical with a crenate margin and an acute tip, and reticulate venation (see leaf terminology). The petiole is reddish. The buds are conical, long, narrow, and sticky, with a strong balsam scent in spring when they open. P. trichocarpa has an extensive and aggressive root system, which can invade and damage drainage systems. Sometimes, the roots can even damage the foundations of buildings by drying out the soil. emerging male catkins female catkins opening  Reproduction  Flowering and fruiting Sherwood, Oregon, USA P. trichocarpa is normally dioecious; male and female catkins are borne on separate trees. The species reaches flowering age around 10 years. Flowers may appear in early March to late May in Washington and Oregon, and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. Staminate catkins contain 30 to 60 stamens, elongated to 2 to 3 cm, and are deciduous. Pistillate catkins at maturity are 8 to 20 cm long with rotund-ovate, tricarpellate subsessile fruits 5 to 8 mm long. Each capsule contains many minute seeds with long, white, cottony hairs. Seed production and dissemination The seed ripens and is disseminated by late May to late June in Oregon and Washington, but frequently not until mid-July in Idaho and Montana. Abundant seed crops are usually produced every year. Attached to its cotton, the seed is light and buoyant and can be transported long distances by wind and water. Although highly viable, longevity of P. trichocarpa seed under natural conditions may be as short as two weeks to a month. This can be increased with cold storage. Seeds and fluff of cottonwood (July 1, 2012) Boise, Idaho, USA Seedling development Moist seedbeds are essential for high germination, and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month. Wet bottomlands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is epigeal. P. trichocarpa seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after logging unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment. Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age five because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant species are suppressed. Vegetative reproduction Due to its high levels of rooting hormones, P. trichocarpa sprouts readily. After logging operations, it sometimes regenerates naturally from rooting of partially buried fragments of branches or from stumps. Sprouting from roots also occurs. The species also has the ability to abscise shoots complete with green leaves. These shoots drop to the ground and may root where they fall or may be dispersed by water transport. In some situations, abscission may be one means of colonizing exposed sandbars. Habitat Black cottonwood grows on alluvial sites, riparian habitats, and moist woods on mountain slopes, at elevations of 0‚Äì2100(‚Äì2750) meters. It often forms extensive stands on bottomlands of major streams and rivers at low elevations along the Pacific Coast, west of the Cascade Range. In eastern Washington and other dry areas, it is restricted to protected valleys and canyon bottoms, along streambanks, and edges of ponds and meadows. It grows on a variety of soils from moist silts, gravels, and sands to rich humus, loams, and occasionally clays. Black cottonwood is a pioneer species that grows best in full sunlight and commonly establishes on recently disturbed alluvium. Seeds are numerous and widely dispersed because of their cottony tufts, enabling the species to colonize even burn sites, if conditions for establishment are met. Seral communities dominated or codominated by cottonwood are maintained by periodic flooding or other types of soil disturbance. Black cottonwood has low drought tolerance; it is flood-tolerant but cannot tolerate brackish water or stagnant pools.  Distribution  The native range of P. trichocarpa covers large sections of western North America. It extends northeast from Kodiak Island along Cook Inlet to latitude 62¬∞ 30¬∞ N., then southeast in southeast Alaska and British Columbia to the forested areas of Washington and Oregon, to the mountains in southern California and northern Baja California (31¬∞N). It is also found inland, generally on the west side of the Rocky Mountains, in British Columbia, western Alberta, western Montana, and northern Idaho. Scattered small populations have been noted in southeastern Alberta, eastern Montana, western North Dakota, western Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. It grows up to elevations of 2100 m. P. trichocarpa has been one of the most successful introductions of trees to the otherwise almost treeless Faroe Islands. The species was imported from Alaska to Iceland in 1944 and has since become one of the most widespread trees in the country.  Cultivation  It is also grown as an ornamental tree, valued for its fast growth and scented foliage in spring, detectable from over 100 m distance. The roots are however invasive, and it can damage the foundations of buildings on shrinkable clay soils if planted nearby (Mitchel 1996). Branches can be added to potted plants to stimulate rooting.  Use as a model species  Populus trichocarpa has several qualities that makes it a good model species for trees: * Model genome size (although significantly larger than the other model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana) * Rapid growth (for a tree) * Reaches reproductive maturity 4‚Äì6 years * Economically important * It represents a phenotypically diverse genus For these reasons, the species has been extensively studied. Its genome sequence was published in 2006 (see \\"Genome\\" below). More than 121,000 expressed sequence tags have been sequenced from it. The wide range of topics studied by using P. trichocarpa include the effects of ethylene, lignin biosynthesis, drought tolerance, and wood formation.  Lumber  P. trichocarpa wood is light-weight and although not particularly strong, is strong for its weight. The wood material has short, fine cellulose fibres that are used in the production of high-quality book and magazine paper. The wood is also excellent for production of plywood. Living trees are used as windbreaks. This species grows very quickly; trees in plantations in Great Britain have reached tall in 11 years, and tall in 28 years.Mitchell 1996 It can reach suitable size for pulp production in 10‚Äì15 years and about 25 years for timber production.  Uses  Native American tribes in the Pacific Northwest used components of P. trichocarpa for treatments in traditional medicine. Because of its salicin content, it was used raw or in salves to treat various ailments. The wood, roots and bark were used for firewood, canoe making, rope, fish traps, baskets and structures. The gum-like sap was even used as a glue or as waterproofing.Pojar, J. & MacKinnon, A. Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Vancouver, British Columbia: Lone Pine Publishing, 2004. Commercial extracts are produced from the fragrant buds for use as a perfume in cosmetics.  Genome   Characteristics  * Size: 485 million base pairs (human genome: 3 billion base pairs) * Proportion of heterochromatin to euchromatin: 3:7 * Number of chromosomes: 19 * Number of putative genes: 45,555, the largest number of genes ever recorded (estimate in September 2008) * Mitochondrial genome: 803,000 base pairs, 52 genes * Chloroplast genome: 157,000 base pairs, 101 genes  General information  The sequence of P. trichocarpa is that of an individual female specimen \\"Nisqually-1\\", named after the Nisqually River in Washington in the United States, where the specimen was collected. The sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute using the shotgun method. The depth of the sequencing was about 7.5 x (meaning that each base pair was sequenced on average 7.5 times). Genome annotation was done primarily by the Joint Genome Institute, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Ume√• Plant Science Centre, and Genome Canada. Prior to the publication of P. trichocarpa genome the only available plant genomes were those of thale cress and rice, both of which are herbaceous. P. trihocarpa is the first woody plant genome to be sequenced. Considering the economic importance of wood and wood products, the availability of a tree genome was necessary. The sequence also allows evolutionary comparisons and the elucidation of basic molecular differences between herbaceous and woody plants. Doty et al. (2016) found the first direct evidence of nitrogen fixation in the wild P. trichocarpa (a nonleguminous tree).Doty, S. L., Sher, A. W., Fleck, N. D., Khorasani, M., Bumgarner, R. E., Khan, Z., ... & DeLuca, T. H. (2016). Variable nitrogen fixation in wild Populus. PLOS ONE, 11(5), e0155979.  Somatic mosaicism  Genome-wide analysis of 11 clumps of P. trichocarpa trees reveals significant genetic differences between the roots and the leaves and branches of the same tree. The variation within a specimen is as much as found between unrelated trees. These results may be important in resolving debate in evolutionary biology regarding somatic mutation (that evolution can occur within individuals, not solely among populations), with a variety of implications.  Nomenclature  \\"Trichocarpa\\" is Greek for \\"hairy fruits\\". These scientific names are now considered synonymous with P. trichocarpa: {- valign=top *P. balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa *P. balsamifera var. californica *P. hastata *P. trichocarpa subsp. hastata *P. trichocarpa var. hastata *P. trichocarpa var. cupulata *P. trichocarpa var. ingrata |} References Further reading * Populus genome at the JGI website * Popgenie: The Populus Genome Integrative Explorer * Plants for a Future: Populus trichocarpa * Forbes, R.

These are the largest known Inca ruins in Ecuador. The most significant building is the Temple of the Sun, an elliptically shaped building constructed around a large rock. History This area had long been settled by the Ca√±ari indigenous people, who called it Hatun Ca√±ar. As the Inca Empire expanded into southern Ecuador, the Inca T√∫pac Yupanqui encountered the Ca√±ari \\"Hatun Ca√±ar\\" tribe. He had difficulties in conquering them. He used different political strategies, marrying the Ca√±ari princess and improving the Ca√±ari city of Guapondelig, calling it Tumebamba or Pumapungo (nowadays Cuenca). The Inca and Ca√±ari decided to settle their differences and live together peacefully. The astronomical observatory was built under Inca Huayna Capac. The Inca renamed the city as Ingapirca and kept most of their distinctive customs separately, as the Ca√±ari did theirs. Although the Inca were more numerous, they did not demand that the Ca√±ari give up their autonomy. The castle complex is of Ca√±ari-Inca origin. Its purpose is uncertain. The complex was used as a fortress and storehouse from which to resupply Inca troops en route to northern Ecuador. At Ingapirca they also developed a complex underground aqueduct system to provide water to the entire compound. The Temple of the Sun is the most significant building whose partial ruins survive at the archeological site. It is constructed in the Inca way without mortar, as are most of the structures in the complex. The stones were carefully chiseled and fashioned to fit together perfectly. It was positioned in keeping with their beliefs and knowledge of the cosmos. Researchers have learned by observation that the Temple of the Sun was positioned so that on the solstices, at exactly the right time of day, sunlight would fall through the center of the doorway of the small chamber at the top of the temple. Most of this chamber has fallen down. The people had numerous ritual celebrations at the complex. They prepared gallons of a local fermented drink to consume in the rituals of these festivals. As sun and moon worshipers, they tried to be as close to their gods as possible, and built their monuments high in the mountains. The weather changes rapidly, within minutes, ranging from calm and sunny one minute and rainy, windy, and cold another minute. This climate volatility is typical year round. The people felt strongly that this was the place where the gods had led them, regardless of the climate. Tourism To visit Ingapirca, travelers can take a day tour from the city of Cuenca. They may also spend the night in the towns of El Tambo or Ca√±ar and travel the next day to the site. Map Map of the Ingapirca site.

In 1760 the prince died, and the implementation of the Family Palace passed to his son Giovanni Carlo who entrusted the old Luigi Vanvitelli. After the death of Vanvitelli, in 1773, the plans passed first to Ferdinando Fuga, then to Mario Gioffredo and lastly to Carlo Vanvitelli, son of Luigi.

It was located on the south side of East 14th Street, between Irving Place and Third Avenue. Designed by Thomas W. Lamb, it was built in 1927 across the street from the site of the original Academy of Music established by financier Moses H. Grinnell in 1852. Opened as a deluxe movie palace by movie mogul William Fox, the Academy operated as a cinema through the early 1970s. Beginning in the 1960s, it was also utilized as a rock concert venue, particularly following the June 1971 closure of the Fillmore East. It was rechristened the Palladium on September 18, 1976, with The Band live radio broadcast,Rockwell, John \\"Refurbished 14th St. Palladium Opens With Program by the Band\\" The New York Times (September 20, 1976) and continued to serve as a concert hall into the following decade. In 1985, the Palladium was converted into a nightclub by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, after their success with Studio 54. Japanese architect Arata Isozaki redesigned the building's interior for the club. Peter Gatien owned and operated the club from 1992 until 1997. The Palladium closed in August 1997 following its purchase by New York University. In August 1998, the building was demolished in order to build a twelve-story residence hall that students affectionately referred to as Palladium Hall. The residence hall typically houses 960 residents, primarily sophomores with approximately 120 MBA students. Two floors in the basement and sub-basement house the Palladium Athletic Facility. Music venue The Academy of Music opened as a movie palace at 126 East 14th Street. By the 1970s it had become a music venue for rock and roll acts. Seating 3,000, it was popular with both mainstream bands and upcoming acts which could open a major bill. Many bands performed at the Palladium in the middle of large arena and stadium tours, due to the prestige of the theater and the excellent acoustics. The theater featured a highly regarded sound system that was designed and installed by Richard Long of Richard Long & Associates (RLA). Among the numerous rock concerts the Academy of Music hosted were The Rolling Stones 1st American Tour 1965, which played this venue on May 1, 1965,Manning, Sean, The Show I'll Never Forget: 50 Writers Relive Their Most Memorable Concertgoing Experience, Da Capo Press, Jan 2, 2007.

New Year's Eve 1973 featured the eclectic line-up of Blue √ñyster Cult, Iggy Pop, Kiss, and Teenage Lust (which had recently backed up John Lennon). Genesis performed their NY concerts of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway there in 1974. And Renaissance performed there on May 17, 1974; the show featured Andy Powell of Wishbone Ash on guitar, and bootleg recordings are widely available. The Grateful Dead played two extended stands at this venue. One was seven shows at the Academy of Music, from March 21‚Äì28, 1972. Excerpts of these shows, including some tracks with Bo Diddley as a guest, were officially released on Dick's Picks Volume 30 and Dave's Picks Volume 14. The other was 5 shows between April 29 and May 4, 1977. The complete April 30 show was officially released as Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 1, with 3 bonus tracks from the April 29 show. Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band played six shows at the Palladium in October and November 1976, and three more in September 1978. Tickets for all three 1978 shows were sold out. Frank Zappa and his band performed on and around Halloween several times, including performances in 1977, which were included in the film Baby Snakes, a legendary series of shows in 1978, and a 1981 performance which was simulcast live on radio and MTV. New York proto-punk musicians The Patti Smith Group, John Cale, and Television, performed at the Palladium on New Year's Eve 1976. The Bay City Rollers performed at The Palladium on January 8, 1977. A performance of the Ramones was recorded at the Palladium on January 7, 1978; and they returned for New Year's Eve 1979. Kiss played a warm-up show here, in 1980, before they kicked off their Unmasked Tour in Italy; it was Eric Carr's first live performance with the band. In 1991, Tin Machine performed at the venue during their It's My Life Tour on November 27 & 29; a portion of these performances were used for their live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby. Blondie, fresh from their first European tour, performed songs from the Blondie and Parallel Lines albums, on May 4, 1978. Deborah Harry wore a long sleeve red shirt, with pink panties and red thigh high boots. Rockabilly legend, Robert Gordon along with master guitarist, Link Wray opened the evening performing classic songs from the likes of Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran among others. On July 25, 1980, Kiss played the venue, their only North American concert in 1980, to introduce new drummer Eric Carr to the American press before heading overseas for their Unmasked Tour. Also part of the reason for having the concert was to help subsidize the rental of the Palladium for tour rehearsals with Carr.\\"KISS and Sell\\" by C.K. Lendt The venue was also where many British heavy metal acts made their initial impact in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Ozzy Osbourne, Humble Pie, and other participants of the so-called new wave of British heavy metal. The classic line-up of Mot√∂rhead, with \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on guitar, performed its final show at the Palladium on May 14, 1982. Many UK punk and new wave acts made their New York debuts at the Academy of Music, including The Clash, The Jam, The Boomtown Rats, The Fall, Graham Parker & The Rumour, Rockpile, U2, Duran Duran, The Undertones, and Roxy Music. American punk bands The Ramones, Blondie, and The Cramps also played there in the late seventies. Chuck Berry played a New Year's Eve concert on 31 December 1988 recorded by WNEW-FM and available as \\"Chuck Berry Live At Palladium Theater, New York, WNEW-FM Broadcast, 31st December 1988\\".

Nightclub The Palladium was converted from a music venue into a nightclub by former Studio 54 owners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, and they hired Danceteria DJ Richard Sweret, DJ Patrick Anastasi and DJ Luis Martinez who saw the possibility of a much larger audience for a downtown ‚Äònew wave music‚Äô, Euro and house music-oriented club.

Fall 2017 From its celebrity-studded opening in May 1985, through the end of the 80s, it was one of the major features on a vibrant New York club scene. The club was a mainstay on the New York club scene until it was bought out in 1997 by New York University (NYU) and demolished for a campus housing project. Junior Vasquez's Arena party, held Saturday nights and Sunday mornings at Palladium between September 1996 and September 1997, was one of the most popular parties in the New York club scene at the time. Although the promoters billed Arena as \\"The Gay Man's Pleasure Dome\\", the party drew an eclectic mix of gay and straight from Manhattan and far beyond. Vasquez commemorated Arena in the titles of the remixes he produced that year.

Dracovenator was a medium-sized, moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, that could grow up to an estimated long. Its type specimen was based on only a partial skull that was recovered.  Description  Speculative size compared to a human Dracovenator is estimated to have measured between in length.Smith, N.D., Makovicky, P.J., Pol, D., Hammer, W.R., and Currie, P.J. (2007). \\"The Dinosaurs of the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of the Central Transantarctic Mountains: Phylogenetic Review and Synthesis\\". U.S. Geological Survey and The National Academies Others estimates suggest that Dracovenator was at most long and weighed . The holotype specimen, BP/1/5243, consists of both premaxillae, a fragment of the maxilla, two dentary fragments, a partial surangular bone, a partial angular bone, a partial prearticular bone, an articular bone, and several teeth. Dracovenator has a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. The back end of the lower jaw features an array of lumps and bumps, a condition seen in Dilophosaurus, but to a much smaller extent. Munyikwa and Raath (1999) reassigned paratype BP/1/5278, which was originally assigned to Syntarsus rhodesiensis, to Dracovenator, a juvenile specimen which consists of bones from the front of the skull, teeth, and jaw bones.Munyikwa and Raath, 1999. Further material of the ceratosaurian dinosaur Syntarsus from the Elliot Formation (Early Jurassic) of South Africa. Palaeontologia Africana. 35:55-59. A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Yates (2005) Dracovenator can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the presence of a large bilobed fossa surrounding a large lateral premaxillary foramen that is connected to the alveolar margin by a deep narrow channel; a deep, oblique notch on the lateral surface of the articular bone, separating the retroarticular process from the posterior margin of the glenoid, a particularly well-developed dorsal, tab-like processes on the articular bone- the first on the medial side, just posterior to the opening of the chorda tympanic foramen and the second on the lateral side on the anterolateral margin of the fossa for the m. depressor mandibulae.  Discovery  Drawing of the known skull bones. Scale bar equals 10 cm. The type material BP/1/5243 for Dracovenator was discovered at the \\"Upper Drumbo Farm\\" locality in the upper Elliot Formation which is part of the Stormberg Group in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. It was collected by James Kitching and Regent \\"Lucas\\" Huma in sandstone that was deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201 to 199 million years ago. The paratype material BP/1/5278 (originally assigned to Syntarsus rhodesiensis) was discovered in 1981, also at the Elliot Formation in pinkish-maroon silty mudstone that was deposited in Hettangian sediments. Both the holotype and paratype specimen were housed in the fossil collection of the Evolutionary Studies Institute, part of the School of Geosciences of the University of the Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg, South Africa. Unfortunately the cranial material house at the Evolutionary Studies Institute was lost and no new fossils of Dracovenator have currently been found. The genus name is a contraction of the Latin words draco meaning \\"dragon\\", and venator meaning \\"hunter\\"; thus, \\"dragon hunter\\". \\"Draco\\" refers to its discovery in the foothills of Drakensberg, which is \\"Dragon‚Äôs Mountain\\" in the Dutch language. The specific name, regenti, was named in the honor of the late Regent ‚ÄòLucas‚Äô Huma, who was Professor Kitching‚Äôs field assistant. Dracovenator was described and named by Adam M. Yates in 2006 and the type species is Dracovenator regenti.  Classification  Juvenile Dracovenator regenti snout on display at the Royal Ontario Museum Yates (2005) assigned Dracovenator to the clade Neotheropoda.A. M. Yates. 2005. A new theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of South Africa and its implications for the early evolution of theropods.

The skull of the type specimen, exhibits a mosaic of both ancestral and derived theropod characteristics. The following cladogram, based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Smith, Makovicky, Pol, Hammer, and Currie in 2007, outlines the relationships of Dracovenator and its close relatives:Smith, N.D., Makovicky, P.J., Pol, D., Hammer, W.R., and Currie, P.J.

The Forest Sandstone Formation was the paleoenvironment of protosuchid crocodiles, sphenodonts, the dinosaur Massospondylus and indeterminate remains of a prosauropod.

The film was released by United Artists at a time when Allen was at the peak of his fame as one of the most popular radio comedians. The film has been preserved by UCLA Film & Television Archive. Characters and story A flea circus ringmaster (Allen), Fred Floogle, has strange encounters as he searches for his inheritance, hidden in the seat of one of five chairs. The film is loosely based on the comic novel The Twelve Chairs (1928) of Ilf and Petrov, later filmed by Mel Brooks as The Twelve Chairs (1970). The team of screenwriters included Jay Dratler, Alma Reville (wife of Alfred Hitchcock) and Morrie Ryskind. Binnie Barnes plays Mrs. Floogle. Cameo roles are filled by other radio actors who had already, or were beginning to, become known in movies, including Don Ameche, Rudy Vallee, William Bendix, Jerry Colonna, Robert Benchley, John Carradine, Sidney Toler. For classic radio fans, the highlight of the film will be Floogle's encounter with Jack Benny, who at the time was involved with Allen in their famous 'feud', which ran for over a decade. There is an alternative version of the film where Allen's voice periodically breaks in on the action with wisecracks a la the opening credits. This version obscures some of the on-screen dialogue, including the punchline. This version has aired on AMC. Cast * Fred Allen - Fred F.

Biography Ermes was born in Bologna. In 1492 he was created knight by Ercole I d'Este and entered to the military service of the latter. Six years later, together with his father and brothers, he was made Imperial Knight by Emperor Maximilian I. He frequently fought alongside his elder brother Annibale. In 1501, by order of his mother Ginevra, he had several members of the Marescotti family, rivals of the Bentivoglio, killed. In 1504 he married Iacopa Orsini, daughter of Giulio Orsini. In 1506, when Pope Julius II ordered the Bentivoglio to leave Bologna, he took refuge first in Ferrara and then in Mantua, together with Annibale. A reward was raised against them by the Pope; in spite of it, the two brothers repeatedly attempted to reconquer their city until they succeeded in 1511, thanks the help of the French. Annibale was declared new lord of Bologna; the following year, however, once the French left the population rose against them and the Bentivoglio had to leave the city forever.

He is best known for his long tenure as music director and conductor of D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring companies during the original runs and early revivals of the Savoy Operas, including many of the New York premieres. Life and career Patrick William Halton was born in Mullingar, Ireland, and died in Manchester, England. For nearly 25 years, Halton served as one of D'Oyly Carte's leading provincial musical directors. Halton was the father of Frederick J. Halton, the author of \\"The Gilbert & Sullivan Operas: A Concordance\\" (New York, Bass, 1935). In the early to mid-1870s, Halton moved to London and worked in a music store, playing the organ in a local church, and giving music lessons. He also conducted at various music halls during this time. In 1876, he was hired as a conductor by the Theatre Royal, in Manchester. Early years and premieres In December 1879, D'Oyly Carte hired Halton in Hastings as music director for one of its touring companies, presenting H.M.S. Pinafore. In 1880 he toured with Pinafore and The Sorcerer, along with shorter companion pieces, and in December 1880, the company began to play The Pirates of Penzance. Among the companion pieces included on this tour was Halton's own composition Six and Six, a one-act operetta with words by B. T. Hughes.Information about Six and Six In September 1881, Halton traveled to America to music direct Patience, at the Standard Theatre in New York, until March 1882. During the last month he also conducted Henry Pottinger Stephens and Edward Solomon's Claude Duval, alternating with Patience. He then returned to England to music direct Patience on tour until December 1883. Next, beginning in February 1884, was Princess Ida. Then, beginning in February 1885, Trial by Jury and Sorcerer were played in repertory with Princess Ida. Back in New York, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, Halton music directed the American premiere of The Mikado from August 1885 to April 1886. He then toured with Pinafore and The Mikado, first in England and then took in Germany and Austria, until January 1887. He then returned to New York and the Fifth Avenue Theatre, with most of the same principals, for the premiere of Ruddigore, which ran until April. He was back to Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and then Britain with Patience and The Mikado until December 1887. In 1888, Halton toured with a repertory consisting at various times of Pinafore, Patience, The Mikado and Pirates, until October. On November 1, 1888, he began a tour of The Yeomen of the Guard, which ran for over a year. In January 1890, Halton was back in New York music directing the ill-starred premiere of The Gondoliers at the Park Theatre. The weak cast meant a disaster, and Carte and Halton assembled a new cast for a re-launch on February 18 at Palmer's Theatre, which was better received. Later years Halton was called back to England to begin touring in March, 1890 with The Gondoliers until December. After this, they added shows in repertory, including The Mikado in December 1890 and Yeomen in January 1891. On 4 September 1891, he conducted The Mikado for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle - an assignment that the patriotic Irishman accepted grudgingly. In October 1891, Iolanthe was added to the company's repertory, and from January to July 1892 they also included The Nautch Girl. The company continued to add more shows: Patience in August 1892, Pirates in May 1893, Pinafore and Trial in January 1894, The Sorcerer in April 1895, the curtain raiser Cox and Box in May, and Princess Ida in December 1895. The repertoire was now eleven, and the tour continued through 1896. In late November 1896, Halton sailed for South Africa for an ambitious tour through June 1897. It embraced all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas Halton had been conducting, except Princess Ida, and also included Utopia, Limited and The Grand Duke. Halton toured Britain from December 1897 with most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas plus, briefly, His Majesty. Over the next six-and-a-half years, with Halton as their musical director, the same touring company played all the G & S operas except Ruddigore and The Grand Duke plus, in 1900, The Rose of Persia. Halton retired on June 18, 1904. Notes References *Jones, Brian. \\"Patrick W. Halton: 'A Very Capable Conductor'\\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, vol. 1, no. 7, 1993.

The band is known for their creative and heartfelt lyrics, lush vocal harmonies, thoughtful arrangements, and engaging live show. History Bombadil began in early 2004 after guitarist Bryan Rahija and bassist Daniel Michalak were studying abroad in Bolivia as students at Duke University. They recorded several demos at an elementary school in La Paz during their spare time. After returning to the U.S., Michalak recruited his brother John to write drum parts. Pianist and friend Stuart Robinson joined the band a few months later. After a busy year of touring and writing, Bombadil signed with Ramseur Records of Concord, North Carolina after playing a show with The Avett Brothers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The group immediately set out recording a debut EP, which was released in May 2006. John Michalak left the band to pursue medical school and was replaced by James Phillips in the fall of 2007. The group released their first full-length album entitled A Buzz, A Buzz on April 29, 2008. The band toured throughout the United States, playing festivals like Bonnaroo, FloydFest, Pickathon, and Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion to support the album. Their second album, Tarpits and Canyonlands, was recorded with Scott Solter and released on July 7, 2009. The band went on hiatus from July 2009 to December 2010, due to Daniel suffering from nerve damage in his hands. Stuart Robinson also briefly left the band during this time to pursue academic interests, but later returned. The band gathered in Portland, Oregon to record a follow up to Tarpits and Canyonlands in November 2010. The album was recorded by drummer James Phillips in a barn on Pendarvis Farm (the same barn where The Decemberists recorded The King is Dead).

He is former Secretary-General of the Thai National Energy Policy Office, Chairman of Kasikorn Asset Management, and Chairman of the Panel of Advisors to the CEO of Kasikornbank. He was President of Thai Airways International between October 2009 and June 2012. He is Chairman of PTT Public Company Limited, board member of Kasikorn Bank, and board member of Pruksa Holding PCL. Piyasvasti plays active roles in three non-profit organizations as a founding and core member of the Energy Reform for Sustainability Group (ERS); Chairman of the Energy for Environment Foundation, a non-profit organization undertaking renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and as president of the Ski and Snowboard Association of Thailand. Career During the 1990s, Piyasvasti played a key role in deregulating and privatizing a number of energy-related state enterprises like PTT and power generation business. During his term as energy minister he implemented wide-ranging reforms in the energy sector, for instance, the end of oil price subsidies and repayment of the oil fund's massive debt accrued by the previous government's subsidy program; implementation of aggressive policies to promote renewable energy (including biofuels), cogeneration and distributed generation; adoption of Euro 4 fuel qualities and introduction of vapour recovery systems for petrol stations; adoption of a number of standards and incentive programs for energy efficiency; awards of a large number of petroleum concessions, issuing of IPP solicitation; conclusion of a number of power purchase agreements for projects in Laos; establishment of a nuclear power program with a target for 4,000 MW of nuclear capacity in 2020-2021; and amendment of a number of energy-related laws. The most important law passed during his term as energy minister was the Energy Industry Act to establish an independent regulatory body for electricity and natural gas. The law was responsible for saving PTT Public Co, Ltd. from being nationalized in a court case brought against the government and PTT by the Consumers Association. Piyasvasti joined Thai Airways in October 2009 when the carrier was in financial trouble. He continued to implement the turnaround plan and introduced a long term strategic plan where the financial position of the company was substantially strengthened, embarked on the largest aircraft acquisition and retrofit program ever implemented at Thai Airways, and formed Thai Smile as an first step in competing with low cost airlines. In June 2012, the board of directors suddenly voted Piyasvasti out with no explanation in what was seen as a politically motivated coup. Education Piyasvasti was born in 1953. He graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford in 1975 with BA (first class honours) in mathematics. He later obtained an MSc in econometrics and mathematical economics, and a PhD in economics from the London School of Economics.

(1457 Vikram Samvat) from Tavari village near Osian town Rajasthan, India. Bhinmal is the birth and native place of well-known Sanskrit poet Mahakavi Magha and mathematician-astronomer Brahmagupta (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§). The land of Bhinmal got purity after visit of Jain Tirthankar Lord Mahavira. The historical attachment of the land of Bhinmal with Shri Jain Acharya Gnanvimalsuri, Acharya Haribhadrasuri, Shri Manudasgani, Jain Acharya Udyotansuri, Acharya Siddharshigani, Pujya Gurudev, Acharya Shrimad Rajendrasuri. The Bafna clan came in 13th Vikram century in this historical and Jain Religious City Bhinmal. First person Shri Tolaji Bafna, his son Shri Dayaji and his son's grandson Shri Malaji Bafna came first time in Bhinmal from Tawari village (Osiya- Jodhpur-Rajasthan). Their family settled in the area was known as Malaji ka Chohta which was known as \\"Malniyon ka chohta\\" nowadays. Businessmen and Jain community's Holi Gair dance was started by Malaji Bafna. There were four families of Malaji, the first was Sangvanji's family which went to Dhanera and settled nearly there, second was Nimbaji's family which is Hinduji's family nowadays, third was Khelaji's family which is Deepani family and the fourth was Lakhmaji's family which Sagarji's family and Suraji's family today. All of their families except first, are in Bhinmal at present. The original house of Malaji is today owned by Dharamchandji Bafna and their sons, one of whom is a Senior Vice President at Goldman Sachs. Thereafter, Rekhaji Bafna and Jodaji Heeraji - Raghunathji Bafna's family came to Bhinmal from Nagaur District of Rajasthan. Out of them, Rekhaji's family settled near by Chhoti School (Small-School) - vegetable market area which is known as Rupaniyon ka Mohalla and Todaji's family settled in the area of Dhora-dhal. There were two family constituted from this family which are Manroopji's family and Kasroorji - Pratapji - Chnotmalji's family and which are now exist. As contemporaries of these, the family of Heemaji Bafna came Bhinmal from Rajikawas and settled in Dhora-dhal region which is veermaji's family now. All these Bafna families have been residing in Bhinmal for 500‚Äì600 years. Thereafter Ukhchandji Peraji's family came Bhinmal from Panthedi, which is part of Malaji's family of Deepani's family in origin there ancestor Shri Dhashrathji went to Panthedi. Their sons Umedmalji, Walchandji, Hirachandji & Kishormalji settled in the area of Khari Road also known as Haddiyon Ki Wa. The great-grandson of Heemaji Bafna, Rajkumar Bafna contested the 2009 Assembly elections from the Malabar Hill constituency, Maharashtra from the Indian National Congress party. The Bafnas of Bhinmal have established Bafna Research Centre & Cultural Society (Bhinmal). This society has made one three-temple complex for their worship, at Bhinmal, Rajasthan. The temple complex is named \\"Shri Bafna Wadi Jain Tirth\\". Bafnas or Bapnas of Jaisalmer Deoraj Bafna left Osian in the early 18th century and migrated to Jaisalmer. He started many businesses and then settled on the gold and silver Brocade business. He struggled until the end of his life, when his enterprising son Guman Chand joined his business and they became prosperous. Guman Chand became highly successful and wealthy in the Brocade business and came to be known as Seth Guman Chand Patwa (Patwa being the occupational title for the Brocade business). Seth Guman Chand commissioned the construction of five magnificent Havelis, for his five sons, around 1805. These are the famous Patwon Ki Havelis in Jaisalmer. Due to a variety of reasons, the five sons of Guman Chand, had to leave Jaisalmer, but all settled in different areas and prospered in business. The most famous was Guman Chand's third son, Jorawar Mal Bapna. He branched out from Brocade business into Banking and established around 300 branches across India, the Middle East and China in the early 19th century. Jorawar Mal Bapna became one of the wealthiest persons in India and also became a prominent diplomat who acted as a go between the British and the local Rajput Princes. Jorawar Mal also commissioned the construction of a Jain temple in Jaisalmer and made significant contributions to various Jain places of worship around Rajasthan and elsewhere. Jorawarl Mal also became a close friend of the famous Col. Tod, who writes about him in his \\"Annals and Antiquities of Rajputana\\". Around 1819, the house of Mewar was in deep financial trouble. Yearly raids by the Marathas had depleted the treasury and the Maharana was unable to deal with the situation. Upon the recommendation of Col Tod, Maharana Bhim Singh invited Seth Jorawarmal Bapna to Udaipur in 1819 and appointed him \\"Nagar Seth\\" and also the state treasurer. Seth Jorawar Mal Bapna stayed in Udaipur for a few years and in a short period turned around the finances of the state of Mewar and also advanced the Maharana a sum of Rs. 20 Lakhs out of which he forgave about Rs. 12 Lakhs. His work done, he set up his sons, Sultanmal Bapna and Chandan Mal Bapna in Seth Ji Ri Haveli in Udaipur and asked the Maharana to allow him to leave Udaipur to look after his far flung business interests. Seth Jorawar Mal Bapna died in Indore. Seth Sahib Jorawar Mal Bapna's son Sultan Mal Bapna had no heir, but he took over as Nagar Seth of Udaipur. His younger brother Seth Chandan Mal took over Seth Jorawar Mal Bapna's businesses outside of Udaipur and started to manage them from Indore. From all accounts the brothers did well and prospered in Udaipur, but their other businesses suffered due to volatile political situation and the gadar of 1857. After Sultan Mal Bapna's death, his brother, Seth Chandan Mal Sahib returned to Udaipur and became Nagar Seth for a short period of time. After Seth Chandan Mal Saheb's death, his son Seth Chhogmal Ji Bapna became the Nagar Seth of Udaipur. Seth Chhogmal ji Bapna continued to run the family business very ably, and also attempted to diversify away from money lending into other businesses. He continued to collect the Mewar State revenues through his agency. He was also the treasurer of the Mewar Bhil Corps. In 1892 the new Maharana Fateh Singh, used Seth Chhog Mal Bapna to teach the British Government a lesson. It was well known that since the days of Seth Jorawar Mal Bapna, the Nagar Seths of Udaipur were highly respected by the British Government and the British AGG and the British Resident. There developed a dispute between the Resident Agent and the Maharana. On the instigation of certain court officials such as Kothari Balwant Rai, the Maharana manufactured a false charge against Seth Chhog Mal Bapna and ordered the confiscation of his Jagir (the village of Parsoli), his shops, his goods and his property, essentially rendering him bankrupt. The British Resident Agent attempted to intervene, but the British Viceroy refused to intervene out of larger political considerations. Seth Chhog Mal Bapna's personal effects were auctioned off and he died while the auction was still going on. Seth Chhog Mal Bapna had three sons, who now were all on the street, overnight going from one of the richest families in India to being penniless. His second son, Siremal Bapna was a brilliant student and he continued his studies with the help of his father in law, Mehta Jagannath Singh, the Prime Minister of Mewar and successfully completed his law degree standing first in the University and winning a gold medal. Siremal Bapna became the Prime Minister of Holkar state and excelled at being an administrator. He became well known in his time and was Prime Minister of states such as Ratlam, Alwar, Bikaner and home minister of Patiala State. He was the Indian Ambassador to the League of Nations and the Indian Delegate in the Round Table Conference in London with Mahatma Gandhi. He was knighted by the British and came to be known as Sir Siremal Bapna. His honesty and generosity were legendary and he gave away all his money, to a point where when he retired as Prime Minister, he did not have his own house to live in, an example unheard of in Modern India. Sir Siremal Bapna died in Indore in 1964. There is a book written about him, by OMprakash Sharma, by the name of \\"Ek Yug Ek Purush\\". The grateful city of Indore honored Sir Siremal Bapna by erecting a statue of him in a public square. Sir Siremal had two sons, Kalyan Mal Bapna and Pratap Singh Bapna. Both were prominent bureaucrats in Holker State. After independence, Pratap Singh Bapna was awarded the IAS and he became a powerful, Chief Secretary level officer in the government of MP. His achievements in service are legendary and his name is mentioned in various Administrative Manuals of MP. After retirement, Pratap Singh Bapna continued his public service and conceived of a highly innovative Water Supply Scheme for the city of Indore, by pumping water from River Narmada to Indore, a distance of about 50 miles. He was made the Chairman of the Narmada Advisory Committee by the then Chief Minister of MP, Shyama Charan Shukla and under Pratap Singh Bapna's leadership the project went off without a hitch, on time and on schedule. This was the last successfully executed public works project in Indore until now, which completed without any corruption and on time. Pratap Singh Bapna served on the Senate of Devi Ahilya University and he had an integral role in bringing the university to Indore. He was also a founder member of the Govind Ram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science Society, being instrumental in the formation of that institution. He was the Chairmen of various trusts and charities and dies in his sleep on June 20, 1992. Pratap Singh Bapna's elder son, Rajendra Singh Bapna resides in Indore in retirement and his only son Upendra Singh Bapna manages the family affairs. Upendra Singh Bapna is married to Kalpana Bapna and they have two children, Jai Pratap Singh Bapna who is an undergraduate at University of Southern California in Los Angeles USA and Monika Bapna who is an undergraduate at Georgetown University in Washington DC. The Bapna family also worships Sachiya Mata as their Kul Devi. The family also has a Dharamshaalaa in Palitana by the name of Chand Bhavan.Most of this information is available in \\"Ek Yug Ek Purush\\", by OP Sharma. Baphnas of Tiloli, Bhilwara Tiloli also known as Tilakpuri in some official records is a small village within Asind tehsil of Bhilwara district in Mewar region of Rajasthan, India. The village is situated around 60 km north east of Bhilwara district headquarters in the foothills of Aravali range. Village‚Äôs demography consists of people of various castes predominantly Hindu with a very influential Jain community. The patriarch of Tiloli‚Äôs Baphna family, Jodhraj Baphna was one of the Mewar‚Äôs regions better established merchant. He was regarded as the ‚ÄòNagar Seth‚Äô of the Asind area. The history of Baphna clan prior to Jodhraj Baphna is rather sketchy and speculations are that few generations before Jodhraj Baphna; as Tiloli was being founded, the Baphnas may have migrated from one of the nearby regions (Tiloli is strategically at the cusp of both Mewar and Marwar regions) to fill in the traders‚Äô roles. With the patronage of Tiloli‚Äôs Thakurs and their own industriousness they rose to become the most prominent family of the area. All of the Jains in Tiloli are followers of Acharya Bhikshu‚Äôs and his successors who follow Shwetamber Terapanthi traditions. Some other prominent families are that of Chordias, Gokhrus, Naulakahs and Bumbs. Jodhraj Baphna had many sons and daughters but the record is available only for only one of his five sons. The names of his five sons in the order of their seniority are Rikhab Das, Lobh Chand, Lal Chand, Har Lal and Megh Raj. Rikhab Das inherited the mantle of taking the family business forward. There is not much information available as of today about the lives and subsequent family trees of these brothers except that of second son Lobh Chand. Lobh Chand had three sons who reached adulthood and theirs names (in order) are Suva Lal, Fateh Lal and Moti Lal. Suva Lal had two sons Devilal and Rajmal from his first wife Nani Bai, and three sons, Ambalal, Ganeshlal, Mishrilal and a daughter Sugan Bai with his second wife Dhapu Bai. Two of his older sons from Dhapu Bai namely Ambalal and Ganeshlal were adopted by his younger brother Fateh Lal who didn‚Äôt have any sons or daughters of his own. Not much information is available about Moti Lal. Rajmal Baphna married Gattu Bai and had three sons HarakChand, Chandmal and Moolchand and a daughter Jeth Kanwar. GattuBai lived to be over 95 years old and her life touched five generations of Baphnas. Jeth Kanwar was married early but her life took a tragic turn when she lost her husband at an early age. She then turned more religious and exhibited a desire to get enunciated into Jain ascetic way of life (monkhood). At an appropriate time, she took a diksha and formally became a Jain nun who in time rose to become one of the most celebrated nuns (Maharasa) of Shwetamber jain traditions. Harak Chand started his own business of cotton trading. He ultimately moved from Tiloli to another nearby town ‚ÄòBijainagar‚Äô (also known as Vijaynagar) in Ajmer district of Marwar region and lived most of his life there where he raised his own four sons and a daughter. His four sons are Madan Lal who is a retired school principal settled in Ajmer, Manohar Lal who is a retired Bank Manager (erstwhile Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.) settled in Bhilwara, Late Dr. Prem Chand who was a prominent eye surgeon of Bhilwara area and Tara Chand who is AGM of a private firm in Bengaluru area. Harak Chand‚Äôs only daughter Lad Bai (also known as Priti) is married to Sudarshan Khabya who retired as DGM of erstwhile Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. and currently lives in Jaipur. Bafnas of Khichan, Phalodi, Jodhpur Seth Ratan Singhji Bafna came to Khichan from Naya Gaon along with his 6 sons somewhere in second half of the 19th century. The six sons were 1) Sri Gulabchandji, 2) Sri Bhomrajji, 3) Sri Meghrajji, 4) Sri Magniramji, 5) Sri Bhagiramji and 6) Sri Sadar Singhji Seth Bhomrajji Bafna had 2 sons namely, Hindumalji and Virdichandji.

These fish live in fast-flowing streams in China, mainland Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. They are mainly distributed in the Mekong, upper Salween and Irrawaddy River drainages. They range from the Brahmaputra basin to the Lam River drainage in central Vietnam. They are easily distinguished from other catfishes by their strongly depressed head and body and greatly enlarged paired fins that have been modified to form an adhesive apparatus. The flattened shape of these fish and the large pectoral and pelvic fins provide essential adhesion in the fast-flowing waters they live in. Taxonomy The taxonomy of this group is currently under discussion and changes seem inevitable as the group is suspected to be non-monophyletic. Based on morphology, Oreoglanis has been divided into two species groups. According to the original description of these groups, the O. siamensis species group is distinguished by having an emarginate caudal fin, and a lower lip notched medially with an entire or weakly laciniate posterior margin, while the O. delacouri species group is distinguished by having a lunate caudal fin and a lower lip without a median notch with prominent extensions along the posterior margin. It has been suggested that only the marginal morphology of lower lip can be employed to recognize the two species groups. Species There are currently 23 recognized species in this genus: * Oreoglanis colurus Vidthayanon, Saenjundaeng & H. H. Ng, 2009 * Oreoglanis delacouri (Pellegrin, 1936) * Oreoglanis frenata H. H.

The title and concept for the film were a tribute to the Out of the Inkwell series of films that Max Fleischer had produced during the 1920s. Synopsis A live-action black janitor, played by Oscar Polk, best known for his portrayal as the servant \\"Pork\\" in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind, studies hypnotism from a book while cleaning Max Fleischer's desk at the Fleischer studio. He manages to conjure Max's pen into drawing Betty Boop. In a sequence of animation mixed with live-action, he uses his new powers to control the white animated Boop. She in turn is able to control a small dog. After waking from the spell, Betty manages to work a few more spells. Fraught with racial innuendo, one of her tricks includes turning the black man white for a split-second, after which he begins cleaning in overdrive. Before that, he was sleeping on his broom and sweeping dirt under the carpet. At the end, Betty Boop leaps into a bottle of black ink. Reception Boxoffice (March 24, 1938): \\"Mostly juvenile appeal. That popular Max Fleischer animated stunt is used here, but their results are far from effective. There is a colored porter, who picks up hypnotism from a book lying on a cartoonist's desk. He brings the pen to life with an unaided drawing of Betty Boop. Betty watches the porter tire at his work and then hypnotized him into doing the work at a speedy clip.\\" Motion Picture Exhibitor (May 1, 1938): \\"The Boops will not be distributed by Paramount next year.

Characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, Deadpool and Wolverine were playable characters that could be unlocked in the game. Players who pre- purchased a game pack received early access to the game on May 29, 2013. The game was officially launched on June 4, 2013, on Microsoft Windows. An OS X version followed in November 2014. The game was renamed to Marvel Heroes 2015 on June 4, 2014. The game was renamed Marvel Heroes 2016 in January 2016. On April 5, 2017, a console version was announced to be in production at the time for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that was branded as a free-to-play game under the title Marvel Heroes Omega. This version was released on June 30, 2017.Marvel Heroes Omega PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Launch Set for June 30 On November 15, 2017, Disney announced that it was ending its relationship with Gazillion Entertainment and that Marvel Heroes would be shut down at the end of 2017. The game and the website for Marvel Heroes were taken offline on November 27, 2017 and Gazillion was shut down.Gazillion Has Terminated its Staff and Shutting Down Marvel Heroes on Friday - PlayStation LifeStyle Gameplay Marvel Heroes allowed players to control iconic Marvel Comics heroes. Here Iron Man, Scarlet Witch and Wolverine battle an enemy robot. The gameplay was an ARPG (action role playing game). Marvel Heroes was free-to- play with micro-transactions used to fund and support the game. Players could unlock most of the things that could be bought via real money with currencies earned in game. As characters gained levels, they gained a passive stat (statistic) increase for stats that helped that particular character and gain power points, allowing the player to further define the abilities of that character. Each character had three power trees in which they could spend points. Each of the trees generally focused on a certain mechanic or play style, such as the Assault (melee), Firepower (guns), and Demolition (explosives) trees for Punisher, or the Archery (ranged), Fighting (melee), and Trick Arrows (special ranged) trees for Hawkeye. As the character gained levels, the player had access to more skills to spend points on and was able to put more points into existing skills. Each skill had a level cap, so more points could not be put in a skill until a certain level was reached. Each skill had a maximum of 20 power points and a maximum of 50 points could be reached from gear bonuses. Several updates after launch rebalanced many of the game's systems. Story Mode could be used to fully level any hero, and defensive stats were consolidated and simplified. Players could obtain any playable character using the 'Eternity Splinter' system. These timed drops could be used as currency with Adam Warlock so that players could obtain the heroes they wanted to play (faster than the previous random hero drop system) without spending money. In addition, the splinters could be used to get a random Cosmic item, to upgrade the character's Ultimate ability, or to purchase a Team-Up companion. The relaunched Marvel Heroes 2015 version of the game was also the first ARPG to feature a raid. In raid encounters, 10 grouped players attacked a series of unique bosses. Each encounter featured a timer and a death limit. Raid encounters allowed players to take on, for example, Surtur and his minions in Muspelheim, and also Red Onslaught in Genosha. Each location in the game was composed of several \\"instances\\" at any one time. This allowed the game to run on one huge virtual server, rather than the game being split into different servers. Many missions took place within smaller instances that would reset if the player left and returned. Plot Doctor Doom obtains the Cosmic Cube, and he uses it to incinerate the Watcher. After responding to a theft at Queens, the player travels to the Raft, where Madame Hydra and HYDRA have facilitated a breakout, freeing several superpowered inmates. The player manages to reactivate the security system, lock down the cell blocks, and recapture Green Goblin and Living Laser; however, many villains escape. After the breakout, Madame Hydra meets with Doctor Doom, declaring it a success. Doctor Doom gives Madame Hydra a chip with the ability to exploit a flaw in Tony Stark's security system, after which their transaction ends. After the breakout, Daredevil manages to recapture Rhino in Hell's Kitchen, while the player recaptures Shocker in an abandoned subway. Doctor Octopus tries to steal the Tablet of Life and Time from the Blood Rose nightclub, but he is stopped and recaptured by the player. The heroes temporarily gain possession of the tablet; however, Hood appears through a portal and steals it. The player then travels to Industry City, combating forces from both Advanced Idea Mechanics and Kingpin's Maggia while hunting the Hood. Eventually, Hood is defeated and taken into custody, only to reveal that he has already sold the Tablet to the Hand. The heroes travel to Madripoor, the Hand's base of operations, and soon discover that HYDRA is also attacking the Hand in an attempt to take the Tablet for themselves. The heroes subdue Madame Viper, culling the HYDRA invasion, and then defeat the Hand's leader, Gorgon and his top assassin, Elektra, reclaiming the tablet. However, upon returning to New York, Kingpin uses his legal connections to force the heroes to return the Tablet to him. Knowing that the Tablet is too powerful to be left in the Kingpin's hands, the heroes work to expose his involvement in illegally smuggling Mutant Growth Hormone into the city. With the help of detective Jean DeWolff, the heroes expose the Kingpin and defeat him, finally securing the Tablet. However, shortly afterwards, the Tablet is again stolen by professional thief Ghost, who delivers it to Doctor Doom. The heroes are then summoned to the X Mansion by Professor Charles Xavier, who explains that anti-mutant terrorists called the Purifiers have launched a genocidal attack on Mutant Town. The heroes rush to Mutant Town to stop the killings, fighting not only the Purifiers, but also the Reavers, a group of psychotic cyborg mercenaries led by Lady Deathstrike, who has allied herself with the Purifiers due to her grudge against the mutant Wolverine. The heroes fight the Purifiers back to their base in an abandoned trainyard, where they discover that the Purifiers have taken advantage of the Juggernaut's hatred of Xavier in order to trick him into defending their base. The heroes subdue Juggernaut and force the Purifiers to retreat from Mutant Town. Upon returning to the X Mansion, they are contacted by Nick Fury, who reveals that the Purifiers' leader, Reverend William Stryker, is colluding with AIM in order to create an anti- mutant superweapon. The heroes rush to the Purifier main base, Fort Stryker, in order to destroy the superweapon and apprehend Stryker. However, when they arrive, they find that Stryker is already under attack by Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in retaliation for their attack on Mutant Town. Magneto threatens to kill Stryker, but the heroes refuse to let this happen and defeat him. As Stryker is arrested, the heroes discover that he has sold genomes from the mutants his forces captured to Mr. Sinister for an unknown purpose. The heroes track Sinister to the Savage Land, which is under attack by not only Sinister's Mutate army, but also hostile tribesmen under the control of the mutant Sauron and a Brood invasion force. The heroes defeat Sinister, but he manages to escape and deliver a clone of Lucas Bishop to Doctor Doom. The heroes are then called to the SHIELD Helicarrier, where Nick Fury takes them with ending the threats of AIM and HYDRA. After defeating both MODOK and the Mandarin, Doctor Doom steals one of the Mandarin's rings and reveals his master plan. It was he who originally orchestrated HYDRA's attack on the Raft which led to the mass breakout of super-villains, as well as commissioned Mr Sinister to gather Mutant DNA through the Purifiers to create a clone of Bishop. The purpose of the clone is to create a conduit with which Doom can control the Cosmic Cube, while the super-villain breakout was intended to keep the heroes occupied while he finalizes his plan. Several supervillains try to prevent the heroes from interfering with Doctor Doom's use of the Cosmic Cube. The villains fail, and the heroes are able to thwart Doom's attempt to gain omnipotence. After stopping Doctor Doom, players may travel across the Bifrost Bridge to Asgard, where Loki has summoned hordes of Dark Elves, Frost Giants, and other monsters in an attempt to seize Asgard's throne while Odin slumbers. The heroes defeat Loki's minions before confronting Loki himself in Odin's throne room where he reveals that he has stolen the power of Doom's Cosmic Cube. Eventually, the heroes defeat him. Before judgement can be passed on Loki, the heroes learn that the dark god Surtur has reforged the Twilight Sword. Surtur plans to use the chaos caused by Loki in order to launch his own invasion of Asgard. The heroes defeat Surtur and his minions in his home dimension of Muspelheim. Odin soon reawakens, enraged at Loki's crimes. Loki claims that he simply wanted to be acknowledged as a hero. As a punishment, Odin decides to trap Loki in an endless time loop covering the events of the game, giving him the opportunity to become a hero. Shortly after Surtur's defeat, Professor X suddenly goes missing. While investigating his disappearance, the heroes discover that Red Skull has merged with Onslaught, becoming Red Onslaught. Onslaught has launched a genocidal campaign against the sovereign mutant nation of Genosha. In order to combat Red Onslaught, the heroes are forced to enlist the aid of supervillains through the Thunderbolts program, including Magneto and Green Goblin. The heroes and super-villains are able to defeat Red Onslaught and save Genosha, after which the Red Skull is imprisoned and Onslaught is destroyed. Sometime later, after defeating Ultron's invasion of Manhattan, the heroes are confronted by Doctor Doom. Doom explains that he had been captured by Thanos following his initial defeat. He then reveals that the Skrulls are planning a massive invasion of Earth. The heroes are summoned by Nick Fury to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, only to discover that the entire base has been infiltrated by Skrulls. After defeating the Skrulls, the heroes meet with S.W.O.R.D., who escort them to the real Nick Fury's base in an abandoned toolshed in Madripoor. From there, the heroes combat Skrull activity throughout the world until discovering that the leader of the invasion, Kl'rt the Super-Skrull, has established his primary base in Madripoor's Hightown. The heroes confront Super-Skrull and defeat him. As he is taken into custody, his ship manages to escape. Thereupon, Super-Skrull exclaims that the heroes should be thankful because its cargo. Sure enough, the ships is revealed to be carrying an Infinity Gem, catching the attention of Thanos. Characters Marvel Heroes features more than 100 characters from the Marvel Universe. Players can choose from a large and diverse cast of superheroes and villains. Each playable character is a different archetype, either Melee or Ranged with each having unique sets of attributes and talent trees. At the game's release, there were 21 playable characters. As of July 2017, there were 63 playable characters. These characters range from well-known and iconic such as Iron Man and Spider-Man to lesser-known and obscure ones such as Squirrel Girl. Several villains, such as Loki and Venom, also appear as playable characters. Every player can play all heroes up to level 10, with the exception of the hero most recently added to the game. Players may continue to level up the heroes of their choice by spending an in-game currency called Eternity Splinters or by purchasing them with real money via the game's store. Once a hero is unlocked, they may reach a maximum level of 60, at which point they may access all of the game's content. Players can also unlock Team-Up characters, a concept based on the Marvel Team-Up comic book series. While these characters are not playable, they may be summoned to act as sidekicks or bodyguards, providing assistance and boosting the playable character. Team-Ups can be acquired using Eternity Splinters or via the game's store. Costumes to change the character's appearance can be acquired in the game's web store, as drops from enemies, or through crafting. Four costumes (consisting of Iron Man 3-inspired Iron Man armor, a Weapon X outfit for Wolverine, Hulk's future form Maestro, and Spider-Man's black symbiote costume) are exclusive to players who purchased the limited edition character Ultimate Pack for nearly USD$200, under Gazillion's Founder's Program. An \\"enhanced costume\\" is an iteration of a playable character, but it is based on a completely different (though usually related) character. For example, Beta Ray Bill is an enhanced costume for Thor; although he has his own unique appearance and voice work, he has the same exact powers, talents and abilities as Thor. On September 9, 2016, the game achieved a Guinness World Record for having the most superhero costumes from the comics in a game. Enhanced costumes may also be an alternate version of a character, in which case they still require additional voice-over work. Examples include Thing's Angir, Breaker of Souls appearance from the Fear Itself storyline and Gambit's appearance as the Horseman of Death. As of July 1, 2017, the Fantastic Four characters (Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, Thing, and Silver Surfer) and all FF-related alternate costumes for various other characters are no longer available to purchase in the shop. After the announcement of Disney's end contract with Gazillion on November 15, 2017, all character packs which contains the pack exclusive costumes are removed from the online shop but could have been purchased in-game with any player-remaining currencies. Development Cryptic Studios Marvel Heroes was originally known as Marvel Universe Online and later Marvel Universe. Marvel Universe Online was the original working title of Champions Online. The massively-multiplayer online (MMO) game was developed by Cryptic Studios and was to be published by Microsoft Game Studios for Microsoft Windows using a license from Marvel. The project was changed on February 11, 2008 due to what a Microsoft spokesperson referred to as \\"an inability to compete\\" with the current MMO marketplace. Less than a week later, Cryptic Studios announced that development would continue using a new intellectual property license related to Champions, a superhero role playing game. Confirmation of the project's cancellation arrived on February 11, 2008, although rumors of the possible cancellation had existed since November of the previous year. Shane Kim, the head of Microsoft Games Studios, stated in an interview that the cancellation was primarily due to the competitive market for subscription-based MMOs, and that while one current MMO was successful, \\"everything else wouldn't meet our level or definition of commercial success\\". Gazillion Entertainment On March 17, 2009, it was revealed that Gazillion Entertainment had signed an exclusive 10-year deal to develop Marvel Entertainment games, of which Marvel Universe is one. The first title released was Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, which targets younger audiences. Marvel Universe was eventually renamed Marvel Heroes and started being developed as a massively multiplayer online-action role-playing game rather than a massively multiplayer online role-playing game like Cryptic's canceled version of Marvel Universe had been. Gazillion Entertainment has chosen to use Epic Games's Unreal Engine 3, instead of the Unity 3D engine used for Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, with studio director Jeff Lind stating \\"We love Unreal Engine 3's streaming system. It's made our entire technical approach possible and is easy to work with. We also love the flexibility we get from the actor components, which have empowered us to make all kinds of customizations without sacrificing the built-in features of the engine.\\" During a live stream session David Brevik, the President/CEO of Gazillion, further detailed the game's engine. He noted that while Unreal Engine 3 powers the game's front end visuals and audio, much of the components that make a massively multiplayer game were written using entirely new code that interfaced with Unreal Engine 3. During development, Gazillion used an internal team of 75 people working for three and a half years, with others assisting with support and marketing. Gazillion has raised more than $80 million to fund the game's development, but it hasn't disclosed exactly how much was spent. In contrast to other MMO developers, Gazillion always planned to use the free-to-play model. Closure David Brevik left Gazillion on January 6, 2016, citing he was pursuing other opportunities. CEO Dave Dohrmann took over as President of Gazillion Entertainment. On October 20, 2017, missed updates became apparent to players when promised releases didn't make the deadline. An annual Halloween event didn't occur during 2017, and a tie-in to the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe movie \\"Thor: Ragnarok\\" wasn't made, both of which were promised semi-annual content. Employees, including designers and community representatives, were stepping down as the CEO faced allegations of harassment from co-workers and associates. On November 15, 2017, Disney announced that it was ending its relationship with Gazillion Entertainment and that Marvel Heroes games would be shut down at the end of the 2017. Around the same day of Disney's announcement concerning Gazillion, Marvel Heroes Omega was removed from the PlayStation Network, but the game server was still playable for those who already downloaded the game from the PSN's online store earlier. On November 23, it was revealed that Marvel Heroes would instead shut down a month earlier than promised and that all employees of Gazillion have been fired without pay before Thanksgiving, including the termination of all benefits, medical and earned time off. This was due to Gazillion being liquidated by its debtors after Disney pulled their license. On November 27, 2017, the game servers and website were taken offline shortly after 11 A.M. Pacific Time. Due to the closure announcement of Marvel Heroes, many players who purchased the game's purchasable content demanded refunds.

It is one of Melbourne's larger concert venues and has hosted a variety of local and international acts over many years. History The site began its sporting history as the West Melbourne Stadium (shortened to The Stadium) in 1913, developed by R.L.Baker, the Sydney boxing promoter, opening just in time for the Mehegan-Wells fight of 3 November 1913. In 1915 it came under the control of John Wren (chairman) and Dick Lean (general manager) of Stadiums Limited as a multi-function venue for boxing and pro wrestling. It quickly became known to locals as \\"the House of Stoush\\", as over the years it has featured some of the greatest names in Australian boxing including Lionel Rose, Johnny Famechon, Anthony Mundine, Lester Ellis and Barry Michael. Professional wrestling also featured regularly, as did Roller Derby, ballroom dancing, cultural and religious gatherings and the first Indoor Tennis Exhibition featuring John McEnroe. It was used by the Painters and Dockers as a meeting place. During the Great Depression, unemployed men seeking work would gather at Festival Hall to be picked for dock work. The Stadium was destroyed by fire in 1955 but was rebuilt in time for the 1956 Olympics, where it was used for boxing, basketball and gymnastics events.1956 Summer Olympics official report. p. 42. Dick Lean Jnr (son of the original general manager, Dick Lean) joined Stadiums in 1960 and set about successful promotion of major music acts of all genres from both the UK and US, increasing the use of the venue significantly. The Stadium was renamed Festival Hall in the early 1960s to reflect its increasing use as Melbourne's largest live entertainment venue at the time. Lean booked the Beatles to play Australia in 1964. Lean continued to promote and bring to Australia many of the major headline acts during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.http://www.classicbands.com/JohnnyChesterInterview.html The Living End's Live at Festival Hall was filmed there on 19 May 2006. On 30 January 2008, Rage Against the Machine performed at the venue in what was only their second headline show outside the United States since their breakup in September 2000. Festival Hall's versatile set-up has been used for many events including a weekly conversion into a television studio for the production of The Price is Right for the Seven Network. The venue has also been used for black tie dinners, product launches, conferences, motivation sessions, art exhibitions, large Christmas parties, religious and cultural events, and even as an examination venue for Swinburne University. In January 2018, Stadiums Australia proposed that the site become an air of apartment towers, while retaining the front facade, with the intention of selling the project, saying it could no longer compete with other newer venues. A subsequent nomination to the State heritage body Heritage Victoria was successful, with the site gaining permanent heritage protection in November 2018. On 29 November 2019, Juice Wrld performed at the venue in what would become his final live show before his death on 8 December 2019. Configurations Festival Hall is used for seated events of up to 4,586 including the main floor or for up to 5,445 if the floor is used for standing, sight lines permitting. The addition of floor-to-ceiling curtains around the main floor and between the side sections allows seating for up to 1,741 people or 2,600 standing on the main floor. The main floor has an area of 1,288 m2, providing room for dining for up to 1,000 seated guests plus dance floor, and the stage offers a further 160 m2 of elevated space.

Optimal stopping problems can be found in areas of statistics, economics, and mathematical finance (related to the pricing of American options). A key example of an optimal stopping problem is the secretary problem. Optimal stopping problems can often be written in the form of a Bellman equation, and are therefore often solved using dynamic programming. Definition Discrete time case Stopping rule problems are associated with two objects: #A sequence of random variables X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots, whose joint distribution is something assumed to be known #A sequence of 'reward' functions (y_i)_{i\\\\ge 1} which depend on the observed values of the random variables in 1: #:y_i=y_i (x_1, \\\\ldots ,x_i) Given those objects, the problem is as follows: * You are observing the sequence of random variables, and at each step i, you can choose to either stop observing or continue * If you stop observing at step i, you will receive reward y_i * You want to choose a stopping rule to maximize your expected reward (or equivalently, minimize your expected loss) Continuous time case Consider a gain processes G=(G_t)_{t\\\\ge 0} defined on a filtered probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},(\\\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\\\ge 0},\\\\mathbb{P}) and assume that G is adapted to the filtration. The optimal stopping problem is to find the stopping time \\\\tau^* which maximizes the expected gain : V_t^T = \\\\mathbb{E} G_{\\\\tau^*} = \\\\sup_{t\\\\le \\\\tau \\\\le T} \\\\mathbb{E} G_\\\\tau where V_t^T is called the value function. Here T can take value \\\\infty. A more specific formulation is as follows. We consider an adapted strong Markov process X = (X_t)_{t\\\\ge 0} defined on a filtered probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},(\\\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\\\ge 0},\\\\mathbb{P}_x) where \\\\mathbb{P}_x denotes the probability measure where the stochastic process starts at x. Given continuous functions M,L, and K, the optimal stopping problem is : V(x) = \\\\sup_{0\\\\le \\\\tau \\\\le T} \\\\mathbb{E}_x \\\\left( M(X_\\\\tau) + \\\\int_0^\\\\tau L(X_t) dt + \\\\sup_{0\\\\le t\\\\le\\\\tau} K(X_t) \\\\right). This is sometimes called the MLS (which stand for Mayer, Lagrange, and supremum, respectively) formulation. Solution methods There are generally two approaches to solving optimal stopping problems. When the underlying process (or the gain process) is described by its unconditional finite-dimensional distributions, the appropriate solution technique is the martingale approach, so called because it uses martingale theory, the most important concept being the Snell envelope. In the discrete time case, if the planning horizon T is finite, the problem can also be easily solved by dynamic programming. When the underlying process is determined by a family of (conditional) transition functions leading to a Markov family of transition probabilities, powerful analytical tools provided by the theory of Markov processes can often be utilized and this approach is referred to as the Markov method. The solution is usually obtained by solving the associated free-boundary problems (Stefan problems). A jump diffusion result Let Y_t be a L√©vy diffusion in \\\\mathbb{R}^k given by the SDE : dY_t = b(Y_t) dt + \\\\sigma (Y_t) dB_t + \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^k} \\\\gamma (Y_{t-},z)\\\\bar{N}(dt,dz),\\\\quad Y_0 = y where B is an m-dimensional Brownian motion, \\\\bar{N} is an l -dimensional compensated Poisson random measure, b:\\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^k , \\\\sigma:\\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{k\\\\times m} , and \\\\gamma:\\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^k \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{k\\\\times l} are given functions such that a unique solution (Y_t) exists. Let \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^k be an open set (the solvency region) and : \\\\tau_\\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{ t>0: Y_t otin \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\\\\\} be the bankruptcy time. The optimal stopping problem is: :V(y) = \\\\sup_{\\\\tau \\\\le \\\\tau_\\\\mathcal{S}} J^\\\\tau (y) = \\\\sup_{\\\\tau \\\\le \\\\tau_\\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathbb{E}_y \\\\left[ M(Y_\\\\tau) + \\\\int_0^\\\\tau L(Y_t) dt \\\\right]. It turns out that under some regularity conditions, the following verification theorem holds: If a function \\\\phi:\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{S}}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} satisfies * \\\\phi \\\\in C(\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{S}}) \\\\cap C^1(\\\\mathcal{S}) \\\\cap C^2(\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\setminus \\\\partial D) where the continuation region is D = \\\\\\\\{y\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}: \\\\phi(y) > M(y) \\\\\\\\} , * \\\\phi \\\\ge M on \\\\mathcal{S} , and * \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\phi + L \\\\le 0 on \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\setminus \\\\partial D , where \\\\mathcal{A} is the infinitesimal generator of (Y_t) then \\\\phi(y) \\\\ge V(y) for all y\\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{S}} . Moreover, if * \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\phi + L = 0 on D Then \\\\phi(y) = V(y) for all y\\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{S}} and \\\\tau^* = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{ t>0: Y_t otin D\\\\\\\\} is an optimal stopping time. These conditions can also be written is a more compact form (the integro-variational inequality): * \\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\phi + L, M-\\\\phi \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 0 on \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\setminus \\\\partial D. Examples  Coin tossing  (Example where \\\\mathbb{E}(y_i) converges) You have a fair coin and are repeatedly tossing it. Each time, before it is tossed, you can choose to stop tossing it and get paid (in dollars, say) the average number of heads observed. You wish to maximise the amount you get paid by choosing a stopping rule. If Xi (for i ‚â• 1) forms a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with Bernoulli distribution : \\\\text{Bern}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right), and if : y_i = \\\\frac 1 i \\\\sum_{k=1}^{i} X_k then the sequences (X_i)_{i\\\\geq 1}, and (y_i)_{i\\\\geq 1} are the objects associated with this problem.  House selling  (Example where \\\\mathbb{E}(y_i) does not necessarily converge) You have a house and wish to sell it. Each day you are offered X_n for your house, and pay k to continue advertising it. If you sell your house on day n, you will earn y_n, where y_n = (X_n - nk). You wish to maximise the amount you earn by choosing a stopping rule. In this example, the sequence (X_i) is the sequence of offers for your house, and the sequence of reward functions is how much you will earn.  Secretary problem  (Example where (X_i) is a finite sequence) You are observing a sequence of objects which can be ranked from best to worst. You wish to choose a stopping rule which maximises your chance of picking the best object. Here, if R_1, \\\\ldots, R_n (n is some large number) are the ranks of the objects, and y_i is the chance you pick the best object if you stop intentionally rejecting objects at step i, then (R_i) and (y_i) are the sequences associated with this problem. This problem was solved in the early 1960s by several people. An elegant solution to the secretary problem and several modifications of this problem is provided by the more recent odds algorithm of optimal stopping (Bruss algorithm).  Search theory  Economists have studied a number of optimal stopping problems similar to the 'secretary problem', and typically call this type of analysis 'search theory'. Search theory has especially focused on a worker's search for a high-wage job, or a consumer's search for a low-priced good.  Parking problem  A special example of an application of search theory is the task of optimal selection of parking space by a driver going to the opera (theater, shopping, etc.). Approaching the destination, the driver goes down the street along which there are parking spaces ‚Äì usually, only some places in the parking lot are free. The goal is clearly visible, so the distance from the target is easily assessed. The driver's task is to choose a free parking space as close to the destination as possible without turning around so that the distance from this place to the destination is the shortest.  Option trading  In the trading of options on financial markets, the holder of an American option is allowed to exercise the right to buy (or sell) the underlying asset at a predetermined price at any time before or at the expiry date. Therefore, the valuation of American options is essentially an optimal stopping problem. Consider a classical Black-Scholes set-up and let r be the risk-free interest rate and \\\\delta and \\\\sigma be the dividend rate and volatility of the stock. The stock price S follows geometric Brownian motion : S_t = S_0 \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left(r - \\\\delta - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2}\\\\right) t + \\\\sigma B_t \\\\right\\\\\\\\} under the risk-neutral measure. When the option is perpetual, the optimal stopping problem is : V(x) = \\\\sup_{\\\\tau} \\\\mathbb{E}_x \\\\left[ e^{-r\\\\tau} g(S_\\\\tau) \\\\right] where the payoff function is g(x) = (x-K)^+ for a call option and g(x) = (K-x)^+ for a put option. The variational inequality is : \\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 x^2 V(x) + (r-\\\\delta) x V'(x) - rV(x), g(x) - V(x) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 0 for all x \\\\in (0,\\\\infty)\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\} where b is the exercise boundary. The solution is known to be * (Perpetual call) V(x) = \\\\begin{cases} (b-K)(x/b)^\\\\gamma & x\\\\in(0,b) \\\\\\\\\\\\ x-K & x\\\\in[b,\\\\infty) \\\\end{cases} where \\\\gamma = (\\\\sqrt{ u^2 + 2r} - u) / \\\\sigma and u = (r-\\\\delta)/\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma / 2, \\\\quad b = \\\\gamma K / (\\\\gamma - 1). * (Perpetual put) V(x) = \\\\begin{cases} K - x & x\\\\in(0,c] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(K-c)(x/c)^\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma} & x\\\\in(c,\\\\infty) \\\\end{cases} where \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma} = -(\\\\sqrt{ u^2 + 2r} + u) / \\\\sigma and u = (r-\\\\delta)/\\\\sigma - \\\\sigma / 2, \\\\quad c = \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma} K / (\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma} - 1). On the other hand, when the expiry date is finite, the problem is associated with a 2-dimensional free-boundary problem with no known closed- form solution. Various numerical methods can, however, be used. See Black‚ÄìScholes model#American options for various valuation methods here, as well as Fugit for a discrete, tree based, calculation of the optimal time to exercise.

Originally developed by Aram Ltd as the AS88 as a support weapon for infantry, the patent rights were purchased and modified by Vektor, which later became a division of Denel Ltd. Further enhancements included rate of fire upgrade and the addition of a ballistics computer, with final qualification testing taking place in 1998, and operational testing in 2002. The Y3 was launched during the 2003 United Kingdom Defence Systems & Equipment (DSEi) International Exhibition. Design details Operating mechanism and features The launcher fires 40x53mm high velocity, medium trajectory calibre grenades at a rate of 360 to 425 rounds per minute. Operating via the long-recoil principle, the Y3 fires from an open breech (minimising the opportunity for grenade cook- off within the magazine) when in counter-recoil. Whilst all moving assemblies are buffered to reduce recoil and vibration, the unit lacks a conventional feed-lever mechanism. The feed direction and ammunition box mountings may be changed in-field without additional components, and are also able to be dual- loaded: enabling selection of two different types of 40mm rounds on the fly. It can be mounted on vehicles or used with a ground-mount tripod. Manned by a team of three, the AGL is normally fired using a manual trigger; on a vehicle, this can be replaced with a firing solenoid. Due to its low recoil force and lightweight breech block, can be used on light-weight aircraft.  Functional description  The belt-linked grenades are fed from the magazine into position above the barrel. There the grenade is extracted from the belt and pushed downwards, to align with the barrel. Empty cartridge cases are ejected through an opening at the bottom of the AGL  Electronic sight  Due to the parabolic trajectory path of the 40mm grenades used, it is possible to use the Y3 against a target that is out of the user's direct sight (such as over cover or obstacles, or around corners; up to an elevation of 60 degrees). This indirect fire mode is, however, only realistically feasible during combat situations if the coordinates of its target are already known (for instance, calculated from a forward observation post); as otherwise the unit acts as a mortar (albeit with a relatively smaller lethal radius). The linked electronic ballistic computer [known as the 'LobSight'] can also be used to reinforce this 'electronic' sight line. By calculating the position, direction, and the angle required for the AGL to hit a given target, the LobSight greatly assists aim modification: providing optimum grenade impact and ammunition usage. If this data is unknown, the AGL may still be used to lay down suppressive fire against possible enemy locations but, again, at a reduced accuracy unless a laser sight or aiming scope is added.  Ammunition  The 40mm Y3 AGL can fire a wide range of \\"high velocity\\" 40√ó53mm 40mm grenades linked in belts of 20 or 32.ÎÇ®ÏïÑÍ≥µÏÇ∞ 40mm ÏûêÎèôÏú†ÌÉÑÎ∞úÏÇ¨Í∏∞ Vektor Y3 AGL.

It is the third indigenous firearm developed in South Korea by the Agency for Defense Development, following the Daewoo Precision Industries K1 submachine gun and Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle. It is manufactured by Daewoo Precision Industries, current S&T; Motiv. The K3 is capable of firing both 5.56√ó45mm NATO and Remington rounds like the K2 assault rifle. The K3 light machine gun entered service since 1989, replacing M60 machine gun from frontline use. Description A South Korean soldier with a Daewoo K3 in March 2012 IDEX 2017 The K3 is a light machine gun resembling the FN Minimi and uses a standard 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge. Its greatest advantage is that it is lighter than the M60 and can interchange cartridges with both the K1A and K2. The feed can come from either a 30-round box magazine or a 200-round disintegrating M27 ammunition belt. It can be used with a bipod for the Squad Automatic role, and fitted with a tripod for sustained fire support. The rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage, and the foresight can be adjusted for elevation for zeroing. The barrel has a built-in carry handle for ease of changing the barrel. The gun is gas operated, with a rotating bolt. The weapon system was not designed for customization, due to the fact that most soldiers of the South Korean military will not see extended use of their weapons. By 2015, ROK forces were looking to obtain a new LMG, as the K3 was suffering from age and reliability issues. S&T; Motiv is attempting to win the contract by modernizing the K3 with a side-folding adjustable stock, an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail on feed cover, detachable side and underside rails, a carbon fiber heat shield over barrel, an improved muzzle brake/flash hider, folding iron sights, and an upgraded feed system. The same improvements would also be applied to the shorter \\"Para\\" version.ADEX 2015 - SAdefensejournal.com, 5 August 2016 As of 2019, it has not been adopted for general service, but it was has been suggested that special forces units could use it. K15 In late 2018, the S&T; Motiv \\"Next-Generation LMG\\" was standardized as the K15, a heavily upgraded version of the K3 planned for fielding to the ROK Army by 2020. It has an adjustable buttstock and redesigned pistol grip/trigger group component for improved ergonomics, and internal parts are reconfigured and manufactured with closer tolerances for better reliability. Unlike the K3, it uses a push button to hold and release the barrel with three upper positioning lugs to ensure the barrel sits on a correct position when reattached. The feed cover and handguard have rails integrally attached, rather than needing an adapter to have them installed like the K3; this helps it to utilize a day/night fire control system that uses a thermal sight, laser rangefinder and ballistic computer. Each leg of the bipod operates independently to make for a more sturdy firing platform and the front sight is collapsible. The K15 is still fed from a 200-round plastic container and also can accept a STANAG magazine in emergency situations. Although the new design is more reliable, it is heavier at without the FCS and with the FCS.THE ROK ARMY‚ÄôS NEXT SQUAD AUTOMATIC WEAPON THE K15 LMG. Small Arms Defense Journal. 19 December 2019. Foreign sales One example of the K3 was purchased by South Africa in 2006, and two examples were purchased by Thailand in the same year. A controversy broke out 2007 in the Philippines when the country's Armed Forces initially selected the FN Minimi rather than picking the K3 or the 5.56 mm Ultimax from Singapore. The AFP's Modernization Program was attacked for showing favoritism towards a Western firearms company over Asian arms manufacturers. Ultimately, 6,540 K3s were acquired by the Philippine Army for their SAW requirement. 5,883 units were first shown in public on February 18, 2008, together with 603 newly delivered Kia KM-450 trucks.

Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of Indo-Iranian origin. In a hymn of the Avesta (incorporated by Ferdowsi, with due acknowledgement, in the Shahnameh), Tishtrya is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon Apaosha. According to the myth, in the form of a pure white horse the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The yazata proceeded to call upon the Creator Ahura Mazda, who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition. In the Zoroastrian religious calendar, the 13th day of the month and the 4th month of the year are dedicated to Tishtrya/Tir, and hence named after the entity. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits its month names from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 4th month is likewise named Tir. During the Achaemenid period, Tishtrya was conflated with Semitic Nabu-*Tiri, and thus came to be associated with the Dog Star, Sirius. The Tiregan festival, previously associated with *Tiri (a reconstructed name), was likewise transferred to Tishtrya. During the Hellenic period, Tishtrya came to be associated with Pythian Apollo, patron of Delphi, and thus a divinity of oracles. References  * Hinnells, John R. (1997).

The mother goddess Sachiya (also spelled as Sachayay Mata and Sachchiyay Mata, ) is worshipped there by Maid Kshatriya Swarnakar (Kulthiya families), Marwadi, Oswal, Agarwal, Maheshwari, Karnawat, and Mahecha (Maru Kansara Soni from Beraja-Kutch). Panwar Rajputs/Parmar Rajputs, Lakhesars Kumawat (Kumhar sub-caste), Oswal, Charans, Jains, Pareek Brahmins, and many other castes living in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and North India. The temple was built by the Parmar King Upendre for his Kuldevi in the 9th to 10th century CE. Maa Jagat Bhawani Shri Sachchiyay Mataji was historically called Shri Osiya Mataji. An archaeological team found many samples, statues, and paintings there. Depictions included the ancient deity of Harihar (half Shiva and half Vishnu), Vasudeva with baby Krishna on his head, Krishna fighting with a horse, the killing of Putna, Kalidaman, Govardhan dharan, and butter stealing along with images of Balram which seem to represent him as the incarnation of Seshnaga. Osiya was once a large town. Telivada was situated away in Tinvari village. Pandit ji ki Dhani (now the small village of Pandit pur) is away. A further away is Kshatripura. At is Lohavat, home of iron smiths. 108 Jain temples were found in Osiya. Osiya is situated about from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. It is connected by roads and trains with Jodhpur and Pokharan. Mythology Goddess Sachi was a daughter of the Asura king Pauloma. The benevolent King Pauloma ruled a great kingdom, sponsoring many Brahmins (for example, Shukracharya). Vrut (Vritra) was the chief of Pauloma's army, and he wanted to marry Sachi. However, Sachi considered this proposal insulting, as she did not want to marry a servant of her father. Knowing the thoughts of Sachi, Vrut left the service of Pauloma and worshipped Lord Shiva, a common god of the Asuras. Shiva gave Vrut his blessings, and the boon that he could not be killed by any known weapons. Vrut, with his magic, assembled a great army, and with this virtue of immortality, he set out to win the Aryan lands and carve out a kingdom greater than Pauloma's. It was the duty of Indra, the king of the gods, to defend the kingdom from Vrut. Knowing that Vrut had the blessing of immortality, Indra approached Sage Dadhichi, for Dadhichi had bones tougher than any known weapon. Dadhichi gave his bones to Indra, by performing a self-sacrifice, and Indra prepared a weapon, known as Vajra, from these bones. (The highest award of bravery in India, the Param Vir Chakra, bears the symbol of Vajra.) Since bones had never before been used for a weapon, this defied the condition of immortality for Vrut. The armies met on the battlefield, but Indra proposed that instead of allowing the full forces to fight, resulting in huge carnage, he and Vrut alone should fight; the victor would take over the other's army and would marry Sachi. Indra emerged from this challenge victorious. The foundation day of Oswals According to Muni Sri Gyan Sunderji, the foundation day of Oswals falls on the fourteenth day of Krishna Paksha in the month of Shravan. All Jain-Oswals celebrate this with sacrifice, prayers, and meditation. The Kuldevi of Oswals Maa Jagat Bhawani Shri Sachchiyay Mataji also called Shri Osiya Mataji is Kuldevi of Oswals. A large temple of Chamunda Mata was built in Upkeshpur, presently known as Osiya. The temple was known for Chamatkars and attracted many worshippers. During Navratri, buffaloes were butchered and people gave offerings of buffalo flesh to please Chamunda Mata. Jain Acharya Shri Ratna Prabh Suri stopped this practice of animal killing. Because of this the goddess became angry and created pain in the eyes of the Acharya. He was not sways but continued under this the suffering, and Chamunda Mata became ashamed and asked forgiveness from the Acharya. History A stone inscription, at the Jain temple of Osian gives a different story about the name of Sachiya Mata.www.bafnawadi.com/Sachchiya.htm According to this story, a Jain monk, Acharya Shrimad Vijay Ratnaprabhasuriji Maharaj Sahib, visited Osian town to perform the ceremony known as Anjan Salakha, at the newly created temple of God Mahaveer, around 43 CE. The temple of Mahavir had been built by Uhad, who was a minister of King Upaldeo; at that time, Osian was known as Upkeshpur. A temple of Jagat Bhavani (Great Goddess) Chamunda Mata was in the town of Upkeshpur. To receive the grace of the goddess, sacrifices of male buffaloes used to be made in the temple, during the festival of Navratri. When the Jain monk Vijay Ratnaprabhasuriji Maharaj learned about this practice, he felt deep sympathy for the animals sacrificed. Using his influence on the minister and king, he convinced them to ban this practice. A temple in Katraj (Pune) is dedicated to Sachchiya Mata (Osiya Mata), close to the Swetamber Jain temple of Katraj. In her temple, Sachiya Mata-Ji is worshipped with lapsi (an Indian sweet dish), saffron, sandalwood, and incense.

While Hammer House focuses on amateur wrestling they do have cross training deals with notable fighters and camps such as Matt Serra, Pat Miletich and Xtreme Couture Mixed Martial Arts. Founded by former UFC champion Mark Coleman, Team Hammer House has attracted such mixed martial arts fighters as Kevin Randleman and Phil Baroni. UFC dominance Coleman made his professional MMA debut at UFC 10. With his solid wrestling background and physical power he won six fights in a row. He beat fighters including Don Frye, Gary Goodridge and Dan Severn, en route to winning the UFC 10 and UFC 11 tournaments and the first ever UFC Heavyweight title. Randleman's MMA career began with a call from Coleman to invite him to fight in Brazil where he went on to achieve a record of 7 wins and 2 losses.Full Contact Fighter Randleman moved on to the UFC, where he also won the Heavyweight title. Coleman subsequently experienced a downturn in his career as his predominantly wrestling based style became less effective, with losses to fighters with more developed striking skills and cardio, including Maurice Smith, Pete Williams and Pedro Rizzo. Coleman and Randleman move to PRIDE After the loss to Rizzo, Coleman moved to the Japanese PRIDE organization where he experienced a great deal of initial success, winning the PRIDE Grand Prix 2000 Finals. Randleman also joined PRIDE, debuting against Michiyoshi Ohara and becoming a top contender for the Middleweight title before losing to Quinton Jackson. The main Randleman's victory in PRIDE FC was his stunning and brutal KO victory over Mirko Filipoviƒá. Both Coleman and Randleman have since experienced downturns in their careers, with losses to fighters such as Fedor Emelianenko and Mirko Cro Cop (Randleman lost to Mirko in rematch). Before his bout with Jutaro Nakao at UFC 36: Worlds Collide, Sean Sherk began training at Team Hammer House. Sherk went on to win against Nakao and Benji Radach at UFC 39: The Warriors Return before facing Matt Hughes for the UFC Welterweight Championship at UFC 42: Sudden Impact. Although the fight was close, Sherk lost via unanimous decision. One of Coleman's opponents at UFC 10: The Tournament, Gary Goodridge, become a part of Team Hammer House to work on his ground skills before his bout with Ant√¥nio Rodrigo Nogueira at PRIDE 15. Goodridge remains a member of Team Hammer House although he also trains at American Kickboxing Academy for his kickboxing fights. Accomplished wrestler, male model and UFC star Phil Baroni started training with Team Hammer House, primarily fighting on PRIDE's Bushido events with success, defeating fighters such as Ikuhisa Minowa, Yuki Kondo and Ryo Chonan. Wes Sims met Coleman before his fight with Ricardo Morais,UFC : Ultimate Fighting Championship and has fought in the UFC and International Fight League. Rivalry with Chute Boxe Hammer House was involved in a short melee with Chute Boxe which started at PRIDE 31 after a confrontation erupted between Chute Boxe members Wanderlei Silva and Murilo Rua, and Team Hammer House members Mark Coleman and Phil Baroni. The conflict began after Coleman pushed aside the referee who tried to restrain him from continuing his attack on an injured Mauricio \\"Shogun\\" Rua. Coleman's outburst could have been due to members of Chute Boxe entering the ring. Despite this, Silva and other Chute Boxe members attacked Coleman in the ring, Baroni took Silva to the ground and Wanderlei had to be restrained with a foot placed on his head.Chute Boxe- Hammer House Rivalry Reaches Boiling Point Following the event, Coleman approached Chute Boxe to apologize, but the Chute Boxe fighters turned him away. PRIDE 32 The Real Deal Team Hammer House was heavily represented at Pride FC's first American show, PRIDE 32 in Las Vegas on October 21, 2006, being involved in three of the eight fights including the main event. Hammer House member Kevin Randleman faced a now-healthy Mauricio \\"Shogun\\" Rua. Rua won via kneebar submission at 2:35 of the very first round. Phil Baroni defeated Japanese professional boxer turned MMA fighter Yosuke Nishijima via technical submission (kimura) at 3:20 of the first round. Mark Coleman was given the opportunity to fight Pride's undefeated Heavyweight champion Fedor Emelianenko for a second time. In a finish very similar to their first encounter, Fedor was able to apply an armbar from the bottom, forcing Coleman to tap out 1:15 of the second round.

Biography According to the catalogues of the Society of Jesus, Houdry entered the Society of Jesus at Paris on 10 October 1647, and after the novitiate followed the regular course of studies (three years philosophy and four years theology). For a considerable while he was engaged in teaching: classics, six years; rhetoric, one year; philosophy, four years. After this he became a celebrated pulpit orator, preaching for the next twenty-five years in the more important cities of France. During the remainder of his life he was principally occupied in writing sermons. He died on 21 March 1729, at Paris. His obituary in the archives of the Society praises his talent as an orator and his never-tiring industry as a speaker and a writer. Among his virtues, his faithful observance of the rules, even to the ninety-ninth year of his life, is especially mentioned. Writings Houdry left two important homiletic works. His collected sermons, under the title Sermons sour tous les sujets de la morale chr√©tienne, appeared in Paris, 1696-1702. It comprises five parts in twenty- two volumes, and has run through several editions; it was also printed in part in a German translation at Augsburg in 1739. With his wonted scrupulous care, he supplemented it by an index volume, together with a treatise on the imitation of famous preachers. (A collection from the large work can be found in Migne, \\"Collection des orateurs sacr√©s\\", XXXVI, XXXVII.) Houdry's second great literary work, La biblioth√®que des predicateurs 'library of preachers', consists of an ambitiously planned collection of materials for preachers, which he called a \\"library\\", and which was published, 1712-1725, in twenty- three volumes at Lyons. Two translations of this work in Latin and one in Italian have been completed; and as recently as 1862 a \\"Biblical Patristic Concordance for Preachers and Catechists\\" was compiled from it. In the introductions to both works, Houdry sets forth his views on the functions of a preacher and criticizes the style of preaching in vogue in his time. In 1702 the famous preacher published a small ascetic treatise in two volumes, on the exercises of St. Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuits, addressed to priests and accordingly written in Latin.

An ovitrap is a device which consists of a dark container containing water and a substrate where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. The eggs then fall through the mesh into the water, where the larvae hatch and develop into pupas. When the adult mosquitoes emerge, they are trapped beneath the mesh and are unable to escape from the ovitrap. Ovitraps mimic the preferred breeding site for container breeding mosquitoes, including Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. The ovitrap was first described in 1966Reiter, P., M. A. Amador, R. A. Anderson, and G. G. Clark. 1995. Short report: dispersal of Aedes aegypti in an urban area after blood feeding as demonstrated by rubidium-marked eggs. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 52: 177-179. and was initially designed for monitoring Aedes populations. Researchers found that if they provided artificial breeding sites, they could easily collect and study the eggs found in the container. Since the original ovitrap was invented, lethal ovitraps have been developed, which kill the larvae and/or the adult mosquitoes that enter. Ovitraps used for monitoring can detect Aedes mosquito populations, thus acting as an early warning signal to preempt disease outbreaks. Analysis can be done on the ovitrap breeding data collected weekly to identify mosquito breeding hotspots and risk areas when there is a danger of high Aedes infestation. This analysis is used to plan vector surveillance and control operations. The extensive use of the ovitrap in a community can be used in Aedes population control and effectively reduce the Aedes population in that area. It has been used in countries like Singapore, the United States, and Hong Kong since the 1970s.

Entremets (; ; from Old French, literally meaning \\"between servings\\") in French cuisine historically referred to small dishes served between courses but in modern times more commonly refers to a type of dessert. By the end of the Middle Ages, it had evolved almost entirely into dinner entertainment in the form of inedible ornaments or acted performances, often packed with symbolism of power and regality. In English it was more commonly known as a subtlety (also sotelty or soteltie) and did not include acted entertainment, but most famously did have live blackbirds flying out of a pie, a scene immortalized in the folk song Sing a Song of Sixpence. Originally an elaborate form of entertainment dish during the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, an entremet marked the end of a course and could be anything from a simple frumenty (a type of wheat porridge) that was brightly colored and flavored with exotic and expensive spices to elaborate models of castles complete with wine fountains, musicians, and food modeled into allegorical scenes. History The staging of an elaborate entremets at the banquet of Charles V in 1378; illumination from Grandes Chroniques, late 14th century. Ancient Dishes that were intended to be eaten as well as entertain can be traced back at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus.Scully (1995) p. 107. Middle Ages The function of the entremets was to mark the end of a course, mets (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremets can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremets.Scully (1995) p. 105. The most noticeable trait of the early entremets was the focus on vivid colors. Later on, the entremets would take the shape of various types of illusion foods, such as peacocks or swans that were skinned, cooked, seasoned and then redressed in their original plumage (or filled with the meat of tastier fowl) or even scenes depicting contemporary human activities, such as a knight in the form of a grilled capon equipped with a paper helmet and lance, sitting on the back of a roast piglet.Scully (1995), pp. 105-107. Elaborate models of castles made from edible material was a popular theme. At a feast in 1343 dedicated to Pope Clement VI, one of the Avignon popes, one of the entremets was a castle with walls made from roast birds, populated with cooked and redressed deer, wild boar, goat, hare and rabbit.Adamson (2004), p. 114. In the 14th century entremets began to involve not just eye-catching displays of amusing haute cuisine, but also more prominent and often highly symbolic forms of inedible entertainment. In 1306, the knighting of the son of Edward I included performances of chansons de geste in what has been assumed to be part of the entremets.Strong (2003), pp. 121-123. During the course of the 14th century they would often take on the character of theatrical displays, complete with props, actors, singers, mummers and dancers. At a banquet held in 1378 by Charles V of France in honor of Emperor Charles IV, a huge wooden model of the city of Jerusalem was rolled in before the high table. Actors portraying the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon and his knights then sailed into the hall on a miniature ship and reenacted the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.Henisch (1976), p. 234. Entremets made an effective tool for political displays. One of the most famous examples is the so-called Feast of the Pheasant, arranged by Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1454. The theme of the banquet was the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and included a vow by Philip and his guests to retake the city in a crusade, though this was never realized. There were several spectacular displays at the banquet referred to by contemporary witnesses as entremets. Guests were entertained by a wide range of extravagant displays of automatons in the form of fountains and pies containing musicians. At the end of the banquet, an actor representing the Holy Church rode in on an elephant and read a poem about the plight of Eastern Christianity under Ottoman rule. From the late 14th century on in England, entremets are referred to as subtleties. This English term was derived from an older meaning of \\"subtle\\" as \\"clever\\" or \\"surprising\\".Constance B. Hieatt \\"Medieval Britain\\" p. 35, in Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe. The meaning of \\"subtlety\\" did not include entertainment involving actors; those were referred to as pageants.Adamson (2004), p. 166. The \\"four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie\\", in the nursery rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\", has its genesis in an entremets presented to amuse banquet guests in the 14th century. This extravaganza of hospitality was related by an Italian cook of the era.Giovanni de Roselli's Epulario, quale tratta del modo de cucinare ogni carne, uccelli, pesci... (1549), of which an English translation, Epulario, or the Italian Banquet, was published in 1598 (Mary Augusta Scott, Elizabethan Translations from the Italian no. 256, p. 333f.). ‚ÄúLive birds were slipped into a baked pie shell through a hole cut in its bottom.‚Äù The unwary guest would release the flapping birds once the upper crust was cut into.Jenkins, Jessica Kerwin, The Encyclopedia of the Exquisite, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday,2010, p. 200-01 A serving of boar's head, a popular form of entremets. The image of the boar caught with an apple in its mouth was possibly among the first dishes to attempt an imitation of a live animal. At the end of the Middle Ages, the level of refinement among the noble and royal courts of Europe had increased considerably, and the demands of powerful hosts and their rich dinner guests resulted in ever more complicated and elaborate creations. Chiquart, cook to Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, described an entremets entitled Castle of Love in his 15th-century culinary treatise Du fait de cuisine (\\"On cookery\\"). It consisted of a giant castle model with four towers, carried in by four men. The castle contained, among other things, a roast piglet, a swan cooked and redressed in its own plumage, a roast boar's head and a pike cooked and sauced in three different ways without having been cut into pieces, all of them breathing fire.The effect was created by placing wax candles bound with strips of cotton that had been soaked in alcohol in the mouth of the animals and lighting them; Scully (1995), p. 162. The battlements of the castle were adorned with the banners of the Duke and his guests, manned by miniature archers, and inside the castle there was a fountain that gushed rosewater and spiced wine. Du Fait de Cuisine. Translation by Elizaebth Cook. Retrieved on October 10, 2008.

Jenkins, Jessica Kerwin, The Encyclopedia of the Exquisite, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, 2010, p. 201 Eliza Acton lists among the entremets (which she calls \\"second-course dishes\\") many dishes, both sweet and savoury: small fruit-filled vol-au-vents with apricots, plums and peaches; a coconut cheesecake attributed to Jamaican origins; jam filled puff pastries; pie varieties like mince pie and pudding pie; pan-fried \\"potato ribbons\\"; different types of croquettes; sea kale and spinach, with gravy and sippets; sugar-glazed carrots braised in cream; poached eggs in Espagnole sauce; asparagus tips or green peas with creamy roux; green beans with lemon-butter sauce; turnips in \\"thick white sauce\\"; and a wide range of dessert compotes, sweet puddings, molded \\"fancy jellies\\" and cakes.

Constable Care is a nationally registered harm prevention charity and utilises theatre-in-education, and in particular applied theatre, to deliver its education messages. The Constable Care Child Safety Foundation tours throughout Western Australia delivering interactive theatre workshops, plays and puppet theatre programs. Based in Maylands, Western Australia, the organisation employs professional actors who visit over 700 schools a year including remote indigenous community schools. The performances are supported by curriculum-linked classroom resources and tailored to the learning needs of students from pre-primary to Year 12, covering topics such as bullying, alcohol and drug abuse, protective behaviours, cultural understanding, road safety, violence prevention and mental health. Students' change in knowledge, attitude and behavioural intent towards each topic is measured pre and post performance incursion through teacher-administered surveys developed through Constable Care's ongoing research partnerships. As of December 2016, well over 2.5 million Western Australian children had participated in a Constable Care performance, with around 100,000 students taking part each year. The Constable Care brand celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2014 and has now performed for three generations of WA children. In July 2018, the foundation launched a road safety app for students. TRG Theatrical Response Group In late 2013 Constable Care launched its youth brand Theatrical Response Group (TRG), a tongue-in-cheek nod to the organisation's long standing connection with WA Police. TRG Theatrical Response Group undertakes theatre workshops in WA's secondary schools using applied theatre techniques to involve students in discussion and problem-solving on serious youth issues such as cyberbullying, relationship violence and alcohol and drug abuse. The organisation uses the Forum theatre approach developed by Brazilian Augusto Boal as its methodology for engaging students, and undertakes a significant number of touring workshops as well as a smaller number of in-residence extended school interventions each year. In September 2014 the organisation commenced delivering this program in remote Aboriginal schools in the Pilbara region, placing indigenous actors and facilitators in classrooms to work with students for up to 2 weeks at a time. The organisation now delivers a significant number of these \\"TRG Intensive\\" programs in both Perth metropolitan and remote secondary schools each year. Community mascots The Constable Care mascots can be seen at upwards of 60 community events across Perth and Western Australia each year, including Telethon events, the Perth Christmas Pageant, Perth Royal Show, Mandurah Crab Fest, Joondalup Festival and many other metropolitan and regional events. The non-speaking mascot's role is to interact with children and families at events to provide a positive first experience of police for young children. The mascots and a trained helper undertake event walkarounds, stopping for photographs and giving away handouts such as stickers and cardboard police hats. At larger events such as the Telethon Kids Carnival, the mascot takes part in safety-themed song and dance performances on stage with actors from the Constable Care Performance Company. The Constable Care mascot was recognised at a ceremony in June 2014 at the Western Australian Police Academy for 25 years of service to the WA community, receiving the regimental number 12020 and the status of Senior Constable. At a ceremony in August 2014, then Commissioner of WA Police Karl O'Callaghan presented the Constable Care mascot with a 25-year service medal. In May 2016 Western Australia Police filmed a video featuring the Constable Care mascot dancing with uniformed officers as part of the worldwide online Running Man Challenge. The video was published on the WA Police Facebook page and has been watched over 1.3 million times. In September 2017, in recognition of Western Australian Police 100 Years of Women in Policing celebrations, a new female mascot Constable Clare was introduced to complement the existing Constable Care mascot. Lost child services The Constable Care Child Safety Foundation provides lost child services at the Perth Christmas Pageant, Mandurah Crab Fest, City of Perth Skyworks, Perth's Anzac Day ceremonies, Western Australia Day celebrations and many other family-oriented community events in Western Australia. The service distributes contact information stickers or armbands to families arriving at events so they can be quickly reunited with their children should they become separated, and also provides highly visible staffed family meeting points within the event to locate missing children rapidly and with a minimum of trauma. Comfort Packs program In 2014 Constable Care launched a Comfort Packs program in partnership with Western Australia Police. The program aims to supply frontline emergency service workers with care packs to give to children who are being temporarily relocated from their homes due to accident, emergency or increasingly as a result of crimes such as domestic violence. The backpacks are age and gender appropriate and contain necessities such as pyjamas, underwear, toothbrush and paste, soap, shampoo and conditioner, hair brush, story book, teddy bear, etc. They are available at no cost to WA Police, Fire and Emergency Services and Child Protection workers and are delivered wherever required in the State. As of December 2016, the organisation had provided over 1,300 comfort packs to children statewide. Video productions In 2011, the organisation released \\"Constable Care and the A-Grades\\" debut single, entitled Merry Christmas, which achieved over 20,000 views on YouTube in its first month. This was the organisation's first foray into film making and was followed by two further Christmas videos in 2012 and 2013. The organisation started working in partnership in 2014 with Edith Cowan University WA Screen Academy on a series of online interactive youth crime prevention films under the banner \\"Your Call\\", with the first (#Emilywasted) on binge drinking among teenage girls released in June 2015. Three further interactive films on young male aggression (Shirtfront), car theft (Wreck) and mental health and drug use (Pressure) were released in September 2015, December 2015 and January 2016 respectively. In 2016 the organisation introduced a secondary schools' competition process for Year 10-12 students to identify the storyline for each new film, with the winning entry then developed into the interactive film. In 2017 the organisation joined forces with the Western Australia Police SAY student film making contest to run a combined secondary school competition under a new \\"Your Say, Your Call\\" banner that allows students to create a short film of their own for judging, with the winning entry then developed into the interactive film. The winning film submission for 2017 \\"Bottled Up\\" was developed by Edith Cowan University WA Screen Academy for both 360 degree virtual reality and traditional film mediums. Safety School Constable Care commenced planning in late 2012 to build and operate a road and transport safety experiential learning centre for children aged 4‚Äì11 years at its site in Maylands. Thanks to the support of Lotterywest and a number of corporate sponsors, the 3,500 sqm centre was completed and opened in July 2017 and now provides a fully functioning urban streetscape for practical bike and pedestrian skills education. The centre includes working traffic signalling, rail crossing, school zone and scale buildings, a bus and train, a rail platform and working pedestrian crossing. It also incorporates an augmented reality experience on iPad minis that enables children to identify and resolve pedestrian, bike and public transport safety risks overlaid on the environment, with results tracked in real time and linked to WA curriculum education outcomes. The $1.7 million Constable Care Safety School has been operating for primary school excursion groups since October 2017, and opened for family school holiday bookings in January 2018, with up to 20,000 children and adults expected to attend each year. Patrons Constable Care has three official patrons who attend its events and provide advice and support to the organisation. They are Commissioner of WA Police Chris Dawson, Western Australian Chief Justice Wayne Martin and actor and comedian Peter Rowsthorn. Board The Board of Constable Care constitutes individuals drawn from business, academia, government, education, marketing, media, the arts and community services. The current board chair is Carolyn Dickie, deputy pro vice-chancellor of Curtin University Business School. CEO David Gribble is the chief executive officer of the Constable Care Child Safety Foundation Incorporated. He took over from former CEO Vick Evans in January 2011. Former employees Television personality Rove McManus was once a Constable Care performer, as was film actor Mahesh Jadu. Vick Evans was the chief executive officer of the Constable Care Child Safety Foundation Incorporated for 14 years from 1998 to early 2011.

They raised 7 million euros which was considered to be the most funds raised in 2006 from the French Web 2.0. In October 2009, the French government invested in Dailymotion through the Strategic Investment Fund. On 25 January 2011, Orange acquired a 49% stake in Dailymotion for ‚Ç¨62 million, valuing the company at ‚Ç¨120 million. On 10 January 2013 Orange bought the remaining 51% for ‚Ç¨61 million. On or about 2 May 2013, the French government blocked Yahoo's acquisition of a majority stake in Dailymotion. On 25 February 2014, Orange revealed it was in discussions with Microsoft about a deal that could see Dailymotion extend into the US market. In an interview with a local television station in Barcelona St√©phane Richard, CEO of Orange, said there was \\"great hope\\" an agreement would be reached. Any deal would see Orange retain majority ownership of Dailymotion. Richard said his company was in talks with other potential partners as well with a view to expanding Dailymotion's international appeal, but said discussions with others were more in relation to content. In 2015, Vivendi purchased an 80% stake in Dailymotion from Orange S. A. Vivendi increased its ownership to 90% that September. In September 2020, Dailymotion has partnered with Mi Video, the global video app developed by Xiaomi.

Blocking of Dailymotion  Dailymotion was banned in India in May 2012, but in the following month India unblocked access to video- and file-sharing sites including Dailymotion. The Madras High Court changed its earlier order, explaining that only specific URLs carrying illegally copied content should be blocked, not entire websites. Dailymotion was again banned in India in December 2014, due to Government concerns that the site might be hosting videos pertaining to ISIS propaganda. On 31 December, however, Dailymotion was again unblocked in India. Dailymotion has been banned in Kazakhstan since August 2011. In 2017, Dailymotion was blocked in Russia for repeated violations of Russian copyright law.  Copyright cases  In June 2007, Dailymotion was found liable for copyright infringement by a Paris High Court. The judges held that Dailymotion is a hosting provider, and not a publisher, but that it must be held liable for copyright infringement, as it was aware of the presence of illegal content on its site. Such illegal content may be copyrighted material uploaded to Dailymotion by Dailymotion users. The Parisian judges held that Dailymotion was aware that illegal videos were put online on its site, and that it must therefore be held liable for the acts of copyright infringement, since it deliberately furnished the users with the means to commit the acts of infringement. In December 2014, Dailymotion was fined ‚Ç¨1.3 million. The Paris Court of Appeal found that the site had infringed the copyright of French television station TF1 and news channel LCI. The court ruled that Dailymotion had failed to take action against users illegally posting TF1 content online. According to Guillaume Cl√©ment, Chief Product & Technology Officer, as of 2017 the company employs a combination of human curation and automated tools to ensure copyright holder rights are protected within the destination, and it is able to remove questionable or illegal content within two hours. Dailymotion has been permanently blocked in Russia since January 2017, because the Moscow City Court ruled that the site was repeatedly violating Russia's copyright law by providing access to illegal TV content.

Levine Productions and Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Edward Dmytryk and produced by Joseph E. Levine from a screenplay by John Michael Hayes based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Harold Robbins. The music score was by Walter Scharf, the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald and the costume design by Edith Head. The film stars Susan Hayward and Bette Davis with Mike Connors, Joey Heatherton, Jane Greer, DeForest Kelley, Anne Seymour, and George Macready. Plot The film begins with headlines stating that 15-year-old Danielle Miller (Joey Heatherton) has murdered a man, Rick Lazich, who was the latest lover of her mother Valerie Hayden (Susan Hayward). Dani's father, Luke Miller (Mike Connors) describes the events that led to the tragedy. Near the end of World War II, Army Air Forces hero Miller is in San Francisco for a parade in his honor, and meets Valerie Hayden at an art show where one of her works is being exhibited. He is invited to dinner by Valerie's mother, Mrs. Gerald Hayden (Bette Davis), who offers him a job and dowry as an enticement for him to marry Valerie. He storms from the house but is followed by Valerie who says she is unable to go against her mother's wishes but that she admires him for having refused her. A relationship develops and the two marry, although a former suitor, Sam Corwin (DeForest Kelley) predicts that the marriage will fail. As time passes, Luke Miller becomes a successful architect and refuses another offer of employment from his mother-in-law, however the influential and vindictive Mrs. Hayden uses her contacts in the banking industry to ensure that Miller is refused loans to help him build his business. He relents and accepts a position in Mrs. Hayden's company. Their daughter, Dani, is born but the relationship of the couple begins to deteriorate with Miller declining into alcoholism, and Valerie indulging in a promiscuous lifestyle. The marriage ends when Miller actually finds her having sex with another man and Mrs. Hayden insists she divorce him. Years pass and Dani eventually becomes her mother's rival for the same man. Back in the present, Dani claims that she was defending Valerie against attack, and when the case is brought to court, a verdict of justifiable homicide is ruled. An investigation into where to place Dani begins, but neither investigator Marian Spicer (Jane Greer) nor psychiatrist Dr. Jennings (Anne Seymour) can persuade Dani to open up about her feelings. When Mrs. Hayden petitions for custody of Dani and she still refuses to reveal herself, Valerie reveals that Dani was trying to kill her, and that Rick was only killed when he tried to defend Valerie. Valerie returns home and commits suicide, and after her death Luke Miller tries to help Dani rebuild her life.

Newsweek wrote that the case seemed to have influenced the \\"foolish story\\" and described it as \\"a typical Harold Robbins pastiche of newspaper clippings liberally shellacked with sentiment and glued with sex\\". The Saturday Review criticized the script saying that it \\"somehow manages to make every dramatic line (particularly when uttered by Susan Hayward) sound like a caption to a cartoon in The New Yorker. Nominations The theme song \\"Where Love Has Gone\\" by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe in the \\"Best Song\\" category.

Early life Pratt was born on August 16, 1869, and raised in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, New York, the third son of Standard Oil magnate Charles Pratt and his wife Mary Helen Richardson. He was brother to Frederic B. Pratt, Herbert L. Pratt, John Teele Pratt and Harold I. Pratt; and half-brother to Charles Millard Pratt. He graduated from Amherst College in 1893, and \\"excelled as an athlete\\". Pratt was a member of the track team, one of Amherst's great teams, who easily won the NEIAA Championship at Worcester, May 28, 1890. In the NEIAA Championship of 1892, he set a new record in the two mile bicycle race. Pratt was also quarterback for the football team. The 1892 team, which he captained, is considered ‚Äúthe greatest football team of which Amherst can boast‚Äù. They played thirteen games, all with other college teams, won 8 and lost 5, scored 314 to opponents 141. On November 18, 1892, Amherst beat Williams on Weston Field at Williamstown, 60-0. Pratt kicked ten goals from almost every angle of the field, most of them against the wind. This record still stands today as the best goal-kicking exhibition of any Amherst player in a major game. Career In 1895, Pratt started work for the Long Island Rail Road, and in 1900, was assistant to the president and superintendent of ferries. In 1910, he helped organize the Boy Scouts of America and served as treasurer. As an early member of the Camp Fire Club he became interested in conservation and for 25 years served on its committee on conservation. He was Conservation Commissioner of New York from 1915 to 1921. Pratt was a trustee of Amherst College, the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum, vice president of the Pratt Institute, and president of the American Forestry Association. He was also a major donor to the Metropolitan's Decorative Arts Department.Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925-1970, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.

It was designed by Trowbridge and Ackerman. By the 1950s it was purchased by the then Soviet Union to serve as the retreat for the Russian delegation to the United Nations. Personal life In 1897, Pratt married Helen Deming Sherman Pratt (1869-1923), the daughter of John Taylor Sherman, a Brooklyn cotton merchant, and great granddaughter of American founding father Roger Sherman; her sister Gertrude Mary (Sherman) Trowbridge was the grandmother of US Secretary of Commerce Alexander Buel Trowbridge, who was also an executive in the Rockefeller/Pratt oil business. They had five children, including the explorer Sherman Pratt and Eliot Deming Pratt, chairman of trustees of Goddard College, Vermont for 15 years, where the Eliot Pratt Center and the Eliot D Pratt Library are named in his honor. In 1926, Pratt married Vera Hale, daughter of William Amherst Hale, a banker of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. They did not have any children. She died on February 3, 1978.

They were formed in 1988 in order to keep their area on the hardcore punk map as most of the other bands around them were breaking up. Biography They were formed by vocalist Giulio the Bastard and guitarist Alberto the Crippler. They were initially a metal-influenced punk band called Grimcorpses. However, they were not satisfied with their music and soon decided to make their style more extreme, which was accompanied by a name change. They combined hardcore and metal influences with grindcore, but still managed to sound different from many other grindcore bands at the time. Their first demo shares the tape with two other bands, which also include members of Cripple Bastards. A few more tracks and demos were recorded after this. The band also played various venues including their first ever international concert in Croatia. By 1994, the band had drafted bassist Eduardo. The following year the band released their first full-length album, Your Lies In Check and drummer Paolo joined the band shortly after. Shortly after their debut album was released, Eduardo left the band and was replaced by Stefano, who was in the same band as Paolo. However both Paolo and Stefano soon departed, leaving the band with only two members once again. As the years went by, the band made numerous changes in personnel. The band released Misantropo a Senso Unico in 2000, which was placed at number 6 in Terrorizer's list of essential European grindcore albums, with deputy editor James Hoare describing it as \\"primitive, punk, pummelling and most importantly given their self-dubbed 'controversial hategrind', genuinely dangerous.\\"Hoare, James (2009). \\"Essential Albums|Europe\\", Terrorizer Magazine 180, p. 55. This album went in an even more uncompromising direction and was also the last album to feature Alberto the Crippler on guitar. However, members were replaced and the band formed its most stable line-up. In 2003, the band released Desperately Insensitive, which had a 'cleaner' sound. Over the years they have played over 300 shows, many of which were included on three full-length tours (in Europe 2000, the US East Coast 2002 and the US West Coast 2003), as well as several international festivals, including Fuck the Commerce in Germany in 2001,Official Fuck the Commerce website Obscene Extreme in the Czech Republic in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006 and 2010,Official Obscene Extreme website Maryland Deathfest in the USA in 2007 and 2011.,Official Maryland Deathfest website Brutal Assault in Czech Republic (2009) and Neurotic Deathfest in the Netherlands in 2011. They have shared the stage with bands, such as Brujeria, Napalm Death, Dismember, Suffocation, Pungent Stench, Brutal Truth, Nasum, Ratos de Por√£o, Extreme Noise Terror, Varukers and Chaos UK.Biography at Official Cripple Bastards Website On 9 September 2014, after 15 years, Cripple Bastards parted ways with drummer Al Mazzotti.

The East Coast Road has been extended up to Kanyakumari via Chidambaram, Sirkali, Thirukkadaiyur, Tharangambadi, Karaikal, Nagore, Nagapattinam, Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupet, Adirampattinam, Pattukkottai Manora, Manamelkudi, Mimisal, Ramanathapuram, Koodankulam, Thoothukudi. The total length of the road is about 800 km between Chennai and Kanyakumari. The highway is a state highway maintained by the Government of Tamil Nadu under the Department of Highways and Minor Ports. It was a two-lane state highway, and has been partially upgraded to four-lane divided highway. The Chennai neighbourhoods on ECR are Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam, Panaiyur, Uthandi, Muttukadu, Covelong and Vilambur.  History  Prior to its completion, the East Coast Road mainly consisted of village roads. The connecting link then was the Old Mahabalipuram Road (SH-49A) till Mahabalipuram. Pondicherry was reached from Chennai through the still existent route via Tambaram, Tindivanam along NH45. In 2000, the State government signed a concessionaire agreement with the TNRDC in order to improve the road, at a cost of 60 crore. The 113-km long stretch from Akkarai to Pondicherry, dotted with resorts and beach houses, became a toll facility in March 2002 and was upgraded into a two-lane road from a small winding road passing through 154 villages. In 2010, TNRDC announced that toll collections had reached an all-time high at 1.08 crore in December 2009 against the 54.67 lakh collected in April 2002 when toll operations started.  Four laning ECR  The ECR starts at Thiruvanmiyur in Chennai and is a part of the Chennai City roads till Uthandi. From Uthandi starts the beachway section starts as a toll road. The speed of the vehicles on this road is restricted to a maximum of 80 km/h. The State Government upgraded most of East Coast Road to a four lane divided, open access highway by 2015. The ECR was made a toll road in April 2002. The ECR till Hanumanthai near Pondicherry is 113.2 km long and has a total of 22 bends. On an average 10,000 passenger car units (PCUs) use the road during rush hour and a total of 40,000 PCUs daily, up from about 5,000 daily before the construction of the road. The process of acquiring land for widening the 11.4-km stretch from Thiruvanmiyur to Akkarai covering six revenue villages (including Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam and Vettuvankani), which is under the control of the Highways Department, is under way.Report for immediate ECR 4-laning till Mamallapuram The stretch currently has width varying between 50 ft and 80 ft. After widening at a sanctioned cost of 3,540 million, the stretch would be uniformly wide and would have six lanes, a 1.2-m-wide median, footpath-cum- stormwater drain. ECR extends up to Hanumanthai. On the way to Hanumanthai, a famous location Marakkanam is situated. On the ECR road right side famous Bhoomiswarar Temple is situated.

Steel Knotts is a fell in the English Lake District, near to Ullswater in the Far Eastern Fells. It stands between the valleys of Fusedale and Martindale on a ridge running north‚Äìsouth. Topography At Wether Hill on the spine of the Far Eastern Fells, a subsidiary spur branches off west to Gowk Hill, before turning north to run parallel to the main ridge. This passes over Brownthwaite Crag () and the rockier top of Steel Knotts before swinging a little to the east and making a brisk descent to Howtown and Ullswater. The Steel Knotts ridge, also termed Martindale Edge, runs for about two miles in total. To the east is the steep sided valley of Fusedale, its beck forming the boundary of the fell. This flows north to the Lake at Howtown, below the nose of the ridge. There are some crags on this side, particularly at the northern end. The western flank of the fell has shallower gradients at the top before dropping over rough ground to Martindale. The boundary here is made by Howegrain Beck which carries the waters of Bannerdale and Rampsgill Dale to the lake at Sandwick. Running off north west from the top of Steel Knotts is a truncated ridge which falls quickly over Birkies Knott to valley level. Here the Martindale road is crossed at The Coombes before the land rises again to Hallin Fell, overlooking Ullswater from its fine position between Sandwick and Howtown. Topographically Hallin Fell is the true continuation of Steel Knotts, although the eye naturally gives this distinction to the narrow ridge descending to Howtown. Summit Steel Knotts has a fine summit pinnacle which is named Pikeawassa. This provides a pleasant little scramble to finish a walk. The view of Martindale is very good with the Helvellyn range also on display.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Ascents The fell can be climbed from Howtown or from The Coombes and St Peter's church at the top of the horseshoes on the Martindale road. The ridge can also be reached just south of the summit from Martindale Old Church, or at Gowk Hill via Fusedale.

He held a number of public offices and in politics he was a moderate who represented Chambly in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (1820-1834); and Montmorency in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada (1841-1844 & 1848-1866). From 1837 to 1841 he sat on the Executive Council of Lower Canada. Condemned by the Patriotes as a vendu in the Lower Canada Rebellion, in 1860 he was elected President of the Saint- Jean-Baptiste Society. In 1859, he was elected President of the Banque du Peuple and his achievements in commerce and finance served to show that a French Canadian could make his fortune in business.Dictionary of Canadian Biography His home, Manoir Souvenir (now a ruin) was one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile. Early life In 1785, Quesnel was born at Montreal into a family well known in Canadien gentry society. He was the eldest son of Joseph Quesnel and Marie-Josephte Deslandes, step-daughter of Maurice-R√©gis Blondeau. His brothers included The Hon. Jules-Maurice Quesnel, a member of the Beaver Club, and his sister was married to The Hon. C√¥me- S√©raphin Cherrier. Like all his brothers, he was educated at the Coll√®ge Saint-Rapha√´l from 1796 to 1803. Afterwards, he articled in the law offices of Stephen Sewell, and could speak both French and English fluently. Early career He was admitted to the Bar of Montreal in 1807, set up practice there, and by 1819 had offices on Rue Notre-Dame. During that period, Quesnel laid the basis of his fortune by investing in his brother's, Jules-Maurice's, activities in the fur trade. He was also involved in various speculations that included considerable land sales. Already a Captain in the 5th Battalion of Montreal militia, this unit became the Chasseurs Canadiens with whom he fought during the War of 1812. Sometime after the war, he reached the rank of Major. Politics From 1820 to 1834, Quesnel represented Kent County, which in 1829 was renamed Chambly, in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, gaining a reputation as an elegant speaker.Dictionary of Canadian Biography In the early years, he supported Louis-Joseph Papineau and Denis-Benjamin Viger. In 1822, he voted against the proposed union of Upper and Lower Canada. Quesnel was a moderate, which made his position increasingly difficult as Papineau became more radical. After several stands against him and his supporters, the final break for Quesnel came over the Ninety-Two Resolutions. He stated: \\"to say in a few words what I think of them, I approve a great many, I reject several, but taken as a whole and as a single unit, I cannot approve them\\".Dictionary of Canadian Biography Quesnel backed John Neilson's attempt to introduce more moderate resolutions, but both men were condemned at a public meeting at Saint-Athanase-d‚ÄôIberville and lost their seats to supporters of Papineau. As the political situation in Lower Canada worsened by 1837, with Cl√©ment-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury and George Moffatt, Quesnel arranged a public meeting at Montreal in support of the government. Two months later, Lord Gosford appointed him to the Executive Council of Lower Canada. When the Lower Canada Rebellion broke out, Quesnel was condemned as a vendu by the Patriotes and his brother, Joseph-Timol√©on, was forced to flee L‚ÄôAcadie and give up his magistrate‚Äôs commission. In 1840, Quesnel headed a delegation still opposing the union of Upper and Lower Canada. When the Canadas did unite the following year, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Montmorency. Lord Sydenham listed as Quesnel as one of the members who consistently voted against him. Fearing he might support the Tory government under pressure from Denis-Benjamin Viger, he was defeated in the 1844 elections. Four years later, he was re-elected and held the seat until his death in 1866. Public life In 1831, he was named King's Counsel. He supported the 1849 Rebellion Losses Bill and opposed annexation to the United States; he ensured that proper compensation for seigneurs was built into legislation to abolish seigneurial tenure. Quesnel was elected president of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal in 1860. Business Quesnel was one of only a few Canadiens of his generation to enter into business life, and he made a fortune doing so. Having been involved in land speculation from the earliest days of his career, by 1864 he was reaping the awards of these early investments: He sold the land which would become Sainte-Cun√©gonde to William Workman and Alexandre-Maurice Delisle for $100,000. In 1843, the Banque du Peuple was born through the Quebec Nationalist movement, to cater for French Canadians, and in 1848 Quesnel was made a director. He served as its president from 1859 to 1865, during which time the bank enjoyed steady growth and tranquillity. Long after Quesnel's death, in 1894 mismanagement at a time of Montreal's economic peak wrecked it, and the bank was eventually forced to close its doors the following year.The Quebec History Encyclopedia Family Notre-Dame des neiges Cemetery. Quesnel's home, Manoir Souvenir, built in 1830 and set amidst a park of 240 acres. Located in Montreal's Golden Square Mile In 1830, within a park of 240 acres, Quesnel built Manoir Souvenir, one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile and so named in memory of his wife. In 1813, at Boucherville, Quesnel married Marguerite Denaut (1791-1820), the only daughter and heiress of Captain Joachim Denaut, a wealthy fur trader who lived at Granville, by his wife Marguerite Chabert. She died in 1820, and their two sons and three daughters all predeceased him too. He adopted a nephew, and one son married and left a daughter. *Pierre-Adolphe-Augustin Quesnel. In 1843, at Boucherville, he married Charlotte Vercheres-Boucher de Boucherville, granddaughter of The Hon. Ren√©-Amable Boucher de Boucherville and niece of The Hon.

It is based on the Daewoo K1A submachine gun, but is simplified by utilizing a blowback action rather than the gas impingement system of its parent firearm. It was first displayed outside of Korea in the United Arab Emirates at the IDEX (International Defence Exhibition) 2003 convention. The K7 is currently manufactured by S&T; Daewoo. History South Korean special forces soldier with the suppressed K7 during drills in 2014. Despite the fact that the H&K; MP5SD6 was already in service with the Republic of Korea Armed Forces by the time the K7 reached production status, most of the special forces relied on unconventional weapons during covert operations due to high price of imported and domestically produced SMGs. Due to the substantial cost of the importation and production of such weapons, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command requested the development of an integrally suppressed submachine gun that would be less expensive to import or manufacture than the MP5SD6. The Defense Agency for Technology and Quality, a part of the Agency for Defense Development, and Daewoo Telecom, a subbranch of Daewoo Group, officially started development in April 1998, finishing the project in December 2000. Design The K7 does not use the direct gas impingement system of the K1A.http://www.military-today.com/firearms/k7.htm Instead, the K7 utilizes a simple blow-back system. A 30-round vertical box magazine is used and it can also use the 30-round magazines taken from the IMI Uzi or 32-round magazines from the Beretta Model 12. As the magazine well of the K1A was retained, there are internal accommodations for the smaller 9 mm magazine. There are 3 firing modes, single shot, a 3-round burst and fully automatic.http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/st-motiv-ready-for-global-stage- small-arms-featured-at-dx-korea/ However, prolonged fully automatic fire has been shown to damage and degrade the baffles within the integral suppressor. As a result of the light bolt, a cyclic rate of fire of 1150-rounds per minute is achieved. An integral suppressor is featured on the K7, which leaves users the option to use standard 9mm Parabellum ammo instead of using subsonic ammo. The K7's upper receiver is based on that of the K2, albeit slightly modified. The hammer/fire control unit and telescopic stock are also derived from those of the K1. It can outfitted with a PK Designlab-made weaponlight with built-in picatinny railing.https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/12/15/k7-smg-pk- weapon-light/ As the K7 was developed from the Daewoo K1A, it features parts that can be interchanged with those of the K1 and vice versa. Suppressor The suppressor reduces the pressure of the gas produced during discharge, and by extension, reduces the amount of noise generated. In addition, the suppressor significantly distorts the sound of the gunshot so that it is very difficult to pinpoint the location of the shooter. Per shot, the mean average of noise generated by the K7 is approximately 111.5 dB.

Other species of Actinidia are also found in China and range east to Japan and north into southern areas of Russian Far East. This species grows naturally at altitudes between 600 and 2,000 m. Description and ecology Actinidia deliciosa is a vigorous, woody, twining vine or climbing shrub reaching 9 m.Purdue University:Kiwifruit(Actinidia deliciosa) The black- lyre leafroller moth (‚ÄúCnephasia‚Äù jactatana) is one of the few commercially significant pests of this plant. Leaves Foliage Its leaves are alternate, long-petioled, deciduous, oval to nearly circular, cordate at the base, and 7.5‚Äì12.5 cm long. Young leaves are coated with red hairs; mature leaves are dark-green and hairless on the upper surface, and downy-white with prominent, light-colored veins beneath. Flowers Flower The flowers are fragrant, dioecious or unisexual, borne singly or in threes in the leaf axils, are five- to six-petalled, white at first, changing to buff-yellow, 2.5‚Äì5 cm broad, and both sexes have central tufts of many stamens, though those of the female flowers with no viable pollen. The flowers also lack nectar. Male and female flowers appear on different plants (dioecious), and both sexes have to be planted in close proximity for fruit set. Bees are normally used by commercial orchards, although the more labour-intensive hand pollination is sometimes employed. Male flowers are gathered and processed to extract their pollen. This is then sprayed back on to the female flowers. Fruits A kiwifruit cut in cross-section The oblong fruits are up to 6.25 cm long. The russet-brown skin of the fruits is densely covered with short, stiff, brown hairs. The flesh is firm until fully ripened; it is glistening, juicy and luscious. The color of the flesh is bright-green, or sometimes yellow, brownish or off-white, except for the white, succulent center from which radiate many fine, pale lines. The flavor is subacid to quite acid; the flavor is suggested to be similar to that of the gooseberry or strawberry. Varieties and cultivars The two botanical varieties are: * Actinidia deliciosa var. chlorocarpa * Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa Zhong hua (Chinese gooseberry), jing li (northern pear gooseberry), ruan zao (soft date gooseberry), and mao hua (may be tight- or loose-haired) are the four main cultivars of this species in China. 'Abbott', 'Allison', 'Bruno', 'Hayward', Monty ('Montgomery'), and 'Greensill' are the most significant cultivars in New Zealand. History In 1847, specimens of the plant were collected by the agent for the Royal Horticultural Society, London. Cultivation spread from China in the early 20th century when seeds were introduced to New Zealand by Isabel Fraser, the principal of Wanganui Girls' College, who had been visiting mission schools in China. The seeds were planted in 1906 by a Wanganui nurseryman, Alexander Allison, with the vines first fruiting in 1910. People who tasted the fruit thought it had a gooseberry flavour, so began to call it the Chinese gooseberry, but being from the genus Actinidia, it is not related to the gooseberry family, Grossulariaceae. The familiar cultivar Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924. This is the most widely grown cultivar in the world. Chinese gooseberry was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s. In 1959, Turners and Growers named it kiwifruit, after New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi‚Äîbrown and furry. , Italy was the leading producer of kiwifruit in the world, followed by New Zealand, Chile, France, Greece, Japan, and the United States. In China, it is grown mainly in the mountainous area upstream of the Yangtze River. It is also grown in other areas of China, including Sichuan. In 2016, global production of kiwifruit was 4.3 million tonnes, led by China with 56% of the world total. Italy and New Zealand were other major producers. In 2010 and 2011, kiwifruit vines worldwide, in Italy, France, and New Zealand, suffered devastating attacks by a bacterial disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, with some of the New Zealand attacks by the virulent strain PSA-V. The disease had first been noticed in Japan in the 1980s, and subsequently in northern Italy (1992) and South Korea.

Early life Kennedy, who lived in New York City at 1 Broadway in the Kennedy mansion, was the son of Archibald Kennedy (1685‚Äì1763) and Maria (n√©e Walter) Schuyler Kennedy (1689‚Äì1764). His mother, a daughter of mayor Robert Walter and Catharine Leisler (a daughter of New York colonial governor Jacob Leisler, known for his role in Leisler's Rebellion), was briefly married, and widowed, to Arent Schuyler before her marriage to his father. His father, a direct descendant of the second son of Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis, died in 1763. Career In 1757, Kennedy served as a Captain in the Royal Navy. He owned what is now Liberty Island in the Upper New York Bay off Manhattan from 1746 to 1758, using it as a summer residence. On 18 December 1792, upon the death of a distant cousin, the 10th Earl (who died without male issue), Archibald was recalled from New York to Culzean Castle in Scotland to succeed to the Earldom and titles as the 11th Earl of Cassilis, and 13th Lord Kennedy. Personal life Portrait of his second wife, Anne Watts, by Mather Brown. His first marriage took place sometime before June 1765, to Katherine Schuyler (1737‚Äì1765), daughter of Peter Schuyler and granddaughter of Arent Schuyler, his mother's first husband. Katherine was an only child, so she inherited all of her father's estate upon his death in 1762. After her death in 1765, Kennedy inherited the entire estate.

Verdier duality was introduced by as an analog for locally compact spaces of the coherent duality for schemes due to Alexander Grothendieck. It is commonly encountered when studying constructible or perverse sheaves. Verdier duality Verdier duality states that certain image functors for sheaves are actually adjoint functors. There are two versions. Global Verdier duality states that for a continuous map f\\\\colon X \\\\to Y , the derived functor of the direct image with proper supports Rf_! has a right adjoint f^! in the derived category of sheaves, in other words, for a sheaf \\\\mathcal F on X and \\\\mathcal G on Y we have :RHom(Rf_!\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{G}) \\\\cong RHom(\\\\mathcal{F},f^!\\\\mathcal{G}). The exclamation mark is often pronounced \\"shriek\\" (slang for exclamation mark), and the maps called \\"f shriek\\" or \\"f lower shriek\\" and \\"f upper shriek\\" ‚Äì see also shriek map. Local Verdier duality states that :R\\\\,\\\\mathcal{H}om(Rf_!\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{G}) \\\\cong Rf_{\\\\ast}R\\\\,\\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\mathcal{F},f^!\\\\mathcal{G}) in the derived category of sheaves of k modules over Y. It is important to note that the distinction between the global and local versions is that the former relates maps between sheaves, whereas the latter relates (complexes of) sheaves directly and so can be evaluated locally. Taking global sections of both sides in the local statement gives global Verdier duality. The dualizing complex D_X on X is defined to be :\\\\omega_X = p^!(k) , where p is the map from X to a point. Part of what makes Verdier duality interesting in the singular setting is that when X is not a manifold (a graph or singular algebraic variety for example) then the dualizing complex is not quasi-isomorphic to a sheaf concentrated in a single degree. From this perspective the derived category is necessary in the study of singular spaces. If X is a finite-dimensional locally compact space, and D^b(X) the bounded derived category of sheaves of abelian groups over X, then the Verdier dual is a contravariant functor :D \\\\colon D^b(X)\\\\to D^b(X) defined by :D(\\\\mathcal{F}) = R\\\\,\\\\mathcal{H}om(\\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\omega_X) . It has the following properties: Poincar√© duality Poincar√© duality can be derived as a special case of Verdier duality. Here one explicitly calculates cohomology of a space using the machinery of sheaf cohomology. Suppose X is a compact orientable n-dimensional manifold, k is a field and k_X is the constant sheaf on X with coefficients in k. Let f=p be the constant map. Global Verdier duality then states :[Rp_!k_X,k] \\\\cong [k_X,p^!k] . To understand how Poincar√© duality is obtained from this statement, it is perhaps easiest to understand both sides piece by piece. Let :k_X\\\\to (I^{\\\\bullet}_X = I^0_X \\\\to I^1_X \\\\to \\\\cdots) be an injective resolution of the constant sheaf. Then by standard facts on right derived functors :Rp_!k_X=p_!I^{\\\\bullet}_X=\\\\Gamma_c(X;I^{\\\\bullet}_X) is a complex whose cohomology is the compactly supported cohomology of X. Since morphisms between complexes of sheaves (or vector spaces) themselves form a complex we find that :\\\\mathrm{Hom}^{\\\\bullet}(\\\\Gamma_c(X;I^{\\\\bullet}_X),k)= \\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\Gamma_c(X;I^2_X)^{\\\\vee}\\\\to \\\\Gamma_c(X;I^1_X)^{\\\\vee}\\\\to \\\\Gamma_c(X;I^0_X)^{\\\\vee}\\\\to 0 where the last non-zero term is in degree 0 and the ones to the left are in negative degree. Morphisms in the derived category are obtained from the homotopy category of chain complexes of sheaves by taking the zeroth cohomology of the complex, i.e. :[Rp_!k_X,k]\\\\cong H^0(\\\\mathrm{Hom}^{\\\\bullet}(\\\\Gamma_c(X;I^{\\\\bullet}_X),k))=H^0_c(X;k_X)^{\\\\vee}. For the other side of the Verdier duality statement above, we have to take for granted the fact that when X is a compact orientable n-dimensional manifold :p^!k=k_X[n], which is the dualizing complex for a manifold. Now we can re- express the right hand side as :[k_X,k_X[n \\\\cong H^n(\\\\mathrm{Hom}^{\\\\bullet}(k_X,k_X))=H^n(X;k_X). We finally have obtained the statement that :H^0_c(X;k_X)^{\\\\vee}\\\\cong H^n(X;k_X). By repeating this argument with the sheaf kX replaced with the same sheaf placed in degree i we get the classical Poincar√© duality :H^i_c(X;k_X)^{\\\\vee}\\\\cong H^{n-i}(X;k_X).

He left some 16,000 sheets to the National Herbarium in Pretoria and was dubbed \\"the Prince of Collectors\\" by General Smuts. Galpin discovered half a dozen genera and many hundreds of new species. Numerous species are named after him such as Acacia galpinii, Bauhinia galpinii, Cyrtanthus galpinii, Kleinia galpinii, Kniphofia galpinii, Streptocarpus galpinii and Watsonia galpinii. He is commemorated in the genus Galpinia N.E.Br. as is his farm in the genus Mosdenia Stent.  Early life  One of seven sons born in Grahamstown to Henry Carter Galpin, watchmaker and jeweller, and Georgina Maria Luck, Ernest Galpin started his education at the local St. Andrew's College. Due to his father's ill-health, Ernest left school at 14 to assist with the business. A short spell of active service on the frontier followed, after which he joined the Oriental Banking Corporation, later the Bank of Africa. After being transferred to Middelburg in the Cape, he developed an interest in the local plants and spent long hours dissecting and identifying wild flowers with the aid of the three volumes of Flora Capensis and Harvey's Genera. However, it was not till 1888 when he became bank manager in Grahamstown, that his collecting took on a serious turn. In 1889 he was transferred to Barberton and became intrigued by the relatively unknown local flora. His specimens now started reflecting his meticulous nature in that they were carefully pressed, preserved and labelled with extensive notes on locality, habitat and plant form. His duplicates soon found their way to Kew, Zurich and a number of notable botanists such as Harry Bolus, John Medley Wood and Peter MacOwan. Not surprisingly his collection became internationally known. In Barberton he befriended a young lawyer and plant collector Douglas Gilfillan, later to become his brother-in-law through their marriage to the de Jongh sisters. Galpin had had some new plant discoveries painted by Marie Elizabeth de Jongh (the daughter of Countess Mimi von Sch√∂nnberg) and married her in 1892. She shared his love of the outdoor life and accompanied him on many of his excursions and expeditions.  Later life  In 1892 Galpin was transferred to Queenstown, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1917. By now his herbarium specimens had grown to about 1500 in number. He made extensive collecting trips to mountains in the Eastern Cape, including Great Winterberg, Katberg, Stormberg and Andriesberg. In 1904 his wife accompanied him on a trip to the Basutoland border where they collected around Ben MacDhui and Satsannasberg. In 1897 he set out on a trip from Port Elizabeth to Humansdorp, Knysna, George, Riversdale, Swellendam and Caledon districts, ending in Cape Town. Here he spent some time at the Bolus Herbarium. In 1905 he visited Rhodesia with the British Association, collecting at the Victoria Falls and the Matopos. In 1907, in the company of Prof. HHW Pearson, he undertook a trip to South West Africa to study Welwitschia, making stops at Port Nolloth, L√ºderitz Bay, Swakopmund, Welwitsch Station and following the Swakop River to Haikamkab. In 1910 he and his wife departed Louren√ßo Marques for Kenya and Uganda, collecting in the Aberdare Mountains and returning with a new species of tree Lobelia. From 1913 on he added few specimens to his collection, which even so numbered about 16,000 by 1916 when he donated the entire collection to the National Herbarium in Pretoria. In 1917 he retired to his farm Mosdene on the Springbok Flats near Naboomspruit north of Pretoria. Here he became inspired to start collecting again. Following the lead of Dr. I.B. Pole Evans, he started an intensive botanical study of the countryside surrounding his farm. Despite failing eyesight, he was taught to drive by his son, and together they set out on a trip through the Transkei and the Eastern Cape. His wife suffered a fatal heart attack in Durban in 1933 while he was on an expedition in the mountains of the eastern Transvaal. He was a life member of the Linnean Society and joined the S. Afr. Assoc. for the Adv. of Science a year after its founding. Vol. 13 of Flowering Plants of South Africa was dedicated to him, and the University of South Africa conferred an honorary doctorate on him.

It was his actions that initiated the conflict in 1919. He was killed in October 1920, on Talbot Street in Dublin, in a shootout with British troops and spies during an aborted British Secret Service surveillance operation. Although sometimes written as Tracey, as inscribed on the commemorative plaque in Talbot Street, or even as Tracy, his surname is more usually spelled as 'Treacy'.The well-known author Tim Pat Coogan uses this form in his book 'The I.R.A.'. Early life Se√°n Allis TreacyMass card at http://www.traceyclann.com/files/Sean%20Treacy.htm came from a small- farming background in Soloheadbeg in west Tipperary. He left school aged 14 and worked as a farmer, also developing deep patriotic convictions; locally, he was seen as a promising farmer, calm, direct, ready to experiment with new methods, and intelligent. He was a member of the Gaelic League, and of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) from 1911 and the Irish Volunteers from 1913. He was picked up in the mass arrests in the aftermath of the Easter Rising in 1916 and spent much of the following two years in prison, where he went on hunger strike on several occasions. From Dundalk jail in 1918 he wrote to his comrades in Tipperary, > Deport all in favour of the enemy out of the country. Deal sternly with > those who try to resist. Maintain the strictest discipline, there must be no > running to kiss mothers goodbye.Michael Hopkinson, Irish War of > Independence, page 116 In 1918 he was appointed Vice Officer-Commanding of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade of the Irish Volunteers (which became the Irish Republican Army in 1919). The Soloheadbeg ambush On 21 January 1919 Treacy and Dan Breen, together with Se√°n Hogan, S√©umas Robinson and five other volunteers, helped to ignite the conflict that was to become the Irish War of Independence. They ambushed and shot dead two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) ‚Äî Constables Patrick O'Connell and James McDonnell ‚Äì during the Soloheadbeg Ambush near Treacy's home. Treacy led the planning for the ambush and briefed the brigade's O/C Robinson on his return from prison in late 1918. Robinson supported the plans and agreed they wouldn't go to GHQ for permission to undertake the attack.Irish Bureau of Military History - S√©umas Robinson witness statement, WS 1721 The RIC men were guarding a transport of gelignite explosives. Some accounts say the Volunteers shot them dead when they refused to surrender and offered resistance; other accounts suggest that shooting them was the intent from the start. Breen later recalled: > ...we took the action deliberately, having thought over the matter and > talked it over between us. Treacy had stated to me that the only way of > starting a war was to kill someone, and we wanted to start a war, so we > intended to kill some of the police, whom we looked upon as the foremost and > most important branch of the enemy forces... The only regret that we had > following the ambush was that there were only two policemen in it, instead > of the six we had expected...History Ireland, May 2007, p.56. The Knocklong train rescue As a result of the action, South Tipperary was placed under martial law and declared a Special Military Area under the Defence of the Realm Act. After another member of the Soloheadbeg ambush party, Se√°n Hogan, who was just 17, was arrested on 12 May 1919, the three others (Treacy, Breen and S√©umas Robinson) were joined by five men from the IRA's East Limerick Brigade to organise Hogan's rescue. Hogan was brought to the train which was intended to bring him from Thurles to Cork city on 13 May 1919 ‚Äî his escort grinning at him as he told the ticketmaster: \\"Give me three tickets to Cork ‚Äî and two returns.\\" As the train steamed across the Tipperary border and into Co Limerick the IRA party, led by Treacy, boarded the train in Knocklong. A close-range struggle ensued on the train. Treacy and Breen were seriously wounded in the gunfight. Two RIC men died, but Hogan was rescued. His rescuers rushed him into the village of Knocklong where a butcher's wife slammed down the shutters to hide them and her husband cut off his handcuffs using a cleaver. On his keeping A search for Treacy and others was mounted across Ireland. Treacy left Tipperary for Dublin to avoid capture. In Dublin, Michael Collins employed Treacy on assassination operations with \\"the Squad\\". He was involved in the attempted killing of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Sir John French in December 1919. In the summer of 1920 he returned to Tipperary and organised several attacks on RIC barracks, notably at Ballagh, Clerihan and Drangan before again moving his base of operations to Dublin. By spring 1920 the political police of both the Crimes Special Branch of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and G-Division (Special Branch) of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) had been effectively neutralised by IRA counterintelligence operatives working for Michael Collins. The British thoroughly reorganised their administration at Dublin Castle, including the appointment of Colonel Ormonde de l'√âp√©e Winter as chief of a new Combined Intelligence Service (CIS) for Ireland. Working closely with Sir Basil Thomson, Director of Civil Intelligence in the British Home Office, with Colonel Hill Dillon, Chief of British Military Intelligence in Ireland, and with the local British Secret Service Head of Station, \\"Count Sevign√©\\" at Dublin Castle, Ormonde Winter began to import dozens of professional secret service agents from all parts of the British Empire into Ireland to track down IRA operatives and Sinn F√©in leaders. Treacy and Dan Breen were relocated to Dublin, where they were directed to operate with Michael Collins' assassination unit, \\"The Squad\\". The Squad's mission was to discover and assassinate British secret agents, political policemen and their informants, and to carry out other special missions for General Headquarters (GHQ) as directed by Collins. With help from police inspectors brought up to Dublin from Tipperary, Ormonde Winter's CIS spotted Treacy and Breen after their arrival in Dublin and placed them under surveillance. Death Se√°n Tracey (sic) Commemorative plaque in Dublin's Talbot Street On 11 October 1920, Treacy and Breen were holed up in a safe house ‚Äì Fernside ‚Äì in Drumcondra on the north side of Dublin city when it was raided by a police unit, led there by a tout, Robert Pike. In the ensuing shootout, two senior British officers were wounded and died the next day, Major Smyth and Captain White, while Breen was seriously wounded. The owner of the house, Professor John Carolan of the nearby St Patrick's Teacher Training College, was put up against a wall and shot in the back of the neck by the British. Treacy and Breen managed to escape through a window and shot their way through the police cordon. The injured Breen was spirited away to Dublin's Mater hospital where he was admitted in alias persona. Treacy had been wounded but not seriously. The British search for the two was intense and Collins ordered the Squad to guard them while plans were laid for Treacy to be exfiltrated from the Dublin metropolitan area. Treacy hoped to return to Tipperary; realising that the major thoroughfares would be under surveillance, he bought a bicycle with the intention of cycling to Tipperary by back roads. When Collins learned that a public funeral for the two officers killed at Fernside was to take place on 14 October, he ordered the Squad to set up along the procession route and to take out the most powerful man in the country, the Chief Secretary for Ireland Hamar Greenwood and Lieutenant-General Henry Hugh Tudor, who had invented the Black and Tans. Four or five members of the Squad assembled at a Dublin safe house, the Republican Outfitters shop at 94 Talbot Street early on 14 October in preparation for this operation. Treacy was to join them for his own protection, but arrived late, to discover that Collins had cancelled the attack. Treacy was extremely distressed ‚Äî he and his closest friend, Dan Breen each thought that the other had been killed. Breen had managed to get away, his feet cut to ribbons by the glass of Professor Carolan's greenhouse, and was now being hidden by the medical staff in a nearby hospital. While the others quietly dispersed, Treacy lingered behind in the shop. But he had been followed by a tout, and a British Secret Service surveillance team working under Winter's direction and led by Major Carew and Lt Gilbert Price were stalking him in the hope that he would lead them to Collins or to other high- value IRA targets. Treacy realised that he was being followed, and ran for his bicycle. But he grabbed the wrong bike ‚Äî taking a machine far too big for him ‚Äî and fell. Price drew his pistol and closed in on Treacy. Treacy drew his parabellum automatic pistol and shot Price and another British agent before he was hit in the head, dying instantly.Se√°n Treacy and the Tan War (2007) publisher: Mercier Press , p.152 Rushing to the scene, Colonel Winter was horrified to see the bodies of Treacy and his own agents lying dead in Talbot Street. The entire confrontation had been witnessed by a 15-year-old Dublin trainee photographer, John J Horgan, who captured the scene moments after the shooting, showing Treacy lying dead on the pavement and Price propped up against a doorway a few feet away. Making a statement to a reporter, Ormonde Winter called the event \\"a tragedy\\". The British soldiers immediately destroyed the Republican Outfitters, riddling the shop with bullets and throwing Mills Bombs inside to wreck it. Legacy Se√°n Treacy mass card Treacy's death sent alarm bells through the upper echelons of the IRA leadership. A commemorative plaque above the door of 94 Talbot Street, now the Wooden Whisk and directly across from Talbot House, commemorates the spot where Treacy died. His coffin arrived by train at Limerick Junction station and was accompanied to St Nicholas Church, Solohead by an immense crowd of Tipperary people. He was buried at Kilfeacle graveyard, where, despite a large presence of British military personnel, a volley of shots was fired over the grave. Se√°n Treacy's death is remembered each year on the anniversary of his death at a commemoration ceremony in Kilfeacle. At noon on the morning of All- Ireland Senior Hurling Finals in which Tipperary participate, a ceremony of remembrance is held at the spot in Talbot Street, Dublin where he died,Tipperary Star - August 26, 2011 http://www.tipperarystar.ie/what-s- on/arts-culture-entertainment/tipp-will-remember-patriot-sean-treacy-on-day- of-all-ireland-1-3003751 attended mainly by people from West Tipperary and Dublin people of Tipperary extraction. The most recent ceremonies were held at midday on Sunday, 4 September 2016 and 18 August 2019 both attracting a large attendance of Tipperary folk en route to Croke Park. The ceremony usually consists of the reading of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, a recitation of a decade of the rosary in Irish, singing of 'Tipperary so far away', an oration by one of the organizing party and followed by the playing of the Irish National Anthem. The first event took place in 1922 and has been held on approximately 27 occasions as of 2019. In Thurles, Co Tipperary Se√°n Treacy Avenue is named after him. The town of Tipperary is home to the Se√°n Treacy Memorial Swimming Pool, which contains many historic items related to the Easter Rising and the War of Independence, and a copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The Se√°n Treacy GAA Club takes his name in honour and represents the parish of Hollyford, Kilcommon and Rearcross in the Slieve Felim Hills, which straddle the borderland between the historical North and South Ridings of Tipperary. He is remembered in many songs. The song Se√°n Treacy, also called Tipperary so Far Away, is about Treacy's death and is still sung with pride in west Tipperary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxyDnr3sjlQ A line from this song was quoted by former US president Ronald Reagan when he visited Tipperary in 1984: \\"And I'll never more roam, from my own native home, in Tipperary so far away\\".Speech at Ballyporeen, Tipperay by US President Ronald Reagan, June 3, 1984 The song most closely identified with him, Se√°n Treacy and Dan Breen commemorates his and Breen's escape from Fernside, and mourns his death: > Give me a Parabellum and a bandolier of shells, Take me to the Murder Gang > and I'll blow them all to hell, For just today, I heard them say that Treacy > met defeat, Our lovely S√©an is dead and gone, shot down in Talbot Street. > They were at the front and at the back; they were all around the place. None > of them anxious to attack; or meet him face to face. Lloyd George did say, > \\"You'll get your pay - and a holiday most complete\\", But none of them knew > what they would go through, in that house in Talbot Street.

Life Chrysogonus was martyred at Aquileia, probably during the Persecution of Diocletian, was buried there, and publicly venerated by the faithful of that region. He is the patron saint of Zadar. His name is found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum on two different days, 31 May and 24 November, with the topographical note \\"in Aquileia\\".Martyrologia Hieronomianum, ed. De Rossi; Duchesne in Acta SS., Nov.

It is also possible, however, that from the beginning, for some unknown reason, it was consecrated to Saint Chrysogonus and does take its name from him. About the 6th century arose a legend of the martyr that made him a Roman and brought him into relation with Saint Anastasia, evidently to explain the veneration of Chrysogonus in the Roman church that bears his name. According to this legend, Chrysogonus, at first a functionary of the vicarius Urbis, was the Christian teacher of Anastasia, the daughter of the noble Roman Praetextatus. Being thrown into prison during the persecution of Diocletian, he comforted by his letters the severely afflicted Anastasia. By order of Diocletian, Chrysogonus was brought before the emperor at Aquileia, condemned to death, and beheaded. His corpse, thrown into the sea, was washed ashore and buried by the aged priest Zoilus who is also the patron saint of Zadar. In the legend the death of the saint is placed on 23 November. The Roman Catholic Church celebrates him on 24 November, the anniversary of the dedication of the church that bears his name.Martyrologium Romanum, Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2001) The Orthodox Church celebrates his feast day on 22 December together with his spiritual daughter Saint Anastasia the Roman.

History Reconstruction of Taino village The name Baconao is related to the name of a little native who lived in the south of Cuba during the pre-Columbian period. Legend mentions a magical tree, called bacona, that allowed the child to play music from the lagoon's snails. This little Cuban was known for his fishing and swimming skills, as well as playing Batos (Cuban original baseball game). The child used to sit under the bacona tree to play music from his snail. Everybody in the village was fascinated, and thought that the ability to play the music was a gift from the magical tree. Therefore, they began to call the child Baconao. One day, the young boy left the village for a trip, and never came back. The villagers believed that the child's magic returned to the trees, and as time passed, the whole area got the name Baconao.

The purpose of the casing pipe is as follows: * prevent the collapse of the borehole * prevent formation fluids from entering the borehole in an uncontrolled way (blow out) * prevent fluids in the borehole ( such as produced oil or gas, drilling mud etc.) from entering other formations Background The pipe segments (called \\"joints\\") are typically about in length, male threaded on each end and connected with short lengths of double-female threaded pipe called couplings. (Some specialty casing is manufactured in one piece with a female thread machined directly into one end.) Specification 5C3 of the American Petroleum Institute standardizes 14 casing sizes from to outside diameter (\\"OD\\").Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe used as Casing or Tubing; and Performance Properties Tables for Casing and Tubing: 7th Edition, 2008, American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street NW, Washington DC 20005-4070 USA This and related API documents also promulgate standards for the threaded end finish, the wall thickness (several are available in each size to satisfy various design parameters, and in fact are indirectly specified by standardized nominal weights per linear foot; thicker pipe obviously being heavier), and the strength and certain chemical characteristics of the steel material. Several material strengths‚Äîtermed \\"Grades\\" and ranging from to minimum yield strength‚Äîare available for most combinations of OD and wall thickness to meet various design needs. Finally, the API publications provide performance minimums for longitudinal strength (\\"joint strength\\") as well as resistance to internal (bursting) and external (collapsing) pressure differentials. A typical piece of casing might be described as 9-5/8\\" 53.5# P-110 LT&C; Rg 3: specifying OD, weight per foot (53.5 lbm/ft thus 0.545-inch wall thickness and 8.535-inch inside diameter), steel strength (110,000 psi yield strength), end finish (\\"Long Threaded and Coupled\\"), and approximate length (\\"Range 3\\" usually runs between 40 and 42 feet). Casing is run to protect or isolate formations adjacent to the wellbore. It is generally not possible to drill a well through all of the formations from surface (or the seabed) to the target depth in one hole-size section. For example, fresh-water-bearing zones (usually found only near the surface) must be protected soon after being penetrated. The well is therefore drilled in sections, with each section of the well being sealed off by lining the inside of the borehole with steel pipe, known as casing, and filling the annular space (or at least the lower portion) between this casing string and the borehole wall with cement. Then drilling commences on the subsequent hole section, necessarily with a smaller bit diameter that will pass through the newly installed casing. A liner is a casing string that does not extend to the surface, being hung instead from a liner hanger set inside of the previous casing string but usually within about of its bottom. Other than the obvious cost savings, the liner installation allows larger drill pipe or production tubing to be used in the upper portions of the well. (A disadvantage is the occasional difficulty in effecting a pressure seal by squeeze cementing the casing-liner overlap zone.) Depending on the conditions encountered (e.g., zones of differing formation pressure gradients), three or four casing strings may be required to reach the target depth. The cost of the casing can constitute 20-30% of the total cost of the well, and failure can be catastrophic. Great care must therefore be taken when designing an economic casing programme that will meet the requirements of the well.

Thus, an object that exists in time has temporal parts in the various subregions of the total region of time it occupies, just like an object that exists in a region of space has at least one part in every subregion of that space. Four-dimensionalists typically argue for treating time as analogous to space, usually leading them to endorse the doctrine of eternalism. This is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of time, according to which all points in time are equally \\"real\\", as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present is real. As some eternalists argue by analogy, just as all spatially distant objects and events are equally as real as those close to us, temporally distant objects and events are as real as those currently present to us. Perdurantism‚Äîor perdurance theory‚Äîis a closely related philosophical theory of persistence and identity, according to which an individual has distinct temporal parts throughout its existence, and the persisting object is the sum or set of all of its temporal parts. This sum or set is colloquially referred to as a \\"space-time worm\\", which has earned the perdurantist view the moniker of \\"the worm view\\". While all perdurantists are plausibly considered four dimensionalists, at least one variety of four dimensionalism does not count as perdurantist in nature. This variety, known as exdurantism or the \\"stage view\\", is closely akin to the perdurantist position. They also countenance a view of persisting objects which have temporal parts that succeed one another through time. However, instead of identifying the persisting object as the entire set or sum of its temporal parts, the exdurantist argues that any object under discussion is a single stage (time-slice, temporal part, etc.), and that the other stages or parts which compose the persisting object are related to that part by a \\"temporal counterpart\\" relation. Though they have often been conflated, eternalism is a theory of what time is like and what times exist, while perdurantism is a theory about persisting objects and their identity conditions over time. Eternalism and perdurantism tend to be discussed together because many philosophers argue for a combination of eternalism and perdurantism. Sider (1997) uses the term four-dimensionalism to refer to perdurantism, but Michael Rea uses the term \\"four-dimensionalism\\" to mean the view that presentism is false as opposed to \\"perdurantism\\", the view that endurantism is false and persisting objects have temporal parts.  Four- dimensionalism about material objects  Four-dimensionalism is a name for different positions. One of these uses four-dimensionalism as a position of material objects with respect to dimensions. Four-dimensionalism is the view that in addition to spatial parts, objects have temporal parts. According to this view, four-dimensionalism cannot be used as a synonym for perdurantism. Perdurantists have to hold a four-dimensional view of material objects: it is impossible that perdurantists, who believe that objects persist by having different temporal parts at different times, do not believe in temporal parts. However, the reverse is not true. Four-dimensionalism is compatible with either perdurantism or exdurantism. A-series and B-series J.M.E. McTaggart in The Unreality of Time identified two descriptions of time, which he called the A-series and the B-series. The A-series identifies positions in time as past, present, or future, and thus assumes that the \\"present\\" has some objective reality, as in both presentism and the growing block universe.Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold by Dean Zimmerman, p. 7 The B-series defines a given event as earlier or later than another event, but does not assume an objective present, as in four-dimensionalism. Much of the contemporary literature in the metaphysics of time has been taken to spring forth from this distinction, and thus takes McTaggart's work as its starting point. Contrast with three-dimensionalism Unlike the four dimensionalist, the three dimensionalist considers time to be a unique dimension that is not analogous to the three spatial dimensions: length, width and height. Whereas the four dimensionalist proposes that objects are extended across time, the three dimensionalist adheres to the belief that all objects are wholly present at any moment at which they exist. While the three dimensionalist agrees that the parts of an object can be differentiated based on their spatial dimensions, they do not believe an object can be differentiated into temporal parts across time. For example, in the three dimensionalist account, \\"Descartes in 1635\\" is the same object as \\"Descartes in 1620\\", and both are identical to Descartes, himself. However, the four dimensionalist considers these to be distinct temporal parts.  Prominent arguments in favor of four- dimensionalism  Several lines of argumentation have been advanced in favor of four-dimensionalism: Firstly, four-dimensional accounts of time are argued to better explain paradoxes of change over time (often referred to as the paradox of the Ship of Theseus) than three-dimensional theories. A contemporary account of this paradox is introduced in Ney (2014), but the original problem has its roots in Greek antiquity. A typical Ship of Theseus paradox involves taking some changeable object with multiple material parts, for example a ship, then sequentially removing and replacing its parts until none of the original components are left. At each stage of the replacement, the ship is presumably identical with the original, since the replacement of a single part need not destroy the ship and create an entirely new one. But, it is also plausible that an object with none of the same material parts as another is not identical with the original object. So, how can an object survive the replacement of any of its parts, and in fact all of its parts? The four-dimensionalist can argue that the persisting object is a single space- time worm which has all the replacement stages as temporal parts, or in the case of the stage view that each succeeding stage bears a temporal counterpart relation to the original stage under discussion. Secondly, problems of temporary intrinsics are argued to be best explained by four-dimensional views of time that involve temporal parts. As presented by David Lewis, the problem of temporary intrinsics involves properties of an object that are both had by that object regardless of how anything else in the world is (and thus intrinsic), and subject to change over time (thus temporary). Shape is argued to be one such property. So, if an object is capable of having a particular shape, and also changing its shape at another time, there must be some way for the same object to be, say, both round and square. Lewis argues that separate temporal parts having the incompatible properties best explains an object being able to change its shape in this way, because other accounts of three- dimensional time eliminate intrinsic properties by indexing them to times and making them relational instead of intrinsic.

He was known primarily as Julius Arnold, but among his aliases were \\"Jules Arndtsteyn\\", \\"Nick Arnold,\\" \\"Nicholas Arnold\\", \\"Wallace Ames\\", \\"John Adams\\", and \\"J. Willard Adair\\". He was best known as the second husband of entertainer Fanny Brice. Life and career Arnstein was born Julius Arndstein in Berlin, German Empire.Birth of Julius Arndstein, 1 July 1879, son of Thekla Gerhardine Arndtstein; Berlin, Germany, Births, 1874-1899Jules Arndtsteyn, born Berlin, Germany, July 1, 1879, in U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 His father, Moses Arndstein, was a German Jew from Berlin who fought in the Franco-Prussian War. His mother, born Thekla van Shaw, was Dutch. The couple raised their children in the Episcopal Church. First settling in New Jersey, the couple had two other children besides middle-child Nicky; son Louis (born 1877), and daughter Gesina (born 1883).US Census 1900 ‚Äì New York City, District 593, Page 30 \\"Nicky\\" was short for nickel plate, a sobriquet bestowed in the 1890s when, as a boy, Arnstein rode a gleaming nickel-plated bicycle in the then-popular bike racing craze. However, he spent more time throwing races than winning them. He graduated to gambling on transatlantic liners and in European casinos, and eventually fell in with Arnold Rothstein, a loan shark, bookmaker, fence, Wall Street swindler, real estate speculator, and labor racketeer, who was best known for fixing the 1919 World Series. In 1915, Arnstein was convicted of swindling, and the following year he entered Sing Sing to serve out his term. Fanny Brice visited him every week while he was there, and in 1918 Arnstein's wife Carrie sued her for alienation of his affection. She subsequently divorced him, leaving him free to marry Brice in October of that year. Arnstein and Brice had two children, daughter Frances Arnstein Stark (1919-1992) and son William Arnstein (1921-2008) a graphic artist later known professionally as William Brice. On May 16, 1924, having been convicted of conspiracy to carry stolen securities into the District of Columbia, Arnstein entered Leavenworth prison, where he remained for three years. Brice divorced him on September 17, 1927, soon after his release. Arnstein remained out of trouble for the rest of his life. He lived long enough to see himself immortalized in the 1964 Broadway musical Funny Girl, in which he was portrayed by Sydney Chaplin. In the musical, Arnstein is found guilty of embezzlement, has never been married to anyone but Fanny, and serves only one prison sentence ‚Äì after being married for several years. Omar Sharif assumed the role in the 1968 film and its 1975 sequel, Funny Lady.

The prison is operated by G4S. History Altcourse became the first prison to be procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract when the contract was signed in December 1995. It was built by Tarmac Construction and opened in December 1997. While early reports about the management of the prison were favourable, the financing of the project drew criticism after it emerged that former owner GSL had managed to make a ¬£10 million windfall from the contracts. In 2005 it was reported that Altcourse was the most overcrowded prison in England with 1,324 inmates. In November 2009, the prison's own Independent Monitoring Board published a report which criticised the amount of illegal drugs that were being smuggled into Altcourse. The report suggested that mobile phones (which were also being smuggled into the jail) were helping to fuel the trade.Prison control in 'parlous state' BBC News, 5 November 2009 A month later, it emerged that inmates at Altcourse were being given access to satellite television as a reward for good behaviour.Inmates given satellite TV access BBC News, 17 December 2009 The prison today Altcourse is a Category B local prison, receiving prisoners from the courts in Lancashire, Merseyside, Cheshire and North Wales. The prison accepts young offenders and adult male prisoners who are both sentenced and remanded by the courts.

It was followed by two all-ages consumer ports for the PlayStation, retitled as Water Summer, and the Dreamcast on July 18, 2002, which was subsequently followed by an all-ages version for Windows, released on July 25, 2003. An expanded version, entitled , was released in Japan on September 24, 2004 with the adult content found in the original version, followed by a European release on April 25, 2009, and was again ported to the PlayStation 2, entitled , released on August 30, 2007 with the adult content removed. The gameplay in Suika follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the main female characters. Suika has made several transitions to other media. A light novel was published by Paradigm in November 2001 and a set of four drama CDs were produced between August 2002 and January 2003. A four-episode adult original video animation created by Moon Rock was released between February 25, 2003 and June 25, 2003 as three DVDs containing one episode each, followed by a DVD box-set released on April 25, 2004 containing an extra episode, and was subsequently licensed for sale in North America under the title Wet Summer Days by Kitty Media. Gameplay The Suika visual novel is divided into four chapters which contain different stories and characters, though all take place in the same rural town known as Tokiwa Village. In a short prologue upon starting a new game, the player assumes the role of Hiroshi Inaba as he arrives back in town for his annual visit of friends and family. It is here that the two heroines for the two upcoming chapters are seen through his eyes. In the first chapter, the player assumes the role of Akira Kazama and centers around his interaction with the first chapter's sole main heroine Itsuki Minase (voiced by Minami Nagasaki). In the second chapter, the protagonist is Souji Kamishiro who interacts with the second chapter's two main heroines Sayaka Shirakawa (voiced by Kanon Torii) and Mie Wakabayashi (voiced by Junko Kusayanagi). In the third chapter, the player plays as Yoshikazu Masaki who interacts with two heroines, Akane Masaki (voiced by Yura Hinata) and Touko Kyouya (voiced by Komugi Nishida). In the fourth and final chapter, the player returns to Hiroshi Inaba. This chapter centers around his interaction with a heroine who remains nameless throughout the story (voiced by Hiyori Haruno in Original and Azumi Nakatani in A.S.). Suika's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent reading the text that appears on the game screen, which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through the text, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\" where he or she must choose from multiple options. The time between these decision points varies. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines the player experiences‚Äîone for each heroine. The player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices during decision points to view all five plot lines. One of the goals of the original version's gameplay is for the player to enable the viewing of hentai scenes depicting the given protagonist and one of the heroines having sex. Development Suika is the fourth project developed by the visual novel studio Circus, and the second by their Northern subdivision. The producer for Suika was Tororo, president of Circus, who was also one of the two music composers, the other being Kometto Nekono. The planning for Suika was headed by Mikage, and was one of the two scenario writers along with Ichir≈ç Go. Art direction and character design was split between Naru Nanao and Takanon Ikuta. Programming for the game was provided by Takanori. Tororo, Mikage, and Naru Nanao went on to create titles such as Da Capo, with the latter two later collaborating to help develop Minori's Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. Release history Suika was first available to be public on July 27, 2001, as a CD-ROM for Windows, containing adult content. It was followed by a DVD-ROM release, with various technical improvements, on August 31, 2001. Both versions were released as both a limited edition and a regular edition. The limited edition contained an arrange soundtrack album, a calendar, in addition to a T-shirt included in only the DVD-ROM release; the regular editions did not contain the aforementioned extras. The next year, the original releases of Suika were followed by two consumer console ports for the PlayStation, renamed as Water Summer, and the Dreamcast. Both versions were published by PrincessSoft, and were released on July 18, 2002 as both a limited edition and a regular edition, with the adult content found in the original release removed. The limited edition of both the PS and the DC version were limited in quantity, with fifteen-thousand units manufactured for the PS version, and twenty- thousand for the DC version. It was subsequently followed by an all-ages version published by S.O.F.T., released on July 25, 2003 for Windows. An enhanced re-release based on the all-ages version, entitled , was published by Circus in Japan on September 24, 2004 with extended scenario and the adult content found in the original version. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 in limited and regular editions on August 30, 2007 under the title with adult content once again removed. The game was released downloadable on the Internet in English published by the European-based company MangaGamer on April 25, 2009.

Biography Professional career Mizrahi is the senior partner in the B. Arnon ‚Äì S. Mizrahi law office, and specializes in traffic violation cases. In 2006, he defended the prominent attorney Dori Klagsbald, in a high-profile case of manslaughter, following the death of two, a mother and child, that were killed by Klagsbald's vehicle. Maccabi Tel Aviv Mizrahi was appointed the chairman of the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club in 1969.Shimon Mizrahi International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame In the wake of the club's financial problems, he introduced various strategies to rescue Maccabi from bankruptcy, such as selling tickets for Maccabi games, which had previously been free. Mizrahi realized that in order to secure Maccabi's dominance in the Israeli Super League, it would have to sign American players. Since he became the club's chairman in 1969, Maccabi has won 44 Israeli Super League championships, winning the league's title in all but seven seasons (1992‚Äì93, 2007‚Äì08, 2009‚Äì10, 2012‚Äì13, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, and 2016‚Äì17). The club has also won 36 Israeli State Cup and 7 Israeli League Cup titles during his tenure. The club also won the Adriatic League championship (2012), with Mizrahi running the club. However, Maccabi's main achievement during his time as the club's chairman, includes the winning of 6 top-tier level European-wide titles, as they won the EuroLeague championship 5 times (1977, 1981, 2004, 2005, and 2014), and also the FIBA SuproLeague championship (2001). Mizrahi was at one time accused by rival clubs of failing to make the Israeli Super League more competitive, by having plans to implement payment limits to players. However, Mizrahi agreed to several new league rules which were meant to weaken Maccabi, such as the Brisker Rule, which limits the number of foreign players every team can sign, and the implementation of a Final Four format, instead of a best-of-five playoff series system, among other rule changes.

The Paragon XP/S is a productized version of the experimental Touchstone Delta system that was built at Caltech, launched in 1992. The Paragon superseded Intel's earlier iPSC/860 system, to which it is closely related. The Paragon series is based on the Intel i860 RISC microprocessor. Up to 2048 (later, up to 4096) i860s are connected in a 2D grid. In 1993, an entry-level Paragon XP/E variant was announced with up to 32 compute nodes. Mesh interconnect on XP/E cabinet The system architecture is a partitioned system, with the majority of the system comprising diskless compute nodes and a small number of I/O nodes interactive service nodes. Since the bulk of the nodes have no permanent storage, it is possible to \\"Red/Black switch\\" the compute partition from classified to unclassified by disconnecting one set of I/O nodes with classified disks and then connecting an unclassified I/O partition. Intel intended the Paragon to run the OSF/1 AD distributed operating system on all processors. However, this was found to be inefficient in practice, and a light-weight kernel called SUNMOS was developed at Sandia National Laboratories to replace OSF/1 AD on the Paragon's compute processors. Oak Ridge National Laboratory operated a Paragon XP/S 150 MP, one of the largest Paragon systems, for several years. The prototype for the Intel Paragon was the Intel Delta, built by Intel with funding from DARPA and installed operationally at the California Institute of Technology in the late 1980s with funding from the National Science Foundation. The Delta was one of the few computers to sit significantly above the curve of Moore's Law.

Each node has a B-NIC interface that connects to the mesh routers on the backplane. The compute nodes are diskless and performed all I/O over the mesh. During system software development, a light-pen was duct-taped to the status LED on one board and a timer interrupt was used to bit bang a serial port. The B-NIC ASIC is the square chip with the circular heat-sink.

Morrison' which comprised the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States and the Unfederated Malay States. It consisted mainly of small garrison forces in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Taiping, Seremban and Singapore. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the command reinforced its strength in anticipation of an attack. With the bulk of British forces being tied down in the war in Europe and the Near East, the command was mainly augmented by units from India. On 18 November 1940, the command was placed under the command of the British Far East Command and later, on 7 January 1942, under the short-lived South West Pacific Command or ABDACOM, which was tasked to maintain control of the \\"Malay Barrier\\" (or \\"East Indies Barrier\\"), a notional line running down the Malayan Peninsula, through Singapore and the southernmost islands of the Dutch East Indies. The command was disbanded on 15 February 1942 with the surrender of all Commonwealth forces in the conclusion of the Battle of Singapore. With the Surrender of Japan, the command was re-formed from the 14th Army with its HQ based in Singapore on 1 November 1945. The command was divided and downgraded to two separate military districts; the Malaya District and Singapore District in August 1947 but was upgraded again into a full command in August 1950 due to the Malayan Emergency. With the independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957, the command was disbanded and succeeded by Overseas Commonwealth Land Forces (Malaya). Formation and Structure In November 1940, the total strength of Malaya Command was 17 battalions. The Indian Army contingent was mainly organised as III Corps with their HQ based in Kuala Lumpur. When Japanese forces invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya in charge of Malaya Command, with a force of 88,600 faced the 70,000 strong Twenty Fifth Army of the Imperial Japanese Army under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita.

Her family had immigrated and she was orphaned when young. Raised in foster homes, she later was acclaimed for her books of fiction for adults and young people that stressed supportive relationships. Guy lived and worked in New York City, where she was among the founders of the Harlem Writers Guild in 1950. It was highly influential in encouraging African- American writers to gain publication and had a high rate of success. Guy died of cancer on June 3, 2012. Inscription by Rosa Guy on the flyleaf of a copy of her novel A Measure of Time: 'To Walter Gaye my old and dear friend luck! Rosa Guy 6/29/83' (with a pencilled footnote in a different hand: 'and ex- \\"husband\\" ') Pencilled note (in the same copy of A Measure of Time as the above inscription): 'Rosa does not acknowledge this, but Dorine is a portrait of _her_ _stepmother_ ' Early years Rosa Cuthbert was born in 1922 in Diego Martin, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. She and her younger sister Ameze were left with relatives when their parents Audrey and Henry Cuthbert emigrated in 1927 to the United States. The children did not join their parents in Harlem, New York, until 1932. The following year their mother became ill, and Rosa and her sister were sent to Brooklyn to live with a cousin.Margaret Busby, \\"Rosa Guy obituary\\", The Guardian, June 17, 2012. The cousin's espousal of Garveyism and black nationalistic politics deeply affected Rosa. After their mother's death in 1934, the two girls returned to Harlem to live with their father, who remarried. When their father died in 1937, the orphaned girls were taken into the welfare system and lived in foster homes. Rosa left school at the age of 14 and took a job in a garment factory to support herself and her sister. Career In 1941, at the age of 19, Rosa met and married Warner Guy. While her husband was serving in the Second World War, she continued working in the factory. A co-worker introduced her to the American Negro Theatre, where she studied acting; other graduates included Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier. In 1942, her son Warren Guy, Jr, was born. After the war, Rosa Guy moved to Connecticut with her husband and son. Five years later she and her husband divorced, and she returned to New York City. Writers' community In 1950, along with novelist John Oliver Killens, Guy formed a workshop that was to become the Harlem Writers Guild (HWG). Its goal was \\"to develop and aid in the publication of works by writers of the African Diaspora\\". Its members and participants included Willard Moore, Walter Christmas, Maya Angelou, Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Paule Marshall, Audre Lorde, Alice Childress, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, and Douglas Turner Ward. The Guild was very influential, nurturing more than half of all successful African-American writers between 1950 and 1971; they were associated with the workshop. Guy also belonged to On Guard for Freedom, a Black nationalist literary organization founded by Calvin Hicks on the Lower East Side of New York City. Other members included LeRoi Jones, Sarah E. Wright and Harold Cruse. On Guard was active in the political realm, supporting Congolese liberation leader Patrice Lumumba and protesting the United States-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion at Cuba. In 1954, Guy wrote and performed in her first play, Venetian Blinds, which was successfully produced Off-Broadway at the Tropical Theater. Publications Two stories by Guy, \\"Magnify\\" and \\"Carnival\\", appeared in the Trinidad Nation newspaper in 1965. The following year her first novel, Bird at My Window, was published. Maya Angelou commented on this novel and said: > This book was welcomed when it was first published in 1966. Its brave > examination of a loving, yet painful, relationship between a Black mother > and her son is even more important today. Rosa Guy is a fine writer and she > continuously gives us new issues to contemplate. Welcome Bird at My Window. After the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, Guy set out to record the voices of young black Americans in a 1970 documentary work entitled Children of Longing, which contains first-hand accounts of the experiences and aspirations of young people \\"growing up in a hostile world\\".\\"Children of Longing\\", Kirkus Reviews.\\"Rosa Guy\\" (obituary), The Sunday Times, July 9, 2011. She traveled in the Caribbean, living for a while in Haiti and Trinidad.\\"Rosa Guy\\", Encyclopaedia Britannica. Most of Guy's books are about the dependability of family members and friends who care and love each other, and her trilogy of novels for young people ‚Äî The Friends (1973), Ruby (1976), and Edith Jackson (1978) ‚Äî is based on her own personal experiences, as well as those of many young African Americans growing up in New York City with little or no money or support from family. Ruby tells the story of a young girl seeking love and friendship, who finds it in Daphne Duprey, allowing both girls a new insight of relationships and love. Guy's 1985 novel, My Love, My Love: Or, The Peasant Girl, has been described as a Caribbean re-telling of Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Little Mermaid\\"\\"The Modern Mermaid\\" Epinions. \\"with a dash of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\\"Dante J.J. Bevilacqua, \\"T&C; Players create an upbeat, energetic 'Island'\\", Montgomery Media, July 11, 2012. In the tale, Desiree is a beautiful peasant who falls in love with a handsome upper-class boy whom she saved in an accident. His family does not approve of Desiree, for she is too black and too poor for their son who will be king. Concepts of sacrifice and pure love reign throughout the novel. It was adapted for the Broadway musical, Once on This Island by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The show's original cast ran for a year, from 1990 to 1991, and was then revived in December 2017 at Circle in the Square Theater. It won the 2018 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. Death Rosa Guy died of cancer in 2012 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, aged 89. Her obituary was included in The Socialite who Killed a Nazi with Her Bare Hands: And 144 Other Fascinating People who Died this Year, a collection of New York Times obituaries published in 2012. Awards Rosa Guy's work has received The New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year citation (for The Friends, in 1973), the Coretta Scott King Award, and the American Library Association's Best Book for Young Adults Award.Barbara Thrash Murphy, Black Authors and Illustrators of Books for Children and Young Adults: A Biographical Dictionary, Garland Publishing, 1999, p. 163.

His best-known cartoon character is Old Bill. Bill and his pals Bert and Alf featured in Bairnsfather's weekly \\"Fragments from France\\" cartoons published weekly in \\"The Bystander\\" magazine during the First World War. Early life Bairnsfather was born at Murree, British India (now Pakistan) to Major Thomas Henry Bairnsfather (1859‚Äì1944), of the Indian Staff Corps, and (Amelia) Jane Eliza, daughter of Edward Every-Clayton and grand- daughter of Henry Every, 9th Baronet. His parents were second cousins, both being great-grandchildren of Edward Every, 8th Baronet.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 1, ed. Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 1360The Biography of Bruce Bairnsfather: In Search of the Better 'Ole, Tonie and Valmai Holt, Pen and Sword Military, 2014, p. 12 He spent his early life in India, but was brought to England in 1895 to be educated at the United Services College, Westward Ho!, then at Stratford-upon- Avon. Initially intending a military career, he failed entrance exams to Sandhurst and Woolwich Military Academies but joined the Cheshire Regiment. He resigned in 1907 to become an artist, studying at the John Hassall School of Art. Unsuccessful at first, he worked as an electrical engineer. Working in this capacity for the Old Memorial Theatre, Stratford, brought him into acquaintance with Marie Corelli, who introduced him to Thomas Lipton, a connection that led to commissions to draw advertising sketches for Lipton tea, Player's cigarettes, Keen's Mustard, and Beecham's Pills. World War I service \\"Well, if you knows of a better 'ole, go to it\\", Bairnsfather's best-known cartoon, 1915 \\"Old Bill\\", from Bullets & Billets: \\"First Discovered in the Alluvial Deposits of Southern Flanders. Feeds Almost Exclusively on Jam and Water Biscuits. Hobby: Filling Sandbags, on Dark and Rainy Nights\\". In 1914, he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a second lieutenant and served with a machine gun unit in France until 1915, when he was hospitalised with shellshock and hearing damage sustained during the Second Battle of Ypres. Posted to the 34th Division headquarters on Salisbury Plain, he developed his humorous series for the Bystander about life in the trenches, featuring \\"Old Bill\\", a curmudgeonly soldier with trademark walrus moustache and balaclava. The best remembered of these shows Bill with another trooper in a muddy shell hole with shells whizzing all around. The other trooper is grumbling and Bill advises: Many of his cartoons from this period were collected in Fragments From France (1914) and the autobiographical Bullets & Billets (1916). Despite the immense popularity with the troops and massive sales increase for the Bystander, initially there were objections to the \\"vulgar caricature\\". Nevertheless, their success in raising morale led to Bairnsfather's promotion and receipt of a War Office appointment to draw similar cartoons for other Allies forces. Post-war In 1921, Bairnsfather married Cecilia Agnes Scott (n√©e Bruton), the divorced wife of Hon Michael Scott. \\"Old Bill\\" and Bairnsfather himself continued in popularity between the World Wars. Many police officers of the time had similar facial hair, and that may have led to British police being referred to as The Old Bill. \\"The Bill\\" was a British t.v. series which incorrectly shortened the original commonly- used phrase. Bairnsfather was the subject of one of the first British sound films in 1927, wrote and directed the 1928 Canadian film Carry On Sergeant, and took part in the early Alexandra Palace television transmissions in 1936. Old Bill appeared in numerous books, plays, musicals and films. In 1939 he published an autobiography, \\"Wide Canvas\\". In World War II, he continued Old Bill work, but was not asked to help with the British war effort. Instead, he became official cartoonist to the American forces in Europe, contributing to Stars and Stripes and Yank, whilst residing at Cresswell House in Clun, Shropshire. He also drew cartoons at American bases and nose art on aircraft. His works are considered to have influenced artists such as Bill Mauldin. In later life, he had found himself typecast as the creator of Old Bill, and his Times obituary concluded of his career that he was \\"fortunate in possessing a talent ... which suited almost to the point of genius one particular moment and one particular set of circumstances; and he was unfortunate in that he was never able to adapt, at all happily, his talent to new times and new circumstances\\".Capt.

Legacy A commemorative blue plaque appears outside one of his old studios, 1 Sterling Street, Knightsbridge London (). The blue plaque was initiated by Tonie and Valmai Holt who later wrote Bairnsfather's biography (In Search of the Better Ole ‚Äì the Life, the Works and the Collectables of Bruce Bairnsfather) and also sponsored a memorial plaque to Bairnsfather on the cottage at St Yvon in Belgium at the edge of Plugstreet Wood where Bairnsfather drew his first 'trench' cartoons. A plaque commemorating Bruce Bairnsfather was unveiled at his former home, Victoria Spa Lodge, Bishopton, Stratford upon Avon () on 10 September 2005 by cartoonist Bill Tidy. The plaque was instigated by Mark Warby, Editor of The Old Bill Newsletter, the official journal for Bairnsfather enthusiasts and collectors. On 24 September 2011, a plaque commemorating Bruce Bairnsfather was unveiled on the wall of Colwall Royal British Legion Club in Crescent Road, Colwall, near Malvern in Worcestershire. The plaque was instigated by the Colwall Village Society and was unveiled by Mark Warby. Bairnsfather lived in Colwall from 1951 to 1954 and was well-known at the British Legion Club in the village.

Early life Dunstone was born in 1964, in the town of Saffron Walden in Essex.

He was 25 years old and had ¬£6,000 of savings to start his business, having previously worked at NEC as a sales executive. It was whilst working at NEC that he first spotted the potential of mobile phones and the future of mobile communications. At that time, handsets were large, cumbersome and mainly purchased by big business and large organisations. Corporate clients were well catered for but small businesses, the self-employed and general public had nowhere to go. Dunstone realised that mobile phones would eventually become ubiquitous and named his company The Carphone Warehouse (CPW) to serve this larger market. In July 2000 the company floated on the London Stock Exchange and based on an Issue price of 200p, the company was valued at approximately ¬£1.7 billion. In 2003 Carphone Warehouse established a subsidiary TalkTalk, from the assets acquired through the purchase of Opal Telecom in 2002. TalkTalk provided homephone and broadband into the UK market. TalkTalk aggressive pricing was disruptive to the market and grew its customer base rapidly. Growth was also through acquisition, purchasing one.tel, AOL, Tele2 and lastly the Tiscali ISP businesses in the UK, this led to the demerger of TalkTalk as a separate business in March 2010. In December 2019, Dunstone purchased ¬£10 million worth of shares in TalkTalk, meaning he now owns 29.5% of the company's stock. In May 2008, Best Buy, an American multinational consumer electronics corporation, and CPW agreed to create a new company, Best Buy Europe. Best Buy acquired 50% of CPW's European and US retail interests for a cash consideration of ¬£1.1 billion or $2.1 billion. The assets of the newly formed company comprise CPW's existing retail business, operating from more than 2,400 stores in nine European countries under CPW and Phone House brands. These include the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. CPW became the world's largest independent mobile communications retailer, but may now have lost this position. In 2005 Dunstone's salary and bonus came to ¬£689,000.

Neighbourhoods built based on the note are known as Vinex-wijken (Vinex neighbourhoods). To accommodate the increasing population in the Netherlands the Ministry of VROM determined a number of main points in the Vinex-document for the construction of new housing districts starting in 1993. New districts had to be placed near existing town centers and had to contribute to the following aims: * Endorsement of existing malls (Increasing the potential number of customers) * Limit the removals of unsatisfied inhabitants in medium-large cities * Protection of open areas by concentrating the agglomerations around existing medium-large cities * Limit traffic between residencies, work and stores (short distances offer more possibilities for public transport, bicycles and walking) The Vinex-locations also had to diminish the unfair pricing of housing. This means that certain households live in housing that is too affordable when compared to their income, as a result of which these houses no longer become available to households with a lower income. So they tried to solve the shortage of affordable housing by luring wealthier households to the more expensive Vinex-locations.

Biography Ebenezer Kinnersley was a son of Rev. William Kinnersley, an assistant pastor of the Lower Dublin Baptist church. Ebenezer became a member of this church while young, and in 1743 was ordained as a minister, but he never served as a pastor. He travelled to America with his parents in 1714. His early life was passed at Dublin, and then he went to Philadelphia, where he gave evidence of his genius as a scholar and mechanician. It is supposed that he taught a school there and associated with Benjamin Franklin, who soon learned to appreciate young Kinnersley, whom he designates as \\"an ingenious neighbor.\\" When Franklin saw Dr. Spence, a Scotsman in Boston, experiment with a glass tube and silk, and observed the effects that were produced, he communicated the fact to his associates in Philadelphia, and soon a hundred tubes were in use. Among those who devoted special attention to the subject were Franklin, Kinnersley, Philip Syng, and Thomas Hopkinson. Kinnersley devoted all his time to the subject, and in a couple of years the discoveries that were made were such as to astound the learned of Europe, to whom they were communicated by Franklin in his letters to the well-known Peter Collinson, of London, by whom they were published. It was thus that \\"The Philadelphia experiments\\" became known and the names of Franklin and Kinnersley were prominently associated with them and the discoveries that were made. The \\"electric fire,\\" as it was then termed, was a subject that engrossed scientific scholars in England and on the continent of Europe, but the Philadelphia philosophers appeared to surpass all in their discoveries. In 1748, Kinnersley demonstrated that the electric fluid actually passed through water, and proved it by a trough ten feet long full of water. He also invented the \\"magical picture\\" referred to by the Abb√© Nollet, and produced the ringing of chimes of bells. In 1751 he began delivering lectures on \\"The Newly Discovered Electrical Fire\\" ‚Äî the first of the kind in America or Europe. His advertisement in the \\"Pennsylvania Gazette\\" of 11 April 1751, is as follows: \\"Notice is hereby given to the Curious, that Wednesday next, Mr. Kinnersley proposes to begin a course of experiments on the newly discovered Electrical Fire, containing not only the most curious of those that have been made and published in Europe, but a considerable number of new ones lately made in this city, to be accompanied with methodical Lectures on the nature and properties of that wonderful element.\\" These lectures proved a complete success, and were attended by persons of all classes. In September 1751, he went to Boston with a letter from Franklin to Gov. James Bowdoin, and delivered his lectures in Faneuil Hall. The governor said they \\"were pleasing to all sorts of people and were very curious.\\" While at Boston, Kinnersley continued his experiments and discovered the difference between the electricity that was produced by the glass and sulphur globes, which he at once communicated to Franklin at Philadelphia. Until then the theory of Du Fay as to the vitreous and resinous electricity was generally adopted, but now Kinnersley showed beyond a doubt that the positive and negative theory was correct. From Boston, Kinnersley went to Newport, Rhode Island, and, in March 1752, repeated his lectures there and suggested how houses and barns might be protected from lightning. This was three months before the time that Franklin drew the electricity from the clouds. He then visited New York and lectured on the subject. In 1753, Kinnersley was elected chief master in the College of Philadelphia, and in 1755 he was appointed professor of English and oratory, holding the office until 1772, when, owing to failing health, he resigned. Kinnersley continued his experiments, invented an electrical thermometer, and proved that heat could be produced by electricity, which was not known before. In 1764, he published a syllabus of his lectures on electricity, a copy of which is in the Philadelphia Public Library. This pamphlet gave in detail most of the experiments that he performed, among others an orrery propelled by electricity; and he suggested that perhaps the solar system might be sustained in the same way. In the United States, he was better known than Franklin, and even in Europe his name was very frequently mentioned, as may be seen in Joseph Priestley's History of Electricity, and in a volume published by the Abb√© Beccaria of the University of Turin. He was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1768, and the degree of M.A. was conferred upon him by the College of Philadelphia.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols.

It is one of the larger British colleges with thousands of learners each year.  Campuses  The college is based at three sites in Bournemouth and Poole. It's based at Lansdowne (in Bournemouth), North Road (in Poole) and The Fulcrum (Poole). Lansdowne The Lansdowne campus is located on the eastern side of Bournemouth town centre on the roundabout linking Bath Road, Meyrick Road, Christchurch Road and Holdenhurst Road. The main building has a large clocktower facing the roundabout. It is close to the East Cliff and Bournemouth University's Lansdowne Campus and a short distance from both the Bournemouth Station travel Interchange and from Bournemouth University's Talbot Campus. Lansdowne is where the sixth form centre, beauty and holistic therapies, hairdressing, hospitality & catering, travel tourism & sport, vocational studies, workforce development, and business & professional studies are based. The college was originally the Bournemouth Municipal College which opened in 1913. It is a listed building and is known for its clock tower (said to be an 'eyesore' when first built). A public library was part of the building until 2002. A small number of 'Horsa huts' were built in the 1940s and a large three-floor extension opened in 1957. In 1960 it took over the former Bournemouth School for Girls buildings which were two old Victorian houses (Ascham House [listed building] and Woodcote) which were used as the school when it opened in 1917. A building was built between these in 1932 which is now the catering block. The college and library were made a grade II listed building in 1973. Woodcote is now used for hairdressing and beauty therapy courses. Although modernised, no large extensions have been built to the present day. North Road The North Road campus is located near Poole Park and The Civic Centre. Art and design, care education and community training (including childcare and nursing) teacher training and engineering services, and some applied computing courses are based here. North Road is also the base for pre-vocational programme courses for students with learning difficulties and disabilities. This was Poole Technical College; the first three-storey building was built in 1957 with a small workshop block. It was not until 1967 that the major building, canteen and library were built along with more workshops. There are a number of wooden huts used for child and social care dating from the 1970s and a small number of offices in portable cabins across the centre. In 1989 the bricklaying block was built. In the 1990s The Study Gallery was built, before being relaunched as KUBE in April 2009. This purpose-built, modern glass-fronted building was a prominent art gallery in the South West of England. The gallery was closed in 2010 due to lack of fundingAstrop, J. (2010). Poole's Kube closure lamented by Arts Council. Bournemouth Echo. [online] 5 January 2010. [Accessed 17 Jan 2011] and the building is now being used for the college's Digital Design Centre. In 2016 the College stopped using its Constitution Hill site and instead opened up a new multi million pound site, the Jellicoe Theatre building, in Danecourt Road. Constitution Hill Located at the bottom of the hill on Constitution Hill Road, Poole, this site was sold to Poole Council in 2015. It was opened in 1919 as Poole Sea Training School and was also used as a Barnardos children's home (Parkstone Sea Training School). As a college it has been modernised with the library being built in 1997. The Upper Constitution Hill site, was known as Shaftesbury House. A high level complex of buildings contained the classrooms, while below was a building used for the technology classes for practical sessions, such as plumbing and light engineering. From 1967‚Äì 1971 the college was used by CEGB apprentices attending from the Poole Power Station Instrument Training School on 'block release' to college (month and month about training school/college). During this time a Mr Davies was Principal of the Shaftsbury House. Students followed City and Guilds Instrument Craft Practise course 309 and this changed in 1969 to Industrial Measurement and Control Technicians Certificate course 310 of City and Guilds. At one time there was an 'Upper Constitution Hill Centre' which has since moved to North Road because it was sold by the college to build a housing estate. For the last 13 years the college has planned to sell off LCH and its Knighton Heath site and for them to move to the North Road site. However funding is the problem. Redlands Located on Knyveton Road (between Lansdowne and Boscombe, Bournemouth), this is now used as offices by Wessex Education Shared Services (WESS). It was built as a Victorian hotel and used by a private school from London during the Second World War. The Fulcrum A site on the Fulcrum industrial estate, Tower Park, Poole for building services and construction crafts.

The city was bombed many times during the Second World War by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe). The most devastating of these attacks occurred on the evening of 14 November 1940 and continued into the morning of 15 November. Background Broadgate, Coventry in 1917 At the start of the Second World War, Coventry was an industrial city of around 238,000 people which, like much of the industrial West Midlands, contained metal and wood-working industries. In Coventry's case, these included cars, bicycles, aeroplane engines and, since 1900, munitions factories. In the words of the historian Frederick Taylor, \\"Coventry was therefore, in terms of what little law existed on the subject, a legitimate target for aerial bombing\\". During the First World War, the advanced state of the mechanical tooling industry in the city meant that pre- war production could quickly be turned to war production purposes, with industries such as the Coventry Ordnance Works assuming the role of one of the leading munition centres in the UK, manufacturing 25% of all British aircraft produced during the war.Jeffrey Haydu, \\"Between craft and class: skilled workers and factory politics in the United Kingdom\\", p. 126 Like many of the industrial towns of the English West Midlands region that had been industrialised during the Industrial Revolution, many of the small and medium- sized factories in the city were woven into the same streets as the workers' houses and the shops of the city centre. However, it developed many large interwar suburbs of both private and council housing, which were relatively isolated from industrial buildings. The city was also at the centre of Britain's car industry, with many carmakers being based at different locations in Coventry, although many of these factories had switched to help supply the war effort. Air raids August to October 1940 There were 17 small raids on Coventry by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain between August and October 1940 during which around 198 tons of bombs fell. Together, the raids killed 176 people and injured around 680. The most notable damage was to the new Rex Cinema which had been opened in February 1937 and had already been closed by an earlier bombing raid in September. On 17 October 1940, Second Lieutenant Sandy Campbell of the Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Company was called upon to deal with an unexploded bomb that had fallen at the Triumph Engineering Company's works in Canley. War production in two factories had ceased on a temporary basis because of it, and the evacuation of many nearby residents. Campbell found that the bomb was fitted with a delayed action fuse that was impossible to remove, so he transported it to a safe place. That was done by lorry, and he lay alongside the bomb so that he could hear if it started ticking and could warn the driver to stop and run for cover. Having taken it a safe distance, he disposed of the bomb successfully but was killed whilst dealing with another bomb the next day. Campbell was posthumously awarded a George Cross for his actions on 17 October 1940. One notable casualty of the October raids was Ernest Hugh Snell FRSE, a retired local Medical Officer of Health. 14 November 1940 Coventry Cathedral in ruins after the Luftwaffe air raid The raid that began on the evening of 14 November 1940 was the most severe to hit Coventry during the war. It was carried out by 515 German bombers, from Luftflotte 3 and from the pathfinders of Kampfgruppe 100\\\\. The attack, code-named Operation Mondscheinsonate (Moonlight Sonata), was intended to destroy Coventry's factories and industrial infrastructure, although it was clear that damage to the rest of the city, including monuments and residential areas, would be considerable. The initial wave of 13 specially modified aircraft of Kampfgruppe 100, which were equipped with X-Ger√§t navigational devices, accurately dropped marker flares at 19:20.The British were on British Summer Time (GMT+1) during the winter months of the war (and double summer time during the summer months). The British and the Germans were fighting the Battle of the Beams and on this night the British failed to disrupt the X-Ger√§t signals. The first wave of follow-up bombers dropped high explosive bombs, knocking out the utilities (the water supply, electricity network, telephones and gas mains) and cratering the roads, making it difficult for the fire engines to reach fires started by the later waves of bombers. These later waves dropped a combination of high explosive and incendiary bombs. There were two types of incendiary bomb: Those made of magnesium and those made of petroleum. The high explosive bombs and the larger air-mines were not only designed to hamper the Coventry fire brigade, they were also intended to damage roofs, making it easier for the incendiary bombs to fall into buildings and ignite them. Holy Trinity Church rises above a scene of devastation. Coventry's air defences consisted of twenty-four 3.7 inch AA guns and twelve 40 mm Bofors. The AA Defence Commander of 95th (Birmingham) Heavy Anti‚ÄìAircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun- laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. The anti- aircraft batteries then fought on in isolation. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10 hour raid (a total of over 6,700 rounds), only one German bomber was shot down. At around 20:00, Coventry Cathedral (dedicated to Saint Michael), was set on fire by incendiaries for the first time. The volunteer firefighters managed to put out the first fire but other direct hits followed and soon new fires broke out in the cathedral; accelerated by a firestorm, the flames quickly spread out of control. During the same period, more than 200 other fires were started across the city, most of which were concentrated in the city-centre area, setting the area ablaze and overwhelming the firefighters. The telephone network was crippled, hampering the fire service's command and control and making it difficult to send firefighters to the most dangerous blazes first; as the Germans had intended, the water mains were damaged by high explosives, meaning there was not enough water available to tackle many of the fires. The raid reached its climax around midnight with the final all clear sounding at 06:15 on the morning of 15 November. In one night, more than 4,300 homes in Coventry were destroyed and around two-thirds of the city's buildings were damaged. The raid was heavily concentrated on the city centre, most of which was destroyed. Two hospitals, two churches and a police station were also damaged. The local police force lost no fewer than nine constables or messengers in the blitz. Approximately one third of the city's factories were completely destroyed or severely damaged, another third were badly damaged, and the rest suffered slight damage. Among the destroyed factories were the main Daimler factory, the Humber Hillman factory, the Alfred Herbert Ltd machine tool works, nine aircraft factories, and two naval ordnance stores. However, the effects on war production were only temporary, as much essential war production had already been moved to 'shadow factories' on the city outskirts. Also, many of the damaged factories were quickly repaired and had recovered to full production within a few months. The city centre following the 14 November air raid An estimated 568 people were killed in the raid (the exact figure was never precisely confirmed), with another 863 badly injured and 393 sustaining lesser injuries. Given the intensity of the raid, casualties were limited by the fact that a large number of Coventrians \\"trekked\\" out of the city at night to sleep in nearby towns or villages following the earlier air raids. Also, people who took to air raid shelters suffered very little death or injury. Out of 79 public air raid shelters holding 33,000 people, very few had been destroyed. Although the city centre suffered the heaviest raids, districts of the city including Stoke Heath, Foleshill and Wyken were also heavily bombed. The raid reached such a new and severe level of destruction that Joseph Goebbels later used the term coventriert (\\"coventried\\") when describing similar levels of destruction of other enemy towns. During the raid, the Germans dropped about 500 tonnes of high explosives, including 50 parachute air-mines, of which 20 were incendiary petroleum mines, and 36,000 incendiary bombs. First published in 2004 by Bloomsbury gives different numbers than Taylor (2005): \\"449 bombers dropped 150,000 incendiary bombs, 503 tons of high-explosives (1,400 bombs) and 130 parachute sea-mines (causing extensive blast damage) on Coventry\\". The raid of 14 November combined several innovations which influenced all future strategic bomber raids during the war. These were: * The use of pathfinder aircraft with electronic aids to navigate, to mark the targets before the main bomber raid. * The use of high explosive bombs and air-mines (blockbuster bombs) coupled with thousands of incendiary bombs intended to set the city ablaze in a firestorm. In the Allied raids later in the war, 500 or more heavy four-engine bombers all delivered their bomb loads in a concentrated wave lasting only a few minutes. But at Coventry, the German twin-engined bombers carried smaller bomb loads (), and attacked in smaller multiple waves. Each bomber flew several sorties over the target, returning to base in France to rearm. Thus the attack was spread over several hours, and there were lulls in the raid when firefighters and rescuers could reorganise and evacuate civilians. As Arthur Harris, commander of RAF Bomber Command, wrote after the war: \\"Coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space [to start a firestorm], but all the same there was little concentration in point of time.\\" The British used the opportunity given them by the attack on Coventry to try a new tactic against Germany, which was carried out on 16 December 1940 as part of Operation Abigail Rachel against Mannheim. The British had been waiting for the opportunity to experiment with an incendiary-intensive raid, considering it a kind of retaliation for the German raid on Coventry. This was the start of a British drift away from precision attacks on military targets and towards area bombing attacks on whole cities. Coventry and Ultra In his 1974 book The Ultra Secret, Group Captain F. W. Winterbotham asserted that the British government had advance warning of the attack from Ultra: intercepted German radio messages encrypted with the Enigma cipher machine and decoded by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park. He further claimed that Winston Churchill ordered that no defensive measures should be taken to protect Coventry, lest the Germans suspect that their cipher had been broken.; also London: Futura (1975), . Winterbotham was a key figure for Ultra and supervised the \\"Special Liaison Officers\\" who delivered Ultra material to field commanders. However, Winterbotham's claim has been rejected by other Ultra participants and by historians. They state that while Churchill was indeed aware that a major bombing raid would take place, no one knew what the target would be. Peter Calvocoressi was head of the Air Section at Bletchley Park which translated and analysed all deciphered Luftwaffe messages. He wrote: \\"Ultra never mentioned Coventry. ... Churchill, so far from pondering whether to save Coventry or safeguard Ultra, was under the impression that the raid was to be on London\\". Scientist Reginald Victor Jones, who led the British side in the Battle of the Beams, wrote that \\"Enigma signals to the X-beam stations were not broken in time\\" and that he was unaware that Coventry was the intended target. Furthermore, a technical mistake caused jamming countermeasures to be ineffective. Jones also noted that Churchill returned to London that afternoon, which indicated that Churchill believed that London was the likely target for the raid. The book was also published in the US under the title The Wizard War. Since 1996, the Ultra decrypts for the relevant period have been available in the UK National Archives.File HW5/6 Between 07:35 GMT on 10 November 1940 and 05:00 on 11 November a German signal was deciphered and given the serial number CX/JQ/444, paragraph 4. The message set out code words to be used by aircraft on an operation named \\"Mondschein Sonate\\" but did not give Coventry as the target or a date. It said that transmission of a figure 9 would denote \\"KORN\\", and hindsight has recognised that to be the code name for Coventry. This was not realised at the time however, even though PAULA had been identified as Paris and LOGE as London. Indeed, the word KORN was used in two reportsNational Archives AIR 22/481: Air Ministry W/T Intelligence Service Daily Summary No. 454 from an aircraft taking part in a raid on Southampton on 30 November, two weeks after the Coventry Blitz. Another decrypt on 11 November or early on 12 NovemberNational Archives HW5/6: CX/JQ/445, para. 4 gave navigational beam settings for Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Coventry but no dates. There was a hiatus in Ultra decrypts from 01:15 GMT on 13 November until 02:40 on 15 NovemberNational Archives HW5/6 by which time the raid was well underway: Churchill could not have received new Ultra intelligence on the afternoon or evening of the attack because there was none to give him. Intelligence from captured airmen and documents did not offer an unambiguous picture either. April 1941 Children searching for books among the ruins of their school after the April raid On the night of 8/9 April 1941 Coventry was subject to another large air raid when 230 bombers attacked the city, dropping 315 tons of high explosive and 25,000 incendiaries. In this and another raid two nights later on 10/11 April about 451 people were killed and over 700 seriously injured. Damage was caused to many buildings including some factories, the central police station, the Coventry & Warwickshire Hospital, King Henry VIII School, and St. Mary's Hall. The main architectural casualty of the raid was Christ Church, most of which was destroyed, leaving only the spire. It was after this raid that the then-Mayor of Coventry, Alfred Robert Grindlay, led the early reconstruction of much of the city centre. August 1942 The final air raid on Coventry came on 3 August 1942, in the Stoke Heath district approximately one mile to the east of the city centre. Six people were killed. By the time of this air raid, some 1,236 people had been killed by air raids on Coventry; of these, 808 rest in the mass grave in London Road Cemetery. Around 80 per cent of them had been killed in the raids of 14/15 November 1940 and 8‚Äì10 April 1941. Aftermath The ruins of the old Coventry Cathedral, the most visible modern-day reminder of the Blitz Immediate reconstruction was undertaken by a committee headed by motor-industry magnate William Rootes. In the aftermath of the war, Coventry city centre was extensively rebuilt according to the Gibson Plan compiled by the town planner Donald Gibson: a then innovative scheme which created a pedestrianised shopping precinct. Coventry Cathedral was left as a ruin, and is today still the principal reminder of the bombing. A new cathedral was constructed alongside the ruin in the 1950s, designed by the architect Basil Spence. Spence (later knighted for this work) insisted that instead of re-building the old cathedral it should be kept in ruins as a garden of remembrance and that the new cathedral should be built alongside, the two buildings together effectively forming one church. The use of Hollington sandstone for the new Coventry Cathedral provides an element of unity between the buildings. The foundation stone of the new cathedral was laid by the Queen on 23 March 1956. It was consecrated on 25 May 1962, and Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, composed for the occasion, was premi√®red in the new cathedral on 30 May to mark its consecration. Spon Street was one of the few areas of the city centre to survive the blitz largely intact, and during the post-war redevelopment of Coventry, several surviving mediaeval buildings from across the city were relocated to Spon Street. The 14th century St. Mary's Guildhall in Bayley Lane opposite the ruined cathedral also survived and stands to this day. However, in addition to destroying many historic buildings, the bombing revealed a mediaeval stone building on Much Park Street, thought to date from the 13th or 14th century.

Hawley held the post from July 27, 2005 to January 20, 2009, replacing the previous Director, Rear Admiral David Stone. He was succeeded by Acting Administrator Gale Rossides. Career This was the second time Hawley had occupied a duty station at TSA. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, then-Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta tapped him to lead \\"Go-Teams\\" of government and private sector experts who tackled the task of quickly establishing a new federal agency. Prior to his nomination to the TSA, Hawley was Executive Vice President of Arzoon, a supply-chain software company in San Mateo, California. Arzoon is a subsidiary of SSA Global Technologies. Hawley also sat on the Air Traffic Services Subcommittee of the Federal Aviation Administration. Prior to this he was CEO of Skyway, a supply-chain services company and Vice President at Union Pacific Railroad. Previous government service included serving on the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation (in 1992) and as Deputy Assistant and Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan. Hawley also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary and Executive Director of Governmental Affairs for the Department of Transportation, responsible for planning budgets and legislative proposals. Hawley received his B.A. from Brown University, and his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1980. Since heading the TSA his two biggest projects were the 3-1-1, which allows passengers to bring limited amount of liquids aboard in aircraft, and the PASS program, which rates the abilities of Transportation Officers.

In September 2006, in response to the new policies limiting the amounts of liquids and gels that passengers could carry on airplanes, Milwaukee resident Ryan Bird wrote \\"Kip Hawley is an Idiot\\" on a plastic bag given to passengers by airport security for those substances. As a result, he claims he was detained and told that the First Amendment did not apply to security checkpoints. In April, 2007, Mr. Hawley agreed to a partially published interview conducted by Bruce Schneier regarding TSA policies and practices. Later, Schneier demonstrated the complete ineffectiveness of TSA measures by bringing a variety of objects which are classified by the TSA as dangerous through security and onto planes. Objects included box cutters and plastic \\"beer belly\\" filled with unexamined liquid. Mr. Hawley responded with the following admission: \\"Clever terrorists can use innovative ways to exploit vulnerabilities. But don't forget that most bombers are not, in fact, clever. Living bomb-makers are usually clever, but the person agreeing to carry it may not be super smart.

It reaches a height of 770 metres (2,526 feet) and stands to the north west of the other Coniston Fells, a little off the beaten track and tends to be the least visited of the group. It is quite a large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water. Topography The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around 10 miles before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Grey Friar is the only major fell in the group not to stand on this main axis, rising to the west of Great Carrs across the depression of Fairfield. Bounded to the north and west by the infant Duddon, Grey Friar has long rough slopes on this side with many small areas of crag. The southern perimeter is formed by Seathwaite Tarn and its attendant streams. The tarn was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was raised early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the Barrow in Furness area. The dam is almost 400 yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth of the tarn being around 80 ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Since Grey Friar curves southward, the main ridge stands across the tarn, Brim Fell and the back of Dow Crag forming the opposing slope. Mining The fell has been mined for copper extensively in the past. The Seathwaite mine was situated on the southern slopes above Seathwaite Tarn while the Cockley Beck mine stood on the fell's lower north western slopes. They operated in the mid-19th century and were nowhere near as profitable or extensive as the main Coniston copper mines in the so-called ‚ÄúCoppermines Valley‚Äù.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Ascents Grey Friar can be climbed from several locations; it is often ascended along with the other six Coniston fells and this walk is usually started at Coniston village. Direct ascents of the fell can be started from the Duddon valley, the top of the Wrynose Pass or Cockley Beck.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Summit The summit of the fell is stony with two cairned rock outcrops, the south easterly is the higher while the north westerly offers the better view. There is a good view of the Scafell massif and the other Coniston fells are well seen along the ridge to the south. 200 metres north west of the main summit is a distinctive pointed rock, often called the ‚ÄúMatterhorn Rock‚Äù.Richards, Mark: Southern Fells: Collins (2003): References The Scafells seen from Grey Friar Summit.

History  There is no certain historical document or archive that holds the origin of the town's name. According to the local folklore, the name 'Painan' is originated from paik nian, which means \\"very bitter\\" in bahasa Minangkabau, the language of the Minangkabau people who lives in the area. The phrase paik nian itself might refer to how difficult the life of the town's local people in the past. It is might also reflect the fact that the town's topography (surrounded by hills and rivers) caused this place to be difficult to traverse by travelers. This coastal town became an important place during Indonesia's colonial period since 1663 when the Dutch, via the Dutch East India Company set-up a trading post in Pulau Cingkuk (Cingkuk Island), one of many islands that are located offshore the town, as documented in the \\"Perjanjian Painan\\" or 'Painan Treaty'. Through the treaty, the local chiefs of West Coast of Sumatra were also bound themselves to supply pepper and gold to the Dutch.

Biography Ibrahim's origin is unclear, although it is generally agreed that he originated from outside of Java. He is thought to have been born in the first half of the 14th century. Ibrahim is known by several names in the Babad Tanah Jawi and other texts. In a transcription by J. J. Meinsma, he is identified as Makhdum Ibrahim as-Samarqandy (localised to Syekh Ibrahim Asmarakandi); this indicates a possible origin from Samarkand in modern-day Uzbekistan. However, other sources suggested that Asmarakandi came in the 16th century and is buried in Tuban Regency, making him a different person. The most generally accepted history, supported by a reading by J. P. Moquette of the inscription at Ibrahim's grave, identifies him as having come from Kashan, Persia (modern day Iran). Dutch writer and researcher Martin van Bruinessen describes Jumadil Kubra, Malik Ibrahim among all their students are followers of Kubrawiyyah . Martin van Bruinessen, \\"Traces of Kubrawiyyah influence in early Indonesian Islam\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde150(1994), 305-329. Malik Ibrahim was born in Kashan, Syekh Jumadil Qubro and Malik Ibrahim are disciples of Kubrowi Shafi'i school of Jurist Master Mir Sayid Ali Shafi Hamadani (died 1384), of Hamadan Persia . the sufis light, sufism academy publication (Delhi) 1962, p.120Malik Ibrahim belonged to syed and highly educated family in Kashan, his grand grandfather migrated from Samarkand to Kashan, that is why thir family also known as Samarkandi. the sufis light, Sufism academy publication (Delhi) 1962,p.122 Ibrahim came to Java with his father, Syekh Jumadil Qubro or Kubro, and his brother Maulana Ishaq, from Persia; they were descendants of Muhammad through Hussein ibn Ali. According to this version, Qubro stayed in Java while his sons went abroad for dakwah: Ibrahim went to Champa (in modern-day Vietnam), while his brother went to Pasai in northern Sumatra. In his 13 years in Champa, Ibrahim provided healthcare and taught farmers more efficient ways to grow crops. He also married one of the king's daughters, whose name has been Indonesianised as Dewi Candrawulan, and had two sons. When he felt that he had converted enough people to Islam, Ibrahim returned to Java without his family. Ibrahim landed at Sembalo, Learn, Manyar ( north of modern-day Gresik) in the late 14th century, where he became acquainted with the local people. He began trading out of the harbour, dealing equally with people from different castes - social strata based in the dominant Hindu religion. By doing so, Ibrahim found popular support from the lower castes, which led to numerous conversions. He also continued his work from Champa, teaching the locals ways to improve harvests and treating the ill. Through his trading, Ibrahim became acquainted with the ruling class and nobles. After journeying to Trowulan to meet the king of Majapahit, he was granted a landing on the outskirts of Gresik which was used for preaching; Ibrahim also founded an Islamic boarding school there. His habit of placing the Qu'ran on a pillow led to him receiving the nickname . A legend associated with Ibrahim is that one day, while travelling, he came across a young woman about to be sacrificed to the gods in order to end a long-standing drought. After stopping a group of men from stabbing the woman, Ibrahim prayed for rain; when his prayers were answered, the group he had faced converted to Islam. Ibrahim died on 12 Rabi' al-Awwal, 822 Hijri (7 April 1419 on the Julian calendar). He was buried in Gapura village, Gresik, East Java. Before the 19th century, Ibrahim was not considered one of the Wali Songo, the saints who spread Islam to Java. After his grave was rediscovered in the early 19th century, he was included in the core group. He was first listed as a Wali Songo in Babad Dipanegara. Today his grave, which is without a headstone, is a common destination for pilgrims, who read the Qu'ran and the life of Muhammad; they also partake in a dish unique to the area, harisah rice porridge. In 2005 over 1.5 million pilgrims went to the grave, for which there is an entry fee. Most come on the anniversary of his death, based on the Islamic calendar. Grave marker Near Ibrahim's grave is a stone marker bearing an inscription in Arabic, translated below: > This is the grave of a man who is sure to be forgiven by Allah and be > granted happiness by The All-Gracious, the teacher of princes and adviser to > sultans and viziers, friend of the poor and destitute. The great religious > teacher: Malik Ibrahim, renowned for his goodness. May Allah grant His > pleasure and grace, and bring him to heaven. He died on Senin, 12 Rabi' al- > Awwal, 822 Hijri. The grave marker is made of stone from the Khambhat region of India. By comparing the marker with others found in the Pasai Kingdom, historians such as Brian Harrison and G. H. Bousquet have suggested that the spread of Islam in Indonesia originated in India. Legacy Both of Ibrahim's sons went on to spread Islam to Java after they became adults. The eldest, Ali Rahmatullah, is better known as Sunan Ampel and is a member of the Wali Songo himself. The youngest was named Ali Murthada. Ibrahim's work in eastern Java was continued by Raden Paku (later known as Susuhunan Giri) in Giri (now part of Banyuwangi Regency) and Raden Rahmat, who founded an Islamic school in Ngampel, near Surabaya. Every year, the Gresik city government holds a festival to celebrate Ibrahim's birth. Known as Gebyar Maulid, the festival also serves to promote local culture.

History The antiquity of this speciality is unknown, although it was probably well-established before the beginning of the nineteenth century when Vittorio di Sant‚ÄôAlbino described it in his Piedmontese-Italian dictionary. The original motivation was the avoidance of waste: pieces of stale, hard and/or mouldy cheese were mixed with homemade grappa (the distillate of the pomace remaining from winemaking) plus, perhaps, butter and spices, and left to ferment in an earthenware container until the mixture acquired a creamy texture. At this point it was covered and could be treated as a preserve. Br√∂s has acquired a certain cachet in recent years, and may often be found in the restaurants of the Langhe. However the robust traditional formulation has been largely replaced by one based on fresh cheeses such as Robiola and white wine.

In the first decade of the twenty-first century it enjoyed something of a revival and was included in the Ark of Taste catalogue of heritage foods. The ricotta is placed in moulds to drain and then transferred to wooden vats to ferment, usually with the addition of salt. The cheeses are ready to eat after being aged for about a week in the cellar.

Marc and Aim√©e Dalens (Fran√ßois Cluzet and Giulia Boschi) are the parents of France (C√©cile Ducasse), a young girl who befriends Prot√©e (Isaach de Bankol√©), a Cameroon native who is the family's household servant. The film was entered into the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. Plot An adult woman named France, walks down a road toward Douala, Cameroon. She is picked up by William J. Park (Emmet Judson Williamson), an African American who has moved to Africa and is driving to Limbe with his son. As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in Mindif, French Cameroon in 1957, where her father was a colonial administrator. The story is conducted through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \\"houseboy\\", Prot√©e, as well the sexual tension between him and her young and beautiful mother, Aim√©e. The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans. This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby. He acknowledges Aim√©e's attraction to Prot√©e in the presence of other black servants. This later results in a fight between Luc and Prot√©e, which Prot√©e wins. During the fight, Aim√©e sits nearby, unseen by the two. She attempts to seduce Prot√©e after Luc has left but he rejects her advance. Aim√©e consequently asks her husband to remove him from the house. Prot√©e is moved from his in-house job to work outdoors in the garage as a mechanic. The title Chocolat (, \\"chocolate\\") comes from the 1950s slang meaning \\"to be cheated\\", and thus refers to the status in French Cameroon of being black and being cheated; it is also an allusion to Prot√©e's dark-brown skin and the racial fetishism of Africans by Europeans. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the horizon is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the boundaries that exists in the country between rich and poor, master and servant, white and black, coloniser and colonised, male and female; a line that is always visible but impossible to approach or pass.

Previously known as the Department for Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), it was created on 1 January 2019 as part of a restructuring of the UN's peace and security apparatus. The DPO retains the core functions and responsibilities of its predecessor, with a greater emphasis on cohesion, integrating different resources and knowledge, and promoting human rights. With an annual budget of roughly $6.5 billion, the DPO is the largest UN agency by expenditure, exceeding the UN's own regular budget.Expenditure by agency, 2018 As of March 2020, it oversees 81,370 personnel serving in thirteen peacekeeping missions. History The DPO traces its roots to 1948 with the creation of the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO). Up to the late 1980s, peacekeeping missions were operated by six officials in the United Nations Office of Special Political Affairs, which was headed first by Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche, and subsequently Brian Urquhart and Marrack Goulding. From the beginning, peacekeeping operations operated with a clear doctrine that applied to its traditional or classical peacekeeping operations for inter-state ceasefires: peacekeepers did not take sides or discharge firearms, save in self-defense, or meddle in politics. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations was created in March 1992 when Boutros Boutros-Ghali took office as Secretary-General of the United Nations; its creation was one of his first decisions. In organisational terms, it upgraded and expanded upon the work of the previous Field Administration and Logistics Division (FALD) (which remained active as a subordinate department). Goulding became under-secretary-general (or USG) for peacekeeping with Kofi Annan appointed as his deputy. The role of the DPKO, however, wasn't clarified until June 1992, when Boutrous-Ghali issued an An Agenda for Peace, a plan to strengthen the UN's capacity for preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. Organizational structure Congo (for MONUSCO mission), 2000 DPO is split into two main offices: the Office of Operations and the Office of Mission Support (OMS). Included within the Office of Mission Support are the logistics and administrative divisions, which provide logistics, personnel, and financial support services to DPO missions. OMS is responsible for determining financial reimbursement to UN member states for their contribution of Contingent owned equipment, troops, and services to peacekeeping missions. Letters of Assist are an important part of this. Also part of DPO are Mine Action, Training, Best Practices, and Military and Police Divisions. A March 2007 United Nations General Assembly Resolution titled ‚ÄúStrengthening the capacity of the Organization in Peacekeeping Operations‚Äù has called for the re-structuring of the department and the establishment of a separate Department of Field Support. Whereas the new entity serves as a key enabler by coordinating the administration and logistics in UN peacekeeping operations, DPO concentrates on policy planning and providing strategic directions. This re-organisation was paralleled by a DPO reform effort launched in 2005 entitled 'Peace Operations 2010', which further pursues reforms initiated by the 'Brahimi Report' Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonization of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peace Operations (DPO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), African Union and European Union. One area of this reform effort has been the development of clearer internal doctrine or guidance for UN peacekeeping. The highest level DPO doctrine document was issued in 2008, known as the 'capstone' doctrine. Very recently with the newest reform efforts, Secretary-General Guterres has made efforts to streamline peacekeeping efforts to conserve finances, and eliminate excess and unnecessary roles. As an effort to be brought together and streamlined, shared regional divisions of the DPA and DPO will restructure and remove duplication of tasks and duties allowing for more manpower readily available to explore new initiates and operations. This gives the department more resources and responsibilities for broader peace building efforts, which are of course by their nature linked to political analysis and strategy (Cliffe, 2018). While peacekeeping operations are at an all-time high, and funding continues to receive budget cuts, making effective business moves will allow peacekeeping operations to remain intact. By merging organizations, the shift in shared duties and management will allow for a wider spectrum of operations to be ready and available for troops on the ground. Less time duplicating work allows for more time to think of broader trends in security and employing preventive measures for future threats and streamlined transportation efforts.

Current operations As of 2010, DPO leads 16 different missions in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Americas, Europe and Asia.https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/where-we-operate DPO Current operations Serving in these missions are over 100,000 uniformed and civilian personnel.

It runs for 52 minutes and features their conversations about filmmaking and television. Synopsis Soft and Hard brings to light questions regarding images and language, in film and television, but does not necessarily set out to answer the questions. Soft and Hard is one of many video projects Godard experimented with during this time of his career. There are several key scenes during Soft and Hard that directly correlate with the questions being asked about TV compared to film. The video starts with the words Soft and Hard appearing in text on the screen. Godard and Mi√©ville then use voiceover of them speaking while random images appear on the screen. A slow motion shot of Godard swinging a tennis racquet follows. Godard and Mi√©ville proceed to a conversational interview that never resolves anything or settles on one correct idea regarding image, but brings to light issues. The conversation-style interview between Godard and Mi√©ville has many elements that are counter to modern-day television interviewing techniques. The lighting for the interview is a single lamp placed on the end table between Godard and Mi√©ville, a technique opposite that of traditional television lighting. The lengthy conversational interview between Godard and Mi√©ville is one extremely long take that has no reverse shot. The entire interview is a cross shot with Godard's back at the camera, but never the reverse angle where the audience could see his face. This is the most obvious element during the interview that is seen as an opposite traditional television interviewing technique. After the interview, the last scene is a shot of a television. As the camera slowly zooms in on the television, it appears as if someone is channel surfing. At the end the channel stops on a shot from Godard's film, Contempt. We see a cameraman panning across the screen finally stopping as if he were shooting at the audience. The shot in Soft and Hard then pans to a blank wall where Contempt is now being projected. Mi√©ville proceeds to walk in front of the projector still playing Contempt, revealing her shadow. Godard then joins her as they hold their arms out making shadows. Soft and Hard ends with the shot of Contempt projected on the wall as Godard says \\"Where has it all gone, all those projects, all those projects to grow, to be enlarged into subjects?\\" This is followed by Mi√©ville's lines: \\"It is hard to say\\". Then, finally, Godard says \\"Hard to say\\" (in English). It fades to black and the credits begin to roll.

It covers a portion of suburban Pittsburgh and some outlying rural areas. The district serves students in a area that includes the towns of McDonald and Midway and the village of Hickory, as well as the townships of Robinson and Mount Pleasant. According to a 2008 local census, it serves a resident population of 8,878. The residents' per capita income was $17,963, while median family income was $45,688. According to District officials, in school year 2007-08 the Fort Cherry School District provided basic educational services to 1,236 pupils through the employment of 95 teachers, 16 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 9 administrators. Fort Cherry School District received more than $8.9 million in state funding in school year 2007-08. History The Fort Cherry School District was established in 1954, bringing together the schools of McDonald, Midway, Mount Pleasant Township, and Robinson Township. Schools *Fort Cherry Elementary Center *Fort Cherry Junior-Senior High School Governance The school district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \\"D-\\" for transparency based on a review of \\"What information can people find on their school district's website\\".

Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.  Graduation requirements  The Fort Cherry School Board requires that students earn 4 credits to graduate, including: English .5 credits, Social Studies .5 credits, Mathematics .5 credits, Science .5 credits, Arts/Humanities .5 credits, and Senior Project 0.25 credit.Fort Cherry Senior High School, Grades 9-12 Course Registration Handbook 2011 - 2012, Fort Cherry School District Administration, 2010 By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the graduating class in 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students‚Äô Keystone Exam scores must count for at least one-third of the final course grade.

The Fort Cherry School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy In compliance with state law, Fort Cherry School Board established a district wellness policy in June 2006 Student Wellness Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The policy requires that the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. \\"Special\\" education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 190 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Fort Cherry School District received a $745,726 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 55 or 3.31% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Enrollment and Consolidation In a budget presentation in June 2010, the school administration noted a 300 student enrollment decline in 2000. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, there are fewer than 1155 students enrolled in Fort Cherry School District, K-12, in 2010. There were 97 students in the Class of 2010. The district's class of 2009 had 102 students while the Class of 2005 had 97 students. Enrollment in Fort Cherry School District has been projected, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to continue to decline to 1000 pupils K-12 total enrollment, by 2020. Pennsylvania is experiencing a decline in population. Deaths have outnumbered births for a decade in many counties. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania have been experiencing significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. Reynolds School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $905.90 per pupil. This is ranked 102nd among in the 500 school districts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In a survey of superintendents of the small districts, 42% stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was at least 3000 pupils. The study examined consolidation of Fort Cherry School District with Chartiers-Houston School District. It found significant savings were achievable, including the elimination of redundant administration salaries. According to a proposal made in 2009, by Governor Edward G. Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to substantially reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two districts' central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. Budget In 2007, the district employed 90 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $46,792 for 180 days worked. Fort Cherry School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $781.19 per pupil. The administrative spending ranks 220th out of 500 school districts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In 2008, the district administration reported spending $12,880 per pupil which ranked 268th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2009, the district employed 103 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $49,951 for 187 days worked. The beginning salary was $28,500, while the highest salary was $124,035. Teachers work a 7-hour 30 minutes day, with one planning period and a paid 30 minute lunch included. Hours worked may not exceed 37.5 per week. Additionally, the teachers receive: a defined benefit pension, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, 10 paid sick days which accumulate, 4 paid days bereavement leave and many other benefits. Early retirees receive paid health insurance benefits for the employee and spouse for up to 120 months. The district offers an extensive retirement/longevity package which includes payment for unused sick days accumulated and a payment of $13,000. The union received 3 paid days to conduct union business. The union pays for the substitute for the first 5 days. According to Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board of Trustees, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary.Legislature must act on educators' pension hole. The Patriot News. February 21, 2010 In October 2009 the district and union ratified a contract with annual raises of 3% to 45 and a small employee contribution to their health insurance premium. In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the administration and the school board by state officials. It found that the Fort Cherry School District inaccurately reported payments made to a transportation contractor, resulting in a $115,424 underpayment to the Fort Cherry School District. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a $1,335,476 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as zero. The district is funded by a combination of: an income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level. State basic education funding In 2011-12, the district will receive $6,265,884 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $83,782 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. For the 2010-11 budget year, the Fort Cherry School District was allotted a 2.00% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $6,525,220. The highest increase in Washington County was provided to Charleroi School District which received a 9.90% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding.PA Basic Education Funding-Printout2 2010-2011 Pennsylvania House Appropriations Committee Education Budget information. The amount of increase each school district receives is set by the Governor and the Secretary of Education as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.16% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $6,401,196. The state Basic Education funding to the Fort Cherry School District in 2008-09 was $6,265,884.46. The highest increase in Washington County went to Burgettstown Area School District which received a 6.45% increase. Eleven Washington County school districts received an increase of less than 5% in 2009-10. Muhlenberg School District of Berks County received an increase of 22.31 percent. Sixteen school districts received an increase in funding of over 10 percent in 2009. In 2008, the administration reported that 400 students received a free or reduced-price lunch based on the federal poverty levels. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11 the district applied for and received $227,406 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The Fort Cherry School District uses the funding to increase instructional time for struggling students, to pay teacher to write new curriculum and revise current classes and to make research based changes in the curriculum and instruction. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Fort Cherry School District applied, but was denied funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $148,013. In 2008-09, the district received 45,413 for a total funding of $193,426. Education Assistance Program The EAP initiative provides extended learning opportunities and is designed to boost student achievement and help all students succeed by utilizing evidenced-based instructional models. The funding provides tutoring in Math and Reading for students in grades 7-12. Tutoring is mandatory for all students who do not score Proficient or Advanced on the PSSA Reading Assessment and/or PSSA Mathematics Assessment AND/OR do not meet proficiency standards on the Performance Series Reading and/or Mathematics Assessment. Students are required to participate in a minimum of 45 hours of tutoring in each subject in which they do not meet the proficiency requirement. Tutoring is provided during the school day, during study halls and after school. In 2010-11 the Fort Cherry School District received $26,345.Pennsylvania Department of Education - Educational Assistance Program Funding 2010-2011 Fiscal Year Federal Stimulus funding The district received an extra $750,000 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The grant was for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-11 school years. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district up to million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Pennsylvania Governor Press Office, January 20, 2010 Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Common Cents state initiative The Fort Cherry School District School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes In 2011, the Fort Cherry School Board set the property taxes rate at 118.5000 mills (both Allegheny County and Washington County residents) for the 2011-12 school year. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010-11 - 118.5000 mills (both Allegheny County and Washington County residents) for the 2010-11 school year. *2009-10 - 118.5000 mills for both Allegheny County and Washington County residents. *2008-09 - 118.5000 mills for both Allegheny County and Washington County residents. *2007-08 - 118.5000 mills Allegheny County and Washington County residents.  Act 1 Adjusted index  The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum. The School District Adjusted Index for the Fort Cherry School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.5%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.8%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.6%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.9%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year, the Fort Cherry School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, Fort Cherry School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Fort Cherry School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 or in 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.  Property tax relief  In 2011, property tax relief for 2,502 approved residents of Fort Cherry School District was set at $180. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Fort Cherry School District was $181 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,485 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Washington County, the highest tax relief went to Washington School District at $407 in 2009 and $414 in 2010. In Allegheny County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in Duquesne City School District at $346. The greatest tax relief in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was given to Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report 2010. In Washington County, 73% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurricular This district is a single \\"A\\" school. The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy.

Even though being a revolutionary theme, the movie was wonderfully made without the usual noise that accompanies the leftist movies and fashioned on the lines of the great epic Mahabharata. Amazing performances by all the actors (Krishnam Raju, Raogopal Rao, Allu Ramalingaiah etc.) and wonderful technical backup make this movie another classic from Bapu. The film also has Chiranjeevi as a very young actor (his second movie to be released) in the role of Parthu.

It was released in October 1994 on Beggars Banquet Records and it is also the band's last album on Sire Records in the USA. It is also commonly referred to as the \\"Black Sheep\\" record, due to the image of a Manx Loaghtan black sheep on the front cover. The record also features one of the very rare times when Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy have shared songwriting credit with anyone: bassist Craig Adams is credited as co-author of \\"Universal You\\". Musical style The style of music on the album is more reminiscent of the grunge and alternative rock music popular at the time, and of noise rock, with its use of distortion and feedback. Album information Vocalist Ian Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal, and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston (friend and former drummer for The Cult), to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s. But the record was barely noticed, only reaching US#69, and UK#21, and then quickly dropping out of sight. Reportedly it reached number one on the charts in Portugal, but quickly dropped out of sight as well. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" (UK#51) was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\" (UK#65), was officially released. That song began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" before being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected once again as \\"Starchild\\", and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\". \\"Be Free\\" was also released as a single both in Canada, as a promotional CD with a purchase of a party pack of Labatt Genuine Draft, and in France by Virgin Records as an extremely rare edited version along with the edit of \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\". \\"Sacred Life\\" was released as a promotional only single in Spain and the Netherlands, and \\"Saints are Down\\" was released as a promotional single in Greece. \\"Gone\\" was released as a limited edition (only 2000 made) 7 inch vinyl single with artwork and handwritten lyrics by Ian Astbury.

Nature and Culture are in eternal conflict with each other in Hans Deuss' works. Classically shaped exotic buildings stand in sharp contrast with the advancing foliage: trees and bushes grow through constructions or loom in the distance. Air and water surround the architecture. Stairs lead up or down, and seem to offer an escape out of this constricting situation. His paintings give the viewer a sense of enormous space by a horizon far way, or a window that leads the viewer outside of the picture: it is there that the freedom is. Nature gives battle to the presence of man. Deuss shows mans urge to destruction and the fight that nature wages to save itself. Eventually, Deuss' paintings seem to tell us, nature will come out victorious, but it will take a very long time. The wind blows seeds in tiny cracks in the structures, from which plants and trees will grow that will eventually engulf the building. Deuss likes to spend time outside of the city in which he lives, and he loves to cycle through the flat polderlandscape around Amsterdam. The ever-expanding city can always be seen looming on the horizon, like an advancing front. Deuss is fascinated by this concept. The buildings in his paintings are figments of his imagination or based on real building. They can be glimpses of memories of his childhood when he was leafing through old photo albums, or of his travels: for example Mexico, where he visited the ancient Aztec buildings. The surrealistic buildings are mostly open constructions without roof, windows or doors. Air, water or foliage can be glimpsed through these openings. The buildings are not dilapidated or dirty buildings but look to be carefully conserved and clean. Everything is tidy and structured in the painting of Deuss. This tidiness is enhanced by his painting style: the structures of the walls, the leaves of the trees, everything is painted in excruciating detail. Deuss studied at the Rietveld academy in Amsterdam, and was taught by Melle and Herman Gordijn. This was where his interest in the Magical Realism was born. Expositions Hans Deuss' work was part of many expositions of the works of Independent Realists in the M√∏hlmann museum. His works were also displayed in the Singer Museum in Laren, the Aemstelle Museum in Amstelveen, the Markiezenhof in Bergen op Zoom and the PAN Galerie De Twee Pauwen in Den Haag. His work was also displayed abroad in New York, Atlanta, Tokyo, Paris, Antwerp, Strassbourg and Dijon.

Thomas Stevens (or Stephens), Abbot of Netley Abbey and later of Beaulieu Abbey; (b. probably. c. 1490) (died 1550) was an English and Cistercian monk and clergyman. As abbot of Netley and later of Beaulieu he had the right to a seat in the House of Lords. Little is known of Stevens' early life, but at some time in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century he became a monk at the small and poor Cistercian monastery of Netley Abbey in Hampshire. There he took holy orders and rose through the ranks so that by 1529 he was elected abbot of Netley, succeeding John Corne. Abbot Stevens was evidently a skilled administrator and agriculturalist. Under his stewardship his often financially troubled abbey of Netley remained solvent (a difficult task given the small endowment and the heavy cost of providing hospitality to travellers by land and sea and the king‚Äôs sailors) and he was able to build up a farm surplus worth more than ¬£100, a sum not far off the annual net income of the abbey, and to pay down the debts. The amount of ¬£100 was considerable for this period. He also maintained high standards of religious life at the abbey, and he and his seven monks were the object of good reports to the king from the local gentry and were much respected in the neighbourhood. That the Abbot was also trusted by the government, is shown by his being given custody of two Franciscan friars, who presumably had offended the king by opposing his religious policies. Notwithstanding the Abbot's apparent complacency, those policies were soon to have a dramatic effect on his own life. In 1535 Netley's income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's general survey of church finances, at ¬£160 gross, ¬£100 net, which meant the following year that it came under the terms of the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which closed all monasteries with incomes of less than ¬£200 per year. Abbot Stevens and his seven monks were forced to surrender their house to the King in 1536. The seal of the abbots of Netley. Thomas Stevens would have used this to authenticate official documents as abbot. Yet this was not the end of Thomas' career as an abbot. In fact, shortly before the closure of Netley, Henry appointed him abbot of Netley's mother house, Beaulieu Abbey, a wealthy royal foundation across Southampton Water. This was unusual, and is symptomatic of the general breakdown, since the post was elective. Thomas and six of his monks (the other desired to resign and become a secular priest) crossed Southampton Water to join Beaulieu in 1536. At Beaulieu Stevens continued the policy he had presumably already begun of currying favour with the government, especially Thomas Cromwell, King Henry's chief minister, who held the fates of the English clergy in his hands, as well as bribing Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, another minister who had his eyes on taking over the abbey for himself, with the fine horses from the abbey stables. Now the currying aimed ostensibly at saving Beaulieu. However, there came a setback. Stevens had barely been abbot of Beaulieu for a year when a crisis occurred which enabled to the government to put pressure on him to surrender his monastery, were this needed, and perhaps to menace a worse fate. In September 1537 James Manzi (or Mangii), a Florentine on the run from the government for unspecified offences that might be construed as treason, took sanctuary at the abbey. Cromwell sent agents to arrest him, but the abbot was absent when they arrived and in the meanwhile the fugitive escaped. The abbot conducted an investigation into the affair and Manzi was soon recaptured, but suspicion remained that he had been somehow involved in the escape in the spirit of the old laws of sanctuary (thus potentially incurring serious criminal charges) and Stevens was obliged to throw himself on the mercy of Cromwell and Wriothesley. Since by early 1538 it was clear that Beaulieu was doomed, the abbot began to make provision for his future. One of his last acts as abbot before he was finally forced to surrender was to grant the mill and parsonage of Beaulieu to a friend and give his sister a manor house belonging to the abbey,Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 329. a conduct not uncommon practice among heads of institutions suppression by Henry's government, as insurance against not getting a decent pension (compare the similar transactions at neighbouring Titchfield Abbey). The king‚Äôs commissioners arrived at the gates of the abbey in March 1538 and, after negotiations, the great monastery surrendered on 2 April 1538, the deed being signed by Thomas and 20 of the monks. It is probable that by now Stevens had had a change of mentality, after all his attachment to Beaulieu was not that of a lifetime, and his appointment there, despite the tensions, had been something of a windfall. Now he was destined to receive a handsome pension of 100 marks a year for a largely ceremonial role in an event he could do nothing to prevent. It made him a wealthy man, and made him disinclined to any great fellow-feeling for his fellow monks. In a letter to Thomas Wriothesley written shortly after the abbey was extinguished, he fell to describing his monks at Beaulieu as \\"lewd monks, which now, I thank God, I am rid of\\".Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 344. On the other hand, he displayed more apparent sympathy for the people who had taken sanctuary at the abbey and who lived in the abbey grounds. He pleaded with the government for their lives, with the result that they were given either pardons or protection and the right to remain living in the former abbey precinct. Later life Thomas continued his career in the church after the fall of Beaulieu and already in 1539 was made rector of Bentworth in Hampshire.Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 357. In May 1548 he was also made Treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral and given the prebend of Calne while retaining his rectory. Since he could only be in one place at a time, somewhere he was an absentee incumbent.Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 356-358. The appointment under the Protestantizing Edward VI suggests that Stevens was now of flexible theological views. At some point he married, too, and had children, who are mentioned in his will.Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 367-368. Stevens' will, which he wrote on 9 August 1550, perhaps already in bad health, and its codicil, written three days later, reveals more details about Thomas' subsequent life. At that date he had a daughter, Mary Stevens, to whom he left all his property, specifically noting his plate and an estate he had recently bought at Alton. Mary was clearly young because he created a trust supervised by a friend, Christofer Wallison, to manage the property and help her make a suitable marriage. Mary was present at the creation of the will and agreed not to marry anyone without the consent of Christofer. At his death Thomas was a rich man, which can be seen from the large sums he was able to leave as gifts to friends and his servants, many of whom are named in the will. It was a long way from the poor Cistercian monk of Netley. He must have died shortly after making his will, which was probated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in London on 9 September 1550.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Trieste. In 1899, Pope Leo XIII granted it the status of a basilica minor. History The first religious edifice on the site was built in the 6th century on an Roman propylaea, using part of the existing structure. Perhaps the entrance to a monument, this was commonly known as the Capitoline Temple, as a pyramidal altar with the symbols of the Capitoline Triad (Jupiter, Juno and Minerva) had been discovered inside it. In the main hall, the original remains of part of the mosaic floor is integrated into the present-day floor, which contains markings of the outer walls of the early Christian building. Soon after it was opened for worship, the church was destroyed in the Lombard invasion. Between the 9th and 11th centuries, two basilicas were erected on the ruins of the old church, the first dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption and the second, the cathedral, to Saint Justus (San Giusto). The original design of the latter building was subsequently lengthened. In the 14th century, the two basilicas were joined by means of the demolition of one nave of either basilica and the construction of a simple asymmetrical fa√ßade, dominated by a delicately worked Gothic rose window, as ornate as the new bell tower, using the Romanesque debris stones found on the site and friezes of arms.

Though the band were only together for approximately two years and never achieved any measure of success, after its breakup ex-members Blackie Lawless and Nikki Sixx would go on to international success with the bands W.A.S.P. and M√∂tley Cr√ºe respectively. Lawless had previously played guitar with the New York Dolls for a handful of live shows before that band broke up in 1976. Overview Though the band never officially released any material, Sister has obtained some measure of notoriety for pioneering the fusion of occult symbology such as the pentagram with a theatrical heavy metal performance inspired by Alice Cooper. The band had the misfortune of existing in a time when heavy metal had yet to become commercially viable (though that would change significantly in the coming years) and personal differences caused the band to break up in 1978. Upon the breakup of Sister, bassist Nikki Sixx and guitarist Lizzie Grey formed the band London, a band that Lawless would soon join as well. London has become well known for having several members in its ranks during its three year existence who would go on to major success later in the 1980s, such as Sixx, Lawless, Izzy Stradlin, and Fred Coury. Future Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler auditioned for London but was turned down.

It was established in 1855, renamed in 1948 to the United States Court of Claims (), and abolished in 1982. Then, its jurisdiction was assumed by the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and United States Claims Court (), which was later renamed the Court of Federal Claims. Before the Court of Claims was established, monetary claims against the federal government were normally submitted through petitions to Congress. By the time of the Court's creation, the workload had become unwieldy so Congress gave the Court jurisdiction to hear all monetary claims based upon a law, a regulation, or a federal government contract. The Court was required to report its findings to Congress and to prepare bills for payments to claimants whose petitions were approved by the Court. Since only Congress was constitutionally empowered to make appropriations, Congress still had to approve the bills and reports, but it usually did so pro forma. The Court originally had three judges, who were given lifetime appointments. The judges were authorized to appoint commissioners to take depositions and issue subpoenas. The federal government was represented in the Court by a solicitor appointed by the President. Establishment of Court The Court of Claims was established in 1855 to adjudicate certain claims brought against the United States government by veterans of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Initially, the court met at the Willard Hotel, from May to June 1855, when it moved to the US Capitol.U.S. Courts, United States Court of Federal Claims: The People's Court. There, the court met in the Supreme Court's chamber in the basement of the Capitol until it was given its space to use. In 1861, Abraham Lincoln in his Annual Message to Congress asked that the court be given the power to issue final judgments. Congress granted the power with the Act of March 3, 1863, and it explicitly allowed the judgments to be appealed to the Supreme Court. However, it also modified the law governing the Court so that its reports and bills were sent to the Department of the Treasury rather than directly to Congress. The moneys to cover these costs were then made a part of the appropriation for the Treasury Department. The conflict inherent between the two provisions was made manifest when in 1864, the decision in Gordon v. United States was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied that it had jurisdiction because the decisions of the Court of Claims, hence any appeals, were subject to review by an executive department.Gordon v. United States, see also Gordon v. United States, 117 U.S. 697 (1864). Less than a year later, Congress passed a law removing review of the Court of Claims from the Treasury Department. Tucker Act In 1887, Congress passed the Tucker Act (), which further restricted the claims that could be submitted directly to Congress and required the claims instead to be submitted to the Court of Claims. It broadened the court's jurisdiction so that \\"claims founded upon the Constitution\\" could be heard. In particular, this meant that monetary claims based on takings under the eminent domain clause of the Fifth Amendment could be brought before the Court of Claims. The Tucker Act also opened the Court to tax refund suits. Depredations against American shipping committed by the French during the Quasi-War of 1793 to 1800 led to claims against France that were relinquished by the terms of the Treaty of 1800. Since the claims against France were no longer valid, claimants continually petitioned Congress for the relief that had been waived by the treaty. Only on January 20, 1885, a law was passed, 23 Stat. 283, to provide for consideration of the matter before the Court of Claims. The lead case, Gray v. United States, 21 Ct. Cl. 340, written by Judge John Davis, includes a complete discussion of the historical and political circumstances that led to the hostilities between the United States and France and their resolution by treaty. The cases, termed \\"French Spoliation Claims\\", continued in the court until 1915. In 1925, Congress changed the structure of the Court of Claims by authorizing the Court to appoint seven commissioners who were empowered to hear evidence in judicial proceedings and report on findings of fact. The judges of the Court of Claims would then serve as a board of review for the commissioners. In 1932, Congress reduced the salary of the judges of the Court of Claims as part of the Legislative Appropriation Act of 1932. Thomas Sutler Williams was one of the judges of the Court, and he sued the federal government by claiming that his salary could not be cut because the Constitution had specified that judicial salaries could not be reduced. The Supreme Court ruled on Williams v. United States in 1933, deciding that the Court of Claims was an Article I or legislative court and so Congress had the authority to reduce the salaries of the judges of the Court of Claims.Williams v. United States, Beginning in 1948, Congress directed that when directed by the court, the commissioner could make recommendations for conclusions of law (). Chief Judge Wilson Cowen made that mandatory under the court rules in 1964. Elevation to Article III status On July 28, 1953, Congress passed a law to convert the Court of Claims into an Article III court and to raise the number of commissioners to 15., In spite of the Congressional statement of the Court's status, when Judge J. Warren Madden was sitting by designation with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, one of the parties asked for the decision to be thrown out on the basis that Madden was not a valid judge in that court. On appeal, the Supreme Court, in Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, held that the Court of Claims was a proper Article III court, and its judges could sit by designation and assignment on other courts. Ironically, the judges could no longer sit on Congressional reference cases because of this change since an independent court could not act in an advisory role to Congress. The solution, enacted by Congress in 1966, was to have the trial judges hear the cases, upon assignment by the chief judge of the trial division., Two more judges were added to the court in 1966, bringing the total to seven., Congress terminated the Indian Claims Commission in 1978 and required that any pending cases to be transferred to the Court of Claims. Of the 170 cases so transferred, many were complicated longstanding accounting claims that had been before the Commission for years. One of the most famous of these cases was United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, which ultimately reached the Supreme Court.United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, Aside from its large judgment awarded to the Sioux, the case also featured interesting questions about judicial power and the ability of Congress to waive the Federal government's legal defense of res judicata to allow a claim to be judicially determined. Abolition In 1982, Congress abolished the court, transferring its trial level jurisdiction to the new United States Claims Court, now known as the United States Court of Federal Claims, and its appellate jurisdiction to the equally-new United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. By then, the Court had expanded to have seven judges; they were transferred to the Federal Circuit., Former judges See also * Charles Cooper Nott, Sr., Chief Justice (1896‚Äì1905) * George W.

Other accounts suggest the name derives from his hobby of submerging himself in Kali (\\"river\\" in Javanese). Others note that the name Kalijaga derived its nature from the Arabic notion of qadli dzaqa which means \\"holy leader\\" in the sultanate. Names Sunan Kalijaga was known by the following names and titles:Sunyoto (2014:214) *Raden *Lokajaya *Syaikh Melaya *Raden Abdurrahman *Pangeran (prince) Tuban *Ki Dalang Sida Brangti *Ki Dalang Bengkok *Ki Dalang Kumendung *Ki Unehan Life Sunan Kalijaga was a close friend of Sunan Gunungjati, and is said to have lived to the age of one hundred. He witnessed the downfall of Majapahit, the kingdoms of Demak, Cirebon, Banten, and Pajang in 1546. Among his missionary activities (dawah), he built two mosques, Masjid Agung Cirebon and Masjid Agung Demak. His main mentor was Sunan Bonang, another of the Wali Sanga. Kalijaga's beliefs and teaching are more sufistic than salaf, applying arts and culture as medium for his dawah. He was also tolerant to local tradition. His exegesis from the Quranic perspective led him to believe that people will keep away from dakwah if their personality is questioned. In this premise one should consider a step by step approach to his people by the principle of following yet influencing. To him, if Islam is truly or fully understood, then people will gradually give up their old habits. This method can be seen in Indonesian artworks, particularly in carvings, shadow puppets (wayang kulit), gamelan (javanese traditional musical performance), and singing. From this idea he popularized Baju Takwa (a traditional dress custom for Indonesian Moslem), Sekaten (a festivity), and Grebeg Maulid, amongst others. Sunan Kalijaga was buried in Kadilangu southeast of Demak. Babad Tanah Jawi (\\"History of the land of Java\\") In the Babad Tanah Jawi, a chronicle of large Javanese manuscripts, there are no formal signs of Sunan Kalijaga's conversion to Islam so it is not clear if Kalijaga is already Muslim at the time of his \\"conversion\\". In this legend, he is said to be the son of Tumenggung Wilatikta, and in the service of the Majapahit empire, and Kalijaga whose religion is unspecified but has the Arabic name \\"Said\\". Following gambling losses, Said resorts to highway robbery on the north coast of Java. Sunan Bonang one day passes and is pulled up by Said. Sunan Bonang suggests it would be better for Said to rob a person who will later pass dressed in blue with a red hibiscus behind his ear. Three days later, this person passes, and is Bonang in disguise. Said attacks, but Bonang turns himself into four persons, traumatising Said such that he becomes an ascetic. He takes the name \\"Kalijaga\\", becomes a wali and marries the sister of Sunan Giri.Ricklefs (1991), p. 10.

The appropriate ward is called Wallisdown and Winton West.  Geography  Wallisdown is situated on the border between Bournemouth and Poole. The main road through the area is Wallisdown Road which runs from Boundary Roundabout (adjacent to Bournemouth University) to Mountbatten Roundabout, Ringwood Road. Wallisdown is close to Alderney, West Howe, Slades Farm and Ensbury Park.  Buildings and landmarks  The area has 19th century houses and cottages in Talbot Village, although there has been much development from the mid 20th century. Local industries include Parvalux Electric Motors on Wallisdown Road, the UK's largest fractional horsepower motor manufacturer, next to cosmetics and healthcare giant Procter & Gamble.  Community services  Schools that serve the area are Talbot Primary School and St Aldhelm's Academy for the Poole half and St Mark's School for the Bournemouth side (with a number of secondary schools in the north of Bournemouth). Churches in the area include St. Mark's Church in Wallisdown Road, St Saviour's in Alton Road.  Transport  Wallisdown is served by Wilts & Dorset and Yellow Buses which provide services to Bournemouth and Poole. Wallisdown Roundabout The main road running through the area (A3049) has for some years been overloaded with traffic and the area is blighted with congestion, particularly around the Wallisdown Roundabout. Dorset County Council has made three attempts in the last 20 years to build a relief road on a corridor of land reserved along the riverside behind Talbot Village to the Alderney roundabout, but has been unsuccessful, in part due to resident opposition to the scheme. Land is still reserved in various verges along Talbot Avenue and Wallisdown Road for dual carriageway upgrades. The Fern Barrow and Boundary Lane roundabouts have been built to accommodate this potential future upgrade, with the former being much too large for its purpose and the latter covered in red hatching where a second lane should run (near the university). There is, however, a 'pinch point' around Wallisdown Roundabout which would require a large (and costly) demolition programme that has made the scheme proposals financially unattractive.

It is set mainly in Manaus, Brazil, early in the 20th century and conveys the author's vision of the Amazon River. It was a finalist for all of the major British children's literary awards (below), winning the Smarties Prize, ages 9‚Äì11, and garnering an unusual commendation as runner-up for the Guardian Award. Anne Fine, British Children's Laureate (2001-3) and one of three former winners on the Guardian panel, wrote that \\"we all fell on Eva Ibbotson's perfectly judged, brilliantly light to read, civilised Journey To The River Sea, in which we are shown how, as one of the characters Miss Minton reminds us, 'Children must lead big lives... if it is in them to do so.' because, in any other year, we would have handed her the prize without a thought.\\" Plot The book opens in an exclusive London girls' school, The Mayfair Academy for Young Ladies. Maia, an orphan, is sent from this safe and cosy environment to stay with distant relations, the Carters, who are not as kind as she had hoped for. The Carters do not embrace their surroundings and almost always stay indoors, except for trips to Manaus. Beatrice and Gwendolyn, the twin daughters, are selfish and seem to be brought up strictly to be British, while their father, the eccentric Mr Carter, obsessively collects the glass eyes of famous people. Living with the family is Miss Minton, governess to Maia and the twins, who, despite an outwardly strict appearance, begins to care deeply for Maia. The family plans to see a play starring Clovis King, an English child actor, but the twins lie and say that all the tickets had sold out so they couldn't buy one for Maia. She decides to go anyway and secretly slips out of the Carters house to get there. When she gets lost, a Native boy takes her to the theatre on his boat. When Maia finally gets to watch Little Lord Fauntleroy, Clovis acts very well, but during the pivotal scene, his voice cracks and the play is ruined. Later, Maia meets an orphaned half Xanti, half British boy called Finn Taverner and finds out that he was the boy who gave her a ride to Clovis's act. Two detectives, Mr. Trapwood and Mr. Low, whom Maia nicknames \\"the crows\\", are chasing him because his grandfather, Lord Aubrey Taverner, wants to find the heir of Westwood, the estate of the wealthy Taverner family. Finn doesn't want to go because of the terrible memories his father had of living in Westwood, and because he wants to travel up the Amazon to where the Xanti, the Native tribe to which his mother belonged, live. Afterward, Clovis meets Finn too and Finn suggests that they swap positions by making Clovis take the place of Finn. Clovis, also an orphan, desperately wants to go back to England, while Finn wants to stay in Brazil. Clovis will pretend to be Finn Taverner and become the heir to Westwood, while Finn will explore the \\"River Sea\\" (the name given to the Amazon River by locals). The swapping is successful, and for a while, everything seems to be going fairly well. But then one day, Miss Minton disappears. She has plans to rescue Maia from the Carters by taking the place of Mademoiselle Lille, the governess to a Russian family, the Kaminsky's, Maia's friends Sergei and Olga and their parents, the Count and Countess Kaminsky. However, Maia, who Miss Minton eventually plans to take with her, do not know this and believes that she has been abandoned. While she is gone, the twins accidentally start a fire in the Carters' home. Mrs. Carter, distracted by Beatrice and Gwendolyn's fighting, accidentally spills insect repellent onto the oil lamp, burning the twins' bedroom and finally the whole house. The Carters are sent to the hospital in the river ambulance, but Maia is left on her own. She is found by Finn and he takes her on his boat, the Arabella, to embark on the adventure she had hoped for. Miss Minton and her friend, Professor Neville Glastonberry, chase after them by boat as well. They find the Xanti and for a short time, they live with them and are perfectly happy. One day, Maia is singing for the Xanti when the police from Manaus hear her voice and also find Miss Minton's corset, and, thinking they are rescuing Miss Minton, Maia, and the curator of the Natural History Museum, take them back to Manaus. Meanwhile, in England, Clovis confesses that he is not the heir and wishes to go home, which causes Sir Aubrey to have a heart attack. Finn goes to Westwood to help Clovis, but Clovis tells him that he has since told Sir Aubrey that his confession was simply a joke. Finn is relieved as this means he can return to Brazil. In the end, Mrs. Carter, Beatrice, and Gwendolyn return to England to become servants of their wealthy relative, Lady Parsons. Maia, Miss Minton, and Finn all return to Manaus and Clovis, under the assumed identity of Finn, is able to stay in England and becomes the heir to Westwood.  Main characters   Maia Fielding  Maia is an orphan and the main character of the book. Bright, passionate, adventurous, determined and resourceful, Maia has great ambition and a talent for music. She used to live and study in a boarding school in England, called \\"Mayfair Academy for Young Ladies\\"; all fees were subsidised by her parents' trust fund. She journeys to the Amazon to live with her relatives, the Carters, who exploit, neglect and abuse her, only keeping her under their roof for the sake of her parents' money. She grows close to her governess, Miss Minton. She also forms remarkably close bonds with both Clovis King and Finn Taverner, who are, if in different ways, in lonely and vulnerable situations similar to her own. Maia is excited and mystified by the unexplored Amazon and deeply cares about it once it becomes her own home. Clovis King Clovis (Jimmy Bates, as Clovis is his stage name) is an impoverished boy actor who dreams of going home to England. He has a mishap in Manaus and leaves the acting troupe as they fall into debt and are arrested. Later, Clovis takes Finn's place as heir at Westwood in England, convincing detectives of the false identity. He is reunited with his foster mother who persuades him to reveal his true identity. Clovis tries to reveal his identity on several occasions‚Äîone of which results in disaster, and Clovis remains heir to Westwood. He has feelings for Maia, asking Finn whether he can \\"have Maia when she's grown up.\\" He ends the book living like the wealthy heir Finn Taverner. Clovis is kind and sensitive, yet his insecurities and anxiety (characterised by his frequent homesickness and tears) are mistaken at first for cowardice. The book concludes with him having found courage, using his acting talent to succeed in his dream of reaching England and his mother. Finn Taverner  Finn Taverner is a half Native (Xanti), half English boy who is the true heir of Westwood (his father's aristocratic home). Loathing to leave his life on the Amazon, however, he spends a long period of time evading those who wish to return him to England. He befriends Maia and comes to trust her completely. With her help, he persuades Clovis to take on his identity and become the heir of Westwood in his place. Afterwards, he sails down the rivers along with Maia looking for the Xanti (his mother's tribe) and succeeds. At the end of the book, he, Maia, Professor Glastonbury, and Miss Minton all remain in the Amazon, referring to it as \\"home\\". It is implied that Finn too has romantic feelings for Maia, most notably when Clovis asks if he can marry Maia when she's grown-up\\" and Finn's smile vanishes and he answers 'NO!'. Finn desires to become a herbalist or a doctor that treats patients with plants and roots found in the wilderness rather than medicine.  Mrs. Carter  Mrs Carter is the twins' mother and Mr Carter's wife. It is clear she only took Maia in for the money that came with her. She uses this to buy various varieties of insect repellent as she is shown to hate bugs. She is also greedy and demonstrates signs of increasing mental instability towards the end of the book. When she gets the money Maia brought she doesn't spend it on Maia's needs such as piano lessons for her she just uses it to buy herself clothes and her daughter twins dresses. She is in debt, and all the other families living in Manaus despise the Carters. When her house is set on fire, she goes to live with a distant relative, who turns Mrs Carter into her personal maid. There two horrible children who like money and like to hurt Maias fellings  Mr. Carter  Mr Carter is the twins' father. He is in debt in Manaus and is wanted for fraud in England after embezzling the bank where he worked. He is shown to be manipulative and has an obsession with collecting famous peoples' glass eyes. At the end of the novel, he is sent to prison in the Amazon after failing to pay workers and loan sharks. He also gets taken to prison by Gonzales. Mr Carter is a very mysterious man; he doesn't really care for his family and spends all day in his messy office obsessing over his collection of eyeballs. He loves his collection of eyeballs to such an extent that when the Carters' home caught fire, he chose to retrieve his collection of eyes from his office instead of helping Maia from the burning house. When questioned by Miss Minton at the hospital he claims that he tried to get to Maia's room but the fire prevented him from reaching her.  Miss.Minton  Miss Minton is the governess of Maia and the twins. She is reserved, though caring. She is very slender and bony and wears only black, preferring gothic accessories such as a spear- shaped hatpin and steel, beaked umbrella. She is strict and concerned with routine and proper learning, encouraging Maia to study Portuguese, for example, in the empty dining room of a ship caught in a storm, or asking Finn to continue his Latin studies whilst in the Amazon rainforest. She loves reading books, particularly Shakespeare. A close friend of Bernard Taverner, she is revealed to be the maid who helped him escape his abusive household and reach the Amazon when they were younger. This is realised as her friend named his boat after her: the \\"Arabella\\". Miss Minton takes the job with the Carters in order to follow her late friend's journey to the Amazon. She is extremely intelligent, having been revealed to have knowledge of all the plots the children concoct but allowing them to take place. She has a witty and dry sense of humour, and is cunning, using deception and acting in order to protect the children from unkind and corrupt individuals, such as the detectives. Miss Minton grows to love Maia and treats her like her own child. She finally manages to persuade Mr Murray to let her and Maia live together in the Amazon. Furthermore, she seems to find romance with Doctor Glastonbury, a naturalist, and Bernard's close friend. He eventually proposes to her, but she is not certain of her suitability to marry.  Mr Trapwood and Mr Low  Trapwood and Low are two detectives who search for Finn (who is the legitimate heir) on behalf of Aubrey Taverner. They are greedy, hoping only for money in exchange for their work, and are clumsy and unkind in their attempts to discover the boy. Two unwittingly comedic individuals, Mr Trapwood being harsh and tall and Mr Low being short with a high pitched tone, they wear only black suits despite the weather. Whilst being led astray from their mission by residents of Manaus and the Amazonian Natives (all of whom despise them, being friends of Bernard and Finn Taverner), they befall a series of comedic misfortunes. Their racism towards the Natives is also their downfall, as they are mocked by the tribes, refuse to change out of British attire and therefore overheat, and are easily deceived by Finn's charade towards the end of the novel due to their irrational prejudices. Awards Journey to the River Sea won the Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize for reader ages 9‚Äì11. It was identified as runner-up for the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize and it made the shortlist for the Carnegie Medal; the Whitbread Award, Children's Book; and the Blue Peter Book Award.

It is situated in the Majdanpek municipality, in the Bor District. It is located on the right bank of Lake ƒêerdap on the Danube. The population of the town is 2,410 people (2011 census). Its name means \\"Lower Milanovac\\" (there is an Upper Milanovac, as well). The management office of ƒêerdap national park is located in the town. It has been nicknamed a \\"town of 100,000 roses\\".  Geography  The town is located on the right bank of Lake ƒêerdap on the Danube, and is located in the ƒêerdap national park. The Miroƒç mountain lies between Donji Milanovac and Tekija and further to the south are the Kuƒçaj mountains. The Miroƒç is known for the abundance of the medicinal herbs while the area surrounding the town is covered in lush deciduous forests. Via Danube, Donji Milanovac is away from Belgrade. It is situated in the Veliki Kazan gorge, a section of the composite Iron Gate gorge. At Donji Milanovac, the Danube is wide, while at Veliki Kazan is wide and deep. The locality on which the settlement is today used to be called \\"Trkulja's gallery\\", after a local artist. A balloon station \\"Pena\\" was situated on location, as prior to the discovery of radio, balloons were used for signalization during the navigation through the canal. Prior to the construction of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station, which dammed the Danube and created the Lake ƒêerdap in 1967‚Äì72, belugas from the Black Sea reached the gorge, travelling upstream for . Specimen, up to , used to be fished in Donji Milanovac. The dam prevents belugas from swimming upstream since, so the largest fish in the lake now is wels catfish, with rare specimen reaching .  History  Donji Milanovac lies on remains of an 8000-year-old Mesolithic settlement of the Lepenski Vir, and of the Roman town of Taliata. Since the founding of the first settlement, Donji Milanovac was moved three times. It was originally established as a settlement called Banja which was moved some upstream, on the island of Poreƒç (which also became the name of the settlement), during the 17th century. In 1830, due to frequent flooding, ruling prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá ordered the town be moved to the nearest, right bank, so it was resettled downstream, at the mouth of river Ore≈°kovica into the Danube. It became the first town in Serbia built by architectural planning. The relocation was finished by 1832 and the town became the seat of the Poreƒç nahiyah. From 1929 to 1941, Donji Milanovac was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After construction of the \\"ƒêerdap I\\" hydroelectric power station in 1970, the town was moved again to its present location, another downstream, and the old site was completely flooded by the Lake ƒêerdap in 1971.  Lepenski Vir  Lepenski Vir is an important Mesolithic archaeological site located 15 kilometers from Donji Milanovac. The latest radiocarbon and AMS data suggests that the chronology of Lepenski Vir is compressed between 9500/7200-6000 BC. There is some disagreement about the early start of the settlement and culture of Lepenskir Vir. But the latest data suggest 9500-7200 to be the start. The late Lepenskir Vir (6300‚Äì6000 BC) architectural development was the development of the Trapezoidal buildings and monumental sculpture[1] The Lepenski Vir site consists of one large settlement with around ten satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architecture have been found at the site.  Culture  The Church of St. Nicholas is located in the centre of Donji Milanovac. It was built in 1840 thanks to captain Mi≈°a Anastasijeviƒá. Captain Mi≈°a's konak and Tenka's house have been proclaimed cultural heritage of Serbia. There is a monument to the 1912‚Äì1918 wars (Balkan Wars, First World War), and a mammoth sculpture. Another noted monument is the Roman Tabula Traiana.  Economy  Until the 1990s, there were numerous companies in the town: wood company \\"Poreƒç\\", factories \\"FEP\\" and \\"Megaplast\\", hotel \\"Lepenski Vir\\", agricultural cooperative \\"Sloga\\", etc. By 2010s, the majority of economy deteriorated and depopulation accelerated.  Tourism  In 1972 a hotel \\"Lepenski Vir\\" was built and the town beach was arranged. The area became a popular camping location as, due to the climate, there are no mosquitos. Donji Milanovac and the gorge are situated on the European bicycle corridor and the ƒêerdap highway, the shortest connection between Belgrade and Bucharest, Romania, and further with the Black Sea. The town also has a pier, which is today mostly used by the foreign river cruisers. During the 1970s there was a regular motorboat line from Belgrade to ƒêerdap, which took about two and a half hours. Donji MIlanovac was nicknamed \\"Serbian Hollywood\\" as numerous movies were filmed in the town and the surroundings, including Naivko (1975), ƒÜao, inspektore (1984) and Vampiri su meƒëu nama (1989).

Vojvodina Autonomist Movement is a political movement in the Serbian province of Vojvodina that advocates more autonomy for Vojvodina within Serbia. History The idea was introduced during the 1990s and was more popular during the Yugoslav Wars when one part of the local population wasn't satisfied with the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. During this time period, Milo≈°eviƒá's regime abolished much of the aspects of Vojvodina's autonomy, which the province enjoyed during the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Republic of Vojvodina within federalized Serbia, proposed by the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina in 1999. Political parties There are several political parties or party coalitions that advocate more for Vojvodina within Serbia. Most popular of them is the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina led by Nenad ƒåanak. Other parties include: Vojvodina's Party, Vojvodinian Movement, etc. These parties are mostly led and supported by local Vojvodinian Serb population. There are also several political parties of local ethnic minorities, some of which, aside from supporting rights of ethnic minorities, are also supporting the idea of more autonomy for Vojvodina. Proposals and initiatives There are various views among autonomist political parties about the desired level of autonomy of Vojvodina. Some of the proposals are advocating (or advocated) returning to the level of autonomy as it was in 1974, while other proposals are supporting the idea of more autonomy than in 1990s, but somewhat less than in 1974. One of the proposals was the proposal of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, which advocated the transformation of Serbia into a \\"democratic federal state\\" with federal units with higher or lower levels of autonomy. One of the federal units of federal Serbia, according to the proposal, would be the Republic of Vojvodina ( or ; ; ; ; ; Rusyn: –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –í–æ–π–≤–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞). Besides Vojvodina, other federal units would be ≈†umadija, South-Eastern Serbia, city of Belgrade, Sand≈æak and Kosovo. According to the League, this political solution would \\"stabilize Serbia as a state and would prevent any separatist tendencies on the territory of Serbia\\". In recent years, the League mostly abandoned the idea about Republic of Vojvodina, but it still advocating a higher level of autonomy for the province.

It is an exudate rich in white blood cells, seen in the anterior chamber, usually accompanied by redness of the conjunctiva and the underlying episclera. It is a sign of inflammation of the anterior uvea and iris, i.e. iritis, which is a form of anterior uveitis. The exudate settles at the dependent aspect of the eye due to gravity. It can be sterile (in bacterial corneal ulcer) or not sterile (fungal corneal ulcer). Differential diagnosis Slit Lamp view of hypopyon Hypopyon can be present in a corneal ulcer. Beh√ßet's disease, endophthalmitis, panuveitis/panophthalmitis, and adverse reactions to some drugs (such as rifabutin). Hypopyon is also known as sterile pus, as it occurs due to the release of toxins and not by the actual invasion of pathogens. The toxins secreted by the pathogens mediate the outpouring of leukocytes that settle in the anterior chamber of the eye. An inverse hypopyon is different from a standard hypopyon. Inverse hypopyon is seen after a pars plana vitrectomy with an insertion of silicone oil (as a replacement of the vitreous humour that has been removed in the operation; the silicone oil maintains internal tamponade). When the silicone oil emulsifies, it seeps into the anterior chamber and settles at the top of the anterior chamber. This is in contrast to hypopyon resulting from toxins where the leukocytes settle at the bottom of the anterior chamber. This is due to the effect of gravity, hence the name inverse hypopyon. Treatment A hypopyon should not be drained, because it offers protection against the invading pathogen due to the presence of white blood cells, although long-standing hypopyon can cause close-angle glaucoma and anterior synechiae. Intravitreal antibiotics can be used if endophthalmitis is suspected.

The church was built around 1100 and has since been refurbished and restored several times. It was not until 1772 that the bishopric of Susa was created from the territory of the abbey, previously a territorial abbacy, and at that point the abbey church was made the cathedral of the new diocese. The cathedral is a Romanesque style building. The fa√ßade has terracotta decorations and is joined to a Roman gate of the 4th century, the Porta Savoia, to the south. Halfway along the south side stands the campanile, with six levels of mullioned windows. The interior is on the Latin Cross plan, with three aisles.

The badge of was displayed on the tampions of her main guns in 1917, before the standardisation of Royal Navy designs Naval heraldry commonly takes the form of a badge, seal, crest, or coat of arms designed specifically for a ship (or a series of ships bearing the same name), which in Commonwealth navies takes the form of a large plaque, referred to as the ship's badge, mounted on the superstructure of the ship, and in the United States Navy is known as the ship's seal or ship's crest, and is primarily found on crew uniform patches. An item of naval heraldry is seen as the identifying logo of the vessel, and is commonly reproduced on hats, stationery, trophies, souvenirs, and gifts related to the ship. In many navies, the ship's badge is also displayed on the tampions ‚Äì the covers for the gun muzzles. The naval heraldric tradition follows the heraldic traditions of the country, with some distinctive variations. Portuguese Navy Marine Corps (Corpo de Fuzileiros) of the Portuguese Navy. The system of naval heraldry used by the Portuguese Navy was established and regulated in 1972, being slightly reviewed by an ordinance of February 18, 2010. The coats of arms consist of a round tip shield (Portuguese shield), topped by a naval crown and under which is placed a scroll with the motto or the name of the body or unit. A scroll with the war cry of the unit can be placed above the naval crown. The coat of arms may also include tenants or supporters, trophies and decorations. A coat of arms can also be used as a badge, in which case an entirely round shield is used, surrounded by a branch of laurel on the right and by a branch of oak on the left. The following bodies and units are entitled to the use of coat of arms: # The Portuguese Navy itself; # Naval and maritime zones commands; # Bodies dependent from the Naval Command led by officers with the rank of commander or higher; # Main bodies of the National Maritime Authority; # The Hydrographic Institute; # Superintendencies and directorates of the Navy # Corvettes, frigates, submarines, training ships and other ships commanded by officers with the rank of commander or higher; # Permanent naval forces and groups; # Other bodies of the Navy commanded by officers with the rank of captain or higher; # The Hospital of the Navy; # The Navy Staff; # The Navy Band; # Authorized non-permanent naval forces and marine forces commanded by officers with the rank of commander or higher; # Flag officers heads of bodies or units entitled to the use of coat of arms. The coats of arms of the flag officers consist of the shield of the body or unit they command, replacing the naval crown for a helmet with a crest. The heraldic rank insignia of the officer (consisting of one or two anchors) is placed under the shield. The commands and the units of the Portuguese Navy are also entitled to the use of heraldic flags, that ‚Äì depending on the type of unit ‚Äì can be in the form of a standard, a guidon or a pennon. Royal Australian Navy The ship's badge of the Australian aircraft carrier . This is the current (post 1975) version of the badge. An item of naval heraldry in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is referred to as a ship's badge, although the incorrect ship's crest is sometimes used.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 191 Initially, the badges were designed and assigned to ships by the Royal Navy. After World War II, an Australian body, the Badges, Names and Honours Committee, was created to take responsibility for creating RAN ships' badges. At the first meeting, it was decided that all RAN badges would follow the Royal Navy format: a circle of rope in which the individual design would be placed, capped by a naval crown and a scroll with the ship's name. A second, longer scroll was located below the rope circle for the ship's motto. To identify the ship as Australian, the badge included a boomerang between the rope circle and motto scroll. The design was revised soon after to also incorporate a nulla nulla and a stone axe, intertwined with the boomerang. Initially, there were gaps between the naval crown, name scroll, and rope circle.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 192-193 The name and motto scrolls were intended to be light blue with black lettering, although in practice they were painted dark blue, making the text hard to read. In 1964, the gaps between the crown, scroll, and circle were closed up, and the scrolls were changed to black with gold edging and lettering. The lettering style was also simplified.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 194 In 1970, a minor change was made to the naval crown, with one of the pennants on top of the sails altered to point left instead of right. Another minor change was made to the crown in 1974, with the curvature of the sails altered. In 1975, the weapons below the rope circle were reorganised so the nulla nulla and axe were superimposed over the boomerang, and were redrawn slightly: one of the major changes being thicker hafts on the crossed weapons. Size and use Ship's badges are used equally by the RAN for ships, shore establishments, and organisations within the RAN. The standard badge measures , with the rope circle having a diameter of from the outside edge and from the inside edge.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 195 \\"Boat's badges\\" were created for small craft belonging to a ship: the weapons and motto are omitted. Boat's badges are either or in diameter. Following the introduction of Attack class patrol boats and Oberon class submarines into the RAN fleet in the early 1960s, a scaled-down badge design was created for all commissioned ships of less than in length and all submarines, measuring but with no other modifications. For the patrol boats, it was decided that a full-size badge was not appropriate for such small ships. The reduced size for submarines was a practical necessity: the badge had to fit through the external hatch, as it was only displayed on the fin while in port. Chief of Navy, a non-commissioned administrative division For non-commissioned units and establishments, an altered badge design was used. The first establishment to wear a non-commissioned badge was the RAN/RAAF Australian Joint Anti-Submarine School (AJASS) in 1967. Being a joint unit, it was decided that the badge design would be based on the RAAF unit badge, with a double circle of gold rope surrounding the collar on which the unit name was written, but with an alteration in colouring to the black and gold system used on the scrolls of ships' badges.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 197 The royal crown was used instead of the naval crown. The badge entered use with all non- commissioned RAN units, such as the dockyards, naval police, and administrative divisions. In 1979, all of the altered badges (excluding the joint-operated AJASS) were changed from the royal crown to the naval crown. Royal Danish Navy Ship's badge for Iver Huitfeldt (F361) The tradition of Naval heraldry in the Royal Danish Navy, can be traced back to the 17th century, where ships had elaborate decorations on its Transom. With the introduction of steel ships, the tradition fell out of favour. The was a renewed interest in the heraldry in the 1930s, however, the outbreak of World War II halted any work. Following a visit to Rotterdam in June 1950, Danish sailors expressed wishes to reintroduce heraldry to the Navy's ships for easier recognition and to increase cohesion on the ships. Following a number of work-groups to determine design and use a standard was produced on 26 April 1957 and approved by the King on the 15 June 1957. On 15 April 1959, the first 15 ships' badges were approved by the King. In 1961, designs for other naval institution badges were approved. Royal Canadian Navy Ships in the Royal Canadian Navy receive badges, specifically designed for each ship. Using a circular design, they are topped with the naval crown and surrounded by a gold rope. Three maple leaves at the bottom of the rope circle distinguish Canadian badges from those of other Commonwealth navies. During World War II, the number of ships being built and commissioned outstripped the ability of a central authority to design and approve. Local authority to the commanding officers of the ships resulted in humorous and risque badges, including some cartoon characters. These badges are not considered to be official. Currently, all badges are reviewed by the Director of Ceremonial and recommended to the Governor General.Naval Museum of Manitoba - Canadian Naval History CFB Esquimalt Naval & Military Museum has an extensive collection of official Canadian naval ship, naval establishments and naval air unit badges 1910-1948. Lieutenant-Commander (Ret'd) David J. Freeman heads the Badge Project, capturing photographic or digital images of all the badges worn by HMC ships before 1948, and is in the process of completing a book on this subject. Royal Norwegian Navy It is customary for each individual ship and other units in the Royal Norwegian Navy to receive an individually designed coat of arms. These coats of arms follow the Norwegian heraldic tradition of being very simple in design. They often feature only one colour, one metal and one motive. They all have the same shield shape and are surrounded by a rope. The shield is surmounted by the heraldic Crown of Norway atop the ship's name. The design of the individual shield is often inspired by connections the ship name gives. HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen is given a shield inspired by the family coat of arms of the Nansen family. Others are given shields based on the unit's function. The Naval Schools have a shield depicting a golden anchor and two silver torches of wisdom. All naval coats of arms have to be approved by the King of Norway. Royal Navy During the Age of Sail, ships were identified by figureheads and gilded carvings.Vic Cassells (2000). The Capital Ships, p. 189 However, the extravagance of these decorations began to reach the point of flamboyance, and an Admiralty directive in the early 18th century restricted the amount that could be spent, and eventually banned it outright. Ships' badges first appeared in the 1850s, as identification markings on the stationery used by some Royal Navy ships. These marks were quickly used to mark the boats assigned to a ship, to aid crew in finding their boat at a dark or crowded wharf. The creation of badges was haphazard, and eventually came into use for the ships themselves. In 1918, Charles ffoulkes, the curator of the newly established Imperial War Museum was asked by the commanding officer of HMS Tower to design a badge for his ship. He quickly received requests to create badges for other Royal Navy vessels, and on 10 December 1918, ffoulkes was appointed the Admiralty advisor on heraldry. Shortly prior to this, a Ships' Badge Committee had been established to regulate the creation and use of ships' badges.Vic Cassells (2000). The Capital Ships, p. 190 In 1919 the badges were standardized as four shapes: Circular (Battleships & Battle Cruisers), Pentagonal (Cruisers), Shield (Destroyers) and Diamond (all other types and shore establishments). Testing was carried out to ensure that the badges were designed appropriately to identify ships. Cardboard mockups were created, gilded, and installed on a police launch, which was observed on patrol of the Thames by a captured German submarine moored outside the Palace of Westminster. It was decided to use different shapes to identify different types of vessel: circles for battleships, pentagons for cruisers, 'U'-shaped shields for destroyers, and diamonds for auxiliary units, including depot ships, small war vessels, and aircraft carriers. In 1940, the designs for all ships were standardised to a circular design. This was primarily due to wartime shortages, although another factor was to eliminate difficulties caused when a ship was commissioned with a previously-used name but was a different type of vessel, requiring the badge to be redesigned for the new shape. At the same time, the use of scaled-down badges for a ship's boats was suspended, and as of 2000 has not been resumed. After the war, the pentagonal badge shape was assigned to Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, and the diamond to commissioned shore bases. Before World War II, the design of badges for ships in other Commonwealth navies was the responsibility of the Royal Navy Ships' Badge Committee, but this responsibility was assigned to the relevant nations after the war. Ships' badges are reused along with the ship name. When the Queen approves the name of a new ship she will also approve the new ship's badge, which may have changed if the shape needs to change. HMS Chatham was a ship serving in the Royal Navy with an original badge, since none of the previous Chathams bore a badge. South African Navy A few ships of the South African Navy adopted badges during World War II, but they appear to have been unofficial. Only one, that of the reserve base HMSAS Unitie, conformed to the Royal Navy pattern of enclosing the badge in a 'U'-shaped frame of golden cable, ensigned of a naval crown resting on a name plaque. Badges were formalised after the war, the Royal Navy model being followed. At first, badges were diamond-shaped, but after a few years they were changed to circular frames. Unitie retained her shield-shaped badge, and in the 1980s, pentagonal badges were introduced for Navy Headquarters and the headquarters of the regional commands. The naval crown was replaced by the red lion crest of the national coat of arms in 1954, and this in turn was replaced by the secretary-bird crest of the new national arms in 2002. Where ships and shore units are named after provinces and towns, their badges incorporate elements of the provincial or civic arms, for example the ox-wagon in the badge of the frigate SAS Transvaal. Those named after historical personalities incorporate their namesakes' personal coats of arms, or elements of their arms, in their badges, for example the shield of the Van Riebeeck arms in the badge of the destroyer SAS Jan van Riebeeck. For some categories of ships, including the Daphn√©-class submarines, Minister-class strike craft, and River-class minehunters, standard badges were designed, which were then differenced to identify individual vessels. The submarines' badges depicted a trident (emblem of the submarine branch) surmounted by a lozenge displaying the arms of the lady after whom the vessel was named. The strike craft badges depict a Viking longboat in full sail, with elements of the arms of the cabinet minister after which the ship was named on the sail. The minehunters' badges depict a bridge across a river, with an additional device above the bridge alluding to the name of the river. Badges are designed and approved by the South African National Defence Force's heraldry section, and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry to provide legal protection against misuse. United States Navy A uniform patch showing the coat of arms of the United States destroyer Crest of the United States aircraft carrier It is the custom in the United States Navy (USN) for ships, bases and other commands to receive an individually designed heraldic emblem. Due to heraldic traditions in the U.S., these emblems usually take the form of seals or crests; the terms are used often interchangeably, although the emblems are different. These items of naval heraldry are most commonly found on uniform patches for the ship's crew; unlike ships in Commonwealth navies, which display their symbols on plaques and battle honor boards fixed to the superstructure of the ship, USN ships are not allowed to paint or otherwise fix the ship's heraldry to the exterior of the ship.Bob Ohl (1954). A Naval 'Coat of Arms' for Your Ship, in All Hands, p. 31 From World War I to the beginning of World War II, some U.S. Navy ships had these insignia, but World War II brought them into general use. Some designs were created by the ship's personnel, while others were commissioned by professional artists. The Korean War saw another upsurge in interest in crests and coats of arms. In the 1950s and 1960s, OPNAVINST 5030.2B encouraged ships to design their own crests, and laid out the procedure for receiving official approval. Today, the prospective commanding officers of new ships are responsible for designing the crests and submitting them for approval. They have great leeway in determining the design, and may optionally use the services of the U.S. Army's heraldry branch. Seals for destroyers tend to be oval in shape, whereas seals for submarines and aircraft carriers tend to be circular. Littoral combat ship and aircraft carrier crests also tend to feature a profile illustration of the ship on the crest, whereas destroyer crests do not.

It can form two stoichiometric forms: 3Al2O32SiO2 or 2Al2O3 SiO2. Unusually, mullite has no charge balancing cations present. As a result, there are three different aluminium sites: two distorted tetrahedral and one octahedral. Mullite was first described in 1924 for an occurrence on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. It occurs as argillaceous inclusions in volcanic rocks in the Isle of Mull, inclusions in sillimanite within a tonalite at Val Sissone, Italy and with emerylike rocks in Argyllshire, Scotland. Porcellanite Mullite (porcelainite) can be found as a constituent mineral in a type of thermally- metamorphosed rock called porcellanite. Use in porcelain Mullite is present in the form of needles in porcelain. It is produced during various melting and firing processes, and is used as a refractory material,H. Schneider & S. Komarneni (2005) Mullite. Wiley, VCH, 509 pp, due to its high melting point of 1840 ¬∞C. In 2006 researchers at University College London and Cardiff University discovered that potters in the Hesse region of Germany since the late Middle Ages had used mullite in the manufacture of a type of crucible (known as Hessian crucibles), that were renowned for enabling alchemists to heat their crucibles to very high temperatures. The formula for making it (using kaolinitic clay and then firing it at temperatures above 1100 ¬∞C) was kept a closely guarded secret. Mullite morphology is also important for its application. In this case, there are two common morphologies for mullite. One is a platelet shape with low aspect ratio and the second is a needle shape with high aspect ratio. If the needle shape mullite can form in a ceramic body during sintering, it has an effect on both the mechanical and physical properties by increasing the mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance. The most important condition relates to ceramic chemical composition. If the silica and alumina ratio with low basic materials such as sodium and calcium is adjusted, the needle shape mullite forms at about 1400 ¬∞C and the needles will interlock. This mechanical interlocking contributes to the high mechanical strength of porcelain.  Use as a catalyst  Recent research indicates that a synthetic analogue of mullite can be an effective replacement for platinum in diesel engines for exhaust management.

It is a possible complication of all intraocular surgeries, particularly cataract surgery, with possible loss of vision and the eye itself. Infectious cause is the most common and various bacteria and fungi have been isolated as the cause of the endophthalmitis. Other causes include penetrating trauma, allergic reaction, and retained intraocular foreign bodies. Intravitreal injections expose patients to the risk of endophthalmitis, but with an incidence rate usually less than .05%. Signs and symptoms In cases of endophthalmitis, one usually finds a history of recent intraocular surgery or penetrating ocular trauma. In some cases of endogenous endophthalmitis‚Äîparticularly in immunocompromised patients or those with diabetes‚Äîthe spread of infection may have been hematogenous (via the blood-stream). Endophthalmitis is usually accompanied by severe pain, loss of vision, and redness of the conjunctiva and the underlying episclera. Hypopyon can be present in endophthalmitis and should be looked for on examination by a slit lamp. It can first present with the 'black dot sign' (Martin-Farina sign) where patients may report a small area of loss of vision that resembles a black dot or 'fly'. An eye exam may be indicated in severe forms of candidiasis. 1-3% of cases of candidal blood infections include endophthalmitis. Complications * Panophthalmitis ‚Äî Progression to involve all the coats of the eye. * Corneal ulcer * Orbital cellulitis * no light perception vision Cause * Bacteria: N. meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, other streptococcal spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other gram negative organisms.Forbes BA, Sahm DF, Weissfeld AS. Bailey & Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology. 12th Edition. Mosby Elsevier, 2007. p. 834. * Viruses: Herpes simplex virus. * Fungi: Candida spp. Fusarium * Parasites: Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara. Late-onset endophthalmitis is mostly caused by Cutibacterium acnes. Causative organisms are not present in all cases. Endophthalmitis can emerge by entirely sterile means, e.g. an allergic reaction to a drug administered intravitreally. Diagnosis Diagnosis: Microbiology testing. PCR. TASS vs Infectious endophthalmitis. Prevention A Cochrane Review sought to evaluate the effects of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. The review showed high-certainty evidence that antibiotic injections in the eye with cefuroxime at the end of surgery lowers the chance of endophthalmitis. Also, the review showed moderate evidence that antibiotic eye drops (levofloxacin or chloramphenicol) with antibiotic injections (cefuroxime or penicillin) probably lowers the chance of endophthalmitis compared with injections or eye drops alone. Separate studies from the research showed that a periocular injection of penicillin with chloramphenicol-suphadimidine eye drops, and an intracameral cefuroxime injection with topical levofloxacin resulted in a risk reduction of developing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery for subjects. In the case of intravitreal injections, however, antibiotics are not effective. Studies have demonstrated no difference between rates of infection with and without antibiotics when intravitreal injections are performed. The only consistent method of antibioprophylaxis in this instance is a solution of povidone-iodine applied pre-injection. Treatment The patient needs urgent examination by an ophthalmologist, preferably a vitreoretinal specialist who will usually decide for urgent intervention to provide intravitreal injection of potent antibiotics. Injections of vancomycin (to kill Gram-positive bacteria) and ceftazidime (to kill Gram-negative bacteria) are routine. Even though antibiotics can have negative impacts on the retina in high concentrations, the facts that visual acuity worsens in 65% of endophthalmitis patients and prognosis gets poorer the longer an infection goes untreated make immediate intervention necessary. Endophthalmitis patients may also require an urgent surgery (pars plana vitrectomy), and evisceration may be necessary to remove a severe and intractable infection which could result in a blind and painful eye. Steroids may be injected intravitreally if the cause is allergic. In patients with acute endophthalmitis, combined steroid treatment with antibiotics have been found to improve visual outcomes, versus patients only treated with antibiotics, but any improvements on the resolution acute endophthalmitis is unknown.

It was used in the proof of the Hirzebruch‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. Statement of the theorem The L-genus is the genus for the multiplicative sequence of polynomials associated to the characteristic power series :{x\\\\over \\\\tanh(x)} = \\\\sum_{k\\\\ge 0} {{2^{2k}B_{2k}\\\\over (2k)!}x^{2k}} = 1 + {x^2 \\\\over 3} - {x^4 \\\\over 45} +\\\\cdots . The first two of the resulting L-polynomials are: *L_1 = \\\\tfrac13 p_1 *L_2 = \\\\tfrac1{45}(7p_2 - p_1^2) By taking for the p_i the Pontryagin classes p_i(M) of the tangent bundle of a 4n dimensional smooth compact and oriented manifold M one obtains the L-classes of M. Hirzebruch showed that the n-th L-class of M evaluated on the fundamental class of M, [M], is equal to \\\\sigma(M), the signature of M (i.e. the signature of the intersection form on the 2nth cohomology group of M ): : \\\\sigma(M) = \\\\langle L_n(p_1(M), \\\\dots, p_n(M)), [M]\\\\rangle. Sketch of proof of the signature theorem Ren√© Thom had earlier proved that the signature was given by some linear combination of Pontryagin numbers, and Hirzebruch found the exact formula for this linear combination by introducing the notion of the genus of a multiplicative sequence. Since the rational oriented cobordism ring \\\\Omega_*^{\\\\text{SO}}\\\\otimes \\\\Q is equal to :\\\\Omega_*^{\\\\text{SO}}\\\\otimes \\\\Q =\\\\Q [\\\\mathbb{P}^{2}(\\\\Complex), \\\\mathbb{P}^{4}(\\\\Complex), \\\\ldots ], the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes [\\\\mathbb{P}^{2i}(\\\\Complex)] of the even dimensional complex projective spaces, it is enough to verify that : \\\\sigma(\\\\mathbb{P}^{2i})= 1 = \\\\langle L_i(p_1(\\\\mathbb{P}^{2i}), \\\\ldots, p_n(\\\\mathbb{P}^{2i})), [\\\\mathbb{P}^{2i}]\\\\rangle for all i. Generalizations The signature theorem is a special case of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem for the signature operator. The analytic index of the signature operator equals the signature of the manifold, and its topological index is the L-genus of the manifold. By the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem these are equal.
