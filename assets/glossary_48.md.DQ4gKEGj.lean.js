For example, a heist film might include an extended recruitment sequence in which the leader of the gang collects together the conspirators, a robbery sequence, an escape sequence, and so on. Each of these sequences might further contain sub-sequences; for example the robbery sequence might consist of an entry sequence, a safe-cracking sequence, and so on. The sequence is one of a hierarchy of structural units used to describe the structure of films in varying degrees of granularity. Analysed this way, a film is composed of one or more acts; acts include one or more sequences; sequences are divided into one or more scenes; and scenes may be thought of as being built out of shots (if one is thinking visually) or beats (if one is thinking in narrative terms).

It is the only species in the genus Acantharchus. Description The mud sunfish is a small fish which can be distinguished from other members of its family by its possession of 5 or more spines in its anal fin, by having less than 15 gill rakers and in being the only species in its family which has cycloid scales. Its body is oblong and compressed with a large mouth and eyes. This species has rounded pectoral and caudal fins. which are clear through to dark olive in color and the anal fin has a black margin. It has a dark spot on the gill cover and the color of its body varies from brown on the back to yellowish tan on the flanks, while the juveniles are pale olive. There are 3-4 parallel dusky, horizontal stripes which extend from the cheek along the body. They can grow to a maximum total length of , although is a more common total length. Distribution The mud sunfish is occurs along the eastern seaboard of the United States from southern New York south as far as northern Florida. The range of this species just extends into Alabama where they have been recorded in Beaver dam Creek in Washington County. There is a gap in their range in Maryland and Virginia, along the western part of Chesapeake Bay between the Susquehanna River and the Potomac River. It is not common anywhere in its range. Habitat and biology The mud sunfish is found in freshwaters which are stained dark with tannins. It has been recorded in slow-moving sluggish, well vegetated creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes and swamps. As its common name suggests it prefers substrates consisting of mud or detritus. This is a nocturnal species which lives at naturally low densities and as a result there have been few studies conducted on it. What has been discovered is that spawning appears to vary with latitude with gravid females being collected during the late spring and early summer in Delaware while further south, in North Carolina and Georgia spawning takes place during the early fall and late winter. They have a maximum life span of 8 years and sexual maturity is attained at one year old. Their diet is made up largely of invertebrates including amphipods, decapods, and beetles with some smaller fishes and Odonata. Conservation The IUCN has assessed the status of the mud sunfish as Least Concern and states that its population is stable. In individual states, however, there have been significant reductions in the species range. In New York the species was only recorded from the Hackensack River and it has not been collected from there since 1935. Its range has also significantly reduced in New Jersey, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state but it remains reasonable common and widespread in the Pinelands. In New Jesrey the fish's decline is possibly a result of a number of reasons including land use and habitat changes and the introduction of non-native fish which predate on the mud sunfish and in this state it has been recommended that it be classified as a species of special concern. It has been extirpated from Pennsylvania. Taxonomy The mud sunfish was first formally described as Centrarchus pomotis by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1855 with the type locality given as Cedar Swamp Creek, Beesley's Point, Cape May County, New Jersey and the Hackensack River, Rockland County, New York. In 1864, Theodore Nicholas Gill placed it in its own monospecific genus Acantharchus, the new genus name being a compounf of the Greek words acanthus meaning \\"thorn\\" and asrcus meaning \\"anus\\".

A relief valve or pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the \\"path of least resistance\\" as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. See Chapter 11, Flare Stack Plume Rise. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary from roughly 2‚Äì20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns. In high-pressure gas systems, it is recommended that the outlet of the relief valve is in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build-up in the piping system downstream of the relief valve. This often means that the relief valve will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so-called \\"differential\\" relief valves are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the area of the opening of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in the exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation. In some cases, a so-called bypass valve acts as a relief valve by being used to return all or part of the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor. This is done to protect the pump or gas compressor and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path). Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses. In other cases, equipment must be protected against being subjected to an internal vacuum (i.e., low pressure) that is lower than the equipment can withstand. In such cases, vacuum relief valves are used to open at a predetermined low-pressure limit and to admit air or an inert gas into the equipment to control the amount of vacuum. Technical terms In the petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing and power generation industries, the term relief valve is associated with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and safety valve: * Pressure relief valve (PRV) or Pressure Release valve (PRV) or pressure safety valve (PSV): The difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to activate the valve in case of emergency. Most PRVs are spring operated. At lower pressures some use a diaphragm in place of a spring. The oldest PRV designs use a weight to seal the valve. * Set pressure: When the system pressure increases to this value, the PRV opens. The accuracy of the set pressure may follow guidelines set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). * Relief valve (RV): A valve is used on a liquid service, which opens proportionally as the increasing pressure overcomes the spring pressure. * Safety valve (SV): Used in gas service. Most SVs are full lift or snap-acting, in that they pop completely open. * Safety relief valve (SRV): A relief valve that can be used for gas or liquid service. However, the set pressure will usually only be accurate for one type of fluid at a time. * Pilot-operated relief valve (POSRV, PORV, POPRV): A device that relieves by remote command from a pilot valve which is connected to the upstream system pressure. * Low-pressure safety valve (LPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small and near the atmospheric pressure. * Vacuum pressure safety valve (VPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, and near the atmospheric pressure. * Low and vacuum pressure safety valve (LVPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, or positive, and near the atmospheric pressure. * Pressure vacuum release valve (PVRV): A combination of vacuum pressure and a relief valve in one housing. Used on storage tanks for liquids to prevent implosion or overpressure. * Snap acting: The opposite of modulating, refers to a valve that \\"pops\\" open. It snaps into a full lift in milliseconds. Usually accomplished with a skirt on the disc so that the fluid passing the seat suddenly affects a larger area and creates more lifting force. * Modulating: Opens in proportion to the overpressure. Legal and code requirements in industry In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American Petroleum Institute (API) and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with and those codes include design standards for relief valves. The main standards, laws, or directives are: * AD Merkblatt (German) * American Petroleum Institute (API); Standards 520, 521, 526, and 2000 * American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII Division 1 and Section I * American Water Works Association (AWWA), storage tanks * EN 764-7; European Standard based on pressure Equipment Directive 97/23/EC * Eurocode EN 1993-4-2, storage tanks. * International Organization for Standardization; ISO 4126  DIERS  Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems was a consortium of 29 companies under the auspices of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency relief systems to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure relief systems for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations, and many others. Pressure relief systems can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapor, liquid, or a mixture of the two ‚Äì just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow. DIERS investigated the two- phase vapor-liquid onset/disengagement dynamics and the hydrodynamics of emergency relief systems with extensive experimental and analysis work. Of particular interest to DIERS were the prediction of two-phase flow venting and the applicability of various sizing methods for two-phase vapor-liquid flashing flow. DIERS became a user's group in 1985. European DIERS Users‚Äô Group (EDUG) is a group of mainly European industrialists, consultants and academics who use the DIERS technology. The EDUG started in the late 1980s and has an annual meeting. A summary of many of key aspects of the DIERS technology has been published in the UK by the HSE.

The Barynya dance is an alternation of chastushkas and frenetic dancing. Originally the dancing was without special choreography. The main characteristics of the Barynya dance are traditional elements of Russian folk dance like Russian squatting, rotations, jumps and sprited stomping. The main instruments of Baryna are Balalaika and Garmon.

The group experienced commercial success throughout the 1990s and are well known for their single \\"Three Lions\\", a collaboration with David Baddiel and Frank Skinner which reached No. 1 in the UK in 1996 and 1998. The single once again reached No. 1 in the UK in 2018. History =1989‚Äì1993: Formation and early years= Prior to the forming his own project, Ian Broudie had been a member of the 1970s post-punk band Big in Japan, and later formed the new wave duo Care with vocalist Paul Simpson. By the late 1980s, Broudie was better known as a producer than as a musician, and had produced albums for new wave and alternative rock artists such as Echo & the Bunnymen, Wall of Voodoo and the Fall. In 1989, Broudie began recording alone under the name \\"Lightning Seeds\\". The name derives from a misheard lyric from Prince's 1985 hit single \\"Raspberry Beret\\", in which Prince sings the line \\"thunder drowns out what the lightning sees\\". Broudie performed all vocals and instruments on the band's first album, 1989's Cloudcuckooland, which he also produced. The Lightning Seeds achieved success with their debut single, the psychedelic hit \\"Pure\\", which reached the top 20 in the UK and the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Both \\"Pure\\" and followup single \\"All I Want\\" also reached the Modern Rock Tracks top 10. Broudie resumed his production career after the success of the first Lightning Seeds album, but returned to songwriting in 1991 and moved labels from Rough Trade to Virgin. He then resumed his Lightning Seeds recording career, drafting Simon Rogers as his studio partner in production, arrangements, and instrumentation. Rogers, who had also helped with programming on the first Lightning Seeds album, would continue as Broudie's in-studio partner throughout the rest of the Lightning Seeds' career. The album Sense (1992) featured the song \\"The Life of Riley\\", written by Broudie for his son, which reached No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. An instrumental version of the song later became better known as the BBC TV theme for the Goal of the Month competition. The album Sense would mark Broudie's first Lightning Seeds songwriting collaborations with former Specials singer Terry Hall. = 1994‚Äì1998: Touring years = Broudie signed the Lightning Seeds to Epic Records, put other projects on hold and embarked on a touring schedule: By the end of 1993 Broudie had finished the Jollification (1994) album, which included contributions from Terry Hall, Alison Moyet and Ian McNabb, the promotional tour began in August 1994 with a consistently changing line up over the years with Broudie the only constant. The tour benefited from the success of the second single from the album \\"Change\\", which reached No. 13 in the UK Singles Charts, becoming the band's second UK top 20 hit. The song was also featured on the soundtrack for the hit movie Clueless. The album Jollification became a critical success and the singles taken from this album, \\"Lucky You\\", \\"Marvellous\\" and \\"Perfect\\" made noticeable impact. Mark Farrow's album cover featured the use of computer graphics to create an enormous strawberry and depicting seeds with superimposed human faces. During this period a number of songs were recorded at a private river barge studio located at Eel Pie Studios, then owned by Pete Townshend for the fourth studio album Dizzy Heights. The single \\"Ready or Not\\" was released ahead of the album and reached No. 20 in the UK Singles chart. In 1996 The Football Association commissioned Broudie to write an England song for the upcoming Euro '96 football tournament. Broudie agreed on the condition that comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, who had presented the late-night television show Fantasy Football League participated. The resulting song, \\"Three Lions\\", became a No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and was adopted as a football chant, not only in the UK but also in countries such as Germany, where the single and accompanying video reached No. 16 in their charts. In 1997 Lightning Seeds headlined the Hillsborough Justice Concert, which was held at the Liverpool Anfield stadium to raise fund for the families in their struggle for justice. During this period the band achieved three more UK Top 20 hits, including a cover version of The Turtles \\"You Showed Me\\", which became one of their biggest hits. 1997 gave the Lightning Seeds international exposure with the song \\"You Showed Me\\" included on the Austin Powers Soundtrack. The release of Like You Do... and a UK promotional tour followed. In 1998, Broudie reworked and recorded an updated version of their hit football anthem for the FIFA World Cup in France. \\"Three Lions '98\\", reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart and became the first song to top the charts on two separate occasions with different sets of lyrics. In 1998, The Lightning Seeds also performed on the Main Stage at both the Glastonbury Festival and the V Festival in the UK. =1999‚Äì2005: Tilt and hiatus= Their album Tilt (1999) was dance-oriented and featured collaborations with Stephen Jones. The single \\"Life's Too Short\\" was heralded by BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as \\"one of the band's strongest singles to date\\" and rose to No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart. =2006‚Äìpresent= The band's second greatest hits album The Very Best of the Lightning Seeds was released on 12 June 2006, followed by the re-release of \\"Three Lions\\", which rose to No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2009 Sony released a new collection of songs under the title Four Winds, but the album was never toured. In 2014, the songs and career of Ian Broudie were celebrated in a concert held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, featuring the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra and performances by Ian McCulloch (Echo And The Bunnymen), Miles Kane (The Last Shadow Puppets), Terry Hall (The Specials), James Skelly (The Coral) and Broudie himself with a band featuring musicians Sean Payne (The Zutons), Bill Ryder Jones and Nick Power (The Coral) and Broudie's son, Riley. The event was filmed but is yet to be released. On 22 August 2014, the Lightning Seeds were joined by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Liverpool's Sefton Park for a show in front of 30,000 people, reprising the Philharmonic show without the special guests. In December 2016, the Lightning Seeds supported Madness on their British pre-Christmas arena tour. On 13 July 2018, the single Three Lions re-entered the UK charts at No. 1.

Unfortunately, he also lost his singing voice during this period. After the War ended, following medical advice and performing vocal exercises, Paoli regained his voice and returned to the international stage, in all the glory of days past. He performed in Europe, North and South America, and finally settled with his sister Amalia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she had opened a singing school. Paoli spent the last 20 years of his life teaching voice and singing in San Juan, while also working for the establishment of a music conservatory in that city. He would not see this last dream come true, because he developed cancer and died at age 75. He was buried in San Juan, but his remains were later transferred to a mausoleum at Pante√≥n Nacional Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro in his birth city of Ponce. Early years Paoli (birth name: Antonio Emilio Paoli y Marcano ) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He was the son of Amalia Marcano Intriago, of Spanish ancestry, who was born on the island of Margarita, Venezuela, and of Domingo Paoli Marcatentti, a Corsican immigrant. Antonio Paoli's parents met in Caracas, and immediately fell in love. But Amalia's father, a rich landlord, opposed their relationship because of class differences. The young couple escaped to the Dominican Republic without getting married and later returned to Puerto Rico. They established themselves in the city of Yauco and lived there for several years. Later they moved to Ponce, into a house given to them by Amalia's aunt, Teresa Intriago. It was located on Calle Mayor (Mayor Street), House No. 14. Paoli had two notable sisters, Olivia Paoli (1855‚Äì1942), who was a suffragist and Amalia Paoli (1861‚Äì1941), a notable opera soprano who together with her sister joined the Suffragist Social League and fought for the rights of Puerto Rican women.Lilliam Torres-Braschi.

When Paoli was young, his parents would often take him to operas at Ponce's La Perla Theater located a block from their residence. They saw a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore, sung by Italian tenor, Pietro Baccei. At that moment, Paoli decided what he wanted to become. His parents were very supportive of his ambition and guided him on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of \\"voice\\" directed by Ramon Marin. His sister Amalia was a soprano who performed at La Perla in Emilio Arrieta's opera, Marina. In 1883, when Paoli was only 12 years old, both his parents died. He traveled to Spain to live with his sister Amalia and study music and opera.PRPOP Debut Amalia was taking singing classes under Napoleon Verger. She was under the patronage of Isabel de Borb√≥n, Princess of Asturias and sister of the King of Spain, Alfonso XII, In 1884, Amalia helped Paoli to obtain two scholarships from her Majesty Queen Mar√≠a Cristina, Queen Regent of Spain. Paoli started his studies at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial. He entered Toledo's Military Academy and in 1892 graduated with honors. He was assigned to the Queen's escort and named personal custodian and guard of the child King Alfonso XIII. Paoli wanted to continue singing and in 1897 went to study at the Academia de Canto La Scala in Milan, Italy. On 26 April 1899, he made his debut in Gioacchino Rossini's opera William Tell in Paris, France. Paris newspapers commented on Paoli's success and said, \\"We should declare Paoli the Tenor of France.\\"Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

World tours His sister Amalia Paoli, an opera soprano Between 1900 and 1914, Paoli performed in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia. He performed in Italy, Luxembourg and in the United Kingdom, with performances in London, Scotland, Edinburgh, and Brighton, closing the year with concerts in Corsica (his father's homeland) and Turkey. In 1900, he married Josephine Vetiska, an Austrian, in Vienna. From 1901 to 1902, Paoli performed in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the United States. Paoli purchased a villa in Porto Cereso, Lugano, Italy, where his son Antonio Arnaldo was born. After singing for King Alfonso XII and the Royal family in Spain, Paoli returned to the United States and sang in various cities, among them New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Albany, Providence, Grand Rapids, New London, Detroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Chicago. In 1905, Paoli performed at the Grand Theatre du Conservatoire in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Czar of Russia Nicholas II was present during one of the performances. After inviting Paoli to perform at the royal Winter Palace, he awarded Paoli The Cross of St. Mauricio medal and bestowed upon him the title Cammer Sanger (Chamber Singer). On 5 September 1907, Paoli held a private recital for Pope Pius X at the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. That same year he was named as a \\"Singer of the Royal Court\\" by William II of Germany. Paoli was the first operatic artist to record an entire opera when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy. He was selected in 1907 as the First Tenor in the main character, by a team of engineers and musicians which included Leoncavallo. The recording was arranged in the following manner; the musicians were placed at the end of the recording room and the back-up singers in a semi-arc in front of the gramophone, while Paoli stood alone away from the gramophone. Paoli continued to perform around the world: in Greece, Palestine, Poland, Egypt, Spain and Italy, where he established his permanent residence. In 1910, the singer was signed as the First Tenor by La Scala, Milan, the most prestigious opera company in the world at the time. Paoli received a contract to inaugurate Teatro Col√≥n, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he sang Otello and Di quella pira. He also performed in Russia, Poland, Egypt, Hungary, Belgium, Cuba, Chile, Haiti, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Canada, and the United States.Music of Puerto Rico Boxing career By 1914, just before the start of World War I, Paoli lost his voice and all of the major opera houses in Europe were shut down. Paoli moved to Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, leaving his Italian properties unattended. By 1915, Paoli was without economic means as a result of his bad investments.Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

After a period of training in Spain, he moved to England to start his new \\"career.\\" He was undefeated in his first five fights. He broke his right wrist on his sixth challenge, which ended his boxing career. Paoli sold his properties in Italy and acquired a small country house in Spain. He stayed for a few months with his brother Carlos in the Philippines. Paoli was medically treating his vocal cords, but observers believed that his opera career was over. He continued his singing exercises with his sister Amalia, who had moved into his house in Spain. Comeback In January 1917, Paoli returned to the stage and performed the opera Samson and Delilah at the Constanzi Theater in Rome. Elvira de Hidalgo, who later became the singing coach of Maria Callas, recalled: Paoli kept busy performing in Italy, South America, and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, his sister Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) where she was running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some note that Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Cura√ßao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador. Last years Caruso who was shareholder at the old New York City Metropolitan Opera House (\\"The Old Met\\") made sure Paoli was not allowed to sing at the Met. Even with this busy agenda, Paoli's financial situation remained strained. After living in New York City for almost the entire year of 1927, Paoli decided to return to Puerto Rico to live and work with his sister Amalia, and give voice lessons at the Academia Paoli. Paoli also helped produce Othello at the Municipal Theater in San Juan. For the next two decades Paoli's main concern was teaching at the Paoli Academy with Amalia. In 1928, the tenor performed Verdi's Otello in its entirety for the last time in San Juan. This was his last performance on stage. It took place at the San Juan Municipal Theater, known today as the Tapia Theater. In 1935, the government of Puerto Rico named the San Juan Municipal Theater in his honor, changing its name to Teatro Paoli. In 1929, his wife Josephine died and a year later he married Adelaida Bonini, from Rimini, Italy. He affectionately called her \\"Adina\\".Casa Paoli's Web Site. Retrieved 28 May 2010.

Honors, accolades, and legacy Antonio Paoli was the first Puerto Rican to gain international recognition in the performing arts. He gave 1,725 performances between 1888 and 1942, and interpreted Verdi's Otello 575 times. To his credit, Paoli was also the first opera singer in the world to record an entire opera; he was part of a recorded performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Italy in 1907. Centro de Bellas Artes in San Juan has a hall named in Paoli's memory. As early as 1904, Paoli was awarded The Cross of St. Mauricio medal by the Czar of Russia Nicholas II, and Mar√≠a Cristina de Habsburgo, Queen of Spain, declared Paoli Cantante de C√°mara de la Corte (Chamber Singer of the Court) and gave him La Gran Cruz de Isabel la Cat√≥lica (The Cross of Isabella the Catholic), while Carlos de Braganza, Prince of Portugal, named him Caballero Comendador del Cristo de Portugal y Cantante de C√°mara. Just two years later, in 1906, the same title of Cammer Sanger (Chamber Singer of the Court) was given to Paoli by Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria, and in 1907 he was decorated by Carlos I of Braganza. In 1909, Paoli received La Cruz de Alfonso II from Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, and was declared ‚Äô'Honor Singer of the Vatican'‚Äô by Pope Pius X. In 1910, he was honored with the title of Hijo Predilecto de Espa√±a (Favorite Son of Spain), while in 1911, Wilhelm II, Kaiser of Germany, declared Paoli ‚Äô'Kammer Sanger of the Empire'‚Äô, and in 1912, Paoli received a protocol-breakingAntonio Paoli.

In 1920, the tenor was knighted by Vittorio Emmanuelle III, King of Italy, making him Cavaliere De La Corona Italiana and Commendatore Dell Popolo Romano (Knight of the Italian Crown and Commandant of the Roman People). Though he did not see it happen during his lifetime, Puerto Rico also built the Music Conservatory, something for which Paoli had worked so hard to establish. This dream was finally realized shortly after his death. At the \\"Centro de Bellas Artes\\" in San Juan there is also a 1,883-seat \\"Antonio Paoli Festival Hall.\\" San Juan's Municipal Theater was also renamed Teatro Paoli in his honor in 1935. In recognition of his fame and talent, the government of Puerto Rico also awarded Paoli a pension in 1934. Casa Paoli, the childhood home of Antonio Paoli in Ponce In 1983, the non-profit \\"Paoli Award\\" was created. This award honors the effort, work, and success of outstanding professionals in the various arts and media, including music and recording, television, radio, written communication, fashion, and beauty. Originally designated to recognize the outstanding achievements of Puerto Ricans, the Paoli Award has branched out internationally, and since 1992 it also includes Hispanics and Latin Americans from around the world. On 9 October 2009, the Government of the United States listed Casa Paoli in Antonio Paoli's hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

It was originally a private Palladian mansion owned by the Earls of Burlington and was expanded in the mid-19th century after being purchased by the British government. Burlington House is most familiar to the general public as the venue for art exhibitions from the Royal Academy. The academy is housed in the main building at the northern end of the courtyard. Five learned societies occupy the two wings on the east and west sides of the courtyard and the Piccadilly wing at the southern end. Collectively known as the Courtyard Societies, these societies are as listed below: *Geological Society of London (Piccadilly/east wing) *Linnean Society of London (Piccadilly/west wing) *Royal Astronomical Society (west wing) *Society of Antiquaries of London (west wing) *Royal Society of Chemistry (east wing) Burlington House has been listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England since February 1970. History Burlington House from Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff's Britannia Illustrata, 1707 The house was one of the earliest of a number of very large private residences built on the north side of Piccadilly, previously a country lane, from the 1660s onwards. The first version was begun by Sir John Denham in about 1664.Date in The John Madeski Fine Rooms: An Architectural Guide (Royal Academy of Arts). It was a red-brick double-pile hip-roofed mansion with a recessed centre, typical of the style of the time, or perhaps even a little old fashioned. Denham may have acted as his own architect, or he may have employed Hugh May, who certainly became involved in the construction after the house was sold in an incomplete state in 1667 to Richard Boyle, the first Earl of Burlington, from whom it derives its name. Burlington had the house completed, which was the largest structure on his land, the Burlington Estate. In 1704, the house was passed on to ten-year-old Richard Boyle, third Earl of Burlington, who was to become the principal patron of the Palladian movement in England, and an architect in his own right. Around 1709, during Burlington's minority, Lady Juliana Boyle, the second Countess, commissioned James Gibbs to reconfigure the staircase and make exterior alterations to the house, including a quadrant Doric colonnade which was later praised by Sir William Chambers as \\"one of the finest pieces of architecture\\". The colonnade separated the house from increasingly urbanized Piccadilly with a cour d'honneur. Inside, Baroque decorative paintings in the entrance hall and a staircase by Sebastiano Ricci and Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini makes it one of the richest interiors in London.Pellegrini's decorations were removed by 1727 and survive at Narford Hall, Norfolk; canvases from Ricci's screen are no longer in situ but remain at Burlington House (The John Madeski Fine Rooms). One of James Gibbs's colonnades at Burlington House, in a watercolour of c.1806‚Äì08 In between his two Grand Tours of Italy (1714 and 1719), young Lord Burlington's taste (the third Earl) was transformed by the publication of Giacomo Leoni's Palladio which made him develop a passion for Palladian architecture. In 1717 or 1718, the third Earl began making major modifications to Burlington House and the supervision of the work was undertaken by Gibbs. Later, Colen Campbell was appointed to replace Gibbs, who was working in the Baroque style of Sir Christopher Wren, to recast the work in a new manner on the old foundation. This was a key moment in the history of English architecture, as Campbell's work was in a strict Palladian style, and the aesthetic preferences of Campbell and Burlington, soon joined by the aesthetic style of their close associate William Kent, who worked on interiors at Burlington House, were to provide the leading strain in English architecture and interior decoration for two generations. Campbell's work closely followed the form of the previous building and reused much of the structure, but the conventional front (south) fa√ßade was replaced with an austere two-storey composition, taking Palladio's Palazzo Iseppo di Porti, Vicenza, for a model\\"A fairly faithful transcript\\", according to James Lees-Milne, The Earls of Creation, 1962:99; Leoni had provided an engraving; Campbell had already used the scheme in a design dedicated to Lord Islay in his Vitruvius Britannicus. but omitting sculpture and substituting a balustrade for the attic storey. The ground floor became a rusticated basement, which supported a monumental piano nobile of nine bays. This had no centrepiece but was highlighted by venetian windows in the projecting end bays, the first to be seen in England. Other alterations included a monumental screening gateway to Piccadilly and the reconstruction of most of the principal interiors, with typical Palladian features such as rich coved ceilings. The Saloon, constructed immediately after William Kent's return from Rome in December 1719, has survived in the most intact condition; it was the first Kentian interior designed in England. Its plaster putti above the pedimented doorcases were probably by Giovanni Battista Guelfi.The John Madeski Fine Rooms. Photograph of the original main block of Burlington House, before the addition of the top storey Lord Burlington transferred his architectural energies to Chiswick House after 1722. After Burlington's death in 1753, Burlington House was passed on to the Dukes of Devonshire, but they had no need of it as they already owned Devonshire House just along Piccadilly. The fourth Duke's younger son Lord George Cavendish and a Devonshire in-law, the third Duke of Portland, each used the house for at least two separate spells. Portland had some of the interiors altered by John Carr in the 1770s. Eventually Lord George, who was a rich man in his own right due to his having married an heiress, purchased the house from his nephew, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, for ¬£70,000 in 1815. Lord George employed Samuel Ware to shift the staircase to the centre and reshape the interiors to provide a suite of \\"Fine Rooms\\" en filade linking the new state dining room at the west endNow the General Assembly Room, it was originally a bedroom; its opening into the enfilade was blocked in 1885 by Richard Norman Shaw, who centred the room on his new staircase; the enfilade has been reopened with the restoration of the \\"Fine Rooms\\". to the new ballroom at the east end. Like Carr's work, Ware's was sympathetic with the Palladian style of the house, providing an early example of the \\"Kent Revival\\", a particularly English prefiguration of Baroque Revival architecture. In 1819 the Burlington Arcade was built along the western part of the grounds. In 1854, Burlington House was sold to the British government for ¬£140,000, originally with the plan of demolishing the building and using the site to build the University of London. This plan, however, was abandoned in the face of strong opposition, and in 1857 Burlington House was occupied by the Royal Society, the Linnean Society and the Chemical Society (later the Royal Society of Chemistry).

These were completed in 1873, and the three societies moved into these. In 1874 they were joined by the Geological Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society and the Society of Antiquaries. The street fa√ßade of the Piccadilly wing This arrangement lasted until 1968, when the Royal Society moved to new premises in Carlton House Terrace and its apartments were split between the Royal Society of Chemistry and the British Academy. The British Academy also moved to Carlton House Terrace in 1998 and the Royal Society of Chemistry took over the rest of the east wing. In 2004 the Courtyard Societies went to court against the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister over the terms of their tenure of the apartments in Burlington House, which they have enjoyed rent-free. The dispute was sent to mediation, after which the following statement was released: \\"The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Learned Societies had a very constructive meeting on 16 March which envisages the continued presence of the Learned Societies at Burlington House. Discussions are continuing with a view to formalising the arrangement on a basis which is acceptable to all parties.\\" Public access The courtyard of Burlington House Sometimes the courtyard hosts temporary sculptures or exhibitions, such as this one in 2009 The courtyard of Burlington House, known as the \\"Annenberg Courtyard\\", is open to the public during the day. It features a statue of Joshua Reynolds and fountains arranged in the pattern of the planets at the time of his birth. The Royal Academy's public art exhibitions are staged in nineteenth-century additions to the main block which are of little architectural interest. However, in 2004 the principal reception rooms on the piano nobile were opened to the public after restoration as the \\"John Madejski Fine Rooms\\". They contain many of the principal works in the academy's permanent collection, which predominantly features works by Royal Academicians and small temporary exhibitions drawn from the collection. The east, west and Piccadilly wings are occupied by the learned societies and are generally not open to the public.

Book music is a medium for storing the music played on mechanical organs, mainly of European manufacture. Book music is made from thick cardboard, containing perforated holes specifying the musical notes to be played, with the book folded zig-zag style. Unlike the heavy pinned barrels, which could only contain a few tunes of fixed length, that had been used on earlier instruments, book music enabled large repertoires to be built up. The length of each tune was no longer determined by the physical dimensions of the instrument. In 1892, organ maker Anselmo Gavioli patented the \\"book organ,\\" with a series of folded sheets of cardboard. Holes punched on the pages of the folded book allowed keys to rise in the key frame playing the required note. The keys would cause considerable wear to the music books over time. A solution to this was the keyless frame where the holes allowed air to pass through.Life of Guangzhou - Brief Introduction of Automatic Musical Instruments The development marked a turning point in the history of the mechanical organ, and made Gavioli, until their demise in 1910, the most famous and prolific fair-organ builders.Gavioli 89 Key No 2 Book Music was the most commonly used medium for large instruments. Used extensively by fairground and street organ makers, book music was also used by Henri Fourneaux in 1863 in his Pianista. Music mechanism of \\"Australia Fair\\" street organ. One of the advantages of book music is that it can be mechanically interpreted. Keys, small levers which rock upwards when a hole passes by, run underneath the book. This motion then mechanically opens the valves of the organ. Paper rolls on the other hand are \\"key-less\\" and are generally only read by pneumatic pressure or suction. Some mechanical organs, particularly those of German manufacture by firms such as Gbr Bruder and Ruth, play keyless cardboard book music, operating pneumatically. The disadvantage of book music, compared to paper rolls, is the increased size and weight to store an equivalent amount of music. The major advantage of book music, however, is that it is sturdy and not subject to expansion and contraction with humidity. In addition, it is not necessary to rewind a book after playing; therefore, a musical performance may continue almost immediately without a prolonged break (while the instrument is occupied with rewinding the roll). This allows for large books and sets of books to be manufactured, allowing musically versatile capabilities. In Europe the book format, rather than the roll, is the preferred method of operating all but the smallest instruments designed for outdoor use.

References Xenosauridae Reptiles of Mexico Endemic fauna of Mexico Reptiles described in 1993 Taxa named by Hobart Muir Smith ","title":"Xenosaurus rectocollaris"},{"id":"984139","text":"Xenosaurus grandis, commonly known as the knob-scaled lizard, is a species of diurnal, terrestrial lizard endemic to Mexico and Guatemala. It primarily inhabits tropical rainforests. It dwells in rock crevices and eats insects. Etymology The scientific name, Xenosaurus grandis, comes from the Greek words xenos, meaning ‚Äúalien‚Äù, ‚Äústranger‚Äù, or ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù, saurus, meaning ‚Äúlizard‚Äù, and grandis, meaning ‚Äúgrand‚Äù or ‚Äúgreat‚Äù. Its common name, ‚Äúknob- scaled lizard‚Äù, refers to the bumpy, ‚Äúknob-like‚Äù scales found on the upper portion of its body.Gadow H (1901). Amphibia and Reptiles. London: Macmillan & Co. Taxonomy There are five recognized subspecies, which are spread throughout the species‚Äô range, and the species complex is being reevaluated. Some of the subspecies are currently in the process of being elevated to species status. The species as a whole is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List and its population is currently decreasing. Physiology =Appearance= Xenosaurus grandis has a flattened head and body and is nearly always found in rock crevices, or at least with a portion of the body in a crevice.Zuniga-Vega JJ, Valverde T, Rojas-Gonzalez RI, Lemos-Espinal JA (2007). \\"Analysis of the population dynamics of an endangered lizard (Xenosaurus grandis) through the use of projection matrices\\". Copeia 2007 (2): 324-335. Its flattened physiology is most likely an adaptation to allow it to squeeze into narrow crevices. Its color ranges from dark grey to dark brown, with lighter bands or blotches. It has a forked tongue, and small, sharp, fang-like teeth.Hall D (2007). The Ultimate Guide to Snakes and Reptiles. Kent: Regency House Publishing. =Body size= On average, the snout-vent length (SVL) of Xenosaurus grandis is 6.8 - 12.9 cm.Smith GR, Lemos-Espinal JA, Ballinger RE (1997). \\"Sexual dimorphism in two species of knob-scaled lizards (Genus Xenosaurus) from Mexico\\". Herpetologica 53: 200-205. While some species of Xenosaurus do not exhibit sexual dimorphism, Xenosaurus grandis, among other species, is one that does. In Xenosaurus grandis, males and females do not differ significantly in body size, but males have proportionately larger heads (in length and width) than females. Males and females of X. grandis do not exhibit a significant difference in femur length or head shape. =Body temperature= Xenosaurus grandis is a diurnally active thermal conformer, meaning that its body temperature correlates with substrate and air temperatures. Its average body temperature is 22.7 C.Ballinger RE, Lemos-Espinal J, Sanoja-Sarabia S, Coady NR (1995). \\"Ecological observations of the lizard, Xenosaurus grandis in Cuautlapan, Veracruz, Mexico\\". Biotropica 27: 128-132. Air and substrate temperatures may be particularly relevant in Xenosaurus grandis since they are almost exclusively ground and crevice dwellers. Temperatures seem to differ across Xenosaurus species, possibly because of environment and habitat. Xenosaurus grandis appears to inhabit more dense tropical forests, where sunlight may not reach the ground as much.Lemos- Espinal JA, Smith GR, Ballinger RE (2003). \\"Ecology of Xenosaurus grandis agrenon, a knob-scaled lizard from Oaxaca, M√©xico\\". Journal of Herpetology 37: 192-196. While body temperature is influenced by the lizard's amount of cover and its body position in its crevice, it does not seem to be influenced by sex, month, vegetation type, or any crevice characteristics. =Diet= Lizards in the genus Xenosaurus are exclusively found in crevices. Such a lifestyle suggests that the diets of these lizards might be opportunistic, and they eat whatever crawls or flies past or into their crevice.Lemos-Espinal JA, Smith GR, Ballinger RE (2003). \\"Diets of three species of knob-scaled lizards (genus Xenosaurus) from Mexico\\". Southwestern Naturalist 48: 119-122. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but occasional lizard prey are taken. Their most frequent prey includes coleopterans (beetles), dipterans (flies), orthopterans (insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, weta, and locusts), and myriapods (terrestrial arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes). On the basis of number, they consume the most dipterans, but on the basis of volume, they consume the most orthopterans. Behavior The Knob-scaled lizard is diurnal, meaning it is active during the day. Due to its diet of Orthoptera and Lepitdoptera larvae, Xenosaurus grandis is an ambush predator. It waits in its rocky crevice home and strikes with the element of surprise. It is a very solitary and aggressive species and will often fight with members of its own species over territory. Reproduction Xenosaurus grandis and the rest of the xenosaurids are viviparous, which means offspring are birthed live rather than in eggs. Young are birthed after a 9-month gestation period. The majority of litters contain only three offspring, but litters ranging from two to seven offspring have also been observed. Male knob-scaled lizards reach maturity at 28 months, while females reach maturity a little later, at 32 months.Z√∫√±iga- Vega JJ, Rojas-Gonz√°lez RI, Lemos-Espinal JA, P√©rez-Trejo ME (2005). \\"Growth ecology of the lizard Xenosaurus grandis in Veracruz, M√©xico\\". Journal of Herpetology 39: 433-443. It is also plausible to say that X. grandis do not produce young every year.Goldberg, Stephen R. (2009). \\"Notes on the reproduction of the knob-scaled lizard, Xenosaurus grandis (Squamata: Xenosauridae), from Veracruz, Mexico\\". The Texas Journal of Science 61 (4). Geographic range There are five major population areas for the Xenosaurus grandis in Southern Mexico and Guatemala: central Veracruz, southern Oaxaca, north-central Oaxaca, the highlands of central Chiapas, and central Guatemala. The separate population areas have given rise to five subspecies of X. grandis. The five subspecies are X. g. grandis, X. g. agrenon, X. g. arboreus, X. g. rackhami, and X. g. sanmartinesis.\\"Xenosaurus grandis (GRAY, 1856)\\". (2012). Retrieved 10/21/2012, 2012, from http://reptile- database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Xenosaurus&species;=grandis&search;_param=%28%28search%3D%27xenosaurus+grandis%27%29%29 Habitat All the subspecies of Xenosaurus grandis live exclusively in rock crevices, which allows them to live in many habitats, including: xerophytic vegetation, tropical rainforests, cloud forests, oak forests, and tropical deciduous rainforests. The lizards have strong attachments to where they live, only living in 1-2 rock crevices for 95% of their entire lives. Conservation status Currently Xenosaurus grandis is categorized as a vulnerable species according to the IUCN. The species was given this status because of fragmented populations, decreasing population size, and decreasing habitat quality and area, covering only 20,000 square km. The greatest threats to the survival of the species in the wild are habitat destruction and trapping for international pet trade. Eagles are the greatest natural predator of X. grandis, but they are not considered a threat to the survival of the species as a whole. Also, warmer temperatures in their habitat have been shown to cause greater mortality rates among the lizards, posing another potential threat to the species. =Temperature= Higher temperatures have been associated with higher mortality rates for X. grandis. In the 2003-2004 wet season of Southern Mexico and Guatemala (the habitat regions of the species), the average temperature was 24.3 C. That temperature was in the top 12% of highest recorded temperatures in the past 34 years of record keeping. The mortality rate for yearlings (the youngest age group) increased from 0.1923 to 0.6551 and for adult II (the oldest age group) increased from 0.3956 to 0.5676 for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 wet seasons respectively. If temperatures continue to increase, the survival of the species will be further threatened and currently 50% of wet seasons are warm enough to be considered to be unfavorable for the species. =Population and growth rates= As of 2004, X. grandis had a survival rate of 70.5% and a growth rate of 0.851. Even though the rates may appear to be low, in comparison to other lizard genera and families X. grandis is doing well. Currently the species is decreasing in population, which is thought to be primarily caused by human development destroying their habitat. If habitat destruction stops, the population should at least be stable, if not prosperous. References Further reading *Boulenger GA (1885).

Wells (March 4, 1932 ‚Äì April 3, 1994) was an American businessman who served as president of The Walt Disney Company from 1984 until his death in 1994. Life and career Wells was born in Coronado, California and traced his ancestry back to the Mayflower. He attended Pomona College, which he left as Phi Beta Kappa in 1953. Wells was a recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship, through which he obtained a BA at Oxford University. He went into the army for two years as an infantry first lieutenant and then graduated from Stanford Law School and became a lawyer. Before his tenure with Disney, Wells had worked for Warner Bros. as its West Coast vice president in 1969, then in 1973 as president, and in 1977 as vice chairman until he left the company in 1982. Disney directors Roy E. Disney, Stanley Gold and Sid Bass had ousted President and CEO Ron W. Miller in 1984. The Disney board then recruited Wells to become Disney's president and chief operating officer (1984‚Äì1994), along with Michael Eisner as chairman and CEO, and Jeffrey Katzenberg as head of Walt Disney Studios. Wells was unique among the management troika in that he had the highest academic achievement. Although the number-two executive at Disney, Wells reported to the board of directors and not to Eisner. Seven Summits Wells was an avid alpinist and came close to achieving his goal of climbing the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each of the seven continents: * Kilimanjaro in Africa * Denali (Mount McKinley) in North America * Aconcagua in South America * Elbrus in Europe * Mount Everest in Asia * Mount Kosciuszko in Australia * Vinson in Antarctica Only Everest eluded him, as bad weather had forced his party to descend when just 3,000 feet from the summit. His partner in the Seven Summits attempt, Dick Bass, an entrepreneur who developed the Snowbird ski resort in Utah, later made it up all seven peaks, the first man to do so.

Wells died in a helicopter crash on Easter 1994 while returning from a ski trip in Nevada's Ruby Mountains. He was a good friend of Clint Eastwood, who had been skiing with Wells that weekend. Eastwood left in his own helicopter just an hour before Wells' departure. Because of poor weather in the area, the chartered Bell 206 helicopter carrying Wells had landed at a remote location about two and a half hours prior to the crash. While waiting for improved weather conditions, snow fell on the helicopter. During the subsequent takeoff and ascent, the engine lost power and the aircraft crashed on a 30-degree slope, followed by a rollover, during an attempted emergency landing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was \\"the ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power).\\" Of the five persons on board, four were killed. The sole survivor was Mike Hoover.NTSB Aviation Accident Final Report SEA94FA096; June 5, 1995 Wells was buried at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

It is the only member of the genus Hymenolaimus. Its exact taxonomic status is still unresolved, but it appears to be most closely related to the tribe Anatini, the dabbling ducks. The whio is depicted on the reverse side of the New Zealand $10 banknote.  Name  It is commonly known in New Zealand English by its MƒÅori name Whio, pronounced \\"fee-o\\" (o as in sock) which is an onomatopoeic rendition of the males' call. Other names may be known by are Mountain Duck or Blue Mountain Duck. Description Blue duck, Mikonui River The blue duck is long and varies in weight by sex. Females are smaller than males, weighing , whereas the males weigh . The plumage is a dark slate-grey with a greenish sheen on the head, a chestnut-flecked breast. The outer are tipped with white and the inner ones have black margins. The plumage of the two sexes are mostly the same, although the female has slightly less chestnut in the chest. The pinkish-white bill has fleshy flaps of skin hanging from the sides of its tip. The blue duck hatches with a green beak for just 8 hours after hatching; after which it then develops its final colour. = Song = The male's call is a high-pitched whistle. The female's call is a rattling growl or low-pitched grating notes. Taxonomy The blue duck was first described in the 13th edition of the Systema Naturae published by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. The species is the only member of its genus and has no close relatives. Its taxonomic relationships with other waterfowl species remains uncertain; DNA analysis has placed it as a sister to the South American dabbling ducks (Anatini), but with no close relative. As of 2013, it was commonly listed as incertae sedis but likely within the Anatinae and allied to the Anatini. It was formerly thought to be related to the shelduck tribe. Although the North Island and South Island whio are genetically distinct, they are not described as subspecies; they are, however, treated as separate management units. Behaviour This species is an endemic resident breeder in New Zealand, nesting in hollow logs, small caves and other sheltered spots. It is a rare duck, holding territories on fast flowing mountain rivers. It is a powerful swimmer even in strong currents, but is reluctant to fly. It is difficult to find, but not particularly wary when located. =Diet= The blue duck feeds almost entirely on aquatic invertebrates, with the majority of food items being made up of caddisfly larvae. It may on occasion take berries and the fruits of shrubs. =Breeding= Blue duck family in Hawke's Bay Blue ducks nest between August and October, laying 4‚Äì9 creamy white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 35 days and chicks can fly when about 70 days old. Nesting and egg incubation of four to seven eggs is undertaken by the female while the male stands guard. Nests are shallow, twig, grass and down-lined scrapes in caves, under river-side vegetation or in log-jams, and are therefore very prone to spring floods. For this, and other reasons, their breeding success is extremely variable from one year to the next. Captivity A breeding pair in the wild, in Fiordland National Park (2017). Captive North Island whio are held and bred on both main islands of New Zealand, but the progeny are returned to their respective island. South Island whio are held and bred in captivity in the South Island only. All captives are kept by approved and permitted zoological and wildlife facilities as part of the national recovery plan. As part of this current ten-year plan (2009‚Äì2019) is the WHIONE program which works with specially trained nose dogs to locate nests. The eggs are removed, and the ducklings hatched and raised in captivity. Later they are conditioned for coordinated release. Blue ducks were presented to the International Waterfowl Association in the UK in the 1970s along with New Zealand shovelers, New Zealand scaup, and brown teal by The Wildlife Service of New Zealand. The species were maintained in the UK until at least 2012 before dying out. They have not been known to be exported and maintained anywhere else internationally. Status The blue duck is classified as Endangered by the IUCN due to its highly fragmented and shrinking population, and it is listed as Nationally Endangered in the New Zealand Threat Classification System. A 2010 census estimated a total population size of 2,500‚Äì3,000 individuals, with a maximum of 1,200 pairs. The blue duck is a very localised species now threatened by predation from introduced mammals such as stoats, competition for its invertebrate food with introduced trout, and damming of mountain rivers for hydroelectric schemes. Early recovery efforts by scientists, field workers and volunteers have been summarised in a project sponsored by Genesis Energy, the Central North Island Blue Duck Charitable Conservation Trust and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society in 2006. In 2009 the New Zealand Department of Conservation started a ten-year recovery programme to protect the species at eight sites using predator control and then re-establish populations throughout their entire former range. Female whio are especially vulnerable to stoats while nesting, and some populations are now 70 percent male. In one study area, clutches of eggs lasted an average of nine days before being destroyed by stoats, and the one brood that hatched was killed the next day. In 2011 the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Genesis Energy started the Whio Forever Project, a five-year management programme for whio. It will enable the implementation of a national recovery plan that will double the number of fully operational secure blue duck breeding sites throughout New Zealand, and boost pest control efforts.

Read has been a broadcaster since 1976, best known for being a DJ with BBC Radio 1, and television host for music chart series Top of the Pops, children's show Saturday Superstore, and music panel game Pop Quiz. Early life Michael David Kenneth Read was born 1 March 1947 in Manchester, the only child of a publican. The family moved from Manchester to Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, when he was an infant. He attended Woking Grammar School followed by a sixth-form college. He was an estate agent for a while, and recorded under various names including Mickey Manchester. Broadcasting career Read's professional broadcasting career began in March 1976 at Reading's Radio 210, where he co-hosted a show with Steve Wright - entitled Read and Wright ‚Äì before joining Radio Luxembourg late in 1977. He joined Radio 1 in November 1978 and was soon presenting the nighttime programme before John Peel's show, where he championed new groups and featured live sessions. He took over The Radio 1 Breakfast Show on Monday 5 January 1981. On 11 January 1984, he suddenly interrupted broadcasting the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \\"Relax\\" halfway through playing the single, denounced the lyrics as \\"obscene\\". Read has said this account of his intervention is a myth. The interruption of the record was solely for timing reasons; he only had access in the studio to the longer 12\\" version. The BBC had already decided to ban the record. Following on from his five-year stint on Radio 1's breakfast show, Read took over a Sunday morning show in 1986. In 1987, he moved to Saturday mornings, and also to a Sunday afternoon show, where he played classic tracks. In addition he hosted Round Table and later went back to it as the renamed Singled Out on Friday evenings, where musicians and disc jockeys would review new single releases. Read's Saturday morning show ended in September 1988 and his Sunday afternoon oldies shows finished in January 1989, when Alan Freeman rejoined the station to host an oldies version of Pick of the Pops, which Mike covered in November that year when Freeman was ill. From January 1989 to September 1990, Read presented a weekly show called The Mike Read Collection, which was broadcast on Monday evenings, and still remained on the Friday panel show Singled Out (which had by then gone back to its original name of Round Table). He remained in this slot until 1991. =After Radio 1= Read left Radio 1 in 1991 and moved to Capital London Gold, presenting his Mike Read Collection, which went out on a Sunday night, before taking on the weekday Drivetime show in mid-1992, where he remained until he left the station in late 1995. Also in 1992, he was heard on BBC Radio 2 presenting special shows looking back at Cliff Richard's career and playing his music. Read then joined Classic FM, where he presented a weekend show and had a stint as weekday breakfast presenter starting in March 1996. Subsequently,in 1997, he presented the networked Breakfast Show on Classic Gold stations around the UK. From September 1999, he presented the Breakfast Show on Jazz FM in the north of England, then in 2001 joined Spirit FM in Chichester, initially presenting a Sunday show from 10a.m. to 1p.m. before moving to a weekday afternoon show from 2p.m. to 3p.m., playing music from various featured years. Between 2003 and 2004, Read presented a Saturday morning show on the Magic network around the UK. In May 2005, he became the weekday morning presenter on Big L 1395, a station modelled on the 1960s pirate radio station. He has also done occasional stints on Talksport. In November 2008, he took time out from Big L to present the 3p.m.7p.m. Drivetime show on Hull-based station KCFM for a week (10‚Äì14 November) as cover for Shaun Tilley. Read became the third ex-Radio 1 DJ to broadcast on the station, along with Tony Blackburn and Paul Burnett. In November 2009, Read began hosting a mid-morning show on the TotalStar network in the West of England. From 1 November 2010, Read returned to Big L with a daily show from 8a.m. to 12p.m. Monday-Friday. From July 2011, he hosted the Golden Hour on More Radio (Swindon & Wiltshire), formerly Total Star Wiltshire. Read was heard on Magic 1548 in the north of England, where he presented their Weekend Breakfast show, on Saturdays & Sundays 7a.m.10a.m. starting April 2012. He also presented the afternoon show Monday to Friday on BBC Radio Berkshire between 1:00/30p.m. and 4p.m. until March 2015 and continued to do certain programmes for the station including a Saturday afternoon show during the summer of 2015. In April 2018, Read was the first voice heard on the new internet radio station United DJs. He continues to host the station's Breakfast show weekdays from 7-9am. He also hosts an additional weekly show for the station entitled 'I Write the Songs'. =Television= Read combined his radio work with a second career as a TV presenter. From 1977 to 1979, Read hosted Yorkshire Television's children's series Pop Quest from 1977 to 1979. On BBC1, Read presented or co-presented 65 episodes of the music chart show Top of the Pops from 9 November 1978 to 28 December 1989.https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv- people/4ce2ba28d9f4fhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/trivia/presenters/list8.shtml From 1982 to 1987, Read presented the BBC's Saturday morning children's programme Saturday Superstore, as well as the Saturday Night music game show Pop Quiz, which regularly got audiences of 10 million and featured rock and pop stars answering music trivia questions. The show spawned board game and computer game spin-offs. The penultimate episode of Pop Quiz in 1984 featured a face-off between pop bands Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran, and in 1994 he returned to host a one-off special of the show for the anniversary of Top of the Pops. The format was revived twice, firstly in 1994 by the BBC with Chris Tarrant as the host, and then in June 2008 a revamped Pop Quiz, recorded without a studio audience and in a pub (rather than a television studio) in which the participants were members of the public, aired on Red TV. This was again hosted by Read. Additionally, he presented UK Gold's TV genre quiz Goldmaster in 1997. In 2004, Read was one of the contestants recruited for the jungle-based ITV reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! though his stay in the Australian outback was short-lived ‚Äì he was the first celebrity to be evicted by the viewing public. Read was among 10 former presenters who returned as guest co-presenters for the final episode of Top of the Pops broadcast 30 July 2006 on BBC Two. He is a regular newspaper reviewer for Sky News. In 2014, he appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as himself. =Songwriting= In 1979, Read wrote and performed the pop-punk song \\"High Rise\\" (upon which his Radio One intro jingle was subsequently based) under the guise of The Trainspotters, following this in 1980 with \\"My Town\\" by next studio group, The Ghosts. He then wrote lyrics to Simon May's TRIC Award- winning Trainer television theme. The resulting UK Top 30 single, \\"More to Life\\", was performed by Cliff Richard. Read also provided a guest rap on Slade's 1991 UK Top 30 hit, Radio Wall of Sound. After I'm a Celebrity..., Read recorded a charity single when he lyrically re-worked Hank Mizell's \\"Jungle Rock\\" and as the Jungle Boys (with Neil 'Razor' Ruddock and Lord Brocket) had a UK Top 30 hit single. The follow-up, which made the Top 75, was a new version of Mungo Jerry's \\"In the Summertime\\". In 2005, Read's song \\"Grief Never Grows Old\\" featured on a charity recording in aid of victims of the 2004 tsunami. Performed by an ensemble of artists named One World Project, the single reached Number 4 in the UK singles chart. Read has written music to accompany many poems written by John Betjeman. Thirty of these songs were recorded by artists including Cliff Richard, David Essex, Gene Pitney and Marc Almond for the 2006 various artists' album Words/Music, and subsequently re- released in 2008 as a double CD titled Sound of Poetry. On 19 October 2011, Read was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his contribution to music. In 2014, Read wrote and recorded \\"UKIP Calypso\\" in support of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). It was criticized for being racist and Read subsequently apologised and withdrew it from sale.M. Cole, Racism (London: Pluto Press, 2016), p. 72 =Musicals= Read has staged a number of musicals, including: Young Apollo (a musical about the life of Rupert Brooke); Oscar (a 2004 show about Oscar Wilde which was derided by critics and closed after one performance); Great Expectations; A Christmas Carol; Cliff - The Musical (which closed after three months) and Ricky Nelson...Teenage Idol. He took one of the lead roles in the Cliff musical, touring with it and appearing for the three-month run in the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre. His Betjeman show (based on his musical settings of Sir John Betjeman poems) has occasionally been staged for charities, including the Royal Marsden Hospital and Children With Leukaemia. Actors appearing in his musicals and shows have included Nyree Dawn Porter, Brian Glover, Colin Baker, Anton Rogers, Jeremy Irons, Alvin Stardust and Bernard Cribbins. =Books and poetry= He was one of the founder editors of the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles, the UK chart reference book, and also co-wrote many of the other Guinness music books. His poetry books include The Aldermoor Poems, Elizabethan Dragonflies, A Room With Books and the latest, New Poems for Old Paintings. He has edited and supplied biographies for the two best-selling poetry books 100 Favourite Poems and 100 Favourite Humorous Poems and contributed to many of the Poets' England series. He has also written two crime novels. =Contemporary art= In October 2007, Read started to produce contemporary art, with a gallery of works in the medium of confectionery entitled Choc Art. The work includes recreations of album sleeves by the Beatles, his own take on the famous map of the London Underground, and works based on the paintings of L.S. Lowry. Personal life and ventures =Stalker= Read had a stalker who had changed her name to Blue Tulip Rose Read and believed that she was married to him. Rose was from Welwyn Garden City and her original name was Carol Ballard. Rose was featured in a film made by Jaine Green for Channel Four in 1996 entitled I'm Your Number One Fan. The film formed part of Channel Four's \\"Fame Factor\\" season, which examined the dark side of fame. Rose was one of the most candid interviewees in the film. She was filmed as she travelled to the offices of Classic FM, and as she wrote \\"love letters\\" to Read. The film stated that Rose had been writing obscene and threatening letters to Read for many years. =Politics= Having spoken three times at Conservative Party conferences, including in 2006 entertaining guests at a Tory conference dinner with a ten-minute political rap,\\"Mike Reads 10-minute rap\\", The Independent (London), 5 October 2006 Read said that he was asked to run for the Conservative Party nomination for the London Mayoral elections in 2008.\\"I'm Backing Boris\\", The Guardian, 17 July 2007 He subsequently announced that he was instead putting his energies behind Boris Johnson's ultimately successful candidacy. On 21 July 2012, Read spoke at the UK Independence Party's South East regional Conference in Frimley, where he was also announced as a member of the party. Read has since spoken at the UKIP 2012 Annual Conference at Birmingham Town Hall on 21 September. Read wrote and recorded a song in support of the party, \\"UKIP Calypso\\", which was released in October 2014 as a single credited to The Independents. An online petition was filed by former Labour borough councillor Richard McKenzie in which he called Read's song \\"racist and offensive\\". Party leader Nigel Farage endorsed it and called for the party's supporters to download the song. Read adopted a faux- Jamaican accent, but said that it was \\"not remotely racist\\" to do so, saying, \\"It's a satire and a bit of fun. It's not terribly serious. It wouldn't have sounded very good sung in a Surrey accent.\\" Debate over the song featured on Newsnight, with UKIP spokesman Winston McKenzie, himself of Caribbean origin, praised the song and likening it to Elvis Presley and The Beatles' adaptation of predominantly black musical styles, although the BBC Asian Network's Nihal was critical of it. Read withdrew the song from sale on 22 October 2014 and apologised \\"unreservedly\\" that it had \\"unintentionally caused offence\\". On 26 October 2014, the song reached number 44 on the UK Singles Chart. =The Rupert Brooke Society= In 1999, Read founded the Rupert Brooke Society of which he was chairman for a few years as well as editing the society's twice- yearly magazine and creating a museum at the Orchard Grantchester. =Cash in the Celebrity Attic= In 2011, Read featured in Cash in the Celebrity Attic with Lorne Spicer and expert John Cameron where they searched for antiques and collectibles at his home in the Cotswolds. The items they found raised funds for a memorial to Britain's Bomber Command of the Second World War, and included Charlie Drake memorabilia and artwork made of chocolate and confectionery. =Charity work= In 2013, Read, along with three friends, formed the British Plaque Trust, a charity established to commemorate deceased achievers in show business, sport and the general arts by unveiling blue plaques on buildings with which they were associated. The organisation aims to act alongside the work in London of English Heritage who have stated that they are \\"restructuring\\" their plaque scheme. In the same year, he was one of the event presenters at Concert At The Kings in All Cannings, Wiltshire.

The summit is located at approximately in Harlan County, Kentucky near the Virginia border, just above the towns of Lynch, Kentucky and Appalachia, Virginia. It is alternatively known as Katahrin's Mountain, and is about taller than any other mountain in Kentucky. Description The summit of Black Mountain, August 2013 Black Mountain summit plaque Route 160 east of Lynch and west of Appalachia crosses the mountain. The summit is reached by a narrow road that turns off to the right (coming from Lynch or to the left, if coming from Appalachia) at the Kentucky- Virginia line (the gap that is the highest part of Route 160) and leads past a Federal Aviation Administration radar dome. There is a one lane dirt road to the left not far past the radar dome that leads to the summit. The summit is marked with an abandoned metal fire lookout tower (the cab and wooden steps are missing from the tower). There are also multiple radio towers along with transmitter buildings around the summit and a National Geodetic Survey benchmark is located on a large rock over the hill to the left of the fire tower. This benchmark is below the highest point; a second is directly under the old lookout tower, marking the latest survey of the highest natural point. The FAA Radar dome is nearby, but below the summit. Trees on both sides of the radar dome have been cleared, so views of other mountains are visible. On a clear day the Great Smoky Mountains on the Tennessee and North Carolina border are clearly visible. Black Mountain's history is intimately tied to the coal mining of the surrounding region. Lynch, Kentucky, was once one of the largest coal mining towns in the nation. In 1998, Jericol Mining, Inc., petitioned to use mountaintop removal methods in the area of Black Mountain. Though the summit itself was not directly threatened, many people protested this action due to the peak's status as the state's highest point. In 1999, Kentucky purchased mineral and timber rights to the summit and prevented future large scale mining. Coal companies have alleged that mined coal veins converge beneath the summit of Black Mountain and that the summit is prone to collapse. A coal company named Penn Virginia Resources of Radnor, Pennsylvania owns the summit, but allows public access with the completion of a waiver. Ecology Black Mountain is one of the few sites in Kentucky supporting a Northern Hardwood Forest at higher elevations. Numerous rare plants and animals are found here, including Black Bear, Red Elderberry and Hobblebush. Like many areas of Northern Hardwood Forest in the Southern Appalachia, fires swept through the mountain after intense logging. Black Mountain has a documented fire that occurred in the fall of 1896.Clark, Thomas Dionysius (2004).

The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Accessed 23 Jul. 2012. Among Pentecostal and some Charismatic Christians, the word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what God is currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person. It can also be defined as knowing the secrets of another person's heart. Through this revelation, it is believed that God encourages the faith of the believer to receive the healing or comfort that God offers. For example, in a public gathering, a person who claims to have the gift of knowledge may describe a medical problem (such as syphilis or trench foot) and ask anyone suffering from the described problem to identify themselves and receive an effective prayer for healing.The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, s.v. \\"Spirituality, Pentecostal and Charismatic\\".

It was designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, with contributions from many notable artists and craftsmen of the period, including a library of miniature books containing original stories written by authors including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and A. A. Milne. History The idea for building the dollhouse originally came from the Queen's cousin, Princess Marie Louise, who discussed her idea with one of the top architects of the time, Sir Edwin Lutyens, at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1921. Sir Edwin agreed to construct the dollhouse and began preparations. Princess Marie Louise had many connections in the arts and arranged for the top artists and craftsmen of the time to contribute their special abilities to the house. It was created as a gift to Queen Mary from the people, and to serve as a historical document on how a royal family might have lived during that period in England. It showcased the very finest and most modern goods of the period. Later the dollhouse was put on display to raise funds for the Queen's charities. It was originally exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition, 1924‚Äì1925, where more than 1.6 million people came to view it, and is now on display in Windsor Castle, at Windsor, Berkshire, England, as a tourist attraction. Description halfpenny The dollhouse was made to a scale of 1:12 (one inch to one foot), is over three feet tall, and contains models of products of well-known companies of the time. It is remarkable for its detail and the detail of the objects within it, many of which are -sized replicas of items in Windsor Castle. These were either made by the companies themselves, or by specialist modelmakers, such as Twining Models of Northampton, England. The carpets, curtains and furnishings are all copies of the real thing, and the house has working light fittings. The bathrooms are fully plumbed with piped, running water, and include a flushable toilet with miniature lavatory paper. Other items in the house include shotguns that \\"break and load\\", monogrammed linens, lifts and a garage of cars with operational engines. In addition, well-known writers wrote special books for the house's library, which were bound in scale size by Sangorski & Sutcliffe. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle contributed the short story \\"How Watson Learned the Trick\\", and the ghost-story writer M. R. James wrote \\"The Haunted Dolls' House\\". A. A. Milne contributed \\"Vespers\\". Other authors included J. M. Barrie, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling and W. Somerset Maugham.The contents of the library were published in normal format in E. V. Lucas, ed., The Book of the Queen's Dolls' House Library (London: Methuen, 1924). (George Bernard Shaw rebuffed the princess's request for a tiny volume of his work,Farquhar, Michael (2001). A Treasury of Royal Scandals. New York: Penguin Books. p.47. . and Sir Edward Elgar also refused to contribute.Siegfried Sassoon reported that on 6 June 1922 Elgar told Lady Maud Warrender: \\"We all know that the King and Queen are incapable of appreciating anything artistic; they have never asked for the full score of my Second Symphony to be added to the Library at Windsor. But as the crown of my career I'm asked to contribute to a Doll's House for the Queen! I've been a monkey- on-a-stick for you people long enough. Now I'm getting off the stick. I wrote and said that I hoped they wouldn't have the impertinence to press the matter on me any further. I consider it an insult for an artist to be asked to mix himself up in such nonsense.\\" (Kennedy, Michael [1982]. Portrait of Elgar. 2nd ed. London: Oxford University Press. p. 305.)) Painters, including Eli Marsden Wilson and Gladys Kathleen Bell, also provided miniature pictures. Even the bottles in the wine cellar were filled with the appropriate wines and spirits, and the wheels of motor vehicles were properly spoked. Queen Mary's purchases brought media attention to specialist furnishers such as Dorothy Rogers, who created needlework miniature carpets for the house. Even viewing a high quality photo of the interior will not reveal it is in fact a collection of miniatures.Lambton, Lucinda (2010) THE QUEEN'S DOLLS' HOUSE: LONDON ENGLAND: Royal Collection Enterprise. pp. 79‚Äì80.

First flying on 14 September 1917, examples were still in use during the Second World War. Development and design The prototype of the Fairey III was the N.10 floatplane, which was designed and built in 1917 by Fairey Aviation (along with the smaller N.9) to meet Admiralty Specification N.2(a) for a carrier-based seaplane for the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War. N.10, also known by its constructor's number F.128 was a two-bay biplane with folding wings and powered by a 260 hp (190 kW) Sunbeam Maori engine. It first flew from the Port Victoria seaplane station on the Isle of Grain, Kent on 14 September 1917.Taylor 1988, p.71. Following tests both as a floatplane and with a conventional wheeled undercarriage, production orders were placed for two versions both powered by the Maori, the IIIA and IIIB, with 50 and 60 aircraft planned, respectively. The Fairey IIIA was a reconnaissance aircraft intended to operate from aircraft carriers, and as such was fitted with a wheeled or skid undercarriage, while the IIIB was intended as a floatplane bomber, with larger span (increased from 46 ft 2 in/14.19 m to 62 ft 9 in/19.13 m) upper wings and a bombload of three 230 lb (105 kg) bombs.Mason 1994, pp. 89‚Äì90. While all 50 IIIAs were built, only 28 of the IIIBs were completed as intended, as a new improved bomber/reconnaissance floatplane, the Fairey IIIC was available, of which 36 were produced, which reverted to short equal-span wings like the IIIA but was powered by the much more powerful and reliable 375 hp (280 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine and could still carry a useful bombload. Many of the IIIBs were completed as IIICs.Mason 1994, p.90. The first major production model was the IIID, which was an improved IIIC, with provision for a third crewmember and capable of being fitted with either a floatplane or a conventional wheeled undercarriage.Mason 1994, p.131. It first flew in August 1920,Taylor 1988, p.96. powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle, and initial production for the Fleet Air Arm, together with aircraft produced for Australia and Portugal retained the Eagle, while later aircraft were powered by the more powerful Napier Lion. The naval variants were usually three- seaters; pilot, observer and gunner and the wings would could be folded back parallel to the fuselage for storage aboard ship. In floatplane configuration, carrier-borne Fairey IIIs would be launched from the deck using a trolley and would land on the water upon their return. The Fairey III floatplane could also be catapult-launched from a ship. The IIID had a wooden, fabric-covered fuselage and usually a wooden, two-blade, fixed-pitch propeller. One IIID was built with metal wings and floats. A total of 207 IIIDs were produced for the Fleet Air Arm and RAF (Royal Air Force), with a further 20 being built for export.Taylor 1988, p.96. IIIF's of 47 Squadron on the Blue Nile at Khartoum in 1930 A Fairey III floatplane (G-EALQ) with a 450 hp Napier Lion was entered into the Air Ministry Commercial Amphibian Competition of September 1920.\\"The Air Ministry Seaplane (Amphibian) Competition\\". Flight, Vol. XII, No. 682, 23 September 1920, p. 1013. The most prolific and enduring of the Fairey IIIs was the final model, the IIIF, which was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification 19/24 for a three-seat spotter/reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm and a two-seat general purpose aircraft for the Royal Air Force. The IIIF, which first flew on 20 April 1926,Taylor 1988, p.145. had a more streamlined engine installation and initially a fuselage of mixed metal and wooden construction, with similar wings to the IIID, although later production aircraft were fitted with an all-metal fuselages and wings.Jarrett March 1994, pp.60‚Äì61. Over 350 IIIFs were operated by the Fleet Air Arm, making it the most widely used type of aircraft in Fleet Air Arm service between the wars.Thetford 1978, p.124. In fact, of the British military aircraft in the inter-war years, only the Hawker Hart family was produced in greater numbers.Thetford May 1994, p.33. Three IIIFs were modified as a radio- controlled gunnery trainer, known as the Fairey Queen. The Fairey IIIF was also the basis for development of the Gordon and Seal. Operational history =Early versions= The IIIA and IIIB saw limited service towards the end of the war, with some IIIBs being used for mine-spotting duty from the seaplane station at Westgate-on-Sea.Taylor 1988, p.78. The IIIC entered service in November 1918, but did not carry out any combat patrols owing to the Armistice ending hostilities with Germany. Seven IIICs were deployed to Arkhangelsk in 1919 by the seaplane tender in support of the North Russian Expeditionary Force. They were used to carry out bombing attacks against Bolshevik shipping and rail communications.Taylor 1988, p.86. =IIID= The IIID was operated by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm as well as the Naval Aviation of Portugal (11 aircraft) and the air forces of Australia. Fairey IIID floatplane during a circumnavigation of Australia in 1924. Australia received six IIIDs, the first being delivered in August 1921. In 1924, the third of the Australian IIIDs, designated ANA.3 (or Australian Naval Aircraft No. 3), flown by Stanley Goble (later Air Vice Marshal) and Ivor McIntyre was awarded the Britannia Trophy by the Royal Aero Club for circumnavigating Australia in 44 days. The IIID remained in Australian service until 1928.Isaacs 1984, pp.40‚Äì49. Portugal ordered its first IIIDs in 1921. Its first aircraft, modified as the F.400 and named \\"Lusit√¢nia\\", was used for an attempt to fly across the South Atlantic and demonstrate the new aerial navigation system devised by Gago Coutinho, the navigator. The voyage started on 30 March 1922 (Flyers Day in Portugal), stopping at Las Palmas, S√£o Vicente, Cape Verde and achieving the main navigation goal of Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, where it was lost during refuelling.Taylor 1988, pp.98‚Äì100. The journey was finished using another two standard aircraft (the second of which was immediately lost in the sea), completing the first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic, 72 days after their departure from Lisbon. The last aircraft, \\"Santa Cruz\\", is currently displayed at the Museu de Marinha, in Portugal. The IIID entered Fleet Air Arm Service in 1924, operating from shore bases, aircraft carriers and floats until replaced by the IIIF in 1930. The RAF Cape Flight used four IIIDs to carry out a long distance formation flight from Cairo to Cape Town and back in 1926, the first long range formation flight by the RAF and the first RAF flight to South Africa.Taylor 1988, p.102‚Äì103. Fleet Air Arm IIIDs were used to defend British interests in Shanghai against rebel Chinese forces in 1927.Thetford 1978, p.116. =IIIF= Fairey IIIF of the New Zealand Permanent Air Force. The IIIF entered service with the RAF in Egypt and with Fleet Air Arm Catapult flights in 1927,Taylor 1988, p.147.Mason 1994, p.178. and with the Royal New Zealand Air Force shortly after. The RAF used the IIIF to equip general-purpose squadrons in Egypt, Sudan, Aden and Jordan, where its ability to operate from both wheels and floats proved useful, while the contemporary Westland Wapiti carried out similar roles in Iraq and India.Thetford 1994, p.33. As such IIIFs were used for colonial policing as well as taking part in further long distance flights. The RAF also used the IIIF to finally replace the Airco DH.9A in the home based Day-Bomber role, and, in the absence of sufficient long range flying boats for maritime patrol duties by 202 Squadron from Hal Far Malta.Thetford 1994, pp.34‚Äì35. In the Fleet Air Arm, the IIIF replaced the IIID as a spotter-reconnaissance aircraft, operating on floats from the Royal Navy's cruisers and battleships, and with wheels, from the aircraft carriers , , , and .Taylor 1988, p.148. The IIIF remained in front line service well into the 1930s, with the last front line RAF squadron, 202 Squadron, re-equipping with Supermarine Scapas in August 1935,Thetford 1994, p.202. and the final front line Fleet Air Arm squadron, 822 Squadron retained the IIIF until 1936.Thetford 1978, p.126. The IIIF remained in use in second line roles, and despite being declared obsolete in 1940,Thetford 1978, p.128. some were still in use as target tugs as late as 1941.Mason 1994, p.128. Civil use The first prototype III was purchased back by Fairey in 1919, fitted with new, single bay wings and a Napier Lion engine and entered into the 1919 Schneider Trophy race, on 10 September. The race was abandoned due to fog, however.Taylor 1988, pp.72‚Äì74. Four IIICs were civilianized, some with an extra cockpit between the two standard ones and sometimes with an enlarged rear cockpit. One carried five passengers, one in the extra cockpit and four in the rear.Taylor 1988, p.89 One three seat civilianized IIIC (G-EBDI) was part of a Daily News sponsored multi-aircraft round the world flight in 1922, with Norman Macmillan, W T Blake and cine-photographer G.H. Malins. The aircraft, with Macmillan and Malins aboard was finally lost between Lakhidia Char and Chittagong, but the crew were rescued.Taylor 1988, pp.87‚Äì89 A small number of civil operated IIIDs and IIIFs were used for survey duties in the 1920s and 30s, while in October 1934 a single IIIF was entered into the MacRobertson Air Race, reaching the finishing line in Melbourne but too late to be classed as completing the race.Jackson 1973, pp.200‚Äì203.

Description Located in the northeast part of the state, Woodall Mountain is the highest natural point in the state of Mississippi at 807 feet (246 m). It was originally called Yow Hill. The summit is marked with a National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disk and three radio towers. A sign cautions visitors to prepare for a steep, unpaved, and rocky inclined road approximately a mile in length to the summit. Atop the hill there is a bench, a high point register, and a gravel circle allowing parking for several vehicles. A wooden observation tower was constructed in the 20th century atop the hill in the middle of the gravel circle. The tower deteriorated over time, with some steps rotting; it was torn down in 1998. History Yow Hill was the scene of fighting during the American Civil War. On September 19, 1862, the Battle of Iuka took place there. Union General William Rosecrans occupied the mountain and used it to launch artillery barrages on the town of Iuka, then under the control of General Sterling Price. The battle was a victory for the Union although Price avoided capture. Summit area of Woodall Mountain The hill was renamed after Zephaniah Woodall, sheriff of Tishomingo County, who bought it and surrounding land in 1884.

The summit straddles the border of Grayson and Smyth Counties, Virginia, about WSW of Troutdale, Virginia. Most of the mountain is contained within the Lewis Fork Wilderness, while the entire area is part of the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, which itself is a part of the Jefferson National Forest. The mountain is named for William Barton Rogers, a Virginian educated at the College of William & Mary, who taught at William & Mary and the University of Virginia, became Virginia's first State Geologist, and went on to found the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The summit is most easily accessed from Grayson Highlands State Park by following the Appalachian Trail southbound for to a blue-blazed trail leading to the summit, which is covered by trees and marked with four National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disks; a standard station disk marked with an equilateral triangle and three standard reference disks marked with arrows pointing towards the station disk. One reference disk has been obscured by dense overgrowth. Because the Appalachian Trail passes within a half mile of the summit, the area is especially popular with hikers. Geology The Mount Rogers area contains a unique record of the geohistory of Virginia. There is evidence from the rocks that volcanoes were part of the landscape. Roughly 750 million years ago, rift-related (divergent) volcanoes erupted along the axis of what later became the Appalachians, and one remnant of that volcanic zone, with its volcanic rocks, still can be seen at Mount Rogers. Massive rhyolite lava flows erupted at the mountain during the Precambrian rifting event. Mount Rogers is also the only place in Virginia that preserves evidence of ancient Proterozoic glaciation. Spruce-fir forests Forest of red spruce and Fraser fir on the slopes of Mount Rogers Mount Rogers is the northernmost habitat of the high-altitude Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests, which are found in only five other locations in the United States: the Great Smoky Mountains, the Black Mountains, the Great Balsam Mountains, Grandfather Mountain, and Roan Mountain.Potter, Kevin M., Frampton, John, and Sidebottom, Jill. \\"Impacts of balsam woolly adelgid on the southern Appalachian spruce-fir ecosystem and the North Carolina Christmas tree industry\\". Third Symposium on Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in the Eastern United States, 2005 This forest type is one of the few remaining habitats of the Fraser fir, which is only found at high elevations, typically above , in the southern Appalachian Mountains. These forests have suffered recent declines due to infestations by the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae), a non- native insect that originated in Europe. It first infested Mount Rogers in 1962 and the entire U.S. population of Fraser firs suffered a 67% mortality rate since, although Mount Rogers was not affected as severely as other locations.Newton, Leslie P., and Hain, Fred P. \\"Host interactions of the balsam woolly adelgid\\". Third Symposium on Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in the United States, 2005. Some researchers have proposed that air pollution in the form of nitrogen and sulfur compounds originating from power plants has been a source of stress to the Fraser firs, resulting in an increased susceptibility to the balsam woolly adelgid, but this relationship has not been confirmed.

The ubiquitous compound can be found in coal tar, tobacco smoke and many foods, especially grilled meats. The substance with the formula C20H12 is one of the benzopyrenes, formed by a benzene ring fused to pyrene. Its diol epoxide metabolites (more commonly known as BPDE) react and bind to DNA, resulting in mutations and eventually cancer. It is listed as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC. In the 18th century a scrotal cancer of chimney sweepers, the chimney sweeps' carcinoma, was already known to be connected to soot.  Description  Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in coal tar with the formula C20H12. The compound is one of the benzopyrenes, formed by a benzene ring fused to pyrene, and is the result of incomplete combustion at temperatures between and .  Sources  The main source of atmospheric BaP is residential wood burning.Assessment of Benzo-alpha-pyrene Emissions in the Great Lakes Region, pp 23-24 http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei20/session10/asoehl_pres.pdf It is also found in coal tar, in automobile exhaust fumes (especially from diesel engines), in all smoke resulting from the combustion of organic material (including cigarette smoke), and in charbroiled food. A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found levels of BaP to be significantly higher in foods that were cooked well-done on the barbecue, particularly steaks, chicken with skin, and hamburgers: Cooked meat products have been shown to contain up to 4 ng/g of BaP, and up to 5.5 ng/g in fried chicken and 62.6 ng/g in overcooked charcoal barbecued beef. BaP is discharged in wastewater by industries such as smelters, particularly iron and steel millsU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C.

History  In the 18th century, young British chimney sweeps who climbed into chimneys suffered from chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a scrotal cancer peculiar to their profession, and this was connected to the effects of soot in 1775, in the first work of occupational cancer epidemiology and also the first connection of any chemical mixture to cancer formation. Frequent skin cancers were noted among fuel industry workers in the 19th century. In 1933, BaP was determined to be the compound responsible for these cases, and its carcinogenicity was demonstrated when skin tumors occurred in laboratory animals repeatedly painted with coal tar. BaP has since been identified as a prime carcinogen in cigarette smoke.  Toxicity  Benzo[a]pyrene, showing the base pyrene ring and numbering and ring fusion locations according to IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. = Nervous system = Prenatal exposure of BaP to rats is known to affect learning and memory in rodent models. Pregnant rats eating BaP were shown to negatively affect the brain function in the late life of their offspring. At a time when synapses are first formed and adjusted in strength by activity, BaP diminished NMDA receptor-dependent nerve cell activity measured as mRNA expression of the NMDA NR2B receptor subunit.. = Immune system = BaP has an effect on the number of white blood cells, inhibiting some of them from differentiating into macrophages, the body's first line of defense to fight infections. In 2016, the molecular mechanism was uncovered as damage to the macrophage membrane's lipid raft integrity by decreasing membrane cholesterol at 25%. This means less immunoreceptors CD32 (a member of the Fc family of immunoreceptors) could bind to IgG and turn the white blood cell into a macrophage. Therefore, macrophage membranes become susceptible to bacterial infections. = Reproductive system = In experiments with male rats, sub- chronic exposure to inhaled BaP has been shown to generally reduce the function of testicles and epididymis with lower sex steroid/testosterone production and sperm production. = Carcinogenicity = BaP's metabolites are mutagenic and highly carcinogenic, and it is listed as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC. Chemical agents and related occupations, Volume 10, A review of Human Carcinogens, IARC Monographs, Lyon France 2009 A review of human carcinogens‚Äîpart F: chemical agents and related occupations In June 2016, BaP was added as benzo[def]chrysene to the REACH Candidate List of Substances of very high concern for Authorisation. Numerous studies since the 1970s have documented links between BaP and cancers. It has been more difficult to link cancers to specific BaP sources, especially in humans, and difficult to quantify risks posed by various methods of exposure (inhalation or ingestion). A link between vitamin A deficiency and emphysema in smokers was described in 2005 to be due to BaP, which induces vitamin A deficiency in rats. A 1996 study provided molecular evidence linking components in tobacco smoke to lung cancer. BaP was shown to cause genetic damage in lung cells that was identical to the damage observed in the DNA of most malignant lung tumours.Denissenko MF, Pao A, Tang M, Pfeifer GP. Preferential formation of benzo[a]pyrene adducts at lung cancer mutational hotspots in P53. Science. 1996 October 18;274(5286):430-2. Regular consumption of cooked meats has been epidemiologically associated with increased levels of colon cancer (although this in itself does not prove carcinogenicity), A 2005 NCI study found an increased risk of colorectal adenomas was associated with BaP intake, and more strongly with BaP intake from all foods.Sinha R, Kulldorff M, Gunter MJ, Strickland P, Rothman N.Dietary Benzo[a]Pyrene Intake and Risk of Colorectal Adenoma Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, August 2005 14; 2030;doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-04-0854 However, the foods themselves are not necessarily carcinogenic, even if they contain trace amounts of carcinogens, because the gastrointestinal tract protects itself against carcinomas by shedding its outer layer continuously. Furthermore, detoxification enzymes, such as cytochromes P450 have increased activities in the gut for protection from food-borne toxins. Thus, in most cases, small amounts of BaP are metabolized prior to being passed into the blood. The lungs are not protected in either of these manners. The detoxification enzymes cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) are both protective and necessary for benzo[a]pyrene toxicity. Experiments with strains of mice engineered to remove (knockout) CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 reveal that CYP1A1 primarily acts to protect mammals from low doses of BaP, and that removing this protection accumulates large concentrations of BaP. Unless CYP1B1 is also knocked out, toxicity results from the bioactivation of BaP to benzo[a]pyrene -7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, the ultimate toxic compound,.Data presented by Daniel W.

A DNA adduct (at center) of benzo[a]pyrene, the major mutagen in tobacco smoke.Created from PDB 1JDG Properly speaking, BaP is a procarcinogen, meaning that its mechanism of carcinogenesis depends on its enzymatic metabolism to BaP diol epoxide. It intercalates in DNA, and the electrophilic epoxide is attacked by nucleophilic guanine bases, forming a bulky guanine adduct.DG rxn with BPDE X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies have shown how this binding distorts the DNAVolk DE, Thiviyanathan V, Rice JS, Luxon BA, Shah JH, Yagi H, Sayer JM, Yeh HJ, Jerina DM, Gorenstein DG.

This disrupts the normal process of copying DNA and causes mutations, which explains the occurrence of cancer after exposure. This mechanism of action is similar to that of aflatoxin which binds to the N7 position of guanine.Eaton DL, Gallagher EP. Mechanisms of aflatoxin carcinogenesis. Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol. 1994;34:135-72. There are indications that benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide specifically targets the protective p53 gene.Pfeifer GP, Denissenko MF, Olivier M, Tretyakova N, Hecht SS, Hainaut P. Tobacco smoke carcinogens, DNA damage and p53 mutations in smoking-associated cancers. Oncogene. 2002 October 21;21(48):7435-51. This gene is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and hence functions as a tumor suppressor. By inducing G (guanine) to T (thymidine) transversions in transversion hotspots within p53, there is a probability that benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide inactivates the tumor suppression ability in certain cells, leading to cancer. Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is the carcinogenic product of three enzymatic reactions: # Benzo[a]pyrene is first oxidized by cytochrome P450 1A1 to form a variety of products, including (+)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-epoxide. # This product is metabolized by epoxide hydrolase, opening up the epoxide ring to yield (‚àí)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol. # The ultimate carcinogen is formed after another reaction with cytochrome P450 1A1 to yield the (+)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. It is this diol epoxide that covalently binds to DNA. BaP induces cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) by binding to the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) in the cytosol. Upon binding the transformed receptor translocates to the nucleus where it dimerises with ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) and then binds xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in DNA located upstream of certain genes. This process increases transcription of certain genes, notably CYP1A1, followed by increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzo[a]pyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eukaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, BaP has been found to activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.

On 1 April 1916, Lieutenant- General Sir Hubert Gough was moved from the command of I Corps and took over the Reserve Corps, which in June before the Battle of the Somme, was expanded and renamed Reserve Army. The army fought on the northern flank of the Fourth Army during the battle and became the Fifth Army on 30 October. History Haig developed a concept of all-arms units of \\"cavalry and mobile troops\\" to capture a portion of the German defences and enlarge the foothold for later exploitation. Haig wrote training instructions for the cavalry in March 1916, in which he described a breach being made in the German lines and the cavalry and mobile troops rushing forward to create a bridgehead, obstructing German reinforcements. Infantry would have time to move up to relieve the cavalry in the bridgehead, which would then operate behind parts of the front where German infantry were still fighting and protect the main force by extending the flank. To enable this, Haig disbanded the two cavalry corps on 3 March 1916 and distributed the divisions to the armies and the new Reserve Corps. Gough was appointed to command the Reserve Corps in April, which was renamed Reserve Army in June. There was some uncertainty over the role of the army, Kiggell, the BEF Chief of Staff writing on 4 June, \\"The area in which the Reserve Corps (sic) may be employed must be dependent on events and cannot be foreseen\\". Gough was told to train the cavalry in the all-arms concept and to convince cavalry officers of the effectiveness of cavalry, when co-operating with artillery and infantry. In 1996, Badsey wrote that the Reserve Army was organised as a conveyor belt, to exploit the success of the Fourth Army, with the 25th Division first, followed by two cavalry divisions and then the II Corps infantry divisions. Sheffield wrote that the all-arms concept was an imaginative response to the tactical problems of 1915 and anticipated post-war moves towards mobile warfare, but was ambitious, and the staff work and traffic control required to make it work, would have been a great burden on the inexperienced armies and staffs of 1916. \\"Gough's Mobile Army\\" was then made ineffective by a disagreement between Haig and Rawlinson about the plan for the Battle of the Somme, Rawlinson wanting to conduct a series of limited advances onto commanding ground, from which German counter-attacks would be smashed. The intelligence picture led Haig to believe that a more ambitious attack could succeed and he insisted on deeper objectives being substituted for the relatively shallow penetration of the German first position preferred by Rawlinson. The army was intended to carry out the breakthrough and exploitation of the Somme offensive, once the Fourth Army (General Sir Henry Rawlinson) had captured the German front-line trenches. In May it had been envisaged that Gough would stand by to take over the two right flank corps of the Fourth Army but on 5 June, this plan was supplemented by a proposal to move the forces under Gough to the Second Army in Flanders, if the Fourth Army offensive bogged down. The idea of Gough taking over the right wing corps was dropped later in June and the 1st, 3rd and 2nd Indian cavalry divisions were attached to Gough along with the 12th and 25th divisions in GHQ reserve, to operate under the command of GHQ. II Corps with the 23rd and 38th divisions, was to be ready to move forward into the vacated assembly areas. In mid-June II Corps was detached and returned to GHQ reserve and the Reserve Army reduced to a cavalry formation, under the command of the Fourth Army, to give more discretion to Rawlinson as the man on the spot. Battle of the Somme 1 July ‚Äì 18 November 1916 In the evening of the First day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, the British Commander-in-Chief General Sir Douglas Haig relieved Rawlinson's Fourth Army of responsibility for the northern sector, placing the VIII and X Corps under Gough from on 2 July. Gough immediately left to visit the two corps to assess the situation. X Corps and VIII Corps to the north were to capture the German front position and the intermediate line from Mouquet Farm to Serre. Gough was sent to take over command of X Corps and VIII Corps and the 25th Division (Major-General E. G. T. Bainbridge) was transferred from reserve to X Corps. Gough had intended to attack Thiepval with the 49th and 32nd divisions and the 48th Division of VIII Corps; eventually changes of plan reduced the attack to two brigades of the 32nd Division. Just before the attack by X Corps and III Corps began on 3 July, Gough revealed that X Corps could not attack before and at noon, VIII Corps and X Corps were detached from the Fourth Army to Gough and the Reserve Army. Later II Corps, I Anzac Corps and the Canadian Corps were added to the Reserve Army. For the next few months the Reserve Army fought the Battle of Pozi√®res and the Battle of Mouquet Farm The Battle of Thiepval Ridge took place as part of the sequential offensives of the French Sixth, the Fourth and then the Reserve Army during September. For much of October, the Reserve Army conducted the Battle of the Ancre Heights and on 30 October, the army was renamed the Fifth Army.

The didactic method of instruction is often contrasted with dialectics and the Socratic method; the term can also be used to refer to a specific didactic method, as for instance constructivist didactics. Overview Didactics is a theory of teaching, and in a wider sense, a theory and practical application of teaching and learning. In demarcation from \\"mathetics\\" (the science of learning), didactics refers only to the science of teaching. This theory might be contrasted with open learning, also known as experiential learning, in which people can learn by themselves, in an unstructured manner, on topics of interest. The theory of didactic learning methods focuses on the baseline knowledge students possess and seeks to improve upon and convey this information. It also refers to the foundation or starting point in a lesson plan, where the overall goal is knowledge. A teacher or educator functions in this role as an authoritative figure, but also as both a guide and a resource for students. Didactics or the didactic method have different connotations in continental Europe and English-speaking countries. For example in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, the Oxford dictionary defines didactics as a particularly moral instruction . Following that, the didactic method still carries the original meaning of teaching moral contents, and is therefore associated with unfavourable views opposed to the teachings of a true art or science . Didacticism was indeed the cultural origin of the didactic method but refers within its narrow context usually pejoratively to the use of language to a doctrinal end. The interpretation of these opposing views are theorised to be the result of a differential cultural development in the 19th century when Great Britain and its former colonies went through a renewal and increased cultural distancing from continental Europe. It was particularly the later appearance of Romanticism and Aestheticism in the Anglo-Saxon world which offered these negative and limiting views of the didactic method. On the other hand, in continental Europe those moralising aspects of didactics were removed earlier by cultural representatives of the age of enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and later specifically related to teaching by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. The consequences of these cultural differences then created two main didactic traditions: The Anglo- Saxon tradition of curriculum studies on one side and the Continental and North European tradition of didactics on the other. Still today, the science of didactics carries much less weight in much of the English-speaking world.. With the advent of globalisation at the beginning of the 20th century, however, the arguments for such relative philosophical aspects in the methods of teaching started to diminish somewhat. It is therefore possible to categorise didactics and pedagogy as a general analytic theory on three levels:Gundem and Hopmann (1998). Journal of Curriculum Studies, vol. 27, no. 1 Retrieved 27 November 2013. *a theoretical or research level (denoting a field of study) *a practical level (summaries of curricular activities) *a discursive level (implying a frame of reference for professional dialogs) Didactic teaching Didactic method provides students with the required theoretical knowledge. It is an effective method used to teach students who are unable to organize their work and depend on the teachers for instructions. It is also used to teach basic skills of reading and writing. The teacher or the literate is the source of knowledge and the knowledge is transmitted to the students through didactic method. Didactic Teaching materials: The Montessori school had preplanned teaching (Didactic) materials designed, to develop practical, sensory, and formal skills. Lacing and buttoning frames, weights, and packet to be identified by their sound or smell. Because they direct learning in the prepared environment, Montessori educators are called directress rather than teachers. In Brazil, there has been for more than 80 years the government program called PNLD (National Program of Didactic Book). This program seeks to provide basic education schools with didactic and pedagogical records, expanding access to the book and democratizing access to sources of information and culture. Textbooks, in many cases, are the only sources of information that poor children and young people have access to in a poor country like Brazil. These books are also valuable support to teachers, offering modern learning methodologies and updated concepts and content in the most diverse disciplines.

It is a teacher-centered method of teaching and is content-oriented. Neither the content nor the knowledge of the teacher are questioned. The process of teaching involves the teacher who gives instructions, commands, delivers content, and provides necessary information. The pupil activity involves listening and memorization of the content. In the modern education system, lecture method which is one of the most commonly used methods is a form of didactic teaching. =Limitations= Though the didactic method has been given importance in several schools, it does not satisfy the needs and interests of all students. It can be tedious for students to listen to the possible lectures. There is minimum interaction between the students and the teachers. Learning which also involves motivating the students to develop an interest towards the subject may not be satisfied through this teaching method. It may be a monologue process and experience of the students may not have a significant role in learning.

Methylcholanthrene is also known as 3-methylcholanthrene, 20-methylcholanthrene or the IUPAC name 3-methyl-1,2-dyhydrobenzo[j]aceanthrylene. The short notation often used is 3-MC or MCA. This compound forms pale yellow solid crystals when crystallized from benzene and ether. It has a melting point around 180 ¬∞C and its boiling point is around 280 ¬∞C at a pressure of 80 mmHg. Methylcholanthrene is used in laboratory studies of chemical carcinogenesis. It is an alkylated derivative of benz[a]anthracene and has a similar UV spectrum. The most common isomer is 3-methylcholanthrene, although the methyl group can occur in other places. 3-Methylcholanthrene, a known carcinogen which builds up in the prostate due to cholesterol breakdown, is implicated in prostate cancer. It \\"readily produces\\" primary sarcomas in mice.  History  In 1933, the first article about methylcholanthrene was published. Here they described the synthesis of the compound. Not many years later, it became clear that this compound had toxic properties to humans and animals. Therefore, a lot of interest was shown in the compound and it was used often in toxicological research. Methylcholanthrene is often tested on mice and rats to derive information for cancer medicine development. Due to the influence of the compound on the central nervous system, its responses and change in response are compared. It is also known that due to genetic mutations, the compound causes cancer cells to develop. In 1982, the last article appeared on the synthesis of methylcholanthrene. The yield of 93% was reached and therefore no further adjustments were made to the synthesis scheme.  Synthesis  :1. Synthesis of methylcholanthrene First 3-MC was synthesized with the method of reference. Later the synthesis of the compound was improved. The synthesis of 3-MC consists of a few steps, visualized in figure 1; the first step is the key to success for the synthesis. 4-methylindanone (1) reacts in condensation with lithium salt of N,N-diethyl-1-naphthamide (2). At -60 ÃäC the reaction of 1 and 2 afforded evenly to the lactone (3), the carbonyl addition product which underwent conversion on treatment with acid. The free acid (4) was obtained when the latter was cleaved reductively with zinc and alkali. Cyclization of the product occurred when treated with ZnCl2 in acetic acid anhydride and gave the compound 6-acetoxy-3-MC (5). Reducing this product with hydriodic acid in propionic acid resulted in 3-MC.  Mechanism  2.Methylcholanthrene mechanism 3-MC has an inhibitory function in a dimethylnitrosamine demethylase process in rat livers. Inhibition could happen on by interfering in demethylase conformations or by interfering in synthesis and/or degradation of demethylase. Experiments showed that the Km doesn‚Äôt change after 3-MC treatment. This strongly indicates that enzyme affinity is not influenced by 3-MC. Instead, incubation with 3-MC leads to a decrease in the amount of enzyme activity. These results point towards inhibition of demethylase synthesis and/or induction of demetylase degradation. Unpublished observations of Venkatesan, Argus and Arcos suggest that demethylase synthesis inhibition is most plausible. A possible mechanism for this reaction is depicted in figure (2). 3-MC is metabolized, via epoxidation, hydrolysis and another epoxidation, to a very reactive epoxide. Epoxidations are realized by the enzyme cytochrome P450. The second epoxide is not hydrolysed immediately because it is localized next to a bay region, which shields the epoxide. This way, the metabolite is able to travel and bind to DNA in figure (2). The mechanism is derived from the binding mechanism of benzo[a]pyrene to DNA. This is likely because it is plausible that two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are metabolized via the same pathway. Deoxyguanosine is used in the figure, since that base appears to be bound to Benzo[a]pyrene far more often than the other bases. There appears to be an equilibrium in 3-MC-free and 3-MC-bound. It is hard to determine how when the equilibrium is formed due to difficulties with radioactive measurements. A probable saturating dosis is thought to be around 40 mg 3-MC/kg. Research on the effect of 3-MC in rat uteri concludes that 3-MC acts as an estrogen antagonist. The sexhormone is, like 3-MC, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. 3-MC and estrogen bind to estrogenreceptors competitively, reducing the estrogen expression. Metabolism MC is metabolized by rat liver microsomes into oxygenated forms which alkylate DNA. These oxygenated metabolites bind to double-stranded and single-stranded. Empirical data show that MC tends to bind mostly to G-bases8. When injected in lung, kidney or liver tissue of rats, it appears that the liver is able to reverse the MC-binding to DNA. Lung and kidney tissue are not capable of doing this, which may explain why MC is more carcinogenic in lungs and kidneys than in the liver. To be carcinogenic, the MC metabolite has to be covalently bound to DNA. Therefore it is necessary for MC to be oxygenated in order to carcinogenic. Injected MC does not move away from the injection site. In a rat body MC has a half-life of about 4 weeks. After 8 weeks, 80% of MC is metabolized into water-soluble metabolites. MC and its metabolites mainly exit the body via feces (a ninefold more urine). Three months after injection with MC, 85% of the rats are reported to have tumors. 82% of the tumors is a form of spindle-cell sarcoma. Efficacy Methylcholanthrene is often used to induce tumors in rodents for carcinogenesis and mutagenesis research. In a study from 1991, lung precancerous and cancerous lesions were induced in Wistar rats by one intrabronchial injection of 3-MC. After 30 days, atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium, adenoid hyperplasia or adenomas, and squamous cell carcinoma occurred in 15 (88.2%), 12 (70.6%) and 3 (17.7%) out of 17 rats respectively. After 60 days, the incidences were 15/18 (83.3%), 4/17 (23.5%) and 7/18 (38.9%). All of the precancerous lesions and carcinomas showed positive expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). Jin et al. (2013) found that the cellular redox balance is altered by acute exposure to 3-MC. This causes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated response pathway to induce antioxidant responses. Toxicity 3-MC is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which stimulates transcription directed by xenobiotic response elements. AhR ligands can induce formation of an AhR-estrogen receptor (ER) complex. 3-MC was found to elicit estrogenic activity by this mechanism, and by stimulation of the expression of some endogenous ER target genes. 3-MC may cause respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation or eye irritation. Effects on animals =Effects on human= 3-MC is mutagenic to human cells. Curren et al. (1978) were the first to report successfully induced mutations in human cells with 3-MC. Skin epithelial cells are thought to metabolize the compound to mutagenic products. The ability to metabolize mutagens may express genetically regulated differences within a species such as man or mouse, causing environmental chemicals to show a different level of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity to specific individuals. =Non-human toxicity studies= The administration of 3-MC to pregnant mice results in the formation of lung tumors in the offspring. Miller et al. (1990) compared the effects of fetal versus adult exposure to 3-MC on both induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity in lung and dependence of lung tumorigenesis on the Ah genotype. A single ip injection (in inducible fetal lung supernatants) of 100 mg/kg of 3-MC to the mothers resulted in a maximal 50-fold induction of AHH activity by 8 hr, which persisted for 48 hr. The same injections to adult F1 mice revealed only a 4- to 7‚Äîfold increase in lung AHH activity, compared to the large fetal induction ratio.

Common topics and themes include technology, futurism, science fiction, gadgets, intellectual property, Disney, and left-wing politics. It twice won the Bloggies for Weblog of the Year, in 2004 and 2005. The editors are Mark Frauenfelder, David Pescovitz, Xeni Jardin and Rob Beschizza, and the publisher is Jason Weisberger. One report named Boing Boing as the most popular blog in the world until 2006, when Chinese-language blogs became popular, and it remained among the most widely-linked and cited blogs into the 2010s. History Boing Boing (originally bOING bOING) started as a zine in 1988 by married duo Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair. Issues were subtitled \\"The World's Greatest Neurozine\\". Associate editors included Gareth Branwyn, Jon Lebkowsky, Paco Nathan, and Pescovitz. Along with Mondo 2000, Boing Boing was an influence in the development of the cyberpunk subculture. It reached a maximum circulation of 17,500 copies. The last issue of the zine was #15. 1990 Boing Boing logo, from a T-shirt Boing Boing was established as a website in 1995 and one year later was a web-only publication. While researching for an article about blogs in 1999, Frauenfelder became acquainted with the Blogger software. He relaunched Boing Boing as a weblog on 21 January 2000, describing it as a \\"directory of wonderful things\\". Over time, Frauenfelder was joined by four co-editors: Doctorow, Pescovitz, Jardin and Beschizza, all of whom previously contributed to Wired magazine. Maggie Koerth-Baker, after a run as a guest blogger in 2009, joined the site as its Science Editor, leaving to join a Nieman Foundation fellowship in 2014. In September 2003, Boing Boing removed their Quicktopics user-comment feature without warning or explanation. Bloggers commenting on the change at the time speculated that it stemmed from \\"identity impersonators and idiot flamers\\" pretending to be co-editors. Xeni Jardin was a guest on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to discuss The Washington Post's decision to remove its Comments section on its website, and she spoke from her experience at Boing Boing. In August 2007, Boing Boing staff launched a redesigned site, which included a restored comment facility, moderated by Teresa Nielsen Hayden. In 2013, Boing Boing switched from the proprietary Disqus comment system to Discourse, an open-source internet forum developed by Jeff Atwood, Robin Ward and Sam Saffron. In 2004, the project incorporated as Happy Mutants LLC, and John Battelle became the blog's business manager. Boing Boing, by the mid-2000s, \\"had become one of the most-read and linked-to blogs in the world\\" according to Fast Company. The site added advertising over the course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site's RSS feed as well. Editor Cory Doctorow noted that \\"John [Battelle] said it's going to be harder to make a little money to pay your bandwidth bills than it will be to make a lot of money and have a real source of income from this.\\" The advertising income during the first quarter was already $27,000, and , Boing Boing still \\"makes a nice living for its founders and a handful of contract employees,\\" but it is no longer a member of Battelle's blog network Federated Media Publishing, Inc. Boing Boing featured a \\"guest blogger\\" sidebar, then stopped the series in summer of 2004. In 2008, the \\"guest blogger\\" series was resumed, with guests posting in the main blog for two-week periods. Guests have included Charles Platt, John Shirley, Mark Dery, Tiffany Lee Brown, Karen Marcelo of Survival Research Laboratories, Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom, Rudy Rucker, Gareth Branwyn, Wiley Wiggins, Jason Scott of textfiles.com, Jessamyn West of librarian.net, journalists Danny O'Brien and Quinn Norton and comedian John Hodgman. In September 2006, Boing Boing introduced a weekly podcast, \\"Boing Boing Boing\\", intended to cover the week's posts and upcoming projects. The show's cast consists of the Boing Boing editors, accompanied by a weekly guest. In the same month, Boing Boing introduced a second podcast called \\"Get Illuminated\\", which features interviews with writers, artists, and other creatives. The site's own original content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license, as of November 2019. In September 2009, Boing Boing refused to comply with a demand from Polo Ralph Lauren's lawyers to remove a post concerning a heavily manipulated image of model Filippa Hamilton, originally published by the Photoshop Disasters blog. The latter was forced to comply with the company's demand by its hosting provider. Ralph Lauren issued DMCA takedown notices to BoingBoing's ISP and Blogspot, which hosts Photoshop Disasters, claiming their use of the image infringed copyright. Blogspot complied, but Boing Boing's ISP consulted with Boing Boing and agreed that the image was fair use. As a result, Boing Boing issued a mocking rebuttal, using the same image again and posting the takedown notice. The rebuttal was widely reported, including on frequently viewed websites such as The Huffington Post and ABC News. On 3 May 2011, the first podcast of \\"Gweek\\" was released. Gweek is a podcast in which the editors and friends of Boing Boing talk about comic books, science fiction and fantasy, video games, TV shows, music, movies, tools, gadgets, apps, and other \\"neat\\" stuff. In the first episode of Gweek, Rob Beschizza and Mark Frauenfelder discussed subjects such as the video game Portal 2, graphic novels, upcoming science fiction books, and recommendations of some of their favorite adventure games for mobile platforms. Boing Boing has since added several other podcasts. In November 2017, the site was sued by Playboy, which alleged that a hyperlink to copyright-infringing content at Imgur and YouTube was itself illegal. A Federal Court dismissed Playboy's claims on 14 February 2018 and Playboy released a statement suggesting that it was standing down on 28 February. In February 2020, Cory Doctorow left Boing Boing to start Pluralistic.net, a blog that brands itself as having \\"No trackers, no ads.\\" and was quietly removed from the list of editors. Unicorn chaser A \\"unicorn chaser\\" is a practice created by Boing Boing editors as an antidote to blog postings linking to sites containing disgusting or shocking images. The shocking post would be immediately followed by another post containing a picture of a unicorn. Xeni Jardin posted the first one (titled \\"And now, we pause for a Unicorn Moment.\\") in August 2003 as a reply to a picture of a rash posted by editor Mark Frauenfelder in an attempt to get readers to diagnose it for him. It has also been used as an antidote for posts containing photos of a brain tumor, a man who pumped up the skin of his face with saline solution, many different ways to clean one's earwax, and a lengthy discussion of the Internet video \\"2 Girls 1 Cup\\". On 18 May 2007, Boing Boing announced that Virgin America, as part of its \\"Name Our Planes!\\" campaign, would be naming one of its new aircraft \\"Unicorn Chaser\\", after having asked Boing Boing to suggest a name. Boing Boing Gadgets and Offworld In August 2007, Boing Boing introduced a gadgets-focused companion site headed by former Gizmodo editor Joel Johnson. Johnson left in July 2009, to be replaced by Rob Beschizza, formerly of Wired News. Other writers include Steven Leckart and Lisa Katayama. Offworld, a blog covering video games edited by Brandon Boyer, was added in November 2008. These sites were incorporated into Boing Boing itself around 2010. Plans to revive the Offworld site were announced in 2015, with Leigh Alexander as Editor-in-Chief and Laura Hudson as Editor. Leigh Alexander and Laura Hudson left Offworld in early 2016 after publishing a collection of selected articles, successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in March 2016. Boing Boing TV In October 2007, Boing Boing started a new component, Boing Boing TV, that consists of video segments including SPAMasterpiece Theater (2008) with John Hodgman, produced by its co-editors in conjunction with DECA, the Digital Entertainment Corporation of America. Art tech group monochrom was a frequent contributor. They created their sock puppet series Kiki and Bubu for Boing Boing TV.First episode of monochrom's Kiki and Bubu: \\"Kiki and Bubu and the Self\\", 2008 The episodes appear online, as well as on Virgin America flights. Censorship Boing Boing has been described as an \\"outspoken critic of censorship elsewhere\\", and operates a high speed, high quality Tor exit node,Torproject.org yet it has been accused of practicing forms of censorship itself. For example, the act of \\"disemvoweling\\" was popularized by the site‚Äîliterally stripping out the vowels of any comment a moderator had taken exception to. A more recent example of censorship is the truncation of the first and complete deletion of any subsequent posts making any reference to Cory Doctorow‚Äôs mysterious disappearance from the blog he helped create. =Violet Blue controversy= Sex blogger Violet Blue has been mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at Boing Boing. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, Tiny Nibbles, that all posts related to her had been deleted from Boing Boing, without explanation. The Los Angeles Times featured an interview that cast the silence on the part of Boing Boing on the matter as \\"inexplicable\\", causing a controversy as Boing Boing \\"has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness\\". A heated debate ensued after a brief statement on the Boing Boing site regarding this action stated: \\"Violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It's our blog and so we made an editorial decision, like we do every single day\\". In commentary attached to that blog entry, \\"many commenters surmised that they had something to do with Blue's suing to stop a porn star from also using the name Violet Blue\\", and many commenters found the removal troubling, but Xeni Jardin said that she hoped she would not have to make the reasons public. Boing Boing Shop Boing Boing features a shop section. Listings often run contrary to the theme of Boing Boing itself, and gather criticism from users.

By Thomas Willement, p.33 Sir John Scott (or Scot) (c. 1423 ‚Äì 17 October 1485) of Scot's Hall in Smeeth was a Kent landowner, and committed supporter of the House of York. Among other offices, he served as Comptroller of the Household to Edward IV, and lieutenant to the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Family John Scott was the son of William Scott (d. 1434) and Isabel Finch (died c. 1457), youngest daughter of Vincent Finch, or Herbert, of Netherfield, Sussex. Following his father's death, his mother Isabel married Sir Gervase Clifton as his first wife. He had a younger brother, William Scott (1428(?) ‚Äì 1491), who married a wife named Margery, by whom he had six sons and two daughters, and was founder of the Essex branch of the Scott family. He also had a sister, Joan Scot (d. 1507), who married firstly Thomas Yarde of Denton Court, Kent and secondly Sir Henry Grey of Heton. Joan's daughter, Anne Yarde married Thomas Heveningham of Suffolk. Career Scott was appointed to commissions in Kent from 1450 onwards, and with Sir John Fogge and Robert Horn expended in excess of ¬£333 in the suppression of Jack Cade's uprising in that year. By 1456 he was an esquire Henry VI. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in Kent in 1458, an office he held until his death, and was Sheriff of Kent in 1460. The 'turning point' in Scott's career, according to Fleming, 'came in June 1460, when, with Fogge and Horn, he gave support to the Yorkist earls that proved crucial to their success in Kent'. Within a year of the accession of Edward IV, Scott was rewarded with annuities, a knighthood, the office of tronage and pesage in the port of London, and appointments as joint Chirographer of the Common Pleas, deputy butler of Sandwich, lieutenant of Dover under Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, 'the Kingmaker', and Comptroller of the Household. In 1462, as a result of the attainders of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and Thomas, 9th Baron Ros of Helmsley (d.1464), he was granted custody of Oxford's lands, as well as the reversion of lands which were the jointure of Baron Ros's widow, Margery [sic?], including the castle and manor of Chilham and the manors of Wilderton and Molash. In 1463 he was granted the manors of Old Swinford and Snodsbury in Worcestershire, in the hands of the crown by the attainder of the Earl of Wiltshire, and was among those entrusted with supervision of all 'wardships, marriages, and ecclesiastical temporalities' which had fallen to the crown. In 1466 he purchased the marriage of Sir Edward Poynings, son and heir of Sir Robert Poynings (d.1461), and in the following year was granted custody of Sir Robert Poynings' lands in Kent. He also served as Chamberlain to Edward, Prince of Wales, and was a Member of Parliament for Kent in 1467. In September 1467 he assisted in negotiations for the marriage of Edward IV's sister, Margaret of York, to Charles the Bold, and accompanied Margaret to her wedding in Burgundy in the following year. In November 1467 he negotiated a commercial treaty with Burgundy at Brussels, and from May 1469 to February 1470 was involved in commercial negotiations with the Hanseatic League in Flanders. In April 1470 he was appointed lieutenant of the Cinque Ports, and by March 1472 was Marshal of Calais. In 1473 and 1474 he travelled to Burgundy, Utrecht and Bruges on diplomatic missions. It seems likely that he went into exile during the readeption, but returned to England to fight at the Battle of Barnet in April 1471, and assist in the suppression of Fauconberg's rebellion in May of that year. In February 1473 he and others were appointed tutors to Edward IV's son, the Prince of Wales. After Edward IV's death, he was loyal to Richard III, 'at least until the end of 1484'. Scott died 17 October 1485, and was buried, by his instructions, in the north wall of the chancel of St. Mary's church, Brabourne. He left a will dated 18 October 1485, proved 18 January 1486. His widow had died by 4 July 1487, and was also buried at St Mary's, Brabourne. She left a will dated 25 March 1487. An uncle, also one 'Sir John Scot of Scott's Hall', born at Brabourne, had been Lieutenant of Dover Castle from 1399 to his death in 1413. He had also served as Member of Parliament for Hythe in Kent from 1384. Marriage and issue Arms of Beaufitz: Argent, a saltire engrailed gules between four ravens proper Scott married Agnes Beaufitz (d.1486/7), daughter and co-heiress of William Beaufitz of The Grange, Gillingham, Kent, and likely also a fishmonger of London, by whom he had a son and two daughters: *Sir William Scott (d. 24 August 1524), who married Sibyl Lewknor. *Isabel or Elizabeth Scott (d. 15 August 1528), whom Sir John Scott married to his ward, Sir Edward Poynings. There is a memorial brass to her in St Mary's church, Brabourne. *Margaret Scott (d.1514), who married, as his second wife, Sir Edmund Bedingfield (1443‚Äì1496). From the 16th century onwards Thomas Rotherham, Archbishop of York, was also known by the alternate surname 'Scot', and it has been speculated that he was a younger son of Sir John Scott and Agnes Beaufitz.

He is a retired member of the United States House of Representatives where Watkins had represented for 14 years as a Democrat and then for six years as a Republican. Early life and career Watkins was born in De Queen, Arkansas but moved to Oklahoma as a boy. He graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1960, receiving a Master's degree from that same school in 1961. After a brief stint working for the United States Department of Agriculture, he worked as an administrator at his alma mater from 1963 to 1966. During that time, he was initiated into Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity as an honorary member while serving as their faculty advisor. In 1972, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. Later, he spent two years heading one of the first economic development districts in the country, based in Ada. Entry into politics Watkins became active in Democratic party politics in the early 1970s, and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in 1974. Two years later, U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert announced his retirement after 30 years representing the 3rd District. Based in the southeastern part of the state, an area known as Little Dixie, the 3rd was heavily Democratic in both local and national elections. Watkins faced a formidable opponent in Albert's popular longtime Chief of Staff and Administrative Assistant, Charles Ward. However, Watkins had closer local ties in the district, while Ward had spent decades in Washington. Watkins prevailed in the Democratic primary runoff and he then gained Albert's endorsement and won the general election with 82% of the vote. He was re-elected six more times, always by close to 80% of the vote. For most of this time, he served on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, allowing him to bring large amounts of money to his mostly rural and agricultural district. He was also very active in oil and natural gas issues, and took particularly strong interest in economic development issues for his rural district. Campaigns for Governor Watkins didn't seek an eighth term in 1990, instead running for the Democratic nomination for governor to succeed Republican Henry Bellmon. He raised $3 million for his campaign, the most ever raised for a gubernatorial bid in Oklahoma at the time. In the Democratic primary, he ran ahead of House Speaker Steve Lewis, yet lost to eventual winner David Walters, who had been the Democratic Gubernatorial nominee 4 years earlier in 1986. Watkins was openly disappointed in the lack of support from the state Democratic hierarchy. In 1994, Watkins ran for governor again, this time as an independent. He only won 23% of the vote. However, his independent candidacy siphoned off enough votes from Lieutenant Governor Jack Mildren, the Democratic candidate, to allow Frank Keating, a Reagan administration official, to become only the third Republican governor in Oklahoma history at that point. Watkins tallied over 233,000 votes, far more than Keating's 171,000-vote margin over Mildren. He dominated his former congressional district, winning many of the counties there by large margins. Return to Congress In 1996, Brewster decided to retire from Congress as it became known that Watkins wanted his seat back. The Republican House leadership persuaded Watkins to run as a Republican, seeing a chance to win a seat where they had never made a serious bid since Oklahoma joined the Union in 1907. They promised Watkins a seat on the Ways and Means Committee with full seniority if he ran as a Republican and won. No congressman had ever served on all three of the major financial committees (Appropriations, Budget and Ways and Means) before. Despite Albert endorsing Watkins' Democratic opponent, State Senator Darryl Roberts, Watkins won a narrow victory, becoming the first Republican to represent Little Dixie since statehood (it had previously been the 4th District from 1907 to 1915, and had been the 3rd since 1915). Watkins initially planned to retire from office in 1998 after undergoing back surgery, but was persuaded to run again. He was handily re-elected that year, defeating Walt Roberts. He faced no major-party opposition when he ran for his third term in 2000. Watkins' voting record in his first period in Congress had been characterized as somewhat moderate. During his second period, however, his voting record was strongly conservative, usually receiving ratings in the high 90s from the American Conservative Union. Retirement from Congress Oklahoma lost a congressional seat after the 2000 census due to slower than expected population growth. The final map saw Watkins' district dismantled, with its territory split between three nearby districts. His home in Stillwater (where he had lived since 1990) was drawn into the western Oklahoma-based 3rd district (the former 6th district), represented by fellow Republican Frank Lucas. Most of his old base in Little Dixie was merged into the Muskogee-based 2nd district. The western portion, including Watkins' former home in Ada, was drawn into the Norman- based 4th district. Faced with the prospect of running in territory that he did not know and that did not know him, Watkins announced he would retire for good. In an indication of how much his politics had changed since leaving the House for the first time, Watkins served as honorary chairman for conservative Senator Jim Inhofe's bid for a second full term.

The El Toro is quite small‚Äîapproximately 8 feet (2.44 ) long‚Äîand very simple to sail. Design and use The El Toro was designed to serve as both a racing dinghy and a tender for ferrying people and material to and from a larger yacht. The hull measures only long and at its widest point. The design features a thwart, or bench, provided for use when rowing. The available space for the sailor is smaller still, as the sailor usually sits on the deck in the area behind the thwart. With a characteristic snub-nosed bow and high sides, the El Toro design is a sharp contrast to the low-profile, more sleek design of the Laser or many other newer boats. However, the stability of the El Toro makes it ideal for teaching sailing. Many junior sailing programs use the El Toro to introduce new sailors to racing, as the boat is easier for the young or inexperienced to control. Lasers, and other similar boats, generally require a larger person and quick reactions to keep the boat under control in brisk winds. While the boat is often used by children and junior sailors, and many adults complain of the small space available for sitting in, the boat should not be considered a \\"youth only\\" boat. As the annual regatta season makes clear, there does exist a community of adults who continue to sail El Toros long past their early junior sailor days. Although it is possible to sail an El Toro in the Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay, the boats are most often used on more protected waters of the lakes and estuaries in the Northern California region. History The El Toro design is traced back to the Richmond Yacht Club in San Francisco Bay Area around 1940. This is one of many boats derived from the MacGregor Sabot design, which was published in Rudder magazine in 1939. The El Toro features a decked-over bow, which distinguishes it from the Naples Sabot, which is the predominant Sabot-style dinghy in Southern California. With the decked over bow, the El Toro is able to handle the rougher waters of the San Francisco Bay. The El Toro name and the shovel sail insignia are attributed to being named after the 'bull sessions' which gave rise to the boat and the program. The original El Toros were made of wood, with newer materials approved for use in the 1970s. The 1970s also saw the introduction of the self-rescuing El Toro, which includes air tanks that prevent a capsized El Toro from completely submerging. The First El Toro was built in Berkeley, in a night school shop where Ernest (Bud) Coxhead taught boat building. Coxhead, Hal Decker and Bill Warren were instrumental in selecting the design for the Richmond Yacht Club, which wanted a small boat for use as a yacht tender and sailing dinghy. The trio drafted the El Toro design by copying and modifying plans published in Rudder Magazine for the MacGregor Sabot, an eight-foot pram. The Richmond Yacht Club's 40 members, who had been debating possible designs at regular meetings, adopted the plan and named the boat after these bull sessions. According to the El Toro International Yacht Racing Association, there were over 11,000 El Toros in the class in 2002. Racing Throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area, there is a year-round series of regattas in the El Toro class. The Bullship Race has been running since 1953 and represents one of the most harrowing El Toro regattas in the racing schedule. The skippers carry their boats through the Sausalito Yacht Club entering the water off the SYC dock. The SYC Auxiliary provides the skippers with a Continental Breakfast before the race. The course starts in Sausalitoin front of Ondine Restaurant, crosses the bay between Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge and ends at the St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. The original name for the race was the Ano Del Gran Concurso Barco Toro, which translates roughly into \\"Golden Gate Bullship Race\\". There is a similar Bullship Race in Kaneohe, Hawaii that leaves from Kaneohe Yacht Club rounds coconut island and returns to the yacht club. BULLSHIP RACE HISTORY The first Bullship Race was April, 1954. Charles O‚ÄôGara and Lynn Pera set out to prove the merits of sailing to Barnaby Conrad, author and bullfighting expert, by racing from Ondines in Sausalito to the St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. O‚ÄôGara lost the race (and by tradition has been the last skipper ever since) but Conrad was convinced that the El Toro class was worthy of a trophy to perpetuate the event. The trophy was the tail of a bull awarded each year to a last place sailor. In 1956 the Monterey Herald donated a perpetual trophy for feminine skippers and in 1958 George Guatekunst gave the Ondine Perpetual trophy for Maiden Voyagers only. In 2006, two new trophies have been designated by the committee; the Robert Cresswell Woody Award for the first wooden boat finishing, and the Clydesdale Award, for the first finisher who weighs over 200 pounds. The legendary Tempest Storm has served as honorary meteorologist since the early years. Traditionally, the race is held on the Saturday after Easter to take advantage of favorable tides. After 134 El Toros raced in 1962, a limit was set at 100 entries per race. The skippers carry their boats through the Sausalito Yacht Club and put them in the water off the SYC dock. The race starts and 9 am. A continental breakfast is always provided to the racers by the SYC Auxiliary starting at 7:30 am. Narrasketuck Yacht Club, located in Amityville, New York, holds an annual frostbite series for El Toros. The series kicks off with the Bullshot Regatta, held on New Year's Day.Narrasketuck Yacht Club External links *Official Class Website *El Toro Rigging Diagram (PDF) *El Toro Rigging Instructions (PDF) *Building a wooden El Toro  References Dinghies ","title":"El Toro (dinghy)"},{"id":"984242","text":"Arthur Boyars (28 May 1925 - 6 August 2017)Arthur Boyars, gifted poet and publisher with a passion for music was a British poet and musicologist, who was also a translator and critic, literary editor and publisher.

It is in the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountains. An observation tower opened on top of Sassafras Mountain in 2019. Location It is located along the South Carolina - North Carolina border in northern Pickens County, South Carolina nearest to the town of Rosman, North Carolina. From I-85 Exit 21 in South Carolina, one can reach Sassafras Mountain by driving north on US-178 until reaching the unincorporated community of Rocky Bottom. From there, take F. Van Clayton Highway (a local road) about to the parking lot at the top. From Rosman, follow US-178 south. The summit is an easy 300 foot walk from the parking lot and is, by merit of not having stairs, handicapped accessible, although the path is fairly steep. The North Carolina side of the mountain was owned by former Congressman Charles H. Taylor. In June 2010 he sold to The Conservation Fund. The Fund has donated , at the top of the mountain, to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and conveyed a remaining to the North Carolina Forest Service for Headwaters State Forest. The Pisgah Quadrangle topographical map, revised 1904‚Äì1905, shows the long abandoned Sassafras Gap Road to be the preferred route through to Rosman, N.C. and Brevard, N.C. at the end of the 19th Century and that the existing Highway 178 was then a secondary road. This abandoned road is a short distance from the summit and is crossed by the hiking trail to Caesars Head from Sassafras summit. Most people crossing this old roadbed in Sassafras Gap don't recognize it as a road, but it is easily recognized because of the short section of steps going down into the roadbed, and a similar section of short steps on the opposite side of the roadbed going up and the trail then continuing steeply up toward Caesars Head. A short hike South down the old Sassafras Gap Road will take you to Hickory Head Spring, the headwater of the South Saluda River.

Found worldwide, the family includes about 300 species contained in four or five genera.Jameson, Mary Liz (2002): \\"Trogidae\\", in Ross H. Arnett, Jr. and Michael C. Thomas, American Beetles (CRC Press, 2002), vol. 2 Trogids range in length from 2.5 to 20.0 mm. Their shape is oblong to oval, with a generally flat abdomen. Their color ranges from brown to gray or black, and they often encrust their bodies with soil. They resemble scarab beetles with heavy limbs and spurs. They are scavengers and are among the last species to visit and feed on carrion. They are most often found on the dry remains of dead animals. Both adults and larvae eat feathers, fur, and skin. Some species are found in bird and mammal nests. Details of the life histories of many species are poorly known, since many are specialized to particular types of nests. They are often overlooked by predators and collectors due to their behaviors of covering their bodies with soil and becoming motionless when disturbed. This group may also be considered Troginae, a subfamily of the Scarabaeidae. The common name \\"skin beetle\\" is sometimes used in reference to these beetles, but more often refers to species of the Dermestidae. Origins Hide beetles are found worldwide. More species of Trogidae are found in dry environments instead of moist environments, typically temperate plains areas. Each genus is more diverse in different regions of the world. Trox is found in the Holarctic/Ethiopian area, Omorgus within the southern continents, and Polynoncus is found in South America.Deloya, C. (2005): Omorgus rodriguezae especie nueva de M√©xico y clave para separar las especies del g√©nero para centro y norteam√©rica (Coleoptera: Trogidae) . Folia Entomol. Mex 44: 121-129. PDF Controversy exists over whether Trogidae is a family of its own or a subfamily of Scarabaeidae. One major reason for the dispute between classifications is the possible evolution of the ommatidium in the eyes. Different environmental pressures and predators may have led to the adaptation of ommatidium structures within this family. For example, the more advanced and numerous the ommatidium, the more present the larger the ability of the insect to escape and elude predators. The Trogidae may have evolved in Australia.LAWRENCE, J. F. and E. B. BRITTON. 1991. Coleoptera. The Insects of Australia, 2nd edition, Volume 1, pp. 543-683. Melbourne University Press, Carlton. The oldest known fossils are from the Aptian Zaza Formation of Russia and the Shar-Tolgoy and Dzun-Bain Formations of Mongolia, assignable to the extant genus Trox as well as the extinct genera Cretomorgus and Paratrox. Other known fossils include Kresnikus beynoni found in Cenomanian aged Burmese amber. Anatomy Trogidae are characterized by their distinct soil-encrusted, warty, or bumpy appearance. They are usually brown, gray, or black in color and are covered with short, dense setae. Their body shape is oblong to oval with a flat abdomen and their length varies from 2 to 20 mm. The antenna of hide beetles are usually short and clubbed.Watson, L. and Dallwitz, M. J.. 2003 onwards. British Insects: the Families of Coleoptera: Trogidae Version: 9 April 2007. http://delta- intkey.com The hardened elytra of Trogidae, which are generally covered with small knobs giving the beetle their rough appearance, meet along the midline of the body and cover the entire abdomen and well-developed wings. Their heads are bent down and covered by the pronotum.Carcass Beetles CSIRO Entomology They also have heavy limbs and spurs resembling those of scarab beetles. Trogidae larvae are a creamy yellow/white in color, except at their caudal end which darkens as it accumulates feces. Their heads are dark and heavily sclerotized. The abdominal segments of hide beetles have at least one or more transverse rows of setae. Diet and habitat Predators rarely attack species of Trogidae. They avoid detection and predation due to their soil covering and motionless behavior. Birds prey upon hide beetles that have invaded the bird nests.Jameson, Mary Liz. Guide to New World Scarab Beetles - Trogidae UNL State Museum - Division of Entomology Species of Trogidae often feed on decomposing carcasses. In one lab experiment done in 1998 by the Department of Zoology at the University of Melbourne, the hide beetles ate all tissues on a sheep carcass and left the bones. Along with carrion, hide beetles are found within the pellet of many animal species, on other decaying dry matter, and around birds‚Äô and mammals‚Äô nests and feathers, as well as aging bones. Mating habits and lifecycle Little is known about the lifecycle of the Trogidae specifically. Their lifecycles are very similar to the other genera of Scarabaeoidea (i.e. Passalidae and Lucanidae). After impregnation of the female by the male, the female lays the eggs and the larvae hatch after an unknown amount of time. During decomposition of a carcass, the beetles leave their nests to feed on the carrion. As the last succession of insects to appear on the carcass, both larvae and adults can be found feeding on the dry remains. At the site of the carcass, an impregnated female digs small, vertical columns underneath the carcass to lay her eggs, allowing the larvae to locate food after hatching. Trogidae usually have three to five instars. Forensic importance The use of Trogidae in forensic entomology is unknown at this time. Though they typically arrive last in the order of succession, they can be the first in succession on burned and charred bodies. After the burned skin is eaten away by the trogids, the corpse (with now-exposed, \\"fresher\\" surfaces) allows for viable colonization by other forensically important insects that help determine accurate post mortem interval estimates.Trogidae Australian Biological Resources Study, Department of the Environment and Heritage Various species of Trogidae have been used by museums to clean up skeletons by eating any remaining dried material left on the skeletons, leaving them clean for display. This method of bone-stripping has been used by some museums for many years, as it is the most effective method.Reid, Craig. Bones Stripped Bare.

Life Sir Simon Burley was one of the most influential men in the court of King Richard II of England. Although of humble origin, he was brought up with Edward, the Black Prince; they became intimate friends, and Burley was raised to become a tutor to the prince's son, later Richard II. He first served in the fleet which destroyed the Spanish corsairs in 1350. In 1355, he took part in Edward's abortive expedition from Calais, and in 1364 he appears in attendance on the Black Prince in Aquitaine. By him he was sent on the embassy to Peter of Castile in 1366, and shared in his restoration and the victory of Najara in 1367. On the war being renewed in 1369, he was attacked near Lusignan, when with a detached force, and made prisoner by the French. On the release of the Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon he was exchanged (1370) and rejoined the Black Prince at Limoges. In 1377, Richard II confirmed an annual grant of ¬£100 to Burley granted to him first by Sir John Chandos and then by Edward III along with the custody of Carmarthen castle, in terms referring to him as \\"the King's father's Knight\\". In the same year, Burley was given the office of Master of the Falcon and Keeper of the Mews near Charring, and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle for life. The following year, the King further granted Burley the manor of Chiltenham in Gloucester and the 'fee simple' of the castle and lordship of Llanstephan. In 1382, Richard granted him the office of under-chamberlain of the King's household for life, and appointed him surveyor of the lands in South Wales in the King's hands during the minority of the heir of Edmund Mortimer. In 1384, the King granted him for life the constableship of Dover Castle and the wardenship of the Cinque Ports, and three hundred pounds yearly (for the maintenance of himself, chaplains, etc.) with provision that he exercise the office himself. His long connection with the family of Richard II is indicated by his being named by Joan of Kent, King Richard's mother, as one of the executors of her will in 1385. In 1388 Burley, along with other favourites of the King, was impeached for treason by the commons and executed in the Merciless Parliament of 1388. = Role in 1381 Peasants' Revolt = In some histories, Sir Simon Burley figures as the trigger for the explosion of the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381 in the county of Kent. In the story related by the Anonimalle Chronicle, Simon Burley appeared in Gravesend with two sergeants on June 3, 1381, and laid claim that one of its residents, a certain Robert Belling (or Bellyng), was his runaway bondsman. When the townsfolk of Gravesend pleaded with Burley on the man's behalf, Burley demanded ¬£300 in silver for manumission. It was an enormous sum that Belling could not afford nor his Gravesend supporters raise for his release, so Burley ordered the royal sergeants to arrest Belling and confine him to nearby Rochester Castle until the money was raised. This incident hit a nerve in the region, long tired of corruption and abuses by royal officials, and led directly to a riot in Dartford (just seven miles from Gravesend) the next day. An armed band was raised that would go on to attack Rochester Castle on June 6 and spring Robert Belling out of jail. Wat Tyler would be elected leader of this Kentish rebel band a few days later. There are a few problems with the Anonimalle story. Firstly, Simon Burley was abroad at the time, negotiating the king's marriage with Anne of Bohemia, and so could not have appeared at Gravesend in person. Secondly, uniquely among English counties, villein service was not practiced in Kent at the time. Nonetheless, the release of Robert Belling from Rochester is well-attested in other sources.

History  The UGT was founded 12 August 1888 by Pablo Iglesias Posse in Matar√≥ (Barcelona), with Marxist socialism as its ideological basis, despite its statutory apolitical status. Until its nineteenth Congress in 1920, it did not consider class struggle as a basic principle of trade union action. Being a member of the UGT implies an affiliation to the PSOE and vice versa. During World War I era, the UGT followed a tactical line of close relationship and unity of action with the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, National Labour Confederation). The UGT grew rapidly after 1917, and by 1920 had 200,000 members.Casanova, Juli√°n. 'Terror and Violence: The Dark Face of Spanish Anarchism' in International Labour and Working-Class History, 67 (Spring 2005), pp. 79-99. p. 88. This era came to a sudden end with the advent of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, who gave a legal monopoly on labor organizing to his own government- sponsored union. While the CNT opted for a radical confrontation with the regime and were prohibited on this account, the UGT, although in disagreement with the dictatorship, adopted a collaborative attitude in order to continue to operate legally. The UGT grew from 277,011 in December 1930, to 958,451 in December 1931, to 1,041,539 in June 1932. Much of this growth occurred in its land workers' federation, the Federaci√≥n Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra (FNTT), which grew from 36,639 in June 1930 to 392,953 in June 1932, raising the proportion of land workers in the UGT from 13 percent to 37 percent.Preston, Paul. The Coming of the Spanish Civil War: Reform, Reaction and Revolution in the Spanish Second Republic. Routledge. New York. 1994. p. 78. The influx of these workers (jornaleros) caused the union's radicalisation, and the bloody breakout of the Spanish Civil War deepened the internal fissures that resulted in the departure of Largo Caballero from the position of UGT secretary general in 1937. General Francisco Franco confined the UGT to exile and clandestinity after his victory in the Spanish Civil War until his death in 1975. The Union emerged from secrecy during the democratic transition after Franco's death, as did the communist Workers' Commissions (Comisiones Obreras, CCOO). The UGT and CCOO, between them, constitute the major avenues for workers' representation in today's Spain, with the anarcho- syndicalist Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo (CGT) a distant third.  Objectives  The UGT declares itself to be an institution of productive workers, organized along lines of trades and liberal professions, which respects freedom of thought, leading toward the transformation of the society, in order to establish it on the basis of social justice, equality and solidarity.

It was formerly designated as Metroad 3. The A3 runs from its intersection with the A8 at Mona Vale at the north end, to the southerly of its two intersections with A1, the Princes Highway, at Blakehurst the south end. The highest speed limit on the (A3) is on Mona Vale Road. It is a major connector between most of the major radial routes emanating from central Sydney, and a major link between the northern and southern parts of the Sydney tolled orbital freeway. It is the most direct, although not necessarily the quickest, route across Sydney between the South Coast and the North Coast. Most of the route has been progressively upgraded to three lanes in each direction (although the kerbside lanes are often blocked by parking). Sections which are only two lanes in each direction remain, between Beverley Hills and South Hurstville, along Homebush Bay Drive, and between St Ives and Terry Hills. Between Mona Vale and Terry Hills, most of the eastern section of Mona Vale Road is only 1 lane in each direction. Much of the route becomes very congested in peak hour. The name \\"A3\\" is the route allocation for the route as a whole, not a road name. The A3 route runs along a whole series of differently named roads. From north to south they are: * Mona Vale Road * Ryde Road * Lane Cove Road * Devlin Street * Church Street * Concord Road * Homebush Bay Drive * Centenary Drive * Roberts Road * Wiley Avenue * King Georges Road A3 (King Georges Road) in Beverly Hills History What is now called A3 was initially designated to become a major north-south metropolitan arterial route in 1964, when the route incorporating several existing local arterial roads was designated as 'Ring Road 3'. It was subsequently re-designated 'State Route 33' between 1974 and 1993, and then re-designated 'Metroad 3' after April 1993. It is the only one of Sydney's 'Metroad' routes that has not changed alignment since the Metroad system was adopted in 1993, although there were changes to the route prior to that. In August 2013, as part of the alphanumeric route scheme, Metroad 3 was decommissioned and was designated A3. After 1964, upgrading projects were commenced, with the construction of new De Burghs Bridges over the Lane Cove River between Pymble and Ryde (1967), and the duplication of Ryde Bridge over the Parramatta River between Ryde and Rhodes (1988). Many projects have been undertaken over the ensuing decades to widen most of the route in stages to three lanes each way, although no proper freeway sections have ever been constructed. Grade-separated crossings have been constructed where A3 crosses other major roads: at the Pacific Highway at Pymble (grade separation completed in 1989), M2 Hills Motorway at Macquarie Park (1997), Epping Road at North Ryde (1978), at Victoria Road at Top Ryde (1998), at the intersection with Australia Avenue and Underwood Road, at Homebush (1998), at the M4 Western Motorway and Parramatta Road, at Flemington (1992), the Hume Highway at Chullora (1998), and the M5 South Western Motorway at Beverly Hills (2001). A major deviation of part of the route was built, relocating the arterial route to the west between Rhodes and Wiley Park, to bypass the Strathfield bottleneck and improve access to the Olympic Precinct at Homebush Bay. The deviated route includes Homebush Bay Drive, Centenary Drive, and an upgraded Roberts Road though Chullora and Greenacre, connecting to King Georges Road near Wiley Park. The road upgrades, new bridges and connections for this deviation were completed in stages between 1983 and 1998. This replaced the original route along Concord Road, Coronation Parade, and Punchbowl Road, which passed through a very congested section at Strathfield and was also problematical to widen. The original route was subsequently given the route allocation State Route 27 which was decommissioned in 2004.

It contains Maymont Mansion, now a historic house museum, an arboretum, formal gardens, a carriage collection, native wildlife exhibits, a nature center, and Children's Farm. In 1893, James H. Dooley, a wealthy Richmond lawyer and philanthropist, and his wife, Sallie, completed their elaborate Gilded Age estate on a site high above the James River. According to their wishes, after their deaths Maymont was left to the people of Richmond. Over the next 75 years, additional attractions were added. History Maymont was named for Major Dooley's wife, Sallie May. Construction of the mansion completed in 1893. The Dooleys also built a summer home on Afton Mountain, Swannanoa, which was completed in 1913. In 2011, Maymont was named one of the top 10 public spaces by the American Planning Association. Gardens The Japanese Garden. The Japanese Garden at Maymont is well tended and features a koi pond and a large waterfall. The Japanese Garden also has a torii arch, rock gardens, and various red maples. It is a blend of two different time periods and a mixture of many styles of gardens. In 1911, a section of the Kanawha Canal was bought to be a part of the garden. Some say they hired a master Japanese gardener by the name of Muto, who had designed other gardens along the East Coast. Years following Mrs. Dooley's passing, the Japanese garden increasingly lost its magnificence and design. The garden still has its stonework and winding watercourse that leads to its large pond. After realizing the decline of the quality of the garden, Earth Design renovated it in 1978. The new design of the Japanese is considered a \\"stroll garden\\" which offers guests at Maymont to see how the changing impact of nature has on the grounds. Created by Noland and Baskervill of Richmond, The Italian Garden features a pergola, fountains, urns and roses. The creators of the garden modeled their design after the 15th and 16th century Italian classical style. The garden is laid out on many levels, facing the south which once over looked the James River. The design of the Cascade and the Fountain Court is patterned like the Villa Torlonia near Rome. The Italian Garden was completed in 1910, when the Petersburg granite stonework was laid down.2017-08-18 1536 Arbor at Maymont's Italian garden, 2006 The arboretum contains more than 200 species of trees and woody plants. It includes a number of \\"exotic champions\\" including a Cedrus atlantica, Cryptomeria japonica, Parrotia persica, and Tilia europea. It's said that this collection of exotic and native species of trees was not just used for beauty, but also for scientific purposes. The Dooley's were of sophisticated people and their tree choice only adds on to that description. Some examples of exotic flora that are on grounds include the False Larch and Pseudolarix kaempferia from Japan; the White Enkianthus and the Enkianthis perulatas from China; and the Persian Ironwood. A characteristic of all these trees is the fact that they were planted for optimal growth. This is credited to the same landscaper who helped with the design of the Italian garden, Henry E. Baskervill. Credit goes to the Dooleys as well, who had the final say on the estates design. Maymont's gardens are popular for outdoor weddings focused around the Italian Garden, the Japanese Garden and numerous gazebos located throughout the grounds. There are ten specialty gardens as well. There is the \\"Marie's Butterfly Garden\\" that was finished in 2009. It starts east of the Children's Farm and goes along the horse and cow pastures, down to the Bobcat habitat. Examples of flowers include yarrow, butterfly weed, cone flowers, butterfly bushes, sunflowers, blue spirea and herbs. There is an Herb Garden on grounds as well. This was donated by the Richmond Council of Garden Clubs in 1957. It has been maintained by the Old Dominion Herb Society since 1978. There is even an \\"Herbs Galor\\" festival that this garden is a centerpiece for. The herbs are grown for culinary, medicinal potpourri uses. Fauna In addition to the farm animals that it keeps in the Children's Farm, Maymont is the permanent home of several animals that are native to the Commonwealth. Many of these have been injured and are otherwise unable to live in the wild. These animals include bald eagles, a bobcat, black bears and foxes. Visitors are also able to see white-tailed deer, elk, and American bison. A nature center is also on the grounds, which exhibits many aquatic animals found in and around Virginia such as otters, alligators, and sharks. Throughout the park, Canada geese, American snapping turtles, numerous species of snakes, and American bullfrogs can be found wild. Image:maymont033.jpg A view from Maymont.

He was the younger son of another Sir Roger de Leybourne, by his 1st wife, Eleanor, the daughter and heir of Stephen of Thornham. In 1199 when the elder Roger was still a minor his wardship was sold to Thornham for 300 marks. The elder Roger then joined the rebels at the start of the First Barons' War in 1215, being captured in November at the siege of Rochester Castle, paying 250 marks for his release. After the death of the elder Roger some time before 1251 his son William de Leybourne inherited seven Knight's fees in Kent and Oxfordshire, as well as substantial debts, which were only cancelled in 1253 by Henry III. Roger first came to royal notice in 1252 when he killed Arnulf de Munteny, one of the king's household knights, in a jousting tournament with a sharpened lance, avenging himself of an injury caused by Arnulf in a previous tournament. To atone for his crime he \\"took the cross\\" (went on a Pilgrimage), and was pardoned by King Henry III.14 October 1252 ‚Äì Grant to Roger de Leyburn of the king's peace, and protection for him, his men, lands and possessions; and mandate to all not to molest him on account of the death of Arnulf de Munteny, lately killed by accident at a round table, because the king has quit-claimed him in respect of that death. (C.P.R., Henry III, vol. 4, p. 154.) In 1253 he was given the lands of Roger Connell in Kent, and from then until his death he spent large amounts of time and money acquiring land in that county. In 1257 he served in the army of Lord Edward as part of his campaign in Wales, and became part of an influential group of his supporters. He joined Edward in autumn 1259 when he allied with Simon de Montfort, and was made custodian of Bristol Castle in November. He was part of Edward's retinue in 1260 when he and the Earl of Gloucester attempted to take London, and was one of those pardoned when Edward patched up his relationship with Henry III. In thanks for this service Edward gave him the manor of Elham in Kent, but in 1262 the grant was deemed to be in violation of the conditions of Henry giving the manor to Edward in the first place, and the manor was returned, with the High Sheriff of Kent being ordered to take ¬£1,820 from Leybourne's lands; Leybourne frustrated him by simply removing all the goods from his lands in Kent, Essex and Sussex. In 1263 he along with other Marcher Lords arrested Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford, and seized Hereford, Gloucester, and Bristol, returning south to assault Windsor Castle. They were joined by Simon de Montfort, beginning the Second Barons' War. They marched into Kent, attacking the Cinque Ports. By August 1263 the Marcher Lords were in negotiations with Edward, having been unnerved by de Montford's plan to ally with the Welsh, and they swore an oath to the king on the 18th. From this point onwards Leybourne was a loyal servant of the king, and swiftly returned to royal favour. In September he was made Steward of the King's Household, Keeper of Kent, Surrey and Sussex, and in December was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and made High Sheriff of Kent. In October 1263 he was one of those who sealed the agreement between Henry and Louis IX, and travelled with the king to France at the end of the year. During the second half of the conflict with de Montfort, Leybourne fought at the Battle of Northampton and as a defender at the siege of Rochester Castle, where he was badly wounded. He fought at the Battle of Lewes with the other marcher lords, who were allowed to go free after their defeat on the condition that they return to stand trial at the next Parliament. When they failed to do so, de Montfort sent a military expedition which failed to defeat them. So they remained a thorn in the side of de Montfort throughout the rest of the war. In December 1264 he was given a safe conduct to visit the king, and then in May 1265 he spoke with Edward, helping organise his escape from Kenilworth Castle on 28 May. Leybourne subsequently fought at the Battle of Evesham, reportedly saving the king's life, and for the two years of conflict after Evesham served as Edward's principal lieutenant. In August 1265 he was made keeper of Westmorland, in October he was given custody of Carlisle Castle, made High Sheriff of Cumberland and trusted with subduing London on behalf of the king. In November he fought the rebels in Kent, and in January 1266 he recaptured Sandwich, serving as Edward's deputy for the capture of the other Cinque Ports. Along with Edward he besieged and captured Winchelsea, fighting off rebels across the Thames in May. He was knighted in September, with the king ordering that he should be received everywhere 'with due honour as the king's knight'. He was also a member of the king's council, and appointed custodian of Nottingham Castle. During this period he was rewarded by the king with large amounts of land, including the village of Leeds, Kent, where he later built a castle, and areas of Kent, Cumberland and Westmorland. He went on a second pilgrimage in 1269, and was rewarded with 1000 marks from Ottobuono, the papal legate, who later became Pope Adrian V. Rather than going to the Holy Land he travelled to Gascony, where he had been appointed Lieutenant on 29 November 1269, with his aim possibly being to raise men for the crusade. He stayed for long enough to have the city of Libourne named after him, but returned home in December 1270, dying before 7 November 1271. References Sources * L.B.

A domain is a concept introduced in Windows NT whereby a user may be granted access to a number of computer resources with the use of a single username and password combination.  History  With Windows NT 4 Server, one domain controller per domain was configured as the primary domain controller (PDC); all other domain controllers were backup domain controllers (BDC). Because of the critical nature of the PDC, best practices dictated that the PDC should be dedicated solely to domain services, and not used for file, print or application services that could slow down or crash the system. Some network administrators took the additional step of having a dedicated BDC online for the express purpose of being available for promotion if the PDC failed. A BDC could authenticate the users in a domain, but all updates to the domain (new users, changed passwords, group membership, etc.) could only be made via the PDC, which would then propagate these changes to all BDCs in the domain. If the PDC was unavailable (or unable to communicate with the user requesting the change), the update would fail. If the PDC was permanently unavailable (e.g. if the machine failed), an existing BDC could be promoted to be a PDC. Windows 2000 and later versions introduced Active Directory (\\"AD\\"), which largely eliminated the concept of PDC and BDC in favor of multi-master replication. However, there are still several roles that only one domain controller can perform, called the Flexible single master operation roles. Some of these roles must be filled by one DC per domain, while others only require one DC per AD forest. If the server performing one of these roles is lost, the domain can still function, and if the server will not be available again, an administrator can designate an alternate DC to assume the role in a process known as \\"seizing\\" the role. Primary domain controller In Windows NT 4, one DC serves as the primary domain controller (PDC). Others, if they exist, are usually a backup domain controller (BDC). The PDC is typically designated as the \\"first\\". The \\"User Manager for Domains\\" is a utility for maintaining user/group information. It uses the domain security database on the primary controller. The PDC has the master copy of the user accounts database which it can access and modify. The BDC computers have a copy of this database, but these copies are read-only. The PDC will replicate its account database to the BDCs on a regular basis. The BDCs exist in order to provide a backup to the PDC, and can also be used to authenticate users logging on to the network. If a PDC should fail, one of the BDCs can then be promoted to take its place. The PDC will usually be the first domain controller that was created unless it was replaced by a promoted BDC. =PDC emulation (Primary Domain Controller)= In modern releases of Windows, domains have been supplemented by the use of Active Directory services. In Active Directory domains, the concept of primary and secondary domain controller relationships no longer applies. PDC emulators hold the accounts databases and administrative tools. As a result, a heavy workload can slow the system down. The DNS service may be installed on a secondary emulator machine to relieve the workload on the PDC emulator. The same rules apply; only one PDC may exist on a domain, but multiple replication servers may still be used. * The PDC emulator master acts in place of the PDC if there are Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers (BDCs) remaining within the domain, acting as a source for them to replicate from. * The PDC emulator master receives preferential replication of password changes within the domain. As password changes take time to replicate across all the domain controllers in an Active Directory domain, the PDC emulator master receives notification of password changes immediately, and if a logon attempt fails at another domain controller, that domain controller will forward the logon request to the PDC emulator master before rejecting it. * The PDC emulator master also serves as the machine to which all domain controllers in the domain will synchronise their clocks. It, in turn, should be configured to synchronise to an external NTP time source. =Samba= Primary Domain Controllers (PDC) have been faithfully recreated on the Samba emulation of Microsoft's SMB client/server system. Samba has the capability to emulate an NT 4.0 domain, as well as modern Active Directory Domain Services on a Linux machine. Backup domain controller In Windows NT 4 domains, the backup domain controller (BDC) is a computer that has a copy of the user accounts database. Unlike the accounts database on the PDC, the BDC database is a read-only copy. When changes are made to the master accounts database on the PDC, the PDC pushes the updates down to the BDCs. These additional domain controllers exist to provide fault tolerance. If the PDC fails, then it can be replaced by a BDC. In such circumstances, an administrator promotes a BDC to be the new PDC. BDCs can also authenticate user logon requests and take some of the authentication load from the PDC. When Windows 2000 was released, the NT domain as found in NT 4 and prior versions was replaced by Active Directory. In Active Directory domains running in native mode, the concept of the PDC and BDC do not exist. In these domains, all domain controllers are considered equals. A side effect of this change is the loss of ability to create a \\"read-only\\" domain controller. Windows Server 2008 reintroduced this capability. Nomenclature Windows Server can be one of three kinds: Active Directory \\"domain controllers\\" (ones that provide identity and authentication), Active Directory \\"member servers\\" (ones that provide complementary services such as file repositories and schema) and Windows Workgroup \\"stand-alone servers\\". The term \\"Active Directory Server\\" is sometimes used by Microsoft as synonymous to \\"Domain Controller\\" but the term is discouraged.Comment officially marked as \\"answer\\" by Microsoft-employed forum moderator \\"Arthur_Li\\".

It belongs to the category V (Protected Landscape) in the IUCN system of protected area categorization. The Jiuzhaigou valley is part of the Min Mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and stretches over . It is known for its many multi-level waterfalls, colorful lakes, and snow-capped peaks. Its elevation ranges from . History Jiuzhaigou (literally \\"Nine Settlement Valley\\") takes its name from the nine Tibetan settlements along its length. The remote region was inhabited by various Tibetan and Qiang peoples for centuries. Until 1975 this inaccessible area was little known. Extensive logging took place until 1979, when the Chinese government banned such activity and made the area a national park in 1982. An Administration Bureau was established and the site officially opened to tourism in 1984; layout of facilities and regulations were completed in 1987. The site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1992 and a World Biosphere Reserve in 1997. The tourism area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. Since opening, tourist activity has increased every year: from 5,000 in 1984 to 170,000 in 1991, 160,000 in 1995, to 200,000 in 1997, including about 3,000 foreigners. Visitors numbered 1,190,000 in 2002. , the site averages 7,000 visits per day, with a quota of 12,000 being reportedly enforced during high season. The Town of Zhangzha at the exit of the valley and the nearby Songpan County feature an ever-increasing number of hotels, including several luxury five-stars, such as Sheraton. Developments related to mass tourism in the region have caused concerns about the impact on the environment around the park. 1 jiuzhaigou valley reed lake 2011.JPG|Reed Lake is a reed-covered marsh with a clear turquoise brook zigzagging through it Mirror Lake Jiuzhaigou.jpg|Mirror Lake Jiuzhaigou Waterfall.jpg|Jiuzhaigou Waterfall Population 7 of the 9 Tibetan villages are still populated today.

In 2003, the permanent population of the valley was about 1,000 comprising 112 families, and due to the protected nature of the park, agriculture is no longer permitted so the locals now rely on tourism and local government subsidies to make a living. Panorama of Shuzheng Village, the busiest Tibetan village in the valley Geography and climate Five Flower Lake has a bottom that is criss-crossed by ancient fallen tree trunks Map of Jiuzhaigou Jiuzhaigou lies at the southern end of the Minshan mountain range, north of the provincial capital of Chengdu. It is part of the Jiuzhaigou County (formerly Nanping County) in the Aba Tibetan Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of northwestern Sichuan province, near the Gansu border. The valley covers , with buffer zones covering an additional . Its elevation, depending on the area considered, ranges from 1,998 to 2,140 m (at the mouth of Shuzheng Gully) to 4,558-4,764 m (on Mount Ganzigonggai at the top of Zechawa Gully). The climate is subtropical to temperate monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 7.8 ¬∞C, with means of ‚àí3.7 ¬∞C in January and 16.8 ¬∞C in July. Total annual rainfall is 761 mm but in the cloud forest it is at least 1,000 mm. 80% of rainfall occurs between May and October. Ecology Rhinoceros Lake, one of the Nuorilang lakes, and the second largest in the valley Jiuzhaigou's ecosystem is classified as temperate broad-leaf forest and woodlands, with mixed mountain and highland systems. Nearly of the core scenic area are covered by virgin mixed forests. Those forests take on attractive (vibrant) yellow, orange and red hues in the autumn, making that season a popular one for visitors. They are home to a number of plant species of interest, such as endemic varieties of rhododendron and bamboo. Local fauna includes the endangered giant panda and golden snub-nosed monkey. Both populations are very small (fewer than 20 individuals for the pandas) and isolated. Their survival is in question in a valley subject to increasing tourism. It is one of only three known locations for the threatened Duke of Bedford's vole. Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is considered to be vulnerable. Jiuzhaigou is also home to approximately 140 bird species. Geology and hydrology Jiuzhaigou's landscape is made up of high-altitude karsts shaped by glacial, hydrological and tectonic activity. It lies on major faults on the diverging belt between the Qinghai-Tibet Plate and the Yangtze Plate, and earthquakes have also shaped the landscape. The rock strata are mostly made up of carbonate rocks such dolomite and tufa, as well as some sandstone and shales. The valley includes the catchment area of three gullies (which due to their large size are often called valleys themselves), and is one of the sources of the Jialing River via the Bailong River, part of the Yangtze River system. Jiuzhaigou's best-known feature is its dozens of blue, green and turquoise- colored lakes. The local Tibetan people call them Haizi in Chinese, meaning \\"son of the sea\\". Originating in glacial activity, they were dammed by rockfalls and other natural phenomena, then solidified by processes of carbonate deposition. Some lakes have a high concentration of calcium carbonate, and their water is very clear so that the bottom is often visible even at high depths. The lakes vary in color and aspect according to their depths, residues, and surroundings. Some of the less stable dams and formations have been artificially reinforced, and direct contact with the lakes or other features is forbidden to tourists. Notable features Five Colour Pond, located in Zechawa Valley‚Äîthe water level being unusually low during a dry spell Jiuzhaigou is composed of three valleys arranged in a Y shape. The Rize and Zechawa valleys flow from the south and meet at the centre of the site where they form the Shuzheng valley, flowing north to the mouth of the valley. The mountainous watersheds of these gullies are lined with of roads for shuttle buses, as well as wooden boardwalks and small pavilions. The boardwalks are typically located on the opposite side of the lakes from the road, shielding them from disturbance by passing buses. Most visitors will first take the shuttle bus to the end of Rize and/or Shuzheng gully, then make their way back downhill by foot on the boardwalks, taking the bus instead when the next site is too distant. Here is a summary of the sites found in each of the gullies: =Rize Valley= The Pearl Shoal Waterfall is a 310-metre-wide curtain of water The Rize Valley (Êó•ÂàôÊ≤ü, pinyin: R√¨z√© G≈çu) is the south-western branch of Jiuzhaigou. It contains the largest variety of sites and is typically visited first. Going downhill from its highest point, one passes the following sites: * The Primeval Forest (ÂéüÂßãÊ£ÆÊûó Yu√°nsh«ê Sƒìnl√≠n) is a preserved ancient woodland. It is fronted by views of the surrounding mountains and cliffs, including the 500-metre-high, blade-shaped Sword Rock (ÂâëÂ≤© Ji√†n Y√°n). * Swan Lake (Â§©ÈπÖÊµ∑, TiƒÅn'√© H«éi) is a 2250-metre-long, 125-metre-wide lake named for its visiting swans and ducks. * Grass Lake (ËçâÊµ∑, C«éo H«éi) is a shallow lake covered in intricate vegetation patterns. * Arrow Bamboo Lake (ÁÆ≠Á´πÊµ∑, Ji√†nzh√∫ H«éi), covering an area of 170,000 m2, is a shallow lake with a depth of 6 m. It lies at an elevation of 2,618 m, and was a main feature site for the 2002 Chinese film Hero. * Panda Lake (ÁÜäÁå´Êµ∑, Xi√≥ngmƒÅo H«éi) features curious color patterns of blue and green. Giant Pandas were said to have come to this lake to drink, though there have been no sightings for many years. The lake empties into the multi-stream, multi-level Panda Waterfalls, dropping 78 m in three steps. * Five Flower Lake (‰∫îËä±Êµ∑, W«îhuƒÅ H«éi) is a shallow multi-colored lake whose bottom is criss-crossed by ancient fallen tree trunks. * Pearl Shoal (ÁèçÁè†Êª©, Zhƒìnzh≈´ TƒÅn) is a wide, gently sloping area of active calcareous tufa deposition covered in a thin sheet of flowing water. It empties into the famous Pearl Waterfalls, where the shoal drops 28 m in a 310-metre-wide broad curtain of water. A scene of the television adaptation of Journey to the West was filmed there. * Mirror Lake (ÈïúÊµ∑, J√¨ng H«éi) is another quiet lake casting beautiful reflections of the surroundings when the water is calm. =Zechawa Valley= Long Lake is the highest, largest and deepest lake in Jiuzhaigou The Zechawa Gully (ÂàôÊü•Ê¥ºÊ≤ü, Z√©ch√°wƒÅ G≈çu) is the south-eastern branch of Jiuzhaigou. It is approximately the same length as Rize gully (18 km) but climbs to a higher altitude (3150 m at the Long Lake). Going downhill from its highest point, it features the following sites: * Long Lake (ÈïøÊµ∑, Ch√°ng H«éi) is crescent-shaped and is the highest, largest and deepest lake in Jiuzhaigou, measuring in length and up to 103 m in depth. It reportedly has no outgoing waterways, getting its water from snowmelt and losing it from seepage. Local folklore features a monster in its depths. * Five-Color Pond (‰∫îÂΩ©Ê±†, W«îc«éi Ch√≠) is one of the smallest bodies of water in Jiuzhaigou lakes. Despite its very modest dimensions and depth, it has a richly colored underwater landscape with some of the brightest and clearest waters in the area. According to legend, the pond was where Goddess Semo washed her hair and God Dage came daily to bring her water. * The Seasonal Lakes (Â≠£ËäÇÊµ∑, J√¨ji√© H«éi) are a series of 3 lakes (Lower, Middle and Upper) along the main road, that change from empty to full during each year. =Shuzheng Valley= Sleeping Dragon Lake and Sparkling Lake amidst the morning mist during autumn The Shuzheng Valley (Ê†ëÊ≠£Ê≤ü, Sh√πzh√®ng G≈çu) is the northern (main) branch of Jiuzhaigou. It ends after at the Y-shaped intersection of the three gullies. Going downhill from the intersection to the mouth of the valley, visitors encounter the following: * Nuorilang Falls (ËØ∫Êó•ÊúóÁÄëÂ∏É, Nu√≤r√¨l«éng P√πb√π), near the junction of the valleys, are 20 m high and 320 m wide. They are reportedly the widest highland waterfall in China, the widest travertine-topped waterfall in the world, and one of the symbols of Jiuzhaigou. * Nuorilang Lakes (ËØ∫Êó•ÊúóÁæ§Êµ∑, Nu√≤r√¨l«éng Q√∫nh«éi) and Shuzheng Lakes (Ê†ëÊ≠£Áæ§Êµ∑ Sh√πzh√®ng Q√∫nh«éi) are stepped series of respectively 18 and 19 ribbon lakes formed by the passage of glaciers, then naturally dammed. Some of them have their own folkloric names, such as the Rhinoceros, Unknown, and Tiger lakes. * Sleeping Dragon Lake (ÂçßÈæôÊµ∑, W√≤l√≥ng H«éi) is one of the lower lakes in the area. With a depth of 20 m, it is notable for the clearly visible calcareous dyke running through it, whose shape has been compared to a dragon lying on the bottom. * Reed Lake (Ëä¶ËãáÊµ∑, L√∫wƒõi H«éi) is a 1375-metre-long, reed- covered marsh with a clear turquoise brook (known as the \\"Jade Ribbon\\") zigzaging through it. The contrast is particularly striking in the autumn when the reeds turn golden yellow. =Others= * The Fairy Pool (Á•û‰ªôÊ±†, Sh√©nxiƒÅn Ch√≠) lies west of Jiuzhaigou and features travertine pools very similar to those of the nearby Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area. hello Tourism The Nuorilang Falls are 320 metres wide View of the Min Mountains as the plane approaches the Jiuzhai Huanglong Airport The Zharu Valley (ÊâéÂ¶ÇÊ≤ü, ZhƒÅr√∫ G≈çu) runs southeast from the main Shuzheng gully and is rarely visited by tourists. The valley begins at the Zharu Buddhist monastery and ends at the Red, Black, and Daling lakes. Zharu Valley is the home of tourism in Jiuzhaigou.http://www.jiuzhai.com/language/english/ecotourism.html The valley has recently been opened to a small number of tourists wishing to go hiking and camping off the beaten track. Visitors can choose from day walks and multiple day hikes, depending on their time availability. Knowledgeable guides accompany tourists through the valley, sharing their knowledge about the unique biodiversity and local culture of the national park. The Zharu Valley has 40% of all the plant species that exist in China and it is the best place to spot wildlife inside the national park. The main hike follows the pilgrimage of the local Benbo Buddhists circumnavigating the sacred 4,528 m Zha Yi Zha Ga Mountain.http://www.jiuzhai.com/language/english/info_history.html Access Jiuzhaigou, compared with other high-traffic scenic spots in China, can be difficult to reach by land. The majority of tourists reach the valley by a ten-hour bus ride from Chengdu along the Min River canyon, which is prone to occasional minor rock-slides and, in the rainy season, mudslides that can add several hours to the trip. The new highway constructed along this route was badly damaged during the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, but has since been repaired. Further repairs from Mao Xian to Chuan Zhu Si are proceeding, but the road is open to public buses and private vehicles. Since 2003, it has been possible to fly from Chengdu or Chongqing to Jiuzhai Huanglong Airport on a mountain side in Songpan County, and then take an hour-long bus ride to Huanglong, or a 90-minute bus ride to Jiuzhaigou. Since 2006, a daily flight to Xi'an opens in the peak season. In October, 2009, new direct flights were added from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong National Parks did not experience any damage during the earthquake of May, 2008, and did not close after the event. In August 2017, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Jiuzhaigou County, causing significant structural damage. The authorities closed the valley to tourists until March 3, 2018, before reopening the park with limited access. The Chengdu‚ÄìLanzhou Railway is under construction and will have a station in Jiuzhaigou County.

It is the third installment in the Dragon Quest series and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese release of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle. The first three Dragon Quest games are part of the same story, and Dragon Warrior III is the first game chronologically, as well as the third game that features the hero Erdrick (Loto in the Japanese releases and Game Boy Color localization). The story follows \\"the Hero\\" who is tasked with saving the world from the archfiend Baramos. Gathering a group of companions into a party, the Hero must travel the world, stopping at various towns and locations, and make their way to the Demon Lord Baramos' lair.  Gameplay  Dragon Quest III is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with \\"Tidy Item\\" and \\"Tidy Bag\\" command, and a \\"Full HP\\" command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non-linear in structure, Dragon Quest III featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day. = Classes = In the picture, the player is reselecting one class for a character in Dhama Temple. The class system became a staple feature of all future Dragon Quest games Dragon Quest III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. At the start of the game, the player begins as a single male or female hero but is able to recruit members at the local tavern. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose to be any of the following of either gender: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. A character who changes classes has their stats halved and restarts at experience Level 1, retaining their spells and, in the remakes, their personality. This allows a player to create a character that knows Wizard spells but has the defense of a Soldier. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles in order to win more gold. In the remakes, after selecting a character, the player can change the character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a personality trait which affects the growth rate of their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence at the start of the game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.  Story  = Setting = The game starts in the castle town of Aliahan. Like the rest of the Dragon Quest worlds, this castle is set in a medieval time period, complete with knights and magicians. The party explores several caves, ruins, and castles during the adventure. The geography of Dragon Quest III largely corresponds to the actual geography of Earth, and many towns correspond to their real-world cultures, including \\"Romaly\\" for Rome, \\"Portoga\\" for Portugal, \\"Assaram\\" near present-day Iraq (derived from \\"as- salamu alaykum\\"), \\"Jipang\\" for Japan (where the hero fights Yamata no Orochi) and even a \\"New Town\\" in eastern North America that experiences a revolution against an overbearing ruler. = Plot = Dragon Quest III is set many years before the original Dragon Warrior in a world separate from the first two games. A wicked fiend named Baramos threatens to destroy the world. The story revolves around the Hero, son or daughter (the player can choose to be either male or female, with few gameplay changes) of the legendary warrior Ortega. On their sixteenth birthday, the Hero (from here on referred to as \\"they\\" for the sake of convenience) is summoned to the castle and is given by the King of Aliahan the challenge to rid the world of the evil archfiend Baramos, which Ortega attempted in the past but seemingly perished in a volcano. The Hero then is able to recruit up to three traveling companions to help fight Baramos. The Hero leaves their home country of Aliahan to travel the world and complete their father's quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly's crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a sailing ship at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia. Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos' castle, which is surrounded by mountains. After defeating Baramos in a ferocious battle and returning to Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return to the land and the Hero will not live long enough to stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of \\"Erdrick\\" (\\"Loto\\" in the Japanese version). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.  Development  As with the other main games in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest IIIs scenario was designed by Yuji Horii, whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama, of Dragon Ball fame. Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for Dragon Quest III. Chunsoft president Koichi Nakamura, co-creator of Dragon Quest, stated he contributed about \\"10%\\" of the games programming. The game was released a year after the original, a longer period of development than its predecessor, and reflected the ever-lengthening game development process of the series. Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in Dragon Quest III, and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two Dragon Quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record . Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, which turned out to be unworkable during Dragon Quest IIIs development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in Mirai Shinwa Jarvas, but Horii's team was too far into development to change anything. Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, \\"Leave him to us! Run! Quick!\\" = 1991 North American localization = The game was localized in North America as Dragon Warrior III in 1991 (though not officially released until 1992). Several changes were made in this version. Among them were the addition of a new title sequence (in the original, it was on a simple black screen with the title of the game in the center), and a new prologue which depicted Ortega, who also was given a brand new sprite in this version, fighting a Dragon, and being dragged into the volcano (in the original, the player was unaware of Ortega's fate, until talking to the King for the first time). There were also brand new music cues, including one for the title sequence, and one that played after Ortega died for real near the end. To accompany the localization credits, the ending theme was extended to include a reprise of the Alefgard theme. It's unclear whether Sugiyama was brought back to score these new tracks, or someone else was brought in. The menu when starting a new or old save file also added the menu music from Dragon Quest IV (in the original, the menu was silent). Finally, most of the monsters were given a tremendous boost in experience points. = Remakes = Comparison of graphics from Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy Color Version. Hero outside of Aliahan The Super Famicom version, released in late 1996, during the last days of the Super NES in North America, was never brought to North America, due to Enix America Corporation's closure in 1995. By the time Enix of America returned, the SNES had been discontinued in North America. However, the next remake, for the Game Boy Color, was released in both Japan and the US. The Game Boy Color version is based on the Super Famicom version. For the North American release of the Dragon Quest III Game Boy Color remake, Enix decided to give the packaging an anime feel, due to fan demand on Enix's message boards. Both remake versions of Dragon Quest III offer many new features and changes. The game received a new translation, incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release, and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a \\"Teen\\" rating. It was also the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America, with 32 Mb ROM and 256Kb of save-state SRAM on one cartridge. A new class, the Thief, was added to the roster in each of the remakes. Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version, such as Soldier to Warrior. Also, in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at Dhama, which was not allowed in the original. New mini-games were added to the remakes, including Pachisi (called Suguroku in Japan / Treasures and Trapdoors as of the Dragon Quest V Remake), which is a giant board game style adventure from which the player can win items. This game is based on Horii's series Itadaki Street. The Mini Medal system, which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items, seen in later Dragon Quest games (it originated in Dragon Quest IV), was added. Another medal system, Monster Medals, lets players collect medals from fallen enemies, was added in Game Boy Color remake, and two players could trade Monster Medals via a Game Link Cable. Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over. The remakes feature updated graphics. An overhauled introduction for the game was made, similar to the one in the original Dragon Quest III, which included Ortega's battle with the Dragon Queen. Monster and attack animation in battles were added, a feature first introduced in Dragon Quest VI. A personality system was added to the remakes of Dragon Quest III. A pre-game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in Ultima IV determines the Hero's personality. The personality of the other members of the party is determined by the stat- raising seeds that the player gives them during the character generation process. Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up. The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books. Square Enix released both the Famicom and Super Famicom versions of Dragon Quest III in Japan on September 15, 2011, as part of Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III, a compilation of emulated Dragon Quest games for the Wii to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary. A quick save feature was added to these versions, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save file is deleted upon resuming. = Music = Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game. Dragon Quest IIIs music is featured on Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1, Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 2, and Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 3, each album a compilation of music from the first six Dragon Quest games. This game's music has also been featured on other Dragon Quest compilation albums, such as Dragon Quest on Piano Vol. II, which was released in 1990, and Dragon Quest Best Songs Selection ~Loula~, released in 1993. A compilation album of Dragon Quest IIIs music was put on Dragon Quest III ~And into the Legend...~ Remix Symphonic Suite and was published by Sony Records in 1996. In 2011 Sugiyama played a concert focused on Dragon Quest III in his \\"Family Classic Concert\\" series he has done for many years, playing fifteen of the games songs.  Reception  = Sales = Dragon Quest III sold over one million copies on the first day with almost 300 arrests for truancy among students absent from school to purchase the game, and 3.8 million copies total in Japan. In Japan, the Super Famicom remake sold 1.4 million units, with nearly 720,000 units sold in 1996 alone. The Game Boy Color version sold a lower 604,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, and eventually became the fifth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 638,551 copies sold. Together with the sales of the remakes, Dragon Quest III is the most successful title in the series and one of the best-selling role- playing games in Japan. As of November 2010, Japan mobile phone version was downloaded more than 1,000,000 times. Wii Dragon Quest Collection sold 403,953 copies in 2011. = Reviews = A survey conducted by the magazine Famitsu in early 2006 among its readers placed Dragon Quest III as the third most favorite game of all time, being preceded by only Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII, It is often mistakenly thought that in 1988 the game's success caused the Japanese government to outlaw further releases of Dragon Quest games on school days. In truth, Enix themselves decided to hold off the release of future Dragon Quest games until weekends. The North American release of Dragon Quest III did not meet nearly as much success. Considered an improvement over the first two games, Dragon Quest III \\"kept the same ugly graphical style and clumsy interface\\", explained Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra. The North American release's poor sales are partly due to the fact that the game was released after the release of 16-bit gaming systems, making it seem archaic to gamers. Critics found the new day/night system and the addition of an in-game bank praiseworthy. Its reputation has risen in America since its release, primarily due to its gameplay innovations, leading Nintendo Power to list it as number 176 on their Top 200 Games list. IGN later listed it as the 96th best Nintendo Entertainment System game. GamesRadar ranked it the 17th best NES game ever made. The staff chose it over the other Dragon Warrior titles due to its job system which they felt had depth and was influential to video games. The Game Boy Color remake received very good reviews from critics. GameSpot gave the Game Boy Color version a \\"good\\" 7.6/10, saying that \\"DWIII is a worthy port of its old NES ancestor, but its firm grounding in the RPG old-school means that only the hard-core need apply.\\" Nintendo Power gave the remake a 4/5, while IGN gave the game a perfect 10/10.  Legacy  The male protagonist from this installment, Erdrick, appears in the Japan- exclusive mobile game Dragon Quest Rivals. Erdrick also appears as a guest character in the 2018 crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate via DLC and is fully voiced for the first time by Nobuyuki Hiyama.  Manga  The manga series, , was written by Chiaki Kawamata and Junji Koyanagi with artwork by Kamui Fujiwara and was published in Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan from 1991 through 1997. The series was later compiled into for 21 volumes published by Enix; in 1994 it was released on CD and was released for the PlayStation Portable on December 11, 2009 as part of manga distribution library. In 1996 an anime movie based on the manga was released on video cassette. A sequel series, , published by Square Enix started in 2005 and is still ongoing; as of December 2012, fifteen volumes have been released. The first four volumes were written by Jun Eishima and all the rest volumes written by Takashi Umemura. All of them have been supervised by Yuji Horii with artwork done by Kamui Fujiwara. Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monsh≈ç is meant to take place between Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest. After monsters possessed the Carmen's king for seven years, the kingdom fell to the hordes of evil. The only survivors were Prince Arus and an army General's daughter, Lunafrea. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Loran, a child by the name of is born with the name Jagan per the orders of Demon Lord Imagine.

She was laid down in 1930 at Chatham Dockyard and built in a dry dock. Afterwards she was moved to Portsmouth for completion and commissioned on 15 March 1932. Service history Until the outbreak of the Second World War, Challenger surveyed the waters around the United Kingdom, Labrador, the West Indies, and the East Indies. On 23 September 1932, she struck a rock north of Ford's Harbour, Labrador, in the Dominion of Newfoundland () and was beached. She was later refloated. From 1939 to 1942 she served in home waters and as a convoy escort. In June and July 1941 she and three s escorted the troop ship from Britain en route for Freetown, Sierra Leone. When the troop ship was torpedoed north of the Azores, Challenger and the corvette rescued hundreds of survivors and then transferred them to the armed merchant cruiser HMS Cathay. From 1942 to 1946 Challenger surveyed in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific. She returned to Chatham in 1946 for a refit before returning to the Persian Gulf late 1946. She left the Gulf in 1947 and went to Cyprus where a shore party logged tides. She then proceeded to Gibraltar for another refit in dry dock. In December 1947 men from Challenger and from the two destroyers and were landed in Aden in an attempt to restore order following anti-Jewish rioting. She circumnavigated the World from 1950 to 1953 that included surveying in the West Indies and the Far East. It was on this mission, in 1951 that Challenger surveyed the Mariana Trench near Guam, including the deepest known point in the oceans, deep at its maximum, near .Explore the Mariana Trench This point had been named Challenger Deep after it was first surveyed in 1875 during an expedition by a previous . In January 1954, Challenger returned to Britain, paid off, and was broken up at Dover.

It was first founded in 1933, and served during World War II, seeing action in the battle of the Atlantic and on Russian convoys, and was eventually disbanded in 1956. Service history =Pre-war= The squadron was formed on 3 April 1933 by amalgamating No. 465 and No. 466 Fleet Torpedo Flights, and served aboard the aircraft carrier in the Home Fleet. Initially equipped with the Blackburn Ripon Mk.II, these were replaced in January 1935 with the Blackburn Baffin, which were in turn replaced by the Fairey Swordfish Mk.I in October 1936. In December 1938 the Furious was paid off, and the next year 811 Squadron was assigned to her sister ship . The squadron lost much of its personnel and all of its aircraft when Courageous was sunk by a U-boat on 17 September 1939, and the survivors of 811 and 812 squadrons were reformed into 815 Naval Air Squadron. =World War II= 811 Squadron was reformed in July 1941 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus), near Portsmouth, as a torpedo- bomber reconnaissance squadron, and was equipped with two Sea Hurricanes and fourteen American Vought SB2U Vindicators, which the British called the \\"Chesapeake\\". The squadron also received two former civilian Avro 652s (the precursor to the Avro Anson) which they operated until March 1942. The Chesapeake's were part of an order originally placed by the French Navy in March 1940, but after the fall of France the order was taken over by the British. The aircraft were fitted with an additional fuel tank and armour, and the single French 7.5 mm Darne machine gun was replaced by four British machine guns. It was intended that they be used as anti-submarine patrol aircraft operating from the escort carrier , but it was soon realised that the Chesapeake lacked the power to fly from such a small vessel while carrying a useful load, and they were reassigned to training squadrons in November 1941, and the squadron received Swordfish Mk.2's as replacements. From August to December 1942 811 Squadron was based at RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, serving under the control of RAF Coastal Command, and flying on anti-shipping and mine-laying operations. In January 1943, the squadron received three Grumman F4F Wildcat Mk.IVs, called the \\"Martlet\\" in British service, and on 21 February 1943 flew from RNAS Hatston to embark aboard the escort carrier to serve on convoy escort duty in the battle of the Atlantic. On 22 April Biter and the escort destroyers , , and joined convoy ONS-4 sailing from Liverpool. On 25 April a Swordfish from 811 Squadron attacked , which was then sunk by depth charges by Pathfinder. The convoy arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 5 April without loss. From 2 May Biter defended the convoys HX 237 and SC 129 from German wolf packs. On 12 May a Swordfish from 811 Squadron, with the destroyer and the frigate , attacked and sank the . After arriving at Liverpool, the squadron disembarked and were stationed at RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail). On 2 June 811 Squadron returned to Biter to escort further convoys between Liverpool and Halifax, including ON-207 in October. While at Naval Station Argentia in November, the squadron was supplied with the new American acoustic torpedo, codenamed the Mark 24 mine, but commonly known as \\"FIDO\\". On 17 November a Swordfish smashed into the end of the flight deck of Biter while landing in a heavy swell, and its unused FIDO torpedo fell into the sea and exploded, badly damaging Biters rudder. The carrier managed to return to Rosyth Dockyard for repairs, which took a month. View of HMS Biter from a Swordfish just after takeoff. Ready on the deck are two Martlet fighters, and in the distance other ships of the convoy, March 1944. While Biter was under repair 811 Squadron were stationed at RNAS Inskip (HMS Nightjar), finally returning to the ship on 12 January 1944. In early February Biter sailed in support of Convoy ONS-29 to Halifax, then transferred to Convoy OS-68/KMS-42 bound for Freetown and Gibraltar. On 16 February, in the Bay of Biscay, 811's Martlets shot down a Ju 290 long-range reconnaissance aircraft, which had attempted to attack the convoy escorts with a glide bomb. Biter arrived at Gibraltar on 25 February where two Swordfish of 811 Squadron spent a week operating out of RAF North Front. On 2 March Biter sailed again, escorting the UK-bound convoys SL-150 and MKS-41, and arrived at Liverpool on the 13th. Biter continued to escort convoys between the UK and Gibraltar until August 1944 when she was withdrawn from service, for conversion to a transport carrier. 811 Squadron was temporarily based at RAF Limavady in Northern Ireland, serving under RAF Coastal Command, until joining in September 1944 to escort convoys to Russia. 811 Squadron was disbanded on its return in December 1944. =Post war= The squadron was reformed in September 1945, and in August 1946 was equipped with the Sea Mosquito TR.33, which was a de Havilland Mosquito FB.VI modified for carrier operations. An early prototype, flown by test pilot Eric Brown, was the first twin-engined aircraft to make a carrier landing, when it touched down aboard on 25 March 1944. Stationed at RNAS Brawdy, Pembrokeshire, 811 Squadron was the only unit to operate this type, which never served aboard a carrier, before it was superseded by the Sea Hornet. The squadron was disbanded in July 1947. 811 Squadron was reformed in the 1950s, with the Hawker Sea Fury, and embarked aboard HMS Warrior dispatched to the Far East for the Korean War. The squadron flew patrols there until the Peace Treaty was signed in 1954. Subsequently, the Squadron reformed flying the Hawker Sea Hawk jet from in mid‚Äì1955 and operating from in the Far East and the Mediterranean at the Suez war in 1956, before being finally disbanded the same year.

The area is located on the coast of the Solent. It is primarily a residential area, with an upsurge of mostly local visitors in summer, but was also the former home to the Royal Naval Air Station HMS Daedalus (renamed as HMS Ariel from 1959 to 1965). History The district gained its name in the 19th century, during attempts to develop the area into a seaside resort. The area had been referenced long before this, referred to as LeeSaxton's Hampshire 1575 and numerous variations, including Lebritan.Notes about old maps of the county of Hampshire, Jean and Martin Norgate, 1996‚Äì2006 Early impetus for the district's development came from Charles Edmund Newton Robinson, who persuaded his father, John Charles Robinson, art curator and collector, to fund the buying of land. Over the period 1884 to 1894 the district was established with the setting out of Marine Parade, a pier, railway connection along with a number of impressive red brick villas. The railway service was discontinued in the 1930s and the pier, unrepaired after breaching in aid of coastal defence in World War II, was demolished in 1958.Local information , The Book Shop, Lee-on-the-Solent Lee-on-the Solent has had a long association with aviation. Seaplane trials took place at Lee- on-the-Solent as early as 1915. A base for seaplane training was established in 1917 on the former RNAS Lee-on-Solent, later HMS Daedalus, site. In 1935 the Lee Tower complex was built on the seafront next to the old pier and railway station. It was designed by architects Yates, Cook & Derbyshire, and comprised a white v-shaped Art Deco building with a tower. The complex housed a cinema, ballroom and restaurant, as well as a viewing platform at the tower's peak. The complex was demolished in 1971 by Gosport Borough Council, with its land now used for the promenade, remembrance gardens and a car park.Portsmouth, Alan H. Balfour, Peter Hollins, Geoffrey Broadbent, Studio Vista, 1970Historical tour, Gosport Council Modern times New developments in the 1980s and 1990s increased the population. More recently, 1,050 new units have been built at the Cherque farm area of the town, and further development will take place over the next few years. Elsewhere along Marine Parade, the seafront has lost many of the original villas and hotels to developers. The Royal Naval Air Station HMS Daedalus closed in 1996 but Daedalus Airfield itself remains active as a civil airfield. Aircraft, helicopters, microlight and motorgliders are operated at what is now the principal HM Coastguard search and rescue helicopter base on the south coast. The airfield is operated by Regional & City Airports Management (RCA) on behalf of the owners, Fareham Borough Council. More information about the airfield is available on the website of Lee Flying Association. A planning application was approved in February 2008 for the construction of a Multi- Purpose Driving Test Centre with Motorcycle Manoeuvring Area (MPTC) from the Driving Standards Agency, inside a part of the Daedalus site. In 2003, the community of Lee-on-the-Solent received nationwide attention for probably the first time in its 120-year existence. The government had proposed to house asylum-seekers at the former base which forms a large area of the resort. At once, the Daedalus Action Group was formed under the chairmanship of John Beavis to oppose the scheme with the support of a large number of local residents. After a U-turn in government policy, the Home Office decided in February 2004 to abandon the asylum centre plan and the action group celebrated with a rally on the seafront. Channel 4 produced a fly-on-the-wall Dispatches documentary Keep them outDispatches ‚Äì Keep Them Out Channel 4 TV in 2004 dealing with both sides of the argument. In early May 2006, 20 unexploded Canadian pipe mines were found under HMS Daedalus during runway repairs. 60 feet (20 metres) long, they were left over from 265, packed with a total of 2,400 lb of gelignite, planted in World War II to make the airfield unusable in the event of an enemy invasion. The subsequent removal, thought to be the largest of its kind in peacetime Britain, led to the evacuation of some 900 homes staggered over a five-week period. The district still has a shopping centre, with a selection of independent shops and restaurants and is a popular destination for jet-skiers and kite surfers. A new bypass has recently been completed to link up the B3385 and the B3333 and forms a bypass to Lee-on-the- Solent. The train has long since gone from the seafront, clearing the coastal cliffs for walking, leisure and parking. The cliffs are interrupted by the former railway station buildings, the war memorial and the seafront bus stop/parking area opposite the end of Pier Street. This is where the Lee Tower used to stand. In August 2011 the government announced that the Daedalus airfield would host an enterprise zone named the Solent Enterprise Zone. The CEMAST (Centre of Excellence in Engineering & Manufacturing Advanced Skills Training) campus on the airfield is now open to students. The centre caters for full and part-time students undertaking apprenticeship programmes for companies such as BAE systems and Virgin Atlantic. In July 2015 parkrun came to the promenade section of Lee on the Solent. The inaugural run had a total of 430 finishers, with around 25 marshals and support people. In the first year there were just over 3,300 runners and 15,000 completed runs. Last year's inaugural of 430 was topped in April of this year with a running attendance of 485. On the last day of July 2018, a 'possibly deactivated' bomb was discovered '250 metres south west of the slip way in Lee-on-Solent'. By August 1st, the beach was taped off and The Royal Navy had been called in, alongside the Solent Coastguard, to try to defuse the bomb. Places of interest The views out to sea from the cliffs at Marine Parade are forever changing. From a vantage point on the grassy banks, it is possible to see shipping movements of large container ships and cruisers into Southampton and Portsmouth, sailing boats, ferries and of course the backdrop of the Isle of Wight. On the seafront on Marine Parade East is the club house of the Lee on the Solent Sailing Club (LOSSC). At the signal station, where the racing starts and finishes, is a smaller galley that can provide light snacks and soft drinks for the people involved in racing or training at the weekend. It is a RYA accredited Sailing School and is open to visitors and day sailors alike. Boats can be hired. On Marine Parade West main sea front stands the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Lee-on-Solent Memorial. This was erected to commemorate the 1,926 men of the Fleet Air Arm who died in various parts of the world in World War II and have no known grave. CWGC Cemetery Record, Lee-on-Solent Memorial. Lee-on-the-Solent is the home to the Hovercraft Museum which houses the world's largest collection of rare hovercraft including some of the earliest and largest. It can be found on the main road along the seafront and hosts an open day every summer. From 2016 it is open every Saturday from 10 am to 4 pm. Further towards Gosport is the area known as Browndown. It is a former army firing range and makes an interesting walk in summer. There are many old relics to explore, and it is not unknown to find large jellyfish washed up on the shore. Browndown army camp was the setting for the ITV television series Bad Lads Army. Browndown army camp is also used as a summer activity camp for young cadets from all over the country. Beyond Browndown eastwards, is the more affluent district and village of Alverstoke and seafront known as Stokes Bay. A short walk from the High Street in Lee is the Lee-on-the-Solent Tennis Club. It has a small bar, a gym, six squash courts (two glass-backed), six tennis courts and a sports therapist. Lee's pubs include The Old Ship, The Bun Penny, The Wyvern and The Inn by the Sea. Some pubs have been demolished to make way for housing and retirement developments, including the Belle Vue Hotel and The Swordfish, which was located on the border between Lee-on-the-Solent and Hill Head, Fareham. In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Lee library. Climate Lee-on-the- Solent, like many towns and cities along the south coast, has a milder climate than the rest of the UK, though it is slightly cooler than the nearby City of Portsmouth. The record high temperature is in August 2003 and the record low is in January 1987http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm Lee-on-the-Solent has a Met Office weather station situated at the MRSC base.

The action was fought between Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units and elements of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). Australian signals intelligence (SIGINT) had tracked the VC 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion moving to a position just north of Long Tan. By 16 August, it was positioned near Long Tan outside the range of the artillery at Nui Dat. On the night of 16/17 August, mortars and recoilless rifles attacked Nui Dat from a position to the east until counter-battery fire caused it to cease. The next morning D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR), departed Nui Dat to locate the firing points and the direction of the enemy withdrawal. Weapon pits were found including mortars and RCLs. D Company clashed with VC around midday 18 August. Facing a larger force, D Company called down artillery. Heavy fighting ensued as the VC attempted to encircle and destroy the Australians. After several hours two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF arrived overhead to resupply them. Supported by strong artillery fire, D Company held off a regimental assault before a relief force of M113 armoured personnel carriers and infantry from Nui Dat reinforced them at nighttime. The Australian forces had withdrawn to evacuate their casualties and formed a defensive position overnight. The next day Australian forces swept the area though the VC had withdrawn. The operation ended on 21 August. Although 1 ATF initially thought it had suffered a defeat, it was later thought to have been a victory by preventing the VC from moving against Nui Dat. The battle's outcome was indecisive, with disagreements on its effect between the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion. The D445 Battalion regarded the battle as a success, with the political victory of an effective ambush, and the securing of the areas around Long Tan village itself. While the 275th Regiment were unable to wipe out the entire company, it gained greater support among the local people by forcing a retreat. Whether the battle impaired the capabilities of the VC is disputed. Background Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam The 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) began arriving in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province of South Vietnam between April and June 1966. Following the establishment of its base at Nui Dat in Operation Hardihood, standing patrols were established outside the base in the evening and clearing patrols sent out every morning and evening along the perimeter. Daily platoon patrols and ambushes were initially conducted out to Line Alpha (), which was the range of the Viet Cong (VC) mortars, but were later extended out to Line Bravo () to counter the threat from artillery. All inhabitants of Long Ph∆∞·ªõc and Long H·∫£i villages within Line Alpha were removed, and resettled nearby. A protective security zone was established and a free-fire zone declared. Although unusual for allied installations in Vietnam, many of which were located near populated areas, the Australians hoped to deny the VC observation of Nui Dat, and afford greater security to patrols entering and exiting the area. While adding to the physical security of the base through disrupting a major VC support area and removing the local population from danger, such measures may have been counter-productive. The resettlement resulted in widespread resentment. The VC continued to observe the base from the Nui Dinh hills. Movement was heard around the perimeter over the first few nights as they attempted to locate the Australian defences under the cover of darkness and heavy rain. Although no clashes occurred and the reconnaissance soon ceased, they were believed to be preparations for an attack. On 10 June reports indicated that a VC regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the north west and was about away. The same day three 120 mm mortar rounds landed just outside the base. That night Australian artillery fired on suspected movement along Route 2, but no casualties were found the next day. Further warnings of an attack hastened the call-forward of 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR), which arrived from V≈©ng T√†u to the south on 14 June. No attack occurred, and the initial reaction to 1 ATF's lodgement proved unexpectedly limited. =Communist order of battle= The principal communist units in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy were main forces from the 274th and 275th Regiments of the VC 5th Division. Under command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen, the division was headquartered in the M√¢y T√†o Mountains. Operating in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy, Bi√™n H√≤a and Long Kh√°nh Provinces, it was comprised of both South Vietnamese VC guerrillas and North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units. Given the task of isolating the eastern provinces from Saigon by interdicting the main roads and highways, including National Routes 1 and 15 and provincial routes 2 and 23, it proved a major challenge to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units that ventured into the province, demonstrating a capacity to mount regimental- size ambushes. The 274th Regiment was the stronger and better trained of the two. Based in the H√°t D·ªãch in north west Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy with three battalions‚ÄîD800, D265 and D308‚Äîit numbered 2,000 men. The 275th Regiment was based in the M√¢y T√†o Mountains and mainly operated in the east of the province. Commanded by Senior Captain Nguyen Thoi Bung (aka Ut Thoi), it consisted of three battalions‚ÄîH421, H422 and H421‚Äîwith a total of 1,850 men. In support was an artillery battalion equipped with 75 mm recoilless rifles (RCLs), 82 mm mortars, and 12.7 mm heavy machine-guns, an engineer battalion, a signals battalion and a sapper reconnaissance battalion, as well as medical and logistic units. Local forces included D445 Battalion, which normally operated in the south and in Long Kh√°nh. Under command of Bui Quang Chanh (alias Sau Chanh), it consisted of three rifle companies‚ÄîC1, C2, C3‚Äîand a weapons company, C4; a strength of 550 men. Recruited locally and operating in familiar terrain, they possessed an intimate knowledge of the area. Guerrilla forces numbered 400 men operating in groups of five to 60, with two companies in Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc district, one in Long Dat, and a platoon in Xuy√™n M·ªôc. In total, VC strength was estimated to have been around 4,500 men. Australians arrive at Tan Son Nhut Airport, Saigon ARVN forces included the 52nd Ranger Battalion, a unit that had previously earned a US Presidential Unit Citation defeating the 275th Regiment the year before, and relatively weak territorial forces of 17 Regional Force (RF) companies and 47 Popular Force (PF) platoons, in total some 4,500 men. Most villages were garrisoned by an RF company operating from a fortified compound, and PF platoons guarded most hamlets and important infrastructure, but their value was questionable. RF companies were technically available for tasks throughout the province, while PF platoons were mostly restricted to operating around their village. While RF and PF units occasionally defended themselves successfully they rarely conducted offensive operations, and when they did they were usually limited. Mostly recruited from the same population as their opponents, they often suffered equally at the hands of the VC and a largely inept government. Poorly trained and unable to rely on being reinforced, they provided little opposition to the VC. A US Advisory Team operated in support, as did a few Australians from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV); despite their efforts, the capabilities of the ARVN remained limited. The arrival of 1 ATF further restricted their ability to operate in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy as it increasingly came to dominate the province. Initially, 1 ATF, under the command of Brigadier Oliver David Jackson, consisted of two infantry battalions: the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, and 6 RAR under Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend. Other units included the 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron operating M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs); 1st Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, consisting of the New Zealand 161st Battery, two Australian batteries equipped with eighteen 105 mm L5 Pack Howitzers, and six 155 mm M109 self-propelled howitzers from the US A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery Regiment; 3rd SAS Squadron; 1st Field Squadron and 21st Engineer Support Troop; 103rd Signals Squadron; 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters; and an intelligence detachment. Support was provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) at V≈©ng T√†u, and eight UH-1B Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. US forces provided considerable support including artillery, close air support, helicopter gunships, and utility, medium and heavy lift helicopters. The largest Australian force deployed since the Second World War, it had been rapidly assembled. Although many of its officers and non-commissioned personnel had extensive operational experience, it included many National Servicemen. Few had direct experience of counter-insurgency operations, or first-hand understanding of the situation in Vietnam. The task force was unable to train together before departure. =Preliminary operations= With 1 ATF established at Nui Dat, subsequent operations included a search and destroy missions to gain control over Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy. Seeking to extend its influence beyond Line Alpha, in early July 5 RAR patrolled north through Nui Ngh·ªá, while 6 RAR cleared Long Ph∆∞·ªõc to the south, removing the former inhabitants who had returned since May. 5 RAR then began operations along Route 2, cordoning and searching D·ª•c M·ªπ on 19‚Äì20 July in preparation for the clearance of B√¨nh Ba, while the SAS conducted long-range patrols to the edge of the Tactical Area of Operations (TAOR) to provide early warning of VC concentrations. With the 5th Division believed able to concentrate anywhere in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy within 24 to 48 hours, it was a significant threat. As 1 ATF began to impact the VC's freedom of action, a response was expected. Mortar fire and small probes on the Nui Dat perimeter occurred, with such activity considered a possible prelude to an attack. Assessments of VC intentions changed from those of May and June. Whereas previously a full-scale assault was expected, as Nui Dat's defences were strengthened an attack against an isolated company or battalion was considered more likely. Other possibilities included skirmishes or ambushes during routine patrolling, or an attempt to interdict a resupply convoy from V≈©ng T√†u. Australian soldier during operations in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province By the end of July, a large VC force had been detected by SAS patrols east of Nui Dat, near the abandoned village of Long T√¢n. In response, 6 RAR launched a battalion search and destroy operation. In a series of fire-fights on 25 July, a company from D445 Battalion attacked C Company, and in the process of retreating assaulted B Company occupying a blocking position. Over the following days, further clashes occurred around Long Tan, resulting in 13 VC killed and 19 wounded, and Australian losses of three killed and 19 wounded. Yet with the inhabitants resettled, the village fortified and the perimeter regularly patrolled, the Australians considered the area secure. Believing VC sympathisers had returned to Long T√¢n, they searched the area again on 29 July. That afternoon, as 6 RAR commenced a detailed search following its initial sweep, Jackson ordered its immediate return to Nui Dat in response to South Vietnamese reports of a large VC presence close to the base. Although the warnings were unconfirmed and an attack against Nui Dat was considered unlikely, 1 ATF was re-postured. Company patrols were sent out in each direction over the following days, but found little of significance. Jackson had seemed to over-react, and his requests for assistance from US II Field Force, Vietnam (II FFV) were denied. Later intelligence discredited the original reporting and the crisis subsided, but it was indicative of the alarms experienced during the first months of 1 ATF's lodgement, and their effect. After two months, 1 ATF had moved beyond the initial requirements of establishing itself and securing its immediate approaches, and commenced operations to open the province. The task force had penetrated the VC base areas to the east and clashed with D445 Battalion. Operations had been conducted in the N√∫i Dinh hills to west, B√¨nh Ba had been cleared of VC influence and Route 2 opened to civilian traffic. Yet the ongoing need to secure Nui Dat reduced the combat power available to the task force commander, and it was evident that with only two battalions‚Äîrather than the usual three‚Äî1 ATF lacked operational flexibility, as while one battalion carried out operations the other was required to secure the base and provide a ready reaction force. Significant logistic problems also plagued the task force, as 1 ALSG struggled to become operational amid the sand dunes at V≈©ng T√†u, resulting in shortages of vital equipment. By the middle of August, the Australian troops were growing tired from constant day and night patrolling with no respite from base defence duties. A rest and recreation program began, with many granted two days leave in V≈©ng T√†u, but this further stretched the limited forces available to 1 ATF. Meanwhile, in response to the growing threat posed by the Australians, the commander of the VC 5th Division finally ordered the 275th Regiment to move against Nui Dat. Viet Cong soldiers from D445 Battalion For several weeks, Australian signals intelligence (SIGINT) had tracked a radio transmitter from the headquarters of the 275th Regiment moving westwards to a position just north of Long T√¢n using radio direction finding, but extensive patrolling failed to find the unit. Provided by the top secret 547 Signals Troop, the reports began on 29 July at the height of the false alarm, with the radio detected moving towards Nui Dat from a position north of Xuy√™n M·ªôc. It continued at a rate of a day and by 13 August was located near the Nui Dat 2 feature, a hill in the vicinity of Long T√¢n, east of Nui Dat. Although direction finding only indicated the movement of the radio, and no transmissions had been intercepted, it suggested the presence of the 275th Regiment, or at least a reconnaissance party of that unit. While deception could not be ruled out, Jackson took the threat seriously, and company patrols were sent out. The existence of a SIGINT capability was a closely guarded secret, and knowledge of the source of the reports was limited to Jackson, his two intelligence officers, and the 1 ATF operations officer; neither battalion commander had access. On 15 August D Company, 6 RAR patrolled to Nui Dat 2 and returned through the Long T√¢n rubber plantation. The following day A Company, 6 RAR departed on a three-day patrol on a route which included Nui Dat 2 and the ridge to the north west. Any sizeable VC force in the vicinity would have been located, but neither patrol found anything of significance. SAS patrols focused on the N√∫i Dinh hills to the west. By 16 August, the VC force was positioned east of the Long T√¢n rubber plantation, just outside the range of the artillery at Nui Dat. The operation was thought to have been planned by Colonel Nguyen Thanh Hong, a staff officer from the VC 5th Division who was likely in overall control. Although VC intentions have been debated in the years since, the aim was likely both a political and military victory to prove their strength to the local population, and undermine Australian public support for the war. They would probably have known one of 1 ATF's battalions was involved in the search of B√¨nh Ba, and may have considered Nui Dat weakly defended as a result. Undetected, it likely consisted of three battalions of the 275th Regiment with approximately 1,400 men, possibly reinforced by at least one regular PAVN battalion, and D445 Battalion with up to 350 men. Well armed, they were equipped with AK-47 and SKS assault rifles, RPG-2 rocket- propelled grenades, light machine-guns, mortars and RCLs. Large quantities of ammunition were carried, with each man issued two or three grenades, and grenadiers up to ten or twelve, and a reserve of small arms, mortar bombs and rounds for their crew-served weapons. The 274th Regiment was probably located north west, occupying a position on Route 2 to ambush a squadron of the US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which they anticipated would move down the inter-provincial highway from Long Kh√°nh to support the Australians. Battle =Opening moves, 16/17 August 1966=  Initial assault  Battle of Long Tan, 18 August 1966 At 02:43 on the night of 16/17 August Nui Dat was bombarded by the VC, and hit by over 100 rounds from several 82 mm mortars, 75 mm RCLs and an old Japanese 70 mm howitzer fired from a position to the east. Most of the infantry were deployed at the time, with 5 RAR still engaged on Operation Holsworthy, although a small stay behind party remained. A Company, 6 RAR was on patrol in the north-east of the TAOR, while a platoon from C Company was manning a night ambush to the south-east. Continuing for 22 minutes, it damaged vehicles and tents and wounded 24 men, one of whom later died. The impact was spread over the south and south-east, with the 103rd Field Battery heaviest hit. The 1st Field Regiment commenced counter-battery fire at 02:50. As the artillery locating radar was suspected of being faulty, this was done using compass bearings on sound and flash. With the likely firing point plotted, 240 rounds were fired, and the mortaring ceased. The Australians remained alert in case of a ground assault, but no follow up occurred. The artillery continued to shell suspected firing positions and withdrawal routes until 04:10. Although the VC were expected to have withdrawn, several company patrols were dispatched the following morning to search the area east of Nui Dat in response.  Pursuing the Vietcong  Townsend ordered B Company under Major Noel Ford to prepare for a patrol to locate the firing points which were believed to be in the area between the abandoned villages of Long T√¢n, Long Ph∆∞·ªõc, and the Nui Dat 2 feature. Having done so, it was to establish the direction of the VC withdrawal. Meanwhile, a platoon from C Company mounted in armoured personnel carriers was to investigate a suspected mortar location south-west of Nui Dat. A Company would continue its patrol in the vicinity of Nui Dat 2, while 7 Platoon, C Company, already conducting a night ambush on the southern edge of the TAOR, would search some sites as it returned that morning. No SAS patrols were deployed as a result of the attack, although several previously been planned to the north between B√¨nh Ba and the Courtenay plantation in preparation for upcoming operations went ahead. Another patrol was inserted near the Song Rai, north- east of Nui Dat, on the morning of 17 August. Noting signs of significant activity soon afterwards, it located several tracks moving west made approximately six hours earlier, possibly by a VC logistics unit. Due to radio interference and faulty equipment the information was unable to be reported until extraction two days later. Australian intelligence continued to assess a ground attack against Nui Dat as unlikely, with the bombardment an indicator of further offensive action against 1 ATF, Jackson felt he would be unable to adequately respond with only one battalion. 5 RAR was therefore ordered to return to Nui Dat, and was expected back by 18 August. Although SIGINT had earlier alerted Jackson to the possible presence of a strong VC force in the vicinity of Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing, and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August with just 80 men‚Äîsome due on leave the following day‚Äîthey were significantly under-strength, lacking provisions. Crossing the Su·ªëi Da Bang creek, the firing point of the mortars was soon located, as were signs of the VC withdrawal. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one VC and wounding two. B Company was subsequently given the task of remaining in the area and searching to the north and east the following day, and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with nothing to report, leaving A and B Company in their night locations. Speculation about the size of the VC in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about VC intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south- east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment. =Patrolling east of Nui Dat, 18 August 1966= B Company, due for leave, returned to Nui Dat on the morning of the 18th. At 07:05 the depleted company‚Äîreduced to a single platoon and Company Headquarters‚Äîcontinued the search east as far as the edge of the rubber plantation, while A Company searched down the Su·ªëi Da Bang towards them. Several weapon pits were located, as were the firing positions of the mortars and RCLs, while discarded stained clothing found nearby confirmed the accuracy of the Australian artillery. At Nui Dat D Company, 6 RAR prepared for its patrol; despite the earlier bombardment, only the standard ammunition load was taken. Smith was briefed by Wickens, who assessed they would be incapable of mounting an ambush due to the effect of the counter-battery mortar fire. While the size of the force was unknown, the possibility it was part of a larger force preparing to move against Nui Dat could not be discounted. The VC were believed able to attack a company-sized force and to launch mortar attacks similar to that the previous morning. Smith then discussed the patrol with Townsend. If B Company had located the withdrawal route used by the mortar crews, he was to follow it with the aim of interdiction; otherwise he was to continue the search until it was located. Assuming D445 Battalion to be the only unit in the area, Smith believed they were looking for that unit's heavy weapons platoon of approximately 30 to 40 men. He briefed his platoon commanders accordingly, although he also felt the VC would have long since left the area. Meanwhile, 5 RAR (minus one company) returned to Nui Dat.  Troop support and continuing pursuit  D Company departed Nui Dat at 11:00 on 18 August. Led by Smith and accompanied by a three-man New Zealand artillery forward observer party under Captain Maurice Stanley, the 108-man company set off quickly. Already behind schedule and with B Company having been out for longer than expected, Smith wanted to relieve Ford and then follow the VC tracks to continue the pursuit that afternoon. Opting for speed, he adopted single file, with 12 Platoon under Second Lieutenant David Sabben in the lead. Despite the heat the company moved at a fast pace, traversing the low scrub, swamp and paddy fields as they closed in on B Company's position. Meanwhile, the rock and roll acts Little Pattie and Col Joye and the Joy Boys had flown into Nui Dat and were setting up for an afternoon concert. Many of the Australians were disappointed at the prospect of missing the entertainment, and as they patrolled east they occasionally heard the music through the trees. At 13:00 they met up with B Company on the edge of the Long T√¢n rubber plantation, approximately from Nui Dat. D Company moved into all- round defence and sentries were posted. While the soldiers had lunch, Smith and Ford inspected the area with a small protection party. The position appeared to have been used by the VC as a staging area prior to the bombardment two nights before, and signs of casualties having been evacuated by cart were located. Blood stains and a quantity of equipment and sandals were also found. The mortar and RCL firing locations were also examined. After briefing Smith, Ford and the remainder of B Company turned for Nui Dat. D Company subsequently took over the pursuit. Smith decided to follow signs of a fresh track leading north-east. Setting off at 15:00, D Company paralleled a well-defined track running slightly uphill. Second Lieutenant Gordon Sharp's 11 Platoon was in the lead, followed by Company Headquarters, with 10 Platoon on the left under Second Lieutenant Geoff Kendall, and 12 Platoon on the right. Each platoon moved in open formation, with two sections forward in arrowhead and one back, on a frontage of approximately . Moving deeper into the plantation, there were select areas with less visibility. After the track divided into two which ran roughly east-south-east in parallel, apart. At the junction, D Company found evidence of the VC mortars having been prepared for firing, while more scattered equipment was found which again indicated the accuracy of the counter-battery fire and a rapid withdrawal. Unable to cover both tracks, Smith radioed Townsend to discuss the situation. It was decided D Company would take the more easterly track, towards the limit of the range of their covering artillery. Smith adopted a \\"two up, one back\\" formation, with 10 Platoon on the left and 11 Platoon on the higher ground to the right. Company Headquarters was in the centre, with 12 Platoon following to the rear. Well dispersed with about between each man, the company had a total frontage of and was about the same in depth. Amid the trees observation was , allowing visual contact between Smith and his platoons. While standard for Australian infantry in such terrain, this spacing was larger than that usually adopted by ARVN or US units. =Initial contact=  First contact with Vietcong  D Company moved off again. Shortly after 11 Platoon's lead section crossed a dirt road running south-west to north-east. Straight, well-established and sunken with a clearing on either side, it was wide and required them to complete an obstacle-crossing drill to traverse it. At 15:40, just as the forward sections entered the tree line on the other side, but before platoon headquarters could follow, a group of six to eight VC approached their right flank along the track from the south. Unaware of their presence, the VC squad continued into the middle of the platoon. One was hit in a brief action after the platoon sergeant, Sergeant Bob Buick, engaged them, while the remainder scattered. They rapidly moved south-east, and although the Australians believed it just another fleeting contact, artillery was called onto their likely withdrawal route south. After pausing to reorganise, 11 Platoon moved into extended line, sweeping the area and recovering an AK-47 and the body of a VC soldier. Sharp reported to Smith that the VC had been dressed in khaki uniforms and were carrying automatic weapons, yet D445 Battalion soldiers typically wore black and were equipped with US-origin bolt-action rifles or carbines. At the time only main force units were so equipped, but the significance was not immediately apparent. With the area clear following the initial contact, Smith ordered D Company to continue the advance. Meanwhile, Second Lieutenant David Harris was at Headquarters 1 ATF at Nui Dat when the first reports came in. As Jackson's aide he was aware of the intelligence being received and believed D Company had clashed with a main force regiment. Harris alerted Jackson, before telephoning Major Bob Hagerty‚Äîofficer commanding 1st APC Squadron‚Äîto warn him of the possible requirement for his standby troop. Site of the battle in 2005 Moving forward again, D Company continued east. 11 Platoon's rapid follow-up had opened a gap with Company Headquarters, while the two lead platoons were also widely dispersed. 11 Platoon penetrated further into the plantation, widening the gap with 10 Platoon to more than . Although 12 Platoon in the rear covered most of the ground bypassed by the forward platoons, the gap was such that their flanking sections had lost sight of each other, while Smith was unable to see them in the dense vegetation. At that distance, the spacing between the Australians was now greater than the maximum effective range of their weapons. Meanwhile, 11 Platoon had moved forward approximately from the first engagement. As Smith reached the site of the contact, the sound of firing continued to the front as Sharp manoeuvred his sections in pursuit of the withdrawing force. Still in extended line, 11 Platoon came across a rubber tapper's hut. Believing sounds coming from it were from VC hiding there, Sharp launched a platoon attack, but the VC had already fled, and the assaulting sections found only two grenades as they swept through the area. Advancing with three sections abreast‚Äî6 Section on the left, 4 Section in the centre and 5 Section on the right‚Äîthey pushed on through the rubber towards a clearing. This formation allowed them to cover a broad front, but offered little flank security. At 16:08, shortly after resuming the advance, 11 Platoon's left flank was engaged by machine-gun fire from an undetected VC force, killing and wounding several men from 6 Section. They went to ground and adopted firing positions, only to be engaged by a second machine-gun firing tracer. The firing lasted two to three minutes then stopped, and Sharp then ordered 5 Section to sweep across the front of the platoon from the right. Yet just as they began to move, they came under heavy small-arms and RPG fire from their front and both flanks. Pinned down by the weight of fire, and under threat of being overrun, the isolated platoon was forced to fight for their lives. Over the next 10 to 15 minutes the VC engaged 11 Platoon with heavy fire, putting their left flank out of action. At that moment a heavy monsoon rain began which reduced visibility to just and turned the ground to mud. Assessing the VC to be in greater strength than previously thought and believing they were preparing to assault his position, Sharp called for artillery fire as he moved to bring his exposed section back into line and then gradually withdraw his platoon into all-round defence. He subsequently reported being under fire from a force estimated to be platoon- sized. The Australians had started the contact thinking they were numerically superior and would attack the VC, yet far from clashing with a small force which would try to withdraw before being decisively engaged, 11 Platoon had run into the forward troops of a main force regiment. Beginning as an encounter battle, heavy fighting ensued as the advancing battalions of the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion clashed with D Company, 6 RAR and attempted to encircle and destroy them. =11 Platoon isolated= Amid the noise of machine-gun and rifle fire and the VC bugle calls, Stanley brought the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery into action to support the Australian infantry. Yet as he was unable to see them, for safety reasons the initial rounds were directed a distance from 11 Platoon's known location, before \\"walking\\" the fire in to between of their position, aided by D Company's favourable location between the VC and the gunline at Nui Dat, which allowed the rounds to pass over their heads and fall away from them. Landing beyond 11 Platoon, the rounds exploded amid the VC as they began to form up for an assault. But with 11 Platoon engaged from its left, front and right, it became clear the VC force was stronger than a platoon, and was probably at least company-sized. Supported by heavy machine-guns, they launched a series of assaults against 11 Platoon, only to be held off by small arms and artillery fire. As the fighting continued, Stanley realised a single artillery battery was insufficient, and at 16:19 requested a regimental fire mission using all 24 guns of the 1st Field Regiment. The VC continued their assault, surging around the flanks of 11 Platoon. The Australians responded with controlled small arms fire, picking off VC soldiers as the rain and artillery continued to fall. After making the required corrections, Stanley requested another regimental fire mission at 16:22, yet still unable to see the rounds land he had to work entirely from radio communications with 11 Platoon, adjusting the fire over an area of using just a map. Australian gunners carry out a fire mission Less than 20 minutes after the first contact more than a third of 11 Platoon had been killed or wounded. Several 60 company-size mm light mortar rounds were fired towards the D Company position and although they landed to the east they further separated the remainder of the company from 11 Platoon, putting the main body behind a slight rise. At 16:26 Smith reported to Townsend that D Company was facing a force using mortars, and called for artillery support. Shortly afterwards Sharp was shot and killed after he raised himself to observe the fall of shot. With the platoon commander dead, Buick took charge of 11 Platoon, directing the artillery through Stanley. Unable to extricate itself, 11 Platoon was almost surrounded. Taking heavy casualties and running short of ammunition, Buick radioed for assistance. Soon after the aerial of the platoon's radio was shot away and communications lost. Meanwhile, Smith requested an air-strike to deal with the mortars. In response, Stanley organised counter-battery fire from the American 155 mm self-propelled howitzers at Nui Dat, which appeared to silence them. Meanwhile, 10 Platoon was approximately to the north and Smith ordered it to move up on the left of 11 Platoon to try to relieve pressure on them and allow a withdrawal back to the company defensive position. Dropping their packs, Kendall's platoon wheeled to the south-east in extended line, advancing towards 11 Platoon. As they came over a small rise, through the rain they observed a VC platoon of 30 to 40 men advancing south, firing on 11 Platoon as they attempted to outflank them. Advancing to close range before dropping to their knees to adopt firing positions, 10 Platoon engaged them from the rear, hitting a large number and breaking up the attack. As the surviving VC withdrew, Kendall pushed on. Yet shortly after 10 Platoon was engaged on three sides from a heavy machine-gun firing tracer from the high ground of the Nui Dat 2 feature to their left, wounding the signaller and damaging the radio, putting it out of action. Now also without communications, and still from 11 Platoon, 10 Platoon moved into a defensive position, fighting to hold on. Finally, a runner arrived from Company Headquarters with a replacement radio, having moved through heavy fire as he tried to locate the platoon, killing two VC with his Owen gun on the way. With the wounded starting to arrive back at Smith's position and communications with 10 Platoon restored, he ordered Kendall to pull back under cover of the artillery. 10 Platoon was ultimately forced back to its start point. =Reaction at Nui Dat= It appeared the VC would shortly overrun D Company if they were not soon reinforced but no quick reaction force was prepared to deploy at short notice. Consequently, it took several hours to organise a relief force. Although essentially a sub-unit battle fought by a rifle company supported by artillery and co-ordinated by Townsend from the 6 RAR command post at Nui Dat, Jackson was concerned. Not only was D Company in trouble, but the entire force might be under threat. VC radio jamming on the battalion command net forced them to switch frequencies to communicate with D Company. Such a jamming capability was rarely found below divisional-level. Intending to lead the company out himself and take command of the battle, at 16:30 Townsend ordered A Company to prepare to reinforce them, despite themselves only having returned from a three-day patrol an hour prior, and 3 Troop, 1st APC Squadron under Lieutenant Adrian Roberts was warned to be ready to lift the relief force. US ground attack aircraft at Bien Hoa Air Base were also placed on alert by Headquarters 1 ATF. Meanwhile, on hearing the sounds of the fighting while returning to Nui Dat, B Company halted short of the base and was ordered to rejoin D Company. Apparently under close observation by the VC, they were engaged by two 60 mm mortars as they turned around, but took no casualties. Requiring the task force commander's permission to send out the relief force and to accompany it, Townsend telephoned Jackson. Concerned for the safety of the entire force, Jackson was initially reluctant to authorise its dispatch should it weaken the position at Nui Dat. Although he was unsure of the size of the VC facing D Company, from Smith's reports it appeared to be at least a regular battalion. Intelligence suggested it was likely from the 275th Regiment, although the location of its remaining two battalions were unknown, as was that of D445 Battalion. The whereabouts of the 274th Regiment was equally unclear. While radio direction finding suggested it may have been near Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy's northern border, three weeks earlier it had been reported close to the western side of the Australian TAOR, and one of its battalions had (incorrectly) been believed involved in an attack on Ph√∫ M·ªπ in the south-west of the province on 11 August. Consequently, Jackson reasoned that if the battle unfolding near Long T√¢n was the opening phase of an attack on Nui Dat, the main assault was still to come, and he would need the bulk of his forces to defend the base. He considered the commitment of A Company would tie up the bulk of 6 RAR and the artillery. Yet Townsend believed Nui Dat's defences sufficient to deter such an attack, even if they remained incomplete, while the strategic reserve held by US II FFV could also be called upon if required. Ultimately Jackson gave in-principle support to the plan, but would not release the relief force until he thought it was warranted. =Fighting continues= By 16:50, it was apparent to Smith that he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength. Yet with his two forward platoons still separated and unable to support each other, D Company was badly positioned for a defensive battle. 10 Platoon had been prevented from engaging the VC attacking 11 Platoon, and was unable to support its withdrawal. Meanwhile, 11 Platoon had gone to ground in extended line following the initial contact, leaving its flanks vulnerable, while its aggressive push forward prior to the engagement also complicated the application of artillery support, which had to be switched to support each platoon as required rather than allowing it to be concentrated. Unable to see either platoon, the D Company forward observer was unsure of 11 Platoon's exact position. As a consequence 10 and 11 Platoons were each forced to fight their own battles, and despite the weight of the indirect fire increasingly becoming available to support the Australian infantry, the VC were able to apply superior firepower as they tried to isolate and attack each platoon in turn. To retrieve the situation, Smith planned to pull his company into an all-round defensive position, enabling his platoons to support each other fighting a co-ordinated battle and care for the wounded until a relief force could arrive. The VC moved to overrun the beleaguered force, but the dispersal of the Australian platoons made it difficult for them to find D Company's flanks and roll them up, and may have led the VC commander to believe he was engaging a much larger force. US F-4 Phantoms over South Vietnam In the meantime, Buick repaired the 11 Platoon radio and re-established communications with Company Headquarters, and with Stanley, who was again able to adjust the artillery by radio. The VC succeeded in closing to within of 11 Platoon's position, and much of the artillery was beginning to fall behind them. Although the fire was probably impacting the VC rear area and causing casualties there, these assault troops had deliberately closed with the Australians to negate its effect. Buick estimated 11 Platoon was being assaulted by at least two companies; down to the last of their ammunition and with just 10 of its 28 men still able to fight, he feared they would soon be overrun, and were unlikely to survive beyond the next 10 to 15 minutes. Confident the rest of D Company would be attempting to reach them, but unable to see how that might occur, Buick requested artillery fire onto his own position despite the danger this entailed. Stanley refused, but after confirming 11 Platoon's precarious situation, he was able to walk the artillery in closer. Landing to their front, the artillery detonated among a large concentration of VC troops, destroying an entire assault line as they formed up. At 17:00, three US F-4 Phantoms arrived on station for an airstrike arranged by Battalion Headquarters.  Ammunition shortage and urgent request for support of D Company  At 17:02, Smith reported D Company was running low on ammunition and required aerial resupply. With just three magazines carried by each rifleman, they were only lightly equipped prior to the battle. This was a standard load calculated on 1 RAR usage rates which had been enough during previous actions, but it proved insufficient for sustained fighting. Due to the thick vegetation, the ammunition boxes would need to be dropped through the trees, and intending on moving his headquarters behind a low knoll, Smith nominated a point west. This position would afford greater protection, while the helicopters would be less likely to attract ground fire. Yet with their casualties now unable to be moved, D Company would have to remain where it was. Townsend passed the ammunition demand to Headquarters 1 ATF. In response, Jackson requested two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF to deliver it; however, the senior RAAF officer at Nui Dat, Group Captain Peter Raw, was not prepared to risk aircraft hovering at tree-top height in the heavy rain where they would be exposed to ground fire, citing Department of Air regulations. Relations between the Army and RAAF over the use of the helicopters had become increasingly bitter in the preceding months, and were still tenuous despite recent improvements. Jackson requested American assistance, and when the US Army liaison officer responded more favourably, Raw felt no alternative than to accede to the original request, offering to effect the resupply instead. By coincidence, two RAAF Iroquois were available at Nui Dat, having been used for the concert. Smith called for the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived, but the rain and low cloud obscured the coloured smoke the Australians had thrown to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, but as Smith was unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted the aircraft to move out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft to attack the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing the VC command element to be located there. The artillery fire recommenced as the VC formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor‚Äîofficer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support‚Äîserved as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries and the American medium artillery. Stanley called down the fire or relayed the direction of the assault, from which Honnor selected targets and ordered the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Although the rain and the soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable conditions: the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting VC, the convenient range of at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued AN/PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat. =12 Platoon attempts to link up with Buick= Having been repulsed on the left, Smith tried the right flank. Pushing his headquarters forward, he ordered Sabben to move 12 Platoon‚Äîuntil then held in reserve‚Äîto support 11 Platoon. As new radio traffic was received, Smith was again forced to ground to work on fresh orders, while the arrival of casualties required the establishment of an aid post in the dead ground, which effectively tied them in location and prevented further manoeuvre. After more than an hour of fighting, D Company was still widely dispersed; 10 Platoon had been unable to break through to 11 Platoon from the north, and there remained only a slight chance 12 Platoon would have more success from the north-west. With the VC enjoying a considerable numerical advantage, Smith feared his platoons would be defeated in detail and that it was only a matter of time before his entire company was overrun, despite the devastating effect of the artillery on the VC assault formations. 12 Platoon departed at 17:15, moving south-east in an attempt to retrieve the now cut-off 11 Platoon, but having been forced to leave 9 Section behind to protect Company Headquarters and support the wounded, with just two sections it was significantly under- strength. Smith requested an airmobile assault to reinforce his position, but due to the bad weather, poor visibility and lack of a suitable landing zone this was considered impossible. Instead, Townsend informed him an infantry company mounted in APCs would be dispatched as a relief force. At 17:05 Roberts had arrived at the 6 RAR headquarters at Nui Dat with his troop of 10 APCs, and was briefed by the Operations Officer on the situation before departing to pick up A Company from their lines. Yet Jackson was reluctant to reduce the defences at Nui Dat, considering the attack a possible feint. Consequently, although Smith repeatedly pressed Townsend, there was a delay of more than an hour from when the relief force was ordered to ready themselves until Roberts was allowed to move. Townsend finally ordered the relief force to move at 17:30, having received Jackson's approval. A Company, 6 RAR and 3 Troop were on standby in the company lines and departed fifteen minutes later. With the route largely dictated by the terrain, the possibility of the relief force being ambushed concerned Townsend and Jackson, but given the dire situation, they saw no alternative, and considered it unlikely, given the ground had been covered by frequent patrols, the proximity of D Company's position to Nui Dat, the open country between the base and rubber plantation, and that it was not yet dark. With 5 RAR back at Nui Dat, Jackson ordered it to take over the defensive positions normally occupied by 6 RAR, while deploying a platoon to the 1st APC Squadron lines, and placing D Company, 5 RAR on one hour's notice to move if required. The remainder of the battalion prepared to repel any attack on Nui Dat or to pursue the VC if they withdrew. No. 9 Squadron RAAF Iroquois in Vietnam Meanwhile, after departing D Company's position, the two sections from 12 Platoon moved south towards the sound of firing heard approximately away. Unaware of the exact position of 11 Platoon, Sabben instead located the rubber tapper's hut previously assaulted by Sharp in the opening phases of the battle. As they advanced, they were forced to fight off an attack on their right flank, before eventually pushing forward another . By this time, the VC had succeeded in pushing behind 11 Platoon in an effort to outflank them, and a large force clashed with 12 Platoon as they attempted to come to their aid. Advancing from the north, two VC platoons then assaulted the Australians, who were now heavily engaged from three directions. Meeting a similar fate to 10 Platoon, Sabben's men were forced to ground short of their objective, and were themselves in danger of being encircled. Sustaining increasing casualties, they clashed with several groups of VC trying to move around their western flank to get between 11 and 12 Platoon and form a cut-off force prior to mounting a frontal assault. In so doing, 12 Platoon succeeded in opening a path to 11 Platoon, yet after 45 minutes under fire Sabben was unable to advance any further, and with the rain reducing visibility to just he was unsure of Buick's location. At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's location with the ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they hovered in the heavy rain just above the rubber trees near a small clearing. Because they were to be dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn and the Administration Company commander, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Without tools to cut the metal straps on the crates, the infantry had to smash them open using machetes or the butts of their rifles. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but now the Australians resumed firing, forcing the VC back for a third time. =D Company regroups= Despite being exposed to heavy fire from three sides, 11 Platoon had maintained its position for over two hours, narrowly holding off the VC with small arms fire and massive artillery support. However, many of the platoon had been killed or wounded, and most of the survivors were now out of ammunition. To their rear Sabben threw yellow smoke in the hope it would be seen through the trees by the beleaguered platoon. Finally, with the close artillery fire causing heavy casualties among the assaulting VC, Buick decided to take advantage of a temporary lull in the fighting to achieve a clean break. Intending to withdraw west to regroup, on his signal the platoon rose to their feet. One of the Australians was immediately shot and killed as he did so, while two more were wounded before they reached a position of temporary safety. From this location Buick could see yellow smoke away, and believing it to be Smith's headquarters, 11 Platoon moved towards it in what Buick described as a \\"mad scramble\\" in his autobiography, calling out to identify themselves as they approached. Locating 12 Platoon instead, but still finding themselves heavily engaged, the two platoons then moved back to the company position covered by the artillery and torrential rain. By 18:10 D Company had reformed, and the VC appeared to have momentarily broken contact. Having concentrated his company, Smith began to re-organise it into a position of all-round defence. Smith attempted to place his depleted platoons into a defensible position, but D Company's location had been dictated by the actions of the VC and the need to care for the wounded, and as a result they had little choice of where to make their stand. However, with the Australians occupying a shallow fold in the ground on a reverse slope the terrain proved decisive. The VC found it difficult to use their heavy calibre weapons effectively and could only engage at close range. The jungle covered Nui Dat 2 feature lay to the north-east, and an impenetrable wall of thick bamboo and scrub abutted the lower slopes to the west. The remainder of the position faced the relatively open rubber plantation. Believing the northern approach unsuitable for a major assault, Smith assessed the most likely VC courses of action to be a frontal assault from the east, or a flanking attack from either the south or south-west. As a consequence, he placed 10 and 12 Platoons in positions on the southern and eastern flanks, while the badly mauled 11 Platoon was allocated a position to the north-west. Company Headquarters was located in the south-west. During the lull, Smith walked around the position to gain an understanding of the situation and check the wounded. With one platoon almost destroyed, and the other two at approximately 75 percent strength, D Company had been battered but morale remained high. Kirby completed the distribution of ammunition and Stanley plotted new defensive fire tasks for the artillery. The respite proved brief as the VC soon located the Australian position. At 18:20 they re-engaged D Company with concentrated machine-gun fire from the east and south-east as they reorganised for a further attack. Movement was soon detected through the trees; however, at a distance of the Australians thought they may have been B Company, and only engaged the VC as they moved out of range to the north. By following up the withdrawal of 12 Platoon and conducting probes, the attackers succeeded in confirming D Company's position. A company-sized VC force formed up to the south on a broad frontage which threatened to engulf them. The assault commenced at 18:35, with several bugle blasts marking the beginning of a series of attacks against D Company. Well spaced, the assault force stepped- off at a fast walk supported by a company in reserve which moved to their rear. Yet as they did so an accurate barrage from the Australian artillery fell among them, effectively destroying the rear echelon. The assault force continued on, only to be engaged with small arms just from the forward Australian positions. Lacking any reserve, the assault was halted, although many of unwounded attackers attempted to crawl around the D Company perimeter, and snipers fired from the trees. A second assault soon advanced over the same ground, only to again be hit by artillery, with those unscathed going to ground among the dead and wounded. As they moved forward, they were joined by survivors of the first assault and together attempted to roll over the Australians. The VC then to site another heavy machine-gun from the D Company perimeter, but Kirby killed the crew. Despite the casualties, attacks continued, supported by machine-guns. The main attacks came from the east, south-east and south, falling on 10 and 12 Platoons, with smaller ones elsewhere. However, due to the slope of the ground, much of the fire passed over the heads of the defenders. The slope likewise screened the advancing VC, preventing either side from effectively firing on the other until the VC closed within 50 metres, but few survived the artillery fire to get that close. Meanwhile, the VC had set up a light and a heavy machine-gun on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 and these continued to engage the Australians. While they were able to achieve plunging fire from this vantage point, they were unable to observe D Company's position through the rubber trees and so were reduced to sweeping a broad area. Australian casualties included four killed and several wounded during this period, the majority from head and chest wounds. =A Company and 3 Troop fight through= By 18:45, D Company had succeeded in moving into an all-round defensive position, throwing back heavy attacks With D Company unable to manoeuvre, the initiative lay with the VC, the 1 ATF's artillery holding them at bay, with the main role of the infantry increasingly becoming one of protecting their forward observer. Stanley's efforts remained crucial to the survival of D Company, with the ability to strike artillery more precisely in closer combat. The close fire devastated the VC ranks, however a mistake led to the wounding of a member of D Company. Nonetheless, D Company was heavily outnumbered, unlikely to survive another assault; a simultaneous attack would completely overrun them. The battle's outcome rested on whether they could keep the VC at bay long enough for reinforcements. A fresh force was observed moving to the west, likely an attempt to encircle and cut off D Company. M113 similar to those used at Long Tan  Initial delays of the relief force  The relief force had been delayed by several factors, including flooding from the heavy rain, VC action, poor equipment, limited communications and an ambiguous command relationship between the armour and infantry. 3 Troop was exceedingly exposed, with their APC strength reduced from 13 to seven, with the remainder undergoing maintenance, many of the remainder marred with mechanical errors. In an attempt to supplement their APC's, three vehicles from 2 Troop, devoid of gun shields, were used leaving the crew commander exposed. Mounted in the carriers, 100 men from A Company 6 RAR departed Nui Dat ordered to relieve pressure on D Company by attacking from the south and then to reinforce them and secure the area to allow the evacuation of the wounded. With few gaps in the Nui Dat perimeter wide enough for the APCs, a longer route was taken, and a diverted exit led to further delays until an alternative was located. At 17:55, after finally clearing the wire, Roberts was ordered to send two APCs back for Townsend and to wait until he came up, as he intended to accompany the carriers rather than move by helicopter. Detaching two APCs, Roberts ignored the second part of the order and the remainder of the troop proceeded, leaving Nui Dat at 18:00. As the rain began, Roberts moved along the edge of the rubber plantation north-east of Long Ph∆∞·ªõc in column towards the heavily swollen Su·ªëi Da Bang. The terracing of the paddy fields resulted in a steep drop to the creek and a difficult climb out; however, using a bullock track alongside a dam, Roberts swam the carriers across the water, despite the threat of fast flowing water At 18:10, Roberts was ordered for a second time to halt and wait for Townsend. Continuing to monitor D Company's situation over the radio, he again chose to disregard the order. After crossing without incident, Roberts left one carrier and its infantry to secure the point (and to act as a guide for Townsend), while the remaining seven APCs moved towards the battle. Advancing another kilometre, by 18:20 they reached the junction leading directly to the fighting; using it as his centre axis, Roberts deployed one section of three APCs on the right commanded by Sergeant Ron Richards and one on the left under Sergeant Leslie O'Reilly, each with two vehicles forward and one back evenly spaced approximately 40m apart, while he remained in the centre moving astride the road. They rapidly began to advance on a 300m frontage. Despite being again ordered to wait by Townsend, Roberts once more decided to press on.  Battle with D445 Battalion and Further small battles  The relief force moved into the plantation in open formation, unaware of the location of D Company or the VC. With visibility limited by the low vegetation of the young rubber trees and the heavy rain, they suddenly encountered a company moving west in arrowhead dressed in greens, cloth hats and webbing. Realising they were VC attempting to outflank D Company, Lieutenant Peter Dinham ordered the crew commander to engage. The rain had masked their approach and the VC ( D445 Battalion), initially caught by surprise, returned fire. Dinham ordered the rear door open and the remainder of the men in the APC‚Äîconsisting of platoon headquarters and one section‚Äîdisembarked to protect him. Moving into extended line, they advanced, engaging the VC and causing heavy casualties. The spontaneous assault caught them by surprise, adding to their growing disorder. All serving to delay the relief force. After re-embarking the infantry, 3 Troop resumed the advance, breaking into the VC force as it streamed west, firing their .50 calibre machine-guns and small arms. D445 Battalion was forced to withdraw east, having lost an estimated 40 killed, while one Australian was wounded. 3 Troop continued forward in assault formation, moving deeper into the plantation, with improved visibility allowing them to increase speed. By 18:30. B Company was also drawing near on foot, and observed the VC moving around the western flank, likely to escape the APCs. Shortly after, they were accidentally engaged by the APCs and lost one man wounded. After moving a further 200m, the relief force came out of the tree-line and were confronted by groups of 8 to 10 VC moving east, in total about 100 men, believed to be the lead elements of the force that had just been struck, now withdrawing after abandoning its attempt to outflank D Company. The APCs opened fire, engaging their flank with heavy machine-guns. A number were hit while others turned to engage the APCs as it closed with them. A 57 mm RCL then fired on one of the APCs at close range with the round narrowly missing and blowing apart a tree which fell across the vehicle. The crew commander, Corporal John Carter, engaged the anti-armour team from the top of the APC as they reloaded, but his .50 calibre machine-gun jammed as they fired again, and he killed two of them with his Owen gun from just . The second RCL round subsequently detonated against the fallen tree, saving both the vehicle and its occupants. Despite being dazed, Carter killed three more VC soldiers as he scrambled back into the carrier, which was now without communications following the destruction of its aerial. By drawing further fire he allowed the remainder of the troop to advance. The potential presence of a second RCL team sited in mutual support forced the APCs to halt, once again. Concerned about the danger of bypassing an anti- armour weapon only to be engaged from the rear, Roberts ordered the troop to scan the area. Frustrated by the delay, Mollison demanded Roberts continue the advance, and an argument broke out between the two. As commander of the APCs, Roberts ignored the senior ranking Mollison, refusing to continue until he either located the weapon or was confident the threat did not exist. After a five-minute delay, with no weapon located, the Australians moved off again. A machine-gun engaged three APCs without gun shields. Under heavy fire, the troop sergeant ran between the carriers to take command of the APC, after Roberts ordered him to return to Nui Dat due to the mistaken belief some of the infantry on board had also been wounded. Despite Mollison's objections, the vehicle departed, taking the headquarters of one of the infantry platoons with it. Still uncertain of the location of D Company, Roberts was forced to closely control the fire of the troop due to the concern any survivors might be hit by overshoots from the armoured vehicle's heavy machine-guns. At the same time, the infantry continued to engage from the rear of the vehicles. A further 45 VC were estimated to have been killed during this action. =D Company reinforced= Unaware of the hold up on the left flank, the right hand section of APCs continued to advance. Pressing on, the section moved through the friendly artillery fire targeting the D445 Battalion as it had attempted to outflank D Company. As they moved closer to D Company the carriers were engaged by small arms and RPGs, continuing through and returning fire. The arrival of the carriers led to the men from D Company to stand and cheer. At the same time, Dinham's platoon dug in at the Eastern flank of D Company, awaiting the arrival of the remainder of A Company. To the west Roberts and the three remaining carriers of 3 Troop had resumed the advance and linked up with Richards at a junction in the road south-west of D Company. Townsend arrived with elements of his headquarters aboard three more M113s at 18:50. Following a number of uncoordinated manoeuvres by the APCs Townsend took command, and with the light failing he ordered Roberts to assault from the west into the flank of the main VC force.  Arrival of the APCs and turning tide of the battle  Bolstered to nine M113s, 3 Troop again moved forward through the artillery fire with Roberts spreading the additional APCs across the rear of his formation for depth. Utilising a track as a guide he reformed the troop into a wide assault formation. Beginning the advance at 18:55, 3 Troop prepared for a frontal assault on the VC force. Continuing past D Company to their left, the APCs moved forward rapidly, firing their machine- guns. A brief but heavy engagement occurred, with the VC responding with automatic fire, including tracer and explosive rounds, mostly missing. Arriving at a crucial point in the fighting, the APCs turned the tide of the battle. The VC had been massing for another assault which would likely have destroyed D Company, yet the additional firepower and mobility of the APCs broke their will to fight, forcing them to break contact and begin to withdraw as night approached. At 19:00 the 32 men from B Company finally entered D Company's position, even as the APCs continued to assault the VC. After a long approach under mortar fire and the threat of ambush by a superior force, Smith placed Ford on the western side of the D Company defensive position to act as a screen to allow them to treat their wounded and prepare to resist a counter- attack. 3 Troop swept forward with the APCs continuing to assault a further before Townsend ordered their return. Turning north-west, Roberts moved back to the company location at 19:10. Yet even as they did so the VC continued to attack from the north-east, although this too was soon broken off. Linking up with D Company, the APCs moved through the company position. Around the perimeter the Australians engaged the withdrawing VC, while the APCs moved into a line from north to south on the eastern side of the company position. A Company disembarked and took up firing positions between the vehicles, joining 2 Platoon. The artillery had been almost constant throughout the battle and had prevented D Company from being destroyed. By 19:15 the firing had ceased and as darkness fell they prepared for the VC to mount another attack. Although snipers continued to engage the Australians there were no further assaults and the battle came to a conclusion. The APCs formed a hollow square around D Company. With the VC at least temporarily driven off, the Australian position was now more strongly held and additional ammunition had been brought in by the APCs, but it was now dark and they would be unable to receive further reinforcement, while the ability of the VC to mount a night attack was unknown. Meanwhile, the expenditure of artillery ammunition had been high and an urgent demand for 1,000 rounds was submitted by 1st Field Regiment, RAA at 19:30 in case the fighting continued. However, with arrangements for the emergency aerial resupply of Nui Dat by night still being worked out, and with a road resupply by 1 ALSG in danger of being ambushed, it took several hours for the rounds to be loaded and delivered by CH-47 Chinook from V≈©ng T√†u.  Townsend assuming command of D company  Townsend assumed command as the defenders regrouped, while Kirby co-ordinated the collection of the dead and wounded. In total, one of the platoons had been destroyed and D Company was \\"non-effective\\", with five dead, 16 wounded and 16 men still missing. VC losses were believed to have been heavy; but with no confirmed casualty figures it looked to the Australians like they had suffered a defeat. The two officers agreed it would be impossible to secure the battlefield or to attempt to locate the missing from 11 Platoon in the darkness, and after it became clear the VC were not going to counter-attack, Townsend ordered a withdrawal to a position to the west from whence their casualties could be evacuated. Handling the dead and wounded proved a slow process but with the casualties finally loaded onto the carriers D Company left at 22:45, while B and A Companies departed on foot 45 minutes later. Roberts established a landing zone by forming a square and illuminated it with the interior lights of the APCs by opening their top hatches. The artillery fire ceased as the evacuation commenced with the first casualties taken out by a US Army Dustoff helicopter, while the remainder were extracted by six UH-1Bs from No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Despite being slowed by the requirement for the helicopters to land without lights, the operation went smoothly and was completed after midnight. The last casualties were taken out by 00:34, and flown to the Australian hospital at V≈©ng T√†u. During the night the artillery continued to fire on likely VC forming-up points, although 11 Platoon's final position was avoided for fear of hitting any survivors, while US aircraft bombed likely withdrawal routes to the east. Forming a defensive position ready to repulse an expected attack the Australians remained overnight, enduring the cold and heavy rain. Although they were now in a better position to hold off an attack, further reinforcement from 1 ATF at night was difficult and was therefore unlikely. Yet with the VC spent no further attack was mounted. Smith and Townsend spent the night in the back of one of the carriers planning the clearance of the battlefield and pursuit of the VC, which was scheduled for the following day under the codename Operation Smithfield. Jackson stipulated the force was to remain within artillery range, but would otherwise have freedom of action to complete the exploitation over the next two to three days. Townsend requested the remaining APCs bring out 6 RAR headquarters, C Company and a section of mortars the following morning, while D Company, 5 RAR would also be placed under his command for the operation. However, with a company from 5 RAR still in B√¨nh Ba, the bulk of 1 ATF's remaining combat power would be deployed as part of the clearance, leaving just two companies from 5 RAR to defend Nui Dat. Smith was determined to recover the missing from 11 Platoon, and despite its losses, D Company would lead the assault. =Clearing the battlefield, 19‚Äì21 August 1966= Australian soldiers and M113 APCs during Operation Smithfield By morning the weather had cleared. At 06:55 the remainder of 6 RAR departed Nui Dat with 2 Troop, 1st APC Squadron, while D Company, 5 RAR departed at the same time aboard US Army helicopters. Meanwhile, at 07:40 Jackson arrived at 6 RAR's night location to observe the clearance, flying in as Townsend gave orders for the operation. Stepping off at 08:45, the Australians returned to the battlefield in strength, while artillery and airstrikes continued to hit the area. The battalion group moved in a \\"two up\\" formation with D Company, 5 RAR and D Company, 6 RAR both mounted in APCs as the forward left and forward right assault companies, followed by A, B and C Companies in depth, each dismounted. The assault companies planned to sweep the area then dismount and commence a detailed search, while the others would clear the surrounding features and begin the follow-up. Moving cautiously in case the VC launched a counter-attack, they advanced along the route used by D Company, 6 RAR the previous day. The battlefield was a scene of devastation, with rubber trees stripped of leaves and branches and bleeding sap, while the area around D Company's final position was heavily cratered. At 09:21 D Company, 5 RAR reported finding the body of a dead VC soldier; while half an hour later D Company, 6 RAR found 12 to 15 more. A large number of VC dead were found, including a 60 mm mortar crew. At 10:20 a bulldozer was requested to bury the bodies of approximately 100 VC soldiers.  Scale of Vietcong defeat and treatment of wounded Vietcong  As the scale of the VC's losses were revealed, it became clear D Company had won a significant victory. By late morning, a total of 113 bodies and two wounded had been found, while numerous drag marks and blood trails indicated many more casualties had been moved the previous night. With the clearance continuing, two wounded VC still bearing arms were killed by D Company, 6 RAR after they moved to engage them, while in a separate incident another wounded soldier was also killed. A third wounded VC was later captured; and all three wounded were given first aid then being evacuated. These events later caused controversy when journalist Ian Mackay published claims in 1968 that the Australians had deliberately killed unarmed VC wounded, citing a \\"witness\\" to the alleged incident; while a major newspaper stated they had killed wounded \\"civilians\\". An official investigation determined the allegations were exaggerated and based on hearsay, with the soldier claimed as the source found not to have been present during the fighting and those killed confirmed to have been armed. Similar accusations were made in 1986 by Terry Burstall, a former D Company soldier, who claimed up to 17 wounded VC had been executed, although they were also refuted, and his credibility challenged. In 2000, Buick admitted in his memoirs to having killed a mortally wounded soldier the day after the battle as an act of mercy. Burstall argued this may have constituted a breach of the Geneva Convention; while Buick's decision to publish was questioned by John Heslewood, the President of the Australian Long Tan Association and a private in 11 Platoon during the battle. Mollison later also criticised Buick's actions. In his 2015 autobiography, Harry Smith states that two mortally wounded VC soldiers were killed on 19 August out of compassion, one by Buick and another by a soldier from A Company, 6 RAR.  Recovery of lost Australian troops  Second Lieutenant Dave Sabben advances cautiously through the rubber plantation the day after the battle At 11:00 6 RAR reported they had located the missing men from 11 Platoon, their bodies found lying in a straight line where they had been killed, largely undisturbed and still holding their weapons. The majority were from 6 Section, which had been the first to be hit. One man was found to have survived despite his wounds, having spent the night on the battlefield in close proximity to the VC as they attempted to evacuate their own casualties. Another wounded soldier had been found nearby, leaning against a tree but still alive. Both were evacuated, and later recuperated in hospital. Thirteen Australian dead were also recovered, accounting for all the missing. As the search continued, VC dead were found up to south-east of the position reached by 11 Platoon. A large bunker complex was uncovered consisting of 200 pits with overhead protection sufficient for a battalion, but its layout suggested it had been constructed as a defensive position rather than for an ambush. Another position of 100 pits was found to the east. By 14:35, the total number of VC dead was reported as 168. A large amount of weapons and equipment were uncovered, including assault rifles, mortars, light machine guns, submachine guns, an RCL, plus ammunition and grenades. By 18:10, the figure had risen to 188 VC dead, with shallow graves dug by the Australians to bury them where they were found. Due to the likely presence of a significant force nearby, the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the VC. Over the next two days, they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering more dead as they did so. Yet, with up to two VC battalions still believed to be in the area and the continued vulnerability of Nui Dat to attack from the 274th Regiment, Jackson lacked the resources to pursue the withdrawing force. Company patrols searched up to east, and to the north of Nui Dat 2. The search area was subsequently expanded to include that contested during Operation Hobart. Several tracks were found with telephone cables running along them, as well as more drag marks, blood stains, discarded equipment, fresh graves and evidence of use by heavy cart and foot traffic. The main VC withdrawal route was discovered after midday on 19 August. Townsend requested permission to follow it, believing he had sufficient forces, but Jackson would only permit 6 RAR to advance a further , remaining within artillery cover, and would not allow the guns to move forward to increase the range of their protective fire. By 20 August, the Australians had counted 245 VC dead, while scores more were found later. Up to four weeks after the battle, decomposed bodies were still found in the area, while numerous graves were also located, none of which were included in the estimates of VC losses. The bodies found later brought the total to about 300 dead. D Company, 5 RAR returned to Nui Dat early on 21 August, while D Company, 6 RAR was withdrawn for two days leave in Vung Tau. The rest of 6 RAR continued the search, with A Company discovering a series of freshly built and recently abandoned hides along the VC withdrawal route, which were believed to have been prepared as delay positions. An older defensive position of approximately 40 pits was also found, while C Company located a makeshift hospital close by containing 14 graves. Both had recently been occupied. Later, an Australian OH-13 reported the presence of scattered groups of civilians, with the largest numbering 30 to 40 people‚Äîmostly women with baskets and bags, while others had ox carts‚Äîbelieved to be carrying medical supplies. These reports were followed up by the 1st APC Squadron and a number of military age males were detained for questioning. The infantry companies completed their search by midday, moving to the edge of the rubber plantation, north-east of Long T√¢n. Smithfield concluded at 17:00, with the Australians returning to Nui Dat by helicopter and APC by 17:30. They had hoped to catch the remnants of the VC force before they could reach their mountain sanctuaries, but the operation failed to prevent their withdrawal. Some Australian officers later questioned the caution with which it was conducted. Jackson felt unable to mount a pursuit due to the continued threat posed by the 274th Regiment, which was still believed to be in the area. With 1 ATF lacking the resources required for such an operation, the opportunity to trap and destroy the VC while they were still vulnerable was lost and they made good their escape. Aftermath =Casualties= Corporal Buddy Lea, who was wounded in the battle, holding a photo of his daughter VC and PAVN casualties were claimed by the Australians to have numbered 245 dead left on the battlefield and three captured, with many more were thought to have been removed as they withdrew. Others were so badly mutilated their remains were unidentifiable. Approximately half were believed to have been caused by artillery and the remainder by small arms. The initial estimate was given by an Australian Army spokesman, and some participants in the battle regarded them as inflated. They were disputed by many individuals present at the battle, with reports by a D Company commander stating actual body counts as no more than 50. The official history of the D445 Battalion and 275th Regiment records either 30 or 47 were killed in total, primarily by artillery fire. Another estimate was 150 according to Colonel Bao who was overall district commander, but did not directly participate. The Australians estimated the VC had evacuated up to a further 350 casualties, including an unknown number of dead buried along the withdrawal route. With such losses representing the operational strength of two battalions, Australian intelligence assessed that the 275th Regiment, which had borne the brunt of the fighting, would be incapable of mounting a regimental-sized operation for several months, but the 275th Regiment carried out attacks against the ARVN 18th Division a week later. D445 Battalion, thought to have played a supporting role and to have suffered less heavily, was assessed as still capable of engaging forces up to company size, with a remaining strength of 300 men. McNeill states that this was based on the capture of the diary of the battle commander Nguyen Thoi Bung, who later became the Deputy Defense Minister of Vietnam; but according to Ernest Chamberlain this has not been corroborated. A captured soldier stated D445 Battalion's casualties had been 70 killed and 100 wounded. Whether the combat effectiveness of D445 and the 275th Regiment was eroded is in dispute, as the D445 were redeployed in September and October against the newly deployed 11th Armored Cavalry Taskforce, while the 275th were combat- capable a week later. Weapons captured included 33 AK-47s, seven RPD light machine-guns, five SKS assault rifles, four RPG-2 launchers, two 57 mm RCLs, two M1 carbines, a PPSh-41, Thompson submachine-gun, Browning Automatic Rifle, M1 Garand and an SGM heavy machine-gun. More than 10,500 rounds of small arms ammunition was recovered, as well as 300 hand grenades, 40 mortar bombs, 28 RPG-2 rockets and 22 RCL rounds. Australian losses were 17 killed, one died of wounds and 24 wounded: approximately one third of the initial force engaged. A high proportion were National Servicemen, drawing criticism in Australia where conscription for overseas service was increasingly controversial. The government later limited the number of conscripts to no more than 50 percent of a unit, requiring a rapid and disruptive reorganisation within 1 ATF. =Recognition= In the aftermath, both sides claimed success. Heralded as an Australian victory against overwhelming odds, the battle was widely covered in the Western press, making headlines in Australia and the United States. 1 ATF received congratulatory messages from the US, South Vietnamese and Australian military commands in Vietnam, and from Prime Minister Harold Holt, while General William Westmoreland considered it one of the more spectacular allied victories to that point in the war. Despite their losses, the VC claimed to have inflicted a heavy defeat on the Australians. Shortly afterwards, leaflets circulated the province stating that \\"700 Australians were killed, one battalion and two companies were destroyed and two squadrons of APCs\\". Similar claims were repeated on Radio Hanoi on 27 August 1966, and the day after on Radio Peking. In contrast, the Vietnamese history of Dong Nai Province published in 1986 gave the battle little attention, claiming to have \\"eliminated 500 Australians and destroyed 21 tanks\\" while their own losses were not recorded. D445 Battalion later received a PAVN heroic unit citation, and the 275th Regiment may have been given a similar award. Many VC soldiers were also awarded Certificates of Commendation for their role in the fighting. Australian troops with weapons captured at Long Tan D Company, 6 RAR was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation by President Lyndon Johnson on 28 May 1968. The Royal Australian Regiment and 3rd Cavalry Regiment were later awarded the battle honour \\"Long Tan\\", one of only five presented to Australian units during the war. Commonwealth decorations were made to 17 Australians and New Zealanders, including Smith who received the Military Cross (MC), Carter and Kirby the Distinguished Conduct Medal, Stanley the Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Buick the Military Medal, Riley was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and Dohle, Roberts, Kendall and Sabben were mentioned in despatches. Both Townsend and Jackson later received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), although these were on the basis of their entire period in command, not solely for actions during the battle. South Vietnamese gallantry medals were also awarded to 22 Australians, but due to official policy regarding foreign awards they were not permitted to wear them until 2004. The limited number of awards later became the subject of considerable criticism. At the time, the allocation of medals under the Imperial honours system was based on a quota, resulting in many of the original recommendations being downgraded or not awarded, with Smith initially nominated for the DSO, Sabben and Kendall the MC, and Sharp a posthumous mention in despatches. In 2008, a review recommended awards made to three officers be upgraded to the equivalent medals in the modern Australian honours system. Smith was subsequently awarded the Star of Gallantry, and Kendall and Sabben the Medal for Gallantry (MG). Following further review in 2009, Dohle received the Distinguished Service Medal, while D Company, 6 RAR was presented a Unit Citation for Gallantry on 18 August 2011. Another review in 2016 led to awards to ten more soldiers, including Roberts, Alcorta and Lance Corporal Barry Magnussen who received the MG, and Sharp and six others a Commendation for Gallantry. On 18 August 1969, 6 RAR erected the Long Tan Cross on the battlefield. =Assessment= Initial estimates of the VC force ranged from several companies to a battalion, yet following the battle Australian intelligence assessed it as having totalled between 1,500 and 2,500 men, while 1,000 were believed to have directly engaged D Company. The fighting left one- third of D Company killed or wounded. Long T√¢n proved a local setback for the VC, forestalling movement against Nui Dat. Although there were other large- scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. The battle established the task force's dominance over the province, and allowed it to pursue operations to restore government authority. Yet such actions were atypical of the Australian experience, and although 1 ATF invariably inflicted heavy casualties on the VC when encountered in large numbers, they were less important than routine patrolling in separating the guerrillas from the population and maintaining constant pressure, coupled with pacification operations to extend South Vietnamese control. Nonetheless, Long T√¢n represented a watershed in the campaign, increasing the confidence of the Australians in their ability to defeat the VC and enhancing their military reputation. The reasons for D Company's survival included superior radio communications which had allowed Stanley to co-ordinate the fire of the guns at Nui Dat, the weight of the artillery which repeatedly broke up the assaulting formations, its timely aerial resupply which prevented them running out of ammunition, and the mobility and firepower of the APCs in the relief force which broke the VC's will to fight. The battle highlighted the power of modern weapons and the importance of sound small-unit tactics, and has since been cited as an example of the effect of combined arms, demonstrating the effective coordination of infantry, armour, artillery and aviation. Artillery was the mainstay of the defence, with D Company supported by 24 guns of the 1st Field Regiment, RAA and A Battery, US 2/35th Artillery Battalion. Indirect fire provided close protection to the infantry, allowing D Company to hold their line and repulse any VC that succeeded in getting through the barrage. Likely forming-up positions and withdrawal routes had also been heavily engaged throughout the battle. In total 3,198 rounds of 105 mm ammunition were fired by the Australian and New Zealand field guns and 242 rounds of 155 mm high explosive by the Americans. The VC made the error of attacking within range of the artillery at Nui Dat and had to withstand the fire of three field batteries and one medium battery as a result. Long T√¢n also confirmed the importance of armoured support to infantry, even in dense jungle. In the wake of the battle the Australians were left to speculate on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the VC had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the VC had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. McNeill argues though that too many facts may be missing to make a conclusive assessment of VC intentions and to date no definitive Vietnamese account is available. In the years since the battle the intentions of the VC have been widely discussed, including by both participants and historians, with debate about it continuing until the present. Yet although there remains divided opinion about whether the VC had intended to attack the base at Nui Dat or to ambush an Australian element, according to Coulthard-Clark what is certain was that the force that clashed with D Company, 6 RAR \\"had been preparing a decisive action against 1 ATF\\". The outcome prevented them achieving a politically important victory so soon after the Australian deployment, and \\"placed Viet Cong plans in the province on the back foot for some time\\". Long- standing disputes include the size of the PAVN/VC attacking force, the number of casualties they suffered, how the battle had unfolded and issues around alleged documentation. Some of the documents assessing casualties or impacts on the PAVN/VC were uncorroborated diaries and anecdotal evidence from \\"Chinese Generals\\". There were also issues with the size of the attacking PAVN/VC forces and communist dead by several authors and by the Red Dunes Film Group, which has received criticism from an Australian Vietnam War veteran and later historian and Vietnamese-language linguist Ernie Chamberlain. In 2015, Harry Smith published Long Tan, The Start of a Lifelong Battle in which he accused senior officers including Jackson and Townsend of fabricating claims about the battle, and alleged that the official history was disingenuous and self-serving. This included deliberate inflation of communist dead by Army Spokesmen and others, and embellishing the roles of officers at the battle at the expense of their men. =Lessons learned by the Australians= 5 RAR soldiers disembarking from a US Army helicopter during Operation Toledo After Long T√¢n a rifle company with armoured support was dedicated to provide a rapid reaction force, on standby to respond to an attack or exploit any opportunity. The VC had been armed with weapons at least equal to those used by the Australians. Most had carried modern Soviet assault rifles, as well as a large quantity of ammunition, which allowed them to sustain a high rate of fire. In contrast, the amount of ammunition carried by the Australians had been insufficient, and following the battle the minimum load was increased to 140 rounds per rifle and 500 for each machine-gun. The aerial resupply of D Company had been delayed because no prepacked ammunition was available. This also changed, with rounds loaded in magazines for quick use. The VC had used 60 mm mortars, but they were no longer standard equipment for Australian rifle companies, and although battalions were issued 81 mm mortars they were controlled by Support Company. Such weapons would afford integral fire support in situations where their opponents had closed within the safety distance of the artillery, and consideration was given to their re-issue. Yet the added weight would limit the ability of sub-units to patrol and M-79 grenade launchers were issued instead, while some APCs were modified as mortar carriers. Despite detecting a transmitter from the 275th Regiment moving west towards Nui Dat, such intercepts were unable to predict VC intentions with certainty, and patrols through the area also failed to find it. Jackson had responded by maintaining patrols at company strength when outside Line Alpha, while ensuring a level of base security. Townsend had not been given access to this intelligence and some officers were later critical of the restrictions placed on it. Although it would not have altered the requirement for a company-sized patrol it might have changed the way the battle was fought, and afterwards both battalion commanders were regularly briefed on such intercepts. The value of patrolling in depth and in sufficient strength to prevent the VC concentrating their forces had been reinforced, and while there was no change to the pattern of Australian operations, when a significant engagement was possible patrols would be a minimum of a company and would operate close enough to rapidly support each other to stop them becoming isolated. Lastly, the command relationship between the infantry and APCs had been problematic during the battle and changes to standard operating procedures were implemented to provide clearer direction in such circumstances. =Subsequent operations= A week following the battle US II FFV launched a large-scale corps-sized sweep of Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy on 23 August. Operation Toledo saw the deployment of two brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, and two ARVN Ranger battalions in an attempt to destroy the 274th and 275th Regiments. 1 ATF involvement included both 5 and 6 RAR and supporting units. It lasted until 8 September and despite the intensity of the previous fighting little contact occurred, with no evidence of a large force having been in the area uncovered. Poorly planned, it failed to trap the VC, while 5 RAR's involvement resulted in only two VC killed, one wounded and one captured without loss, although several tunnels were discovered in Long T√¢n village and destroyed. In the months that followed 1 ATF conducted further search and destroy, village cordon and search and route security operations to extend its control and to separate the local people from the influence of the VC. Such operations usually resulted in contacts between the Australians and small groups of VC, while during cordon and search operations of B√¨nh Ba and H√≤a Long a number of villagers suspected of sympathising with the VC were apprehended and handed over to the South Vietnamese authorities. Several search operations were also conducted in areas suspected of containing VC base camps, and these often resulted in the discovery of recently used and quickly evacuated camps, hospitals and logistic bases which were then destroyed. Meanwhile, 1 ATF continued an extensive patrolling and ambushing program around Nui Dat. 50th anniversary memorial at Long Tan in 2005 Celebrated in Australia ever since, in time the battle became part of the legend of its involvement in the war. The best known of the Australian Army's actions in Vietnam, it has assumed a similar significance as battles such as Gallipoli, Kokoda and Kapyong. The date it was fought is observed annually as Long Tan Day and is also known as Vietnam Veterans' Remembrance Day, the national day of commemoration of the Vietnam War. For the 50th anniversary of the battle the Vietnamese government permitted Australians to hold a 'low-key ceremony', but the unexpected booking of 3,500 individuals to attend as well as a concert by Little Pattie led to the Vietnamese government cancelling the event. Following late-night talks by Malcolm Turnbull with the prime minister of Vietnam, a low-key ceremony was once again permitted. On 18 August 2016 a ceremony was held on the battlefield; more than 1,000 Australian veterans and their families travelled to Vietnam to participate in the 50th anniversary commemoration. In Australia hundreds attended the Australian War Memorial and Vietnam Forces National Memorial in Canberra. Commemorations were also held at Sydney's Cenotaph, Brisbane's ANZAC Square, Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance and elsewhere. The events in Canberra included a four-gun salute and flyover by Vietnam-era aircraft, including Iroquois helicopters, Hercules and Caribou transports and two B-52 bombers. A Last Post Ceremony was held at the War Memorial, with a reading by Victoria Cross-recipient Mark Donaldson. In 2017, Turnbull negotiated for the repatriation of the original Long Tan cross, and the Prime Minister of Vietnam gifted it to the Australian government on conditions of no publicity surrounding the transfer. The original cross was installed at the Australian War Memorial following the transfer. In popular culture * Danger Close: The Battle of Long Tan is a 2019 Australian war film about the battle.

The studio operated independently from 1987 until 1999, when it was acquired by Infogrames, who changed the name to Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd.. Documentation for a 2007 exhibition. In 2006 the studio was sold to Krome Studios. The name Beam was a contraction of the names of the founders: Naomi Besen and Alfred Milgrom.  History  = Home computer era = In the early years, two of Beam's programs were milestones in their respective genres. The Hobbit, a 1982 text adventure by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler, sold more than a million copies.DeMaria, Rusel and Wilson, Johnny L. (2004) High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games McGraw-Hill/Osborne, Berkeley, Calif., p. 347, It employed an advanced parser by Stuart Richie and had real-time elements. Even if the player didn't enter commands, the story would move on. In 1985 Greg Barnett's two-player martial arts game The Way of the Exploding Fist helped define the genre of one-on-one fighting games on the home computer. The game won Best Overall Game at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 1987 Beam's publisher, parent company Melbourne House, was sold to Mastertronic for ¬£850,000. Beam chairman Alfred Milgrom recounted, \\"...around 1987 a lot of our U.K. people went on to other companies and at around the same time the industry was moving from 8-bit to 16-bit. It was pretty chaotic. We didn't have the management depth at that time to run both the publishing and development sides of things, so we ended up selling off the whole Melbourne House publishing side to Mastertronic.\\" Subsequent games were released through varying publishers. The 1988 fighting games Samurai Warrior and Fist +, the third instalment in the Exploding Fist series, were published through Telecomsoft's Firebird label. 1988 also saw the release of space- shoot'em-up Bedlam, published by GO!, one of U.S. Gold's labels, and The Muncher, published by Gremlin Graphics. = Shift to consoles and PCs = In 1987 Nintendo granted a developer's licence for the NES and Beam developed games on that platform for US and Japanese publishers. Targeted at an Australian audience, releases such as Aussie Rules Footy and International Cricket for the NES proved successful. In 1992 they released the original title Nightshade, a dark superhero comedy game. The game was meant to be the first part in a series, but no sequels were ever made; however, it served as the basis for Shadowrun. In 1993 they released Shadowrun, with an innovative dialogue system using the acquisition of keywords which could be used in subsequent conversations to initiate new branches in the dialogue tree. In 1997, Beam relaunched the Melbourne House brand, under which they published the PC titles Krush Kill 'n' Destroy (KKND), and the sequels KKND Xtreme and KKND2: Krossfire. They released KKND2 in South Korea well before they released it in the American and European markets, and pirated versions of the game were available on the internet before it was available in stores in the U.S. They were the developers of the 32-bits versions of Norse By Norse West: The Return of the Lost Vikings for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC in 1996. They also helped produce SNES games such as WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling, Super Smash TV and an updated version of International Cricket titled Super International Cricket. They ported the Sega Saturn game Bug! to Windows 3.x in August, 1996. 1998 saw a return to RPGs with Alien Earth, again with a dialogue tree format. Also in 1998, the studio developed racing games DethKarz and GP 500. In 1999 Beam Software was acquired by Infogrames and renamed to Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd. = 2000s = They continued to cement a reputation as a racing game developer with Le Mans 24 Hours and Looney Tunes: Space Race (both Dreamcast and PlayStation 2), followed by the technically impressive Grand Prix Challenge (PlayStation 2), before a disastrous venture into third-person shooters with Men in Black II: Alien Escape (PlayStation 2, GameCube). In 2004 the studio released Transformers for the PlayStation 2 games console based on the then current Transformers Armada franchise by Hasbro. The game reached the top of the UK PlayStation 2 games charts, making it Melbourne House's most successful recent title. The studio then completed work on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of Eden's next-generation Xbox 360 title Test Drive: Unlimited. In December 2005, Atari decided to shift away from internal development, seeking to sell its studios, including Melbourne House. In November 2006 Krome Studios announced that it had acquired Melbourne House from Atari and that the studio would be renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne. . It was closed on 15 October 2010, along with the main Brisbane office. Next to the game development, Beam Software also had the division Smarty Pants Publishing Pty Ltd., that created software titles for kids, as well as the proprietary video compression technology VideoBeam, and Famous Faces, a facial motion capture hardware and software solution.

A 1.92 m (6 ft 3 in) tall,FORD, ALPHONSO HEIGHT: 1.92. 98 kg (216 lbs.)Alphonso Ford Peso: 98 kg . shooting guard, he was one of the greatest scorers in college basketball history. After a short stint in the NBA, he played professionally in Europe. Ford confirmed his tremendous scoring ability in the EuroLeague, and became a reference in the matter, notwithstanding his chronic health issues. He was the EuroLeague Top Scorer twice (2001, 2002), and earned an All-EuroLeague selection three times. The competition's leading scorer award bears his name, in his honor. Early years Ford was a high school star player for Amanda Elzy High School in Greenwood, Mississippi. Upon entering college basketball at Mississippi Valley State University, Ford led the entire NCAA Division I in freshman scoring, during the 1989‚Äì90 season, with a 29.9 points per game average. In his sophomore year, he averaged 32.7 points per game.Alphonso Ford Per Game. He became the first player in NCAA Division I history to average 25 points per game in four straight seasons. With 3,165 career points scored in the NCAA Division I, he is 5th on the all-time scoring list, behind only Pete Maravich, Freeman Williams, Lionel Simmons, and Chris Clemons. Professional career =NBA and CBA= Ford played just 70 games in the 1994‚Äì95 NBA season, for the Philadelphia 76ers, who selected him 32nd overall in the 1993 NBA draft. Before that, he had played six games for the Seattle SuperSonics, in 1993‚Äì94. During both the 1993‚Äì94 and 1994‚Äì95 NBA seasons, Ford played in the Continental Basketball Association, for the Tri-City Chinook. He averaged 22.8 points per game in his rookie year, and demonstrated right away the fact that he was an extraordinary scorer. His performances earned him every possible honor, as he was selected to the CBA All League Team, named Rookie of the Year and played the CBA All-Star Game. The 1994‚Äì95 CBA season was not very much different, with Ford scoring 24 points per game and playing the All-Star Game once again. =Europe= First steps towards European stardom In the 1995‚Äì96 season, Ford signed with Spanish first division club Pe√±as Huesca. However, although he played great basketball and averaged 25.1 points per game in the Spanish League, he could not prevent the team's relegation. The next season was for Ford the opportunity to show his skills, in what was at the time Europe's most competitive national domestic league, the Greek Basket League. He spent the season with Papagou, and led the team to a ninth-place finish, while also being the Greek competition's leading scorer, with 23.9 points per contest. Nevertheless, glory at the European-wide level turned out to be a little bit more far away than the great scorer thought. Before the beginning of the 1997‚Äì98 season, he was diagnosed with leukemia, thus obliging Papagou to break his contract. The treatment cost Ford the whole season, but he was convinced that he had a lot more to contribute. He signed a one-year deal with Sporting, a traditional Greek club that was struggling to remain in Greece's top basketball scene. The gifted shooting guard helped the team finish in a decent eleventh-place finish, but most importantly, he defied his disease, in an utterly remarkable way. Ford agreed to a two-year deal with the Greek club Nikas Peristeri, before the Greek Basket League 1999‚Äì2000 season, experiencing the game, within a team with considerably higher ambitions than any of the ones he had played for in the past. Needless to say, the challenge was accepted by the player, who would become a reference in the club's history. Ford averaged 22.7 points per game in the Greek League, leading Peristeri to a fifth-place finish in the league. Also, he made his first appearance in a European-wide competition, by playing in the European-wide 3rd-tier level FIBA Koraƒá Cup's 1999‚Äì2000 season, where he scored 20.7 points per game, and reached the competition's top 16 with his team, before they lost to Adecco Estudiantes. The biggest scorer in EuroLeague's modern era The real breakout season for Ford though, was going to be his second one with Peristeri, in 2000‚Äì01. The team contended for the Greek Basket League 2000‚Äì01 season title, and ended up in the league's third-place position, while he was named the league's MVP. In parallel, the club also took part in Euroleague Basketball's EuroLeague 2000‚Äì01 season, and Ford shined, while playing for the first time at the highest European-wide league level. He was the EuroLeague Top Scorer, averaging 26 points per game, and had a memorable 41-point outburst against Tau Ceramica in the competition's playoffs, scoring more than half of his team's 79 points that night. Tau qualified for the quarterfinals, sweeping the playoff series between the two teams, by two games to none, but Ford's performance is now part of the EuroLeague legend. Finally, his nomination to the All-EuroLeague 2000‚Äì01 First Team, was at the same time, a huge recognition, and an official introduction to superstar status. In the 2001‚Äì02 season, the Greek EuroLeague powerhouse, Olympiacos, offered Ford a $12 million net income single-year contract. His mission was to bring a team that had not won anything since the triple crown in 1997, back to the top. Ford signed the deal, and the results were immediate: he led the Reds to a Greek Cup trophy, with 20 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds, in the cup's semifinal against Bodiroga's Panathinaikos, and 24 points, 10 rebounds and 3 assists, in the cup's final game, to defeat Maroussi, by a score of 66‚Äì74. In the EuroLeague 2001‚Äì02 season, Olympiacos made it to the competition's Top 16 stage, and fell one game short of reaching the EuroLeague Final Four. Ford could actually not prevent an 85‚Äì89 home loss to Olimpija Ljubljana, although he had a solid performance that night, with 21 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. He was once again the EuroLeague's Top Scorer, at 24.8 points per game, and was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2001‚Äì02 Second Team. The season ended with a loss in the Greek League's championship finals series to AEK, with Ford missing the last two crucial games of the series, due to an injury. Olympiacos changed for the EuroLeague 2002‚Äì03 season. The major Greek EuroLeague clubs were forced to reduce their budgets, due to the renovation of their arenas for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens. They therefore became considerably less competitive in the league. Ford's contract with Olympiacos was subsequently not renewed, and he signed a new contract with the Italian league's EuroLeague contender, Mens Sana Siena. Ford had a quick adaptation period to his new team, and although his scoring average in the EuroLeague dropped to 17.9 points per game, he was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2002‚Äì03 First Team, after Siena qualified to the 2003 EuroLeague Final Four. Unfortunately, Ford had one of his worst shooting nights ever, in the semifinal against Benetton Treviso: he scored 15 points, making only 5 of his 19 shots. His 7 rebounds and 2 steals did not allow his team to overcome Benetton's obstacle, as they lost 62‚Äì65 in a highly intense game. In the Italian League 2002‚Äì03 season, Ford averaged 19.1 points per game, and Siena finished in fourth place in the league. Final season and death Despite his leukemia being in an advanced stage, Ford played the Italian League 2003‚Äì04 season with Scavolini Pesaro. Averaging 22.2 points per game in the Italian League, Ford, in his final season, helped Scavolini finish in fourth place in the Italian League, which meant the team qualified to the next season's EuroLeague, and to the Italian Cup's runner-up position, despite being near death. That accomplishment still speaks for itself today. Shortly after announcing his retirement from the EuroLeague, Ford died from leukemia, at age 32.

Wesugi was a fan of Axl Rose and Oshima was a guest member of Japanese rock band Loudness. The band was named after wands of tarot. They made a debut with single \\"Sabishisa wa Aki no Iro\\" (literally \\"Loneliness is autumn color\\"). Their 1992 single \\"Motto Tsuyoku Dakishimeta Nara\\" (literally \\"If I Embrace You More Strongly\\") reached the number-one position and was charted for 44 weeks on the Japanese Oricon charts. However, Oshima withdrew from the band and Shinya Kimura joined the band in 1992. Collaborating with Miho Nakayama, in October 1992, they released \\"Sekaij≈´ no Dare yori Kitto\\" (lit. \\"Certainly more than everybody in the world\\"), which became one of standard \\"J-pop\\" songs. In 1992, they took part in Japanese famous year-end show called K≈çhaku Uta Gassen by the song. Along with their songs, Wesugi wrote Deen's debut song \\"Konomama Kimidake wo Ubaisaritai\\" (lit. \\"Now, I want to make off with only you\\"), which was released in March 1993 and sold over a million copies. In April 1993, their album Toki no Tobira (lit. \\"Temporal Door\\") and single \\"Ai wo Kataru yori Kuchizuke wo Kawaso\\" (lit. \\"Let's kiss more than talking love\\") debuted at the number-one positions at the same time on the Oricon charts, making them the second artist to achieve this following Seiko Matsuda. \\"Ai wo Kataru yori Kuchizuke wo Kawaso\\" spent in number-one spot for four consecutive weeks. Toki no Tobira was charted for 33 weeks on the Oricon album charts. They sold over 4.11 million singles and 3.18 million albums in a year, winning the \\"artist of the year\\" award at the 8th Japan Gold Disc Award. Their 1994 single \\"Sekai ga Owaru made wa...\\" (lit. \\"Until the End of the World...\\") reached number-one on Oricon charts and was certified as a million- selling single by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was the ending theme of anime series Slam Dunk. However, Wesugi loved grunge and wanted to turn into alternative rock. \\"Sekai ga Owaru made wa...\\" became his last song written by his former style because he felt that many musicians around him were doing the same thing. The tune of their next single \\"Secret Night (It's My Treat)\\" was more shifted into power pop, creating controversies. However, their 1995 studio album Piece of My Soul also debuted at the number-one position on the Oricon album charts, with the first week sales of over 542,000 copies. Wesugi's image continued to be changed with song \\"Same Side\\". His new style was said to be \\"painterly\\" and their new album was nearing completion. According to Wesugi, their new album was influenced by punk and blues. After they released single \\"Worst Crime (About a rock star who was a swindler)\\" in February 1996, however, Wesugi and Shibasaki withdrew from the band, which was said to have been its actual disbandment. Their withdrawals were officially announced in 1997. Wesugi continued his music career and took part in the sixth anniversary of hide's death as the last singer in 2004. Shibasaki formed rock band Abingdon Boys School with Takanori Nishikawa in 2005. Oshima also associated with Nishikawa on the 2006 album Under Cover. =1997‚Äì2000: Third period with Jiro Waku= Shinya Kimura re- formed the group with vocalist Jiro Waku and guitarist Issei Sugimoto. Jiro Waku, whose real name is Jiro Matsumoto, was the first leader of twelve skateboarding boys (predecessor of SMAP) in Johnny & Associates. Their debut song \\"Sabitsuita Machine Gun de Ima o Uchinuk≈ç\\", written by Miho Komatsu, was adopted as the end credits theme for Dragon Ball GT. Their next single \\"Brand New Love\\" was written by Izumi Sakai. Sakai also wrote their song \\"Ashita moshi Kimi ga kowaretemo\\" (lit. \\"Even if you shatter tomorrow\\"), which was used as the ending theme for Yu-Gi-Oh!. Their next single \\"Kyo, Nanika no Hazumi de Ikiteiru\\" (lit. \\"Today, I live by some chance\\") was written by Nana Azuki, a future member of Garnet Crow and by Makoto Miyoshi, a future member of Rumania Montevideo. However, their first studio album Awake, released on 27 October 1999, was charted for only three weeks, peaking at number 18 on the Oricon charts. The band from the third period has disbanded in 2000 through the announcement from the official website. =2019-present: Fourth and Fifth Wands period with Daishi Uehara= On 13 November 2019, was announced the fifth period of Wands with the new vocalist, Daishi Uehara along with the former members Shibazaki and Kimura.

Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system's infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan basin and the Tibetan plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. Li Bing, then governor of Shu for the state of Qin, and his son headed the construction of the Dujiangyan, which harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over of land in the region. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the \\"three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin.\\" History =Planning= The map showing the plan of Dujiangyan project During the Warring States period, people who lived along the banks of the Min River were plagued by annual flooding. Qin governor, irrigation engineer, and hydrologist Li Bing investigated the problem and discovered that the river was swelled by fast flowing spring melt-water from the local mountains that burst the banks when it reached the slow moving and heavily silted stretch below. One solution would have been to build a dam but Li Bing had also been charged with keeping the waterway open for military vessels to supply troops on the frontier, so instead he proposed to construct an artificial levee to redirect a portion of the river's flow and then to cut a channel through Mount Yulei to discharge the excess water upon the dry Chengdu Plain beyond. =Construction= Li Bing received 100,000 taels of silver for the project from King Zhao of Qin and set to work with a team said to number tens of thousands. The levee was constructed from long sausage-shaped baskets of woven bamboo filled with stones known as Zhulong held in place by wooden tripods known as Macha. The construction of a water-diversion levee resembling a fish's mouth took four years to complete. Cutting the channel proved to be a far greater problem, as the tools available to Li Bing at the time, before gunpowder was invented, could not penetrate the hard rock of the mountain, so he used a combination of fire and water to heat and cool the rocks until they cracked and could be removed. After eight years of work, a channel had been gouged through the mountain. =Legacy= Dujiangyan After the system was finished, no more floods occurred. The irrigation made Sichuan the most productive agricultural region in China. On the east side of Dujiangyan, people built a shrine in remembrance of Li Bing. Li Bing's construction is also credited with giving the people of the region a laid-back attitude to life; by eliminating disaster and ensuring a regular and bountiful harvest, it has left them with plenty of free time. In 2000, Dujiangyan became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today it has become a major tourist attraction in Sichuan. =2008 Sichuan earthquake= On May 12, 2008 a massive earthquake struck a vast portion of west Sichuan, including the Dujiangyan area. Initial reports indicated that the Yuzui Levee was cracked but not severely damaged. Diversion of flow could still be seen as the river turns. Panorama of Inner Stream Engineering Constructions Fish Mouth Levee Water ways map =Irrigation Head= Li Bing's Irrigation System consists of three main constructions that work in harmony with one another to ensure against flooding and keep the fields well supplied with water: The Yuzui or Fish Mouth Levee, named for its conical head that is said to resemble the mouth of a fish, is the key part of Li Bing's construction. It is an artificial levee that divides the water into inner and outer streams. The inner stream is deep and narrow, while the outer stream is relatively shallow but wide. This special structure ensures that the inner stream carries approximately 60% of the river's flow into the irrigation system during dry season. While during flood, this amount decreases to 40% to protect the people from flooding. The outer stream drains away the rest, flushing out much of the silt and sediment. The Feishayan or Flying Sand Weir has a 200 m-wide opening that connects the inner and outer streams. This ensures against flooding by allowing the natural swirling flow of the water to drain out excess water from the inner to the outer stream. The swirl also drains out silt and sediment that failed to go into the outer stream. A modern reinforced concrete weir has replaced Li Bing's original weighted bamboo baskets. The Baopingkou or Bottle-Neck Channel, which Li Bing gouged through the mountain, is the final part of the system. The channel distributes the water to the farmlands in the Chengdu Plain, whilst the narrow entrance, that gives it its name, works as a check gate, creating the whirlpool flow that carries away the excess water over Flying Sand Fence, to ensure against flooding. =Anlan Suspension Bridge= Anlan or Couple's Bridge spans the full width of the river connecting the artificial island to both banks and is known as one of the Five Ancient Bridges of China. Li Bing's original Zhupu Bridge only spanned the inner stream connecting the levee to the foot of Mount Yulei. This was replaced in the Song Dynasty by Pingshi Bridge which burned down during the wars that marked the end of the Ming Dynasty. In 1803 during the Qing Dynasty a local man named He Xiande and his wife proposed the construction of a replacement, made of wooden plates and bamboo handrails, to span both streams and this was nicknamed Couple's Bridge in their honour. This was demolished in the 1970s and replaced by a modern bridge. Temple Sites =Two Kings Temple= The Erwang Temple at Dujiangyan Erwang or Two Kings Temple is on the bank of the river at the foot of Mount Yulei. The original Wangdi Temple built in memory of an ancient Shu king was moved, so locals renamed the temple here in honour of Li Bing and his legendary son whom they had posthumously promoted to kings. The 10,072 m2 Qing Dynasty wooden complex conforms to the traditional standard of temple design except that it does not follow a north-south axis. The main hall, which contains a modern statue of Li Bing, opens up onto a courtyard facing an opera stage. On Li Bing's traditional birthday, 24th day of the 7th month of the lunar calendar, local operas were performed for the public, and on Tomb Sweeping Day a Water Throwing Festival is held. The rear hall contains a modern statue of the god Erlang Shen who was allegedly Li Bing's son, but historic records fail to confirm this and it is possible that he was invented by locals to give their hero a descendant to maintain his family heritage. Guanlantin Pavilion stands above the complex and is inscribed with wise words from Li Bing such as, When the river flows in zigzags, cut a straight channel; when the riverbed is wide and shallow, dig it deeper. =Dragon-Taming Temple= thumb Fulongguan or Dragon-Taming Temple in Lidui Park was founded in the third century in honour of Fan Changsheng. Following Li Bing's death a hall was established here in his honour and the temple was renamed to commemorate the dragon fighting legends that surrounded him. It is here that Erlang Shen, the legendary son of Li Bing, is said to have chained the dragon that he and his 7 friends had captured in an ambush at the River God Temple when it came to collect a human sacrifice. This action is said to have protected the region from floods ever since. During the East Han Dynasty a statue of Li Bing was placed in the river to monitor the water flow, with the level rising above his shoulders to indicate flood and falling beneath his calves to indicate drought. Recovered from the river in 1974 and placed on display in the main hall, this is the oldest known stone statue of a human in China.

The proportion usually varies from trace levels to about 2% uranium by weight, although some 20th-century pieces were made with up to 25% uranium.Big Book of Vaseline Glass, by Barrie Skelcher, Pub. Schiffer\\"Vaseline and uranium glass ca. 1930s\\" Uranium glass was once made into tableware and household items, but fell out of widespread use when the availability of uranium to most industries was sharply curtailed during the Cold War in the 1940s to 1990s. Most such objects are now considered antiques or retro-era collectibles, although there has been a minor revival in art glassware. Otherwise, modern uranium glass is now mainly limited to small objects like beads or marbles as scientific or decorative novelties. Appearance The normal color of uranium glass ranges from yellow to green depending on the oxidation state and concentration of the metal ions, although this may be altered by the addition of other elements as glass colorants. Uranium glass also fluoresces bright green under ultraviolet light and can register above background radiation on a sufficiently sensitive Geiger counter, although most pieces of uranium glass are considered to be harmless and only negligibly radioactive. File:Uranium glass beads, black background.jpg|Modern uranium glass beads (black background) File:Uranium glass beads, UV light.jpg|Modern uranium glass beads (UV light) =Vaseline glass= The most typical color of uranium glass is pale yellowish-green, which in the 1930s led to the nickname Vaseline glass based on a perceived resemblance to the appearance (which was a yellow-green color) of Vaseline brand petroleum jelly as formulated and commercially sold at that time. Specialized collectors still define Vaseline glass as transparent or semi- transparent uranium glass in this specific color.Glickman, Jay L. and Fedosky, Terry, Yellow-Green Vaseline A Guide to the Magic Glass, Revised Edition, c. 1998, The Glass Press, Inc., dba Antique Publications. (PB) or 1570800464 (HB) Vaseline glass is sometimes used as a synonym for any uranium glass, especially in the United States, but this usage is frowned on, since Vaseline- brand petroleum jelly was only yellow, not other colors. The term is sometimes applied to other types of glass based on certain aspects of their superficial appearance in normal light, regardless of actual uranium content which requires a blacklight test to verify the characteristic green fluorescence. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term Vaseline glass can be used to refer to any type of translucent glass. =Other colors= Several other common subtypes of uranium glass have their own nicknames: *custard glass (opaque or semiopaque pale yellow) *jadite glass (opaque or semi-opaque pale green; initially, the name was trademarked as \\"Jadite\\", although this is sometimes over-corrected in modern usage to \\"jadeite\\") *Depression glass (transparent or semitransparent pale green). *Burmese glass (opaque glass that shades from pink to yellow) However, like \\"vaseline\\", the terms \\"custard\\" and \\"jad(e)ite\\" are often applied on the basis of superficial appearance rather than uranium content. Similarly, Depression glass is also a general description for any piece of glassware manufactured during the Great Depression regardless of appearance or formula. History =Pre-industrial usage= The use of uranium glass dates back to at least 79 AD, the date of a mosaic containing yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912.Emsley, Nature's Building Blocks (2001), page 482The Earliest Known Use of a Material Containing Uranium by Earle R. Caley, Isis, Vol. 38, No. 3/4 (Feb., 1948). Starting in the late Middle Ages, pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now J√°chymov in the Czech Republic) and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. Martin Klaproth (1743‚Äì1817), who discovered uranium, later experimented with the use of the element as a glass colourant. Usage =Glass fabrication= Uranium glass is used as one of several intermediate glasses in what is known to scientific glass blowers as a 'graded seal'. This is typically used in glass-to-metal seals such as tungsten and molybdenum or nickel based alloys such as Kovar, as an intermediary glass between the metal sealing glass and lower expansion borosilicate glass. =Modern production= Uranium glass became popular in the mid-19th century, with its period of greatest popularity being from the 1880s to the 1920s. The first major producer of items made of uranium glass is commonly recognized as Austrian Franz Xaver Riedel, who named the yellow () and yellow-green (German: Gelb- Gr√ºn) varieties of the glass \\"annagelb\\" and \\"annagr√ºn\\", respectively, in honor of his daughter Anna Maria. Riedel was a prolific blower of uranium glass in Unter-Polaun (today Dolni Polubny), Bohemia from 1830 to 1848. By the 1840s, many other European glassworks began to produce uranium glass items and developed new varieties of uranium glass. The Baccarat glassworks in France created an opaque green uranium glass which they named chrysoprase from its similarity to that green form of chalcedony. File:Fluorescent Uranium Depression Glass.jpg|Fluorescent uranium Depression glass Image:U glass above.jpg|A uranium glass cakeplate glowing under UV light. Image:U glass with black light.jpg|Uranium glass glowing under UV light File:Uranium-glass- necklace-Benjamim-Mattos.jpg|Uranium glass necklace, circa 1930. At the end of the 19th century, glassmakers discovered that uranium glass with certain mineral additions could be tempered at high temperatures, inducing varying degrees of micro-crystallization. This produced a range of increasingly opaque glasses from the traditional transparent yellow or yellow-green to an opaque white. During the Depression years, more iron oxide was added to the mixture to match popular preferences for a greener glass. This material, technically a glass-ceramic, acquired the name \\"vaseline glass\\" because of its supposedly similar appearance to petroleum jelly. Today, a few manufacturers continue the vaseline glass tradition: Fenton Glass, Mosser Glass, Gibson Glass and Jack Loranger. U.S. production of uranium glasses ceased in the middle years of World War II because of the government's confiscation of uranium supplies for the Manhattan Project from 1942 to 1958. After the restrictions in the United States were eased several firms resumed production of uranium glass, including Fenton, and Mosser; though uranium was still regulated as a strategic material. Following the Cold War, restrictions on uranium glass were completely lifted. During this time many older pieces entered the free market and new pieces continued to be produced in small quantities into the 2000s. Riihim√§ki Glass produced uranium glass designer pieces after World War II.

The route consists of two separately named motorways, the M2 Hills Motorway and the Lane Cove Tunnel. The M2 route replaces the motorway sections of what was known as Metroad 2 from 1993 to 2013, with the non-motorway sections replaced by the A2 route (made up of Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road). Lane Cove Tunnel and M2 Hills Motorway The Lane Cove Tunnel was open to traffic in March 2007. Prior to the opening of the Lane Cove Tunnel, the Metroad 2 followed Epping Road, between the Pacific Highway and Mowbray Road west. The M2 Hills Motorway was opened nearly 10 years prior to the Lane Cove Tunnel in May 1997, replacing sections of Metroad 2 between North Ryde and Baulkham Hills, between Old Windsor road and Carlingford Road, along Epping Road to Delhi Road, Beecroft Road, Pennant Hills Road (Part of the Cumberland Highway), Castle Hill Road and Showground Road, Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road. History of the Metroad 2 route Prior to the opening of the M2 Hills Motorway in 1997, the Metroad 2 route ran along Epping Road, Beecroft Road, Pennant Hills Road (Part of the Cumberland Highway), Castle Hill Road and Showground Road, Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road. These former stretches were parts of State Routes 28 and 30 until Metroad 2 replaced them in November 1993. The southern/eastern extremity of Metroad 2 was originally at the city end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with the Warringah Freeway and Gore Hill Freeway duplexed as both Metroad 1 and Metroad 2.

James Graham Cooper (June 19, 1830 ‚Äì July 19, 1902) was an American surgeon and naturalist. Cooper was born in New York. He worked for the California Geological Survey (1860‚Äì1874) with Josiah Dwight Whitney, William Henry Brewer and Henry Nicholas Bolander. He was primarily a zoologist, but he also made significant botanical collections from San Diego to Fort Mohave, Arizona in 1861. Cooper was active in the California Academy of Sciences, eventually becoming Director of the Museum. He obtained his medical degree in 1851 and practiced in New York City until 1853. Spencer F. Baird, the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution at that time, helped Cooper work with the Pacific railroad survey parties working in the Washington Territory. He joined this survey under Captain George McClellan as a surgeon until 1854. In 1855 he visited San Francisco and the Panama Isthmus. He collected many birds during this expedition. In 1860, he returned west and joined the Blake Expedition that went from St. Louis up to the Missouri River and into Idaho and Washington. He worked as a contract surgeon for brief periods with the US Army and Josiah Whitney, the chief of the California Geological Survey. Along with Baird he wrote a book on the birds of California \\"Ornithology, Volume I, Land Birds\\" in 1870. His marriage in 1866 made it difficult for him to balance his interest in natural history. He worked in San Mateo, Oakland, San Francisco and finally settled in 1875 in Hayward. He wrote on his difficulties in a letter in 1870 His father William Cooper was also a naturalist.

Swiss bankers are popularly associated with extremely secretive policies, while gnomes in fairy tales live underground, in secret, counting their riches. Z√ºrich is the commercial centre of Switzerland. History After World War II, British Labour party politicians were worried about speculation against the pound undermining the economic regime. Economic growth in the United Kingdom was low, only half that of Germany and France. The demand for pound sterling started to fall. Although Swiss bankers had been criticised in Britain since the 1950s, the term \\"gnome of Z√ºrich\\" originated in a crisis meeting of the Labour politicians in November 1964. The politicians blamed Swiss bankers for raising speculation against the pound. During the meeting, politician George Brown criticised the Swiss bankers and said, \\"The gnomes of Z√ºrich are at work again.\\" The term \\"Gnomes of Z√ºrich\\" was then used by many other politicians of the time. Then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson vowed to resist the gnomes' sinister power. Paul Rossy, a top banker in Z√ºrich at the time, stated, \\"In the world it is not the image, but the substance behind the image which counts.\\" The phrase \\"gnomes of Z√ºrich\\" was adopted by the Americans as well. Impact Soon after the catchphrase became famous, a few Swiss bankers started answering their phone as \\"Hello, gnome speaking.\\" An audacious Swiss banker moved to London in order to set up his business and named it \\"Gnome of Notting Hill\\". In recent decades, Z√ºrich bankers have lost the foothold they had in the global economy due to the rise of London, New York, Dubai and Hong Kong as leading financial capitals. The Z√ºrich Money Museum displays the sculpture of a gnome. Jurg Conzett of the Z√ºrich Money Museum says that nowadays, bankers see gnome as \\"almost\\" a noble title. Bankers currently based in London who are agitated by rising taxes, stricter regulation and public animosity towards investment banking are considering moving in large numbers to Z√ºrich itself where banking is \\"the state religion.\\" Other uses The phrase is reflected in the traditions of the Z√ºrich Grasshoppers Rugby Club, whose mascot is a gnome and which occasionally plays a third/casual team called \\"The Gnomes\\". Gnomes of Z√ºrich is also the name of a classic rock band from North East England, and a 1990s psychedelic rock band from Minneapolis. The Gnomes of Z√ºrich are one of the playable factions in Steve Jackson's card game of conspiracy, Illuminati. Their goal is to collect a specified amount of megabucks, the game's currency. The original version of the computer game Zork makes reference to an \\"epicene gnome of Zurich\\". Valiant Comics' Archer & Armstrong features a group of literal gnomes referred to as the Gnomes of Zurich, one of many factions within The Sect formed to kill the titular immortal, Armstrong.

It was developed in Exmoor, Devon, in the 19th century, but is a descendant of sheep that had roamed on the moors for several hundred years.

The short is about a snow globe snowman who wants to join the other travel souvenirs in a summer-themed party. However, the glass dome that surrounds him prevents him from doing so, thus leading to his many attempts to break out of his snow globe. Knick Knack is Pixar's fourth short and the final short produced during the company's tenure as a hardware company. The short stands out from Lasseter's other early short films at Pixar in its reliance on pure comedy to drive the story. It was inspired by Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, and the work of animators Chuck Jones and Tex Avery. Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places and those elements made their way into the short as well. Singer Bobby McFerrin improvised the a cappella vocal jazz soundtrack to the film while watching a rough cut which was eventually left unchanged in its final edition. Knick Knack premiered at the 1989 SIGGRAPH convention in Boston and was presented in 3D. The short has enjoyed positive reviews since its debut, and has been screened as a part of numerous film festivals.  Plot  On a bookshelf filled with vacation-themed souvenirs, a snowman named Knick (who is the cousin of Frosty the Snowman, according to the audio commentary), who resides in a Nome, Alaska snow globe, wants to reach a \\"Sunny Miami\\" knick knack that shows a pretty blonde girl in a blue bikini. Knick tries several unsuccessful methods to break out of the globe, culminating in detonating TNT explosives, which cause the globe to fall over the shelf's edge. Knick notices an emergency exit in the base and frees himself just before he and the globe fall into a fishbowl. Here Knick sees a pretty mermaid souvenir from \\"Sunny Atlantis\\" and runs toward her, but before he can reach her, the globe settles to the bottom and traps him again, much to his annoyance.  Background  In 1988, Pixar's third short film, Tin Toy, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-animated film to claim the award. It was also the first win for the hardware company, which was still struggling to sell its main product: the Pixar Image Computer. The key animator and director behind Tin Toy, John Lasseter, had once worked at Disney several years prior but was fired by unknowingly stepping on his superiors' toes with his support for computer animation. Now, Disney took notice of the Oscar win for Tin Toy and began a campaign to win Lasseter back.Price, p. 106 Lasseter turned the studio's offer for a directorial position down, remarking to Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, \\"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\\"Price, p. 107 Jeffrey Katzenberg, the then-head of Walt Disney Studios, had a reputation for being difficult and controlling. In contrast, Lasseter received complete creative freedom at Pixar's small animation division and was highly respected by his colleagues. In addition to capturing Disney's interest, Pixar owner Steve Jobs' interest in the animation group was invigorated, and he approved production of another short.  Production  After the headaches of animating Billy the baby in Tin Toy, Lasseter backed away from depicting human characters. The team all agreed to do something simpler that would not \\"drive us all crazy,\\" according to producer Ralph Guggeinheim. When watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit during the production of Tin Toy, Lasseter became inspired to create a Chuck Jones-type of cartoon. Rather than to challenge the limitations of the computer as they had done in the previous shorts, the animators wanted to make a short based on geometric shapes instead, which was a strength of the computer.Knick Knack - Director's Commentary Review In a discussion with the group, Lasseter brought up famed Warner Bros. and MGM director Tex Avery, noting that his cartoons were wild and exuberant, yet not necessarily very complex. Lasseter collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places; from those elements, Knick Knack‚Äîthe only pure comedy among Lasseter's early short films at Pixar‚Äîbegan to fall into place. The rest of the team were also fans of Tom and Jerry cartoons and the work of Chuck Jones, and found the idea of cartoonish violence appealing. Animator Flip Phillips and production coordinator Deirdre Warin simultaneously hit on the idea of the snow globe falling into a fishbowl. Craig Good came up with the idea of an \\"iris out,\\" a shrinking circle at the close, as a reference to Looney Tunes.Price, p. 108 A skeleton on the shelf in the short was a 3D model from an Ohio State University skeleton data set called George, though the Pixar team stretched George's arms for comic effect. Also distorted were the two female characters‚Äîthe bikini- attired woman and a mermaid‚Äîwhose breasts were ultra-exaggerated thanks to a technical director who was a pinup enthusiast. The singer Bobby McFerrin created the musical soundtrack, an a cappella vocal jazz track which he improvised while watching a rough cut of the film. As the rough cut ended, the placeholder credits read blah-blah-blah-blah, so he sang those words and it remained in the film's score. McFerrin did the score for free out of a belief that the film was cool to be involved with. Gary Rydstrom of Lucasfilm created the sound effects for the short.  Release and later re-releases  Knick Knack premiered at the 1989 SIGGRAPH in Boston. It was one of the last pieces of animation that Lasseter would animate personally during Pixar's years as an independent company. In 1990, it won the Best Short Film award at the Seattle International Film Festival. When Lasseter presented it at the London Film Festival in 1991, The Independent of London called it \\"a four-minute masterpiece\\" and The Guardian hailed Lasseter as \\"probably the closest thing to God that has ever graced the electronic images community.\\" In 2001, Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time. After Knick Knack, Pixar took a break from animated shorts and re-focused on animating television commercials to build income and hire new animators. The film has been released in two versions, and each of these have been shown in both 3-D and 2-D. The original version was shown in 3D in 1989 at the SIGGRAPH program, and was released on the VHS and LaserDisc, Tiny Toy Stories, and also on the Toy Story deluxe CAV LaserDisc edition. The short was later released on May 30, 2003 in theaters with Finding Nemo. For this release, the film was re- rendered with design adjustments for the woman on the \\"Miami\\" knick knack and the mermaid in the fish bowl. Both characters now have much smaller breasts and the mermaid is now wearing a seashell bra rather than just starfish pasties. Lasseter defended the changes by saying, \\"It wasn‚Äôt big bad Disney coming in and insisting we do this ‚Ä¶ it was our own choice. It was just crossing the line for me personally as a father. So I made the decision to reduce [these characters‚Äô] breast size.\\" This updated version is preceded with the message \\"In 1989, six years before Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios made this short film.\\" This version was first made available with the Finding Nemo DVD. This version is subsequently on Nemo's Blu-ray, the Pixar Short Films Collection ‚Äì Volume 1 DVD and Blu-ray, and on digital services that feature Pixar's shorts including Disney+. A 3-D version of the new edition played to the public as a short attached to the 2006 Disney Digital 3-D release of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  References to Knick Knack in other media  In the Toy Story franchise, a book titled Knick Knack is often seen on a bookshelf along with other books named after Pixar shorts. During 2007‚Äì2008, a series of commercials released in the United Kingdom for Bupa featured the Knick Knack theme tune as their soundtrack. A store at Pixar Pier at Disney California Adventure references this short film. The name of the store is Knick's Knacks. The sign at the front of the store displays Knick the snowman in his snow globe.

Now vicar of Finedon in Northamptonshire, he was formerly the multi-instrumentalist who partnered Jimmy Somerville in the 1980s band The Communards. They achieved three Top Ten hits, including the No. 1 record and best-selling single of 1986, a dance version of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\". Coles appears frequently on radio and television as well as in newspapers and, in March 2011, became the regular host of BBC Radio 4's Saturday Live programme. He is a regular contributor to QI, Would I Lie to You? and Have I Got News for You. He is an author, Chancellor of the University of Northampton, Honorary Chaplain to the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, and a Patron of social housing project Greatwell Homes in Wellingborough. Personal life Coles was born in Northampton, England. His grandfather was a prosperous shoe-manufacturer. The company failed under Coles's father because of the increasing popularity of cheaper foreign imports, and the family lost much of their wealth. He was educated at the independent Wellingborough School (where he was a choirboy) and at the South Warwickshire College of Further Education (Department of Drama & the Liberal Arts) in Stratford-upon-Avon. He later attended King's College London where he studied theology from 1990. He was awarded an MA by research from the University of Leeds in 2005 for work on the Greek text of the Epistle to the Ephesians. Coles is openly gay. The first person Coles came out to was his mother in 1978 when he was 16. He played her Tom Robinson's \\"Glad to Be Gay\\" four times before she said \\"Darling, are you trying to tell me something?\\" Coles has spoken about the ‚Äòmental crisis‚Äô he suffered following his coming out, which ultimately led to him attempting suicide, and being diagnosed with clinical depression. Coles lived with his civil partner, the Reverend David Coles (n√© Oldham), in a celibate relationship until the latter‚Äôs death in December 2019. Following the death, Coles says he had received hate mail claiming that his partner is in hell. The Church of England has allowed priests to enter a civil partnership since 2005. His older brother, Andy Coles, a former Metropolitan Police officer, was elected in 2015 as a Conservative councillor in Peterborough and appointed deputy Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner in 2016. After a mention in Richard's 2014 autobiography, he was accused of having deceived a 19-year-old political activist into a sexual relationship while he was a 32-year-old undercover police officer in the 1990s and resigned as deputy commissioner on 15 May 2017. Coles is a member of the Labour Party. He is also a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), having been converted through watching the 2020 TV series Normal People. Family ties led to him selecting Cork as his county and St Finbarr's as his club. The club responded by sending him a membership card. Musical career Coles had learned to play the saxophone, clarinet and keyboards and moved to London in 1980, where he played in theatre. In 1983 he appeared with Jimmy Somerville in the Lesbian and Gay Youth Video Project film Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts, which won the Grierson Award. Coles joined Bronski Beat (initially on saxophone) in 1983. In 1984 Somerville left Bronski Beat and he and Coles formed The Communards, who were together for just over three years and had three UK Top 10 hits, including the biggest-selling single of 1986, a version of \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\", which was at Number 1 for four weeks. They split in 1988 and Somerville went solo. Post-music career and church ministry The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Finedon, Northamptonshire Coles provided narration for the Style Council's film JerUSAlem in 1987 and also started a career as a writer and journalist, particularly with the Times Literary Supplement and the Catholic Herald. He came to the Christian faith in his late twenties, after \\"the best of times, the worst of times\\", pop success and the deaths of friends as a result of HIV. From 1991 to 1994 he studied for a BA in theology at King's College London. While at university, he became a Roman Catholic and remained so for the next ten years before returning to Anglicanism in 2001. Coles was selected for training for the priesthood in the Church of England and began his training at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, West Yorkshire, in 2003 before being ordained in 2005. After ordination he was a curate at St Botolph's Church in Boston, Lincolnshire and then at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge in London. He has been chaplain of the Royal Academy of Music and has also played Dr Frank N Furter in a local concert and conducted an atheist funeral for Mo Mowlam in 2005. Coles was an inspiration for the character of Adam Smallbone (played by Tom Hollander) in BBC Two sitcom Rev., and was an adviser to the show. Coles mentions in his book Fathomless Riches that he is the inspiration for the character \\"Tom\\" in the Bridget Jones novels. In January 2011, Coles was appointed as the vicar of St Mary the Virgin, Finedon in the Diocese of Peterborough. Coles speaking at Greenbelt Festival, 2012 On 1 November 2012 (All Saints' Day), Darton, Longman and Todd published Coles' book, Lives of the Improbable Saints, illustrated by Ted Harrison, a pr√©cis of the life stories of nearly 200 lesser-known saints. The following year, volume two, Legends of the Improbable Saints, followed. Since 2011, Coles has been on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a social enterprise providing housing and community support for the Borough of Wellingborough and, after its name change to Greatwell Homes, became its Patron. In 2012, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Northampton and also became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2016, he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Warwick. In 2019 he was appointed Honorary Chaplain to the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers. In 2014, the first volume of his memoirs, Fathomless Riches, was published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. In 2016 a follow-up volume, Bringing In The Sheaves, was published. In July 2017, Coles was elected a Fellow of King's College London and, separately, Chancellor of the University of Northampton. Broadcasting and media appearances Coles still works as a broadcaster, which he describes as \\"just showing off\\", including Nightwaves on Radio 3, which he formerly presented, and Newsnight Review on BBC Two. He has appeared on the Radio 4 panel game show Heresy twice; first in May 2008, then in May 2010. Coles has appeared five times as a guest on the topical television news quiz Have I Got News for You, in 1994, May 2009, May 2013, April 2016 and June 2017. He presented a special edition of Songs of Praise in January 2010. He was a guest on the Children in Need special of the BBC quiz Only Connect in November of the same year. In 2011 he presented a four-part Radio 3 series called Out in the World: A Global Gay History. He regularly guest-hosted the Radio 4 programme Saturday Live, while the regular host Fi Glover was on maternity leave from 2008 to 2009: Coles replaced Glover permanently in 2011. On 1 September 2011, he presented a short piece on his home town and parish of Finedon for the Radio 4 programme You and Yours. In December 2012, December 2013 and November 2014, he appeared as a guest on the BBC comedy quiz show QI. In January 2014, he won the BBC's Celebrity Mastermind quiz, his specialist subject being the Mapp and Lucia novels of E. F. Benson. Coles featured as the subject of Fern Britton Meets... on BBC1 in December 2014. Since 2014 he has appeared regularly in the \\"Pause for Thought\\" slot on Radio 2's The Chris Evans Breakfast Show, for which he won a Jerusalem Award in 2014. In July 2016, Coles appeared on the BBC cooking series Celebrity Masterchef, finishing in fifth place. In February 2017, he co-presented The Big Painting Challenge with Mariella Frostrup on BBC1. From September 2017, Coles was a contestant for the 15th series of BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. He was paired with professional dancer Dianne Buswell and they were the second couple to be eliminated after scoring 14 points for their Pasodoble to Flash Gordon - the lowest scoring Pasodoble in the history of Strictly. On 18 December 2017, Coles was a guest panelist on the Christmas special of the eleventh series of the BBC1 comedy quiz Would I Lie to You?, hosted by Rob Brydon. Coles was captain of a team from the University of Leeds who were series champions on the BBC's Christmas 2019 University Challenge.

An example of this would be ADAM12 which plays a significant role in the fusion of muscle cells during embryo development, in a process known as myogenesis. Most metalloproteases require zinc, but some use cobalt. The metal ion is coordinated to the protein via three ligands. The ligands co-ordinating the metal ion can vary with histidine, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and arginine. The fourth coordination position is taken up by a labile water molecule. Treatment with chelating agents such as EDTA leads to complete inactivation. EDTA is a metal chelator that removes zinc, which is essential for activity. They are also inhibited by the chelator orthophenanthroline. Classification  There are two subgroups of metalloproteinases: * Exopeptidases, metalloexopeptidases (EC number: 3.4.17). * Endopeptidases, metalloendopeptidases (3.4.24). Well known metalloendopeptidases include ADAM proteins and matrix metalloproteinases, and M16 metalloproteinases such as Insulin Degrading Enzyme and Presequence Protease In the MEROPS database peptidase families are grouped by their catalytic type, the first character representing the catalytic type: A, aspartic; C, cysteine; G, glutamic acid; M, metallo; S, serine; T, threonine; and U, unknown. The serine, threonine and cysteine peptidases utilise the amino acid as a nucleophile and form an acyl intermediate - these peptidases can also readily act as transferases. In the case of aspartic, glutamic and metallopeptidases, the nucleophile is an activated water molecule. In many instances the structural protein fold that characterises the clan or family may have lost its catalytic activity, yet retain its function in protein recognition and binding. Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main protease types, with more than 50 families classified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as 'abXHEbbHbc', where 'a' is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1' subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, 'b' is an uncharged residue, and 'c' a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases. Metallopeptidases from family M48 are integral membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, binding one zinc ion per subunit. These endopeptidases include CAAX prenyl protease 1, which proteolytically removes the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins. Metalloproteinase inhibitors are found in numerous marine organisms, including fish, cephalopods, mollusks, algae and bacteria. Members of the M50 metallopeptidase family include: mammalian sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) site 2 protease and Escherichia coli protease EcfE, stage IV sporulation protein FB.

For this reason, endopeptidases cannot break down peptides into monomers, while exopeptidases can break down proteins into monomers. A particular case of endopeptidase is the oligopeptidase, whose substrates are oligopeptides instead of proteins. They are usually very specific for certain amino acids. Examples of endopeptidases include: * Trypsin - cuts after Arg or Lys, unless followed by Pro. Very strict. Works best at pH 8. * Chymotrypsin - cuts after Phe, Trp, or Tyr, unless followed by Pro. Cuts more slowly after His, Met or Leu. Works best at pH 8. * Elastase - cuts after Ala, Gly, Ser, or Val, unless followed by Pro. * Thermolysin - cuts before Ile, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, or Val, unless preceded by Pro. Sometimes cuts after Ala, Asp, His or Thr. Heat stable. * Pepsin - cuts before Leu, Phe, Trp or Tyr, unless preceded by Pro.

History The old town, close to the river, forms a nucleus around which a newer and more extensive quarter, bordered by boulevards, has grown up; the suburbs of St. Christophe and D√©ols lie on the right bank of the Indre. The castle from which the city takes its name was built in the latter part of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of D√©ols. From 920 to 1008, the Norman raids forced the monks of the abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, founded in Brittany by Saint Gildas, to bring his relics to the abbey of Saint-Gildas of Ch√¢teauroux that they founded under the protection of the prince Ebbes of D√©ols, father of Raoul. During the Middle Ages it was the seat of a seigniory, which passed to the Chauvigny from 1207 to 1473 and was raised to the rank of countship in 1497 for Jean V d'Aumont. In 1616, when it was held by Henry II, Prince of Cond√©, it was raised to the rank of duchy. In 1736 it returned to the crown, and was given to Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess of Ch√¢teauroux, by Louis XV in 1744. The present Ch√¢teau Raoul housing the pr√©fecture offices dates from the 15th century.

Neighbor Cities: S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, Santa Branca, Guararema, Jambeiro, Igarat√° and Santa Isabel. History Jacare√≠ was formed on land that belonged to Mogi das Cruzes. It was founded by Antonio Afonso and his sons in 1652. They built a chapel in honor of Our Lady of Conception. With the help of peaceful Indians, the village prospered. In 1953, was elevated as a town and in 1849, as a city. Paraibuna (on December 7, 1812), Santa Branca (on February 20, 1841) and S√£o Jos√© dos Campos (unknown date) were incorporated into the municipality of Jacare√≠.

Meaning of Name The origin of the name Jacare√≠ is not known but there are two hypotheses. Contains in the archives of the municipality that, in the past, the lakes and the Paraiba do Sul river relied on large numbers of alligators. In a fraternization, held on the river bank near the pond, a component of the group who was having fun next to the river, watching the large number of alligators made an observation: \\"Jacar√©, iih\\" (alligator, iih). It was the simple interjection that, connected to the alligator, resulted in Jacare√≠. The second hypothesis is that the word came from a native Brazilian language (Tupi language) \\"Icare-ig\\" that means \\"river of alligators\\".

It has also been used to prevent migraine headaches and complications of cirrhosis. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, a slow heart rate, and Raynaud syndrome. Serious side effects may include heart failure and bronchospasm. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is a non-selective beta blocker and works by blocking Œ≤1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and Œ≤2-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels. Nadolol was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2016, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions. Medical uses Nadolol is used to treat hypertension and for long-term treatment of angina pectoris and is approved by the FDA for these purposes.Nadolol entry in AccessMedicine. McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Accessed 8 November 2014 It is regularly used off-label for control of heart rate in people with atrial fibrillation, prevention of migraine headaches; prevention of bleeding veins in people with portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis; and to treat people with high levels of thyroid hormone. Nadolol is one of the preferred beta-blockers in the management of patients with LQTS for shortening of the QT interval and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. It is more efficacious than cardioselective beta-blockers like metoprolol and propanolol in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events. Nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. For patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. It has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's diseaseU.S. National Library of Medicine Nadolol entry in Medline Plus but neither is well established. Side effects The most common side effects include dizziness and fatigue. Contraindications Nadolol and other beta blockers should be used with cautions in people with heart failure and its use should not be abruptly stopped. It is contraindicated for people with asthma, a slow heart rate and certain severe heart problems. Mechanism of action Four stereoisomers of nadolol Nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it non-selectively blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. It has a preference for beta-1 receptors, which are predominantly located in the heart, thereby inhibiting the effects of catecholamines and causing a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Its inhibition of beta-2 receptors, which are mainly located in the bronchial smooth muscle of the airways, leads to airway constriction similar to that seen in asthma. Inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney inhibits the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, causing a decrease in vasoconstriction and a decrease in water retention. Nadolol's inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the heart and kidney leads to its effects on lowering blood pressure. The drug impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate. Nadolol may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. Chemistry Nadolol is a mixture of stereoisomers. It is polar and hydrophilic, with low lipid solubility.

During the Middle Ages, the county of Foix was ruled by the counts of Foix, whose castle overlooks the town of Foix. In 1290 the counts of Foix acquired the viscountcy B√©arn, which became the center of their domain, and from that time on the counts of Foix rarely resided in the county of Foix, preferring the richer and more verdant B√©arn. The county of Foix was an independent fief of the kingdom of France and consisted of an agglomeration of small holdings ruled by lords, who, though subordinate to the counts of Foix, had some voice in the government of the county. The provincial estates of the county, a legislative body that can be traced back to the 14th century, consisted of three orders and possessed considerable power and energy. In the 17th and 18th centuries Foix formed one of the thirty-three gouvernements, or military areas, of France and kept its provincial estates until the French Revolution. In 1790 it was joined with Couserans to form the d√©partement of Ari√®ge. The county of Foix, as it existed just before the French Revolution, had a land area of 2,466 km2 (952 sq. miles). At the 1999 census there were 76,809 inhabitants living on the territory of the former province of the county of Foix, which means a density of only 32 inh. per km2 (84 inh. per sq. miles). The largest urban areas are Pamiers, with 17,715 inhabitants in 1999, and Foix, with 10,378 inhabitants in 1999. History County of Foix in 1328 (B√©arn is outside of the map). =House of Foix= rightThe Counts of Foix flourished from the 11th to the 15th century. They were at first feudatories of the counts of Toulouse and the counts of Barcelona, but after the latter's defeat in the Cathar Crusade they succeeded in establishing their direct vassalage to the king of France. During the 13th and 14th centuries the counts of Foix figured among the most powerful of the French feudal nobles. Living on the borders of France, having constant interaction with the Kingdom of Navarre, and in frequent communication with England through Gascony and Aquitaine, they were in a position favorable to an assertion of independence, and acted more like the equals than the dependents of the kings of France. The title of count of Foix was first assumed by Roger of Foix (died ca. 1064), son of Bernard Roger of Couserans, who was a younger son of Roger I de Cominges, Count of Carcassonne, de Couserans et de Raz√©s, when he inherited the town of Foix and the adjoining lands, which had hitherto formed part of the county of Carcassonne. His grandson, Roger II, took part in the First Crusade in 1095 and was afterwards excommunicated by Pope Paschal II for seizing ecclesiastical property. Subsequently, he appeased the anger of the church through rich donations, and when he died in 1125 he was succeeded by his son, Roger III, and his son, Roger Bernard I. Roger-Bernard's only son, Raymond Roger, accompanied the French king, Philip Augustus, to Palestine in 1190 and distinguished himself at the capture of Acre. He was afterwards engaged in the Albigensian Crusade defending the Cathars, and, on being accused of heresy, his lands were given to Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester. Raymond Roger came to terms with the Church and recovered his estates before his death in 1223. He was a patron of the Proven√ßal poets and a poet himself. He was succeeded by his son, Roger Bernard II the Great, who assisted Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, and the Albigenses in their resistance to the French kings, Louis VIII and Louis IX, was excommunicated on two occasions, and died in 1241. His son, Roger IV, died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son, Roger Bernard III who, more famous as a poet than as a warrior, was taken prisoner both by Philip III of France and by Peter III of Aragon. He married Marguerite, daughter and heiress of Gaston VII, Viscount of B√©arn, and he inherited B√©arn and N√©bouzan from his father-in-law in 1290, which led to the outbreak of a long feud between the Houses of Foix and Armagnac. From 1278 the counts of Foix, and their legal successors, have also been Co-princes of Andorra. =House of Foix-B√©arn= Castle of Foix towering above the town, with the Pyrenees behind. leftThe quarrel was continued under Roger Bernard's son and successor, Gaston I, who became count in 1302, inheriting both Foix and B√©arn. Becoming embroiled with the French king, Philip IV, in consequence of the struggle with the count of Armagnac, Gaston was imprisoned in Paris. He quickly regained his freedom and accompanied King Louis X on an expedition into Flanders in 1315, and died on his return to France in the same year. His eldest son, Gaston II, made peace with the house of Armagnac and took part in various wars both in France and Spain, dying at Seville in 1343, when he was succeeded by his young son, Gaston III. Gaston III (1331‚Äì1391), called Phoebus, the Latin version of Apollo, on account of his beauty, was the most famous member of the House of Foix-B√©arn. Like his father he assisted France in her struggle against England, being entrusted with the defence of the frontiers of Gascony. When the French king, John II, favored the count of Armagnac, Gaston left his service and went to fight against the pagans of Prussia. Returning to France around 1357, he delivered some noble ladies from the attacks of the adherents of the Jacquerie at Meaux, and was soon at war with the count of Armagnac. National Library of France. During this struggle he also attacked the count of Poitiers, the royal representative in Languedoc, but owing to the intervention of Pope Innocent VI he made peace with the count in 1360. Gaston, however, continued to fight against the count of Armagnac, who, in 1362, was defeated and compelled to pay a ransom. This war lasted until 1377. Early in 1380, the count was appointed governor of Languedoc, but when Charles VI succeeded Charles V as king later in the same year, this appointment was cancelled. Refusing, however, to heed the royal command, and supported by the communes of Languedoc, Gaston fought for about two years against John, duke of Berry, who had been chosen as his successor. When he was bested in the combat, he abandoned the struggle and retired to his estates, remaining neutral and independent. He then resided in Orthez, the capital of B√©arn. In 1348 Gaston married Agnes, daughter of Philip, Count of Evreux (d. 1343), by his wife Jeanne II, queen of Navarre. By Agnes, whom he divorced in 1373, he had an only son, Gaston, who is said to have been incited by his uncle, Charles II of Navarre, to poison his father, and who met his death in 1381. It is probable that he was killed by his father; this is the account presented by Froissart. Gaston was very fond of hunting, but was not without a taste for art and literature. Several beautiful manuscripts are in existence which were executed by his orders, and he himself wrote a treatise on hunting, the Livre de chasse, known in English as The Hunting Book. Froissart, who gives a graphic description of his court and his manner of life at Orthez in B√©arn, speaks enthusiastically of Gaston, saying: \\"I never saw one like him of personage, nor of so fair form, nor so well made, and again, in everything he was so perfect that he cannot be praised too much\\". Left without legitimate sons, Gaston de Foix was easily persuaded to bequeath his lands to King Charles VI, who thus obtained Foix and B√©arn when the count died at Orthez in 1391. Almost immediately after Gaston's death Charles granted the county of Foix to Matthew, Viscount of Castelbon, a descendant of Count Gaston I of Foix. When Matthew died without issue in 1398, his lands were seized by Archambault, Count of Grailly and Captal de Buch, the husband of Matthew's sister Isabella (d. 1426), who was confirmed as legitimate count of Foix in 1401. =House of Foix-Grailly= rightArchambault's eldest son, John (ca. 1382‚Äì1436), who succeeded to his father's lands and titles in 1412, had married Jeanne in 1402, daughter of Charles III, king of Navarre. Having served the king of France in Guyenne and the king of Aragon in Sardinia, John became the royal representative in Languedoc, when the old quarrel between Foix and Armagnac broke out again. During the struggle between the Burgundian party and the Armagnacs, he intrigued with both, and consequently was distrusted by the Dauphin, afterwards King Charles VII. Deserting the French cause, he then allied himself with Henry V of England. When Charles VII became king in 1423, he returned to his former allegiance and became the king's representative in Languedoc and Guyenne. He then assisted in suppressing the marauding bands which were devastating France, fought for Aragon against Castile, and aided his brother, the cardinal of Foix, to crush an insurgency in Aragon. Peter, cardinal of Foix (1386‚Äì1464), was the fifth son of Archambault of Grailly, and was made archbishop of Arles in 1450. He took a prominent part in the struggle between the rival popes, and founded and endowed the Coll√®ge de Foix at Toulouse. The next count was John's son, Gaston IV of Foix, who married Leonora (died 1479), a daughter of John, king of Aragon and Navarre. In 1447 he bought the viscounty of Narbonne, and having assisted King Charles VII in Guyenne, he was made a peer of France in 1458. In 1455 his father-in-law designated him as his successor in Navarre, and Louis XI of France gave him the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne, and made him his representative in Languedoc and Guyenne; but these marks of favor did not prevent him from joining a league against Louis in 1471. His eldest son, Gaston, the husband of Madeleine, a daughter of Charles VII of France, died in 1470, and when Gaston IV died two years later, his lands descended to his grandson, Francis Phoebus (died 1483). Francis Phoebus became king of Navarre in 1479 and was succeeded by his sister Catherine (died 1517), the wife of Jean d'Albret (d. 1516). A younger son of Count Gaston IV was John (died 1500), who received the viscounty of Narbonne from his father and married Marie, a sister of the French king Louis XII. He was on good terms both with Louis XI and Louis XII, and on the death of his nephew Francis Phoebus in 1483, claimed the kingdom of Navarre against Jean d'Albret and his wife, Catherine de Foix. The ensuing struggle lasted until 1497 when John renounced his claim. He left a son, Gaston de Foix (1489‚Äì1512), a distinguished French general, and a daughter, Germaine de Foix, who became the second wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon. In 1507, Gaston exchanged his viscounty of Narbonne with King Louis XII of France for the duchy of Nemours, and as duke of Nemours he took command of the French troops in Italy. After delivering Bologna and taking Brescia, Gaston encountered the troops of the Holy League at Ravenna in April 1512 and routed the enemy, but was killed during the pursuit. There were also younger branches of the house of Foix-Grailly: the viscounts of Lautrec (descended from Pierre de Foix, younger son of Jean III); the Counts of Candale and Benauges (descended from Gaston de Foix, a younger son of Archemboult and his son John de Foix, 1st Earl of Kendal); the Counts of Gurson and Fleix and Viscounts of Meille (Jean de Foix, Comte de Meille, Gurson et Fleix, was a younger son of Jean de Foix, Earl of Kendal), and the Counts of Caraman, or Carmain, descended from Isabeau de Foix, Dame de Navailles (only child of Archambaud de Foix-Grailly, Baron de Navailles) and her husband Jean, Vicomte de Carmain, whose descendants adopted the name and arms of Foix.. =Houses of Albret and the House of Bourbon= right rightWhen Catherine, wife of Jean d'Albret, succeeded her brother Francis Phoebus, the House of Foix-Grailly was merged into that of Albret, and later into that of Bourbon with Henry III of Navarre, son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d'Albret. Henry III of Navarre became King Henry IV of France in 1589. In 1607, he united to the French crown his personal fiefs that were under French sovereignty (i.e. County of Foix, Bigorre, Quatre-Vall√©es, and N√©bouzan, but not B√©arn and Lower Navarre, which were sovereign countries outside of the kingdom of France), and so the county of Foix became part of the royal domain.

Franklin and starring Myrna Loy, Conway Tearle and Anthony Bushell. The film is modernized adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel of the same title with the original Regency-era story reset in Twentieth Century Britain. Three years later Thackeray's novel was adapted again as Becky Sharp, the first three-strip technicolor film. Plot This film adaptation's storyline begins around 1920 and concludes in 1933.The actual year this story begins is indefinite. However, the style of car depicted in the film's opening scene, dialogue references to times between major events in the plot, and the appearance of a calendar near the end of the film support the cited timeframe. In its opening scene a limousine is traveling down a road outside London. In the car are two passengers, Amelia Sedley (Barbara Kent) and her friend Becky Sharp (Myrna Loy), young ladies who agewise are in their twenties. Amelia is from a rich, well-connected family, while Becky is from very modest means and has no family at all. Given Becky's circumstances, Amelia has invited her to her home for the Christmas holidays. At the Sedley estate Amelia's family welcomes their guest, but the mother is soon wary of her. Those suspicions are warranted, for Becky aims to use her beauty and guile to gain wealth and privilege by climbing England's social ladder. Her first target for achieving those goals is Joseph, Amelia's much-older brother (Billy Bevan). After Becky tries unsuccessfully to trap him into marriage, Mrs. Sedley sees her cuddling in the home's drawing room with her daughter's fianc√©, George Osborne. Disgusted, the mother calls \\"Miss Sharp\\" into the adjoining room, where she advises Becky to leave immediately so she can begin the job she had accepted before the holidays, that of governess for the family of Sir Pitt Crawley. Becky heeds the thinly veiled advice and departs.Fulghum, R. Neil (2016). The plot summary, including the story's given timeframe, and all dialogue quotations are based on notes from multiple viewings of Vanity Fair by R.

Upon her arrival at the residence of Lord Crawley, Becky quickly stirs the passions of both the elderly Sir Pitt and his son Rawdon (Conway Tearle). The new governess entices them with her suggestive comments and by allowing each man into her bedroom at night while she glides about in her satin pajamas. Soon she and Rawdon begin a secretive affair, but Sir Pitt finally catches them together in Becky's bedroom. There they inform him they had married the previous day. That news enrages the old man, who orders his son and his \\"shameless little hussy\\" out of his house. Relocating to a townhouse in London's Mayfair district, Becky and Rawdon feel the financial strains of being cut off from Lord Crawley and his wealth. The couple at first brings in money by betting and cheating their friends playing bridge. That income, however, is insufficient for their mounting bills, so Becky schemes to find other ways to get money. She does so through blackmail and by obtaining gifts from a string of lovers, including George Osborne, now the husband of her friend Amelia. Eventually, even Rawdon cannot tolerate his wife's wanton, criminal behavior. On the evening he is released from police custody for writing bad checks, Rawdon finds Becky at their home with another lover. He declares their marriage is over and gives her only ten minutes to vacate the premises. As she leaves, he informs Becky that his father had just died, and he is now the new Lord Crawley. He then warns her that if she ever dares to refer to herself as \\"Lady Crawley,\\" he will track her down and kill her. Several years pass and Becky lives in a far less affluent, largely French-speaking area of London.At this point in the film, many of the peripheral characters are portrayed speaking French, which suggests that Becky is living in Soho, a district of London long recognized as home to the city's \\"French Quarter.\\"Watts, Peter (2014). \\"London's Huguenots,\\" Great Wren, July 9, 2014. There she prowls the area's bars and casinos, getting money from the assorted men she meets. One evening in a casino, she sees Amelia's brother Joseph, who updates her about his sister's situation. While Becky already knows that Amelia's husband George had died five years earlier in a horse-riding accident, she learns from Joseph that Amelia still refuses to remarry. Subsequently she also learns that her friend's devotion to George's memory and her mistaken belief in his fidelity have led Amelia to refuse repeated marriage proposals from Dobbin, a gentleman who has adored her for years. Sometime later, Becky invites Amelia to her apartment and confesses her affair with George. She then calls Amelia a fool for revering a dead \\"cad\\" and urges her to wed Dobbin, who is waiting outside in a car. When Amelia rejoins him after Becky's disclosures, she rests her head on Dobbin's shoulder, implying that his next proposal will be accepted. The film sequence that follows shows the passage of more years and the ongoing disintegration of Becky's life, which has become a daily struggle marked by petty crimes, prostitution, and meager funds. In the final scene Becky enters her shabby one-room apartment. Lying on the bed is Joseph, stirring from his latest binge. She addresses him as \\"my love\\" and informs him that his sister had just given her another check. He is infuriated and tells her never to accept money again from Amelia. Becky turns, sits at a dresser, and stares into its mirror. In the reflection she watches her face transform from the reality of its present haggard appearance to its former beauty. She then notices that Joseph has quietly departed. She also notices on a small bedside bureau that he has torn up his sister's check, and in the dust that coats the bureau's surface he has written Finis (\\"The End\\").The etymology of finis is traced to a Latin term literally meaning \\"the end.\\" From the 15th century through the 19th century Finis was often placed on the final page of a book.

Biography Joaquin Cort√©s is a Spanish flamenco dancer. A native of C√≥rdoba, Cort√©s showed interest in dancing from an early age. Cort√©s and his family moved to Madrid in 1981. Soon after moving to Madrid, he began to take formal dancing lessons and studying seriously. In 1984, he was accepted as a member of Spanish prestigious national ballet company. He traveled the world with the Spanish National Ballet, performing in important venues such as the Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center) of New York and the Kremlin Palace in Moscow. During his stint with the Spanish National Ballet, he also became a principal solo performer known for his phenomenal stamina and athleticism. Former U.S. President left Desiring more creative control, Cort√©s formed the Joaqu√≠n Cort√©s Flamenco Ballet company and launched his first international tour 'Cibay√≠' in 1992. The formation of Cort√©s' own company allowed him to diverge from purist ballet and create his own fusion of flamenco, ballet and modern dance. In 1995, in addition to being featured in two international films- 'La flor de mi secreto' (The Flower of My Secret) and Carlos Saura's 'Flamenco', Joaqu√≠n Cort√©s embarked on what is often considered his most successful venture, 'Pasi√≥n Gitana' (Gypsy Passion). 'Pasi√≥n Gitana' marked the beginning of Cort√©s' recognition for not only his prowess as a dancer, but also as a choreographer and artistic director. In 1999 Cort√©s was the subject of a documentary film and he launched a successful tour of 'Soul' across North and South America. In the 1990s Joaqu√≠n Cort√©s gained notoriety for his close relationships with high-profile celebrities such as Naomi Campbell, Giorgio Armani and Mira Sorvino. Continuing into the millennium, Cort√©s' focus shifted from dancing to choreography and artistic direction. He continues to dance in a limited capacity live on stage, in film and television.

Orlev is a decorated war hero who received the Medal of Distinguished Service in the Yom Kippur War. Background Born in Rehovot during the Mandate era, Orlev studied humanities and social sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, before training to be a teacher at Moreshet Yaakov College. He later worked as Director General of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, and Director General of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Orlev lives in Jerusalem's Givat Mordechai neighborhood with his wife, Nira. They have four children. During his national service in the Israel Defense Forces, he reached the rank of Sergeant. Orlev fought in the Six-Day War, participating in the capture of East Jerusalem. He sustained a knee injury and underwent rehabilitation for two years. During the Yom Kippur War, Orlev served in a stronghold on the Bar-Lev Line. During the Egyptian attack on the first day of the war, Orlev took charge of the soldiers in his outpost after the commander was wounded. Under his command, his unit repelled Egyptian attempts to capture the position, and he organized the evacuation from the stronghold. For this, he was awarded a Medal of Distinguished Service. He later served as a reservist during the 1982 Lebanon War. Political career He was first elected to the Knesset in the 1999 elections on the National Religious Party list. After being re-elected in the 2003 elections, Orlev was appointed Minister of Welfare and Social Services in Ariel Sharon's government. During the crisis in the party over the Gaza disengagement plan, Orlev led the camp which believed staying in the government, rather than leaving the coalition, was the best option. In response, NRP leader Effi Eitam called Orlev a \\"Meimadnik\\". When Eitam and Yitzhak Levy quit the government in 2004, Orlev and many NRP members refused to leave the coalition. Orlev then succeeded in taking control of the party, resulting in Eitam and Levy leaving to form the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party (later renamed Ahi), which would later join the National Union. Orlev was re-elected in the 2006 elections. Prior to the 2009 elections the NRP was dissolved and its members joined the Jewish Home. Orlev won second place on the new party's list, and retained his seat in the subsequent elections. Orlev became known for several controversial statements and legislative proposal. In 2009 the Knesset debated a Private Members Bill proposed by Orlev, providing for imprisonment of anyone who denied that Israel was a Jewish and democratic state. The bill passed its preliminary reading.Uri Avnery, CounterPunch, 2 June 2009, A Fascist Odor of the New Coalition: Racists for Democracy Orlev was criticized for proposing a bill that would mandate divorced fathers to pay child support until their children reached age 22, though he later retracted and stated he would not pursue the bill. In 2012, he called for the Third Temple to be built in Jerusalem, as well as legislation to protect the project from prosecution and the \\"hostile, secular, left-wing media\\". He also proposed a Private Members Bill to override an Israeli Supreme Court ruling ordering the demolition five buildings in an Israeli settlement. Orlev did not run in the 2013 elections. He is a co-president of the international Mizrachi movement, which the National Religious Party and its successor Jewish Home represents in the political arena.World Mizrachi Movement Office Bearers References External links * 1945 births Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Israeli civil servants Living people Israeli Orthodox Jews National Religious Party leaders People from Rehovot Religious Zionism Recipients of the Medal of Distinguished Service The Jewish Home politicians Members of the 15th Knesset (1999‚Äì2003) Members of the 16th Knesset (2003‚Äì2006) Members of the 17th Knesset (2006‚Äì2009) Members of the 18th Knesset (2009‚Äì2013) ","title":"Zevulun Orlev"},{"id":"984472","text":"A bottle of ZMA ZMA (zinc monomethionine aspartate, magnesium aspartate and vitamin B6) is a supplement used primarily by athletes, gymnasts, and bodybuilders. It was developed by Victor Conte (founder of BALCO Laboratories in Burlingame, California). No high quality scientific study has found it to have any beneficial effects on muscle building or strength, and the International Society of Sports Nutrition and the Australian Institute of Sport regard it as having no clear benefits. Formula The original ZMA formula is composed of zinc monomethionine and aspartate (30 mg), magnesium aspartate (450 mg), and vitamin B6 as pyridoxine hydrochloride (10.5 mg). According to the label directions, ZMA should be taken 30 ‚Äì 60 minutes prior to bedtime and on an empty stomach to help synchronise absorption with sleep. Also, the product should not be taken with foods or supplements containing calcium because calcium blocks the absorption of zinc. Since ZMA is not a patented formula, other manufacturers can produce supplements using the original ZMA formula. However, as ZMA is a registered trademark of SNAC Nutrition (SNAC Systems Inc.), other manufacturers can only brand a product as ZMA, or use the term in marketing, when they have been licensed to do so by SNAC Nutrition. A number of manufacturers take the original ZMA formula and seek to enhance it with added ingredients. SNAC Nutrition itself has ZMA-5 (ZMA formula with 5-Hydroxytryptophan) marketed as a sleep enhancer and ZMA Nightcap (ZMA-based proprietary blend with 5-hydroxytryptophan) marketed as an anabolic mineral support. Like all 5-HTP-containing supplements, vivid dreams and/or nightmares are a recognized possible side effect within a subset of users. Scientific studies All three basic components in ZMA formula are important in biological processes, and while studies have shown that most Americans get enough zinc and vitamin B6, more than 50% don't meet the U.S. government's recommendation for magnesium. A 1998 study was undertaken on NCAA football players during an 8-week spring training program. The control group was told to cease taking any nutritional supplements. Those who took the ZMA tablets claimed greater increases in muscle strength. This study was funded by SNAC Systems Inc, the intellectual property right holder, and one of the study's authors, Victor Conte, has ownership equity in this company. In 2004, a study funded by a research grant from Cytodyne (another supplement producing company) with 42 resistance trained males showed that ZMA supplementation had no significant effects on total and free testosterone, IGF-1, growth hormone, cortisol, the ratio of cortisol to testosterone, or muscle and liver enzymes in response to training. No significant effects were observed in changes in strength, upper or lower body muscle endurance, or anaerobic sprint capacity. In another study done in 2006, a team of German scientists conducted a study on the effect of ZMA and testosterone levels in the body. The result showed an increase in zinc secretions in urine making it much darker like blood, but no effect on the level of testosterone in the body.

It was established to solve computational tasks related to government programs of nuclear and fusion energy, space research and missile technology. The Institute is a part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The main direction of activity of the institute is the use of computer technology to solve complex scientific and technical issues of practical importance. Since 2016, development of mathematical and computational methods for biological research, as well as a direct solution to the problems of computational biology with the use of such methods, has also been included in the circle of scientific activities of the institute. Scientific activity =Nuclear physics= Prominent theoretical physicist Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich headed one of the departments placed in charge of the theoretical aspects of the work on the creation of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. Young A. A. Samarskii performed the first realistic calculations of macrokinetics of chain reaction of a nuclear explosion, which led to the practical importance estimated power of nuclear weapons. In relation to nuclear energy, the institute was also involved in modelling of processes of neutron transport and nuclear reactions. In particular, E. Kuznetsov is known for his work on the theory of nuclear reactors. Currently, such work in KIAM is continuing in the field of plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear fusion, which began under the leadership of S. P. Kurdyumova, , . =Cosmonautics= D. E. Okhotsimsky directed the works in the department created for researches of dynamics of space flight. In 1966, the department was reorganized into the Ballistic Centre. Ballistic centre of KIAM The Ballistic Centre was involved in the calculations of optimal orbit trajectory and actual corrections for all space flights, from unmanned interplanetary and lunar vehicles to the manned \\"Soyuz\\" and orbital station \\"Salyut\\" and \\"Mir\\". The department also investigated the docking task, controlled landing and stabilizing the spacecraft. The institute took an active part in the creation of the Soviet space shuttle \\"Buran\\". KIAM continues to engage in performance of current Russian space projects. The current researches are connected with: * development of systems for management and navigation of space vehicles in real time with the use of global satellite navigation systems GPS and GLONASS; * studies of the atmosphere of the planets of the solar system; * exploration of prospects for further interplanetary missions using electric rocket engines; * participation in such projects as \\"RadioAstron\\" and Fobos-Grunt. =Mathematics and Mathematical Modelling= One of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century I. M. Gelfand was at the head of the Department of heat transmission before his departure for the United States in 1989. He was carrying out the fundamental works on functional analysis, algebra and topology. A. N. Tikhonov worked initially also in these areas of mathematics. However, Tikhonov is better known with his works of more applied orientation, such as methods for solving ill-posed problems (Tikhonov regularization). Tikhonov also created the theory of differential equations with a small parameter at the highest derivative. The general theory of stability of difference schemes was developed by . Samarskii considered mathematical modelling as an independent scientific discipline. S. P. Kurdyumov created a whole scientific school in nonlinear dynamics and synergetics in Russia. Currently, the existing arsenal of numerical methods is updated and improved in response to the growing complexity of the models and the possibilities of modern supercomputers. Scientists of KIAM elaborate grid methods for solving computational problems, which has led, in particular, to the creation of a declarative language \\"Norma\\". Programming languages and systems \\"Norma\\" =Computers and Programming= The institute is always supplied with the most modern computer technology, which the domestic industry could put. The first studies were carried out still on mechanical calculators \\"Mercedes\\" by a large staff of estimators.

It is made of lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun with the opening on the top rather than the side. The filling may also contain butter, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, with variants made in some parts of New England replacing the butter with mayonnaise. Other versions may contain diced celery or scallion. Potato chips or french fries are the typical sides. History According to the \\"Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink\\" the lobster roll originated as a hot dish at a restaurant named Perry's in Milford, Connecticut, as early as 1929. Its popularity then spread up and down the Connecticut coast, but not far beyond it. In Connecticut, the sandwich served warm is called a \\"lobster roll\\"; served cold, a \\"lobster salad roll.\\" As far back as 1970, chopped lobster meat heated in drawn butter was served on a hot dog bun at road side stands such as Red's Eats in Maine. Lobster rolls in the U.S. are associated with the state of Maine, but are also commonly available at seafood restaurants in the other New England states and on Eastern Long Island, where lobster fishing is common. Lobster rolls in Maine are characteristically served on a New England-style hot dog bun, which is split on the top instead of the side and has flat sides for grilling. The lobster meat is usually served cold, rather than warm or hot, and mayonnaise is typically spread inside the bun or tossed with the meat. The filling consists of chunked knuckle, claw, and lobster tail and is only lightly seasoned if at all. Four ounces is a standard serving size. Lobster rolls are a popular seasonal meal, particularly among tourists throughout the Maritime provinces in Canada, especially Nova Scotia, where they may also appear on hamburger buns, baguettes, or other types of bread rolls and even in pita pockets. The traditional side orders are potato chips and dill pickles. McDonald's restaurants in Canadian provinces, such as Nova Scotia and Ontario, as well as in New England, offer lobster rolls as a limited edition item in the summer.

It was an important trading centre for locally mined tin, and a seaport before the River Plym silted up and trade moved down river to Plymouth and was the seat of Plympton Priory the most significant local landholder for many centuries. Plympton is an amalgamation of several villages, including St Mary's, St Maurice, Colebrook, Woodford, Newnham, and Chaddlewood. Toponymy Although the name of the town appears to be derived from its location on the River Plym (compare, for instance, Otterton or Yealmpton), this is not considered to be the case. As J. Brooking Rowe pointed out in 1906, the town is not and never was sited on the river ‚Äì rather it is sited on the ancient trackway called 'the Ridgeway' from Dartmoor. The earliest surviving documentary reference to the place is as Plymentun in Anglo-Saxon charter S380 dated to around 900 AD, and this name may be derived from the Old English adjective plymen, meaning \\"growing with plum-trees\\". So Plympton would have the meaning \\"Plum-tree farm\\". Alternatively, Cornish derivations also give ploumenn meaning 'plum' and plo(b)m meaning 'lead' ‚Äì possibly related to Latin plombum album ( 'British lead') or tin. The local civic association, however, suggests an unsupported alternative derivation from the Celtic Pen-lyn-dun (\\"fort at the head of a creek\\"). By the early 13th century, the River Plym was named from a back- formation from this name and nearby Plymstock. This later led to the naming of the fishing port created at the river's mouth (Plymouth, originally named Sutton) when the river estuary silted up too much for the monks to sail up river to Plympton any longer. History Nearby is the Iron Age hill fort of Boringdon Camp. Plympton is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being held by the king (William the Conqueror), with 27 villagers, 12 smallholders and 6 slaves.Open Domesday Online: Plympton, accessed December 2017. In the early 12th century Plympton was the site of an important priory founded by William Warelwast. The members were Augustinian canons and the priory soon became the second richest monastic house in Devon (after Tavistock). The gatehouse of the priory is still in existence. In 1872 it was recorded that the gatehouse, kitchen and refectory were still in good condition.Pevsner, N. (1952) South Devon. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; pp. 242‚Äì45 Plympton's motte and bailey castle Richard de Redvers (died 1107) was granted the feudal barony of Plympton, based at Plympton Castle, by King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135), of whom he was a most trusted supporter. The de Redvers family later became Earls of Devon. Their lands, including Plympton, and titles were later inherited by the Courtenay family, feudal barons of Okehampton. The ancient Stannary town remains dominated by its now ruined Norman motte-and-bailey castle and it still retains a cohesive medieval street pattern. A number of historic buildings in the local vernacular style of green Devon slate, limestone and lime-washed walls, with Dartmoor granite detailing, attest to all periods of its history. Before the Reform Act 1832 the town was one of the rotten boroughs, and sent two MPs to the unreformed House of Commons. Sir Joshua Reynolds in a self-portrait The town was the birthplace and early residence of the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723‚Äì1792) who became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts. He was mayor of Plympton in 1773. His father was headmaster of Plympton Grammar School which is a historic building in the centre of the town. Former pupils were Benjamin Haydon and Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, PRA, who were respectively first director of the National Gallery and first president of the Royal Photographic Society. Many of Reynold's paintings were purchased by his friends the Parker family of local Saltram House, now owned by the National Trust, and are still on public display there. Historic estates The manor of Boringdon in Colebrook was a seat of the Parker family formerly of North Molton, which later acquired Saltram. Loughtor (after c.1718 renamed Newnham Park) was the seat of the Selman family, of whom several were MPs. William Selman II was five times MP for Plympton Erle between 1420 and 1429. The estate was later a minor seat of a cadet branch of the Courtenay family. Newnham was a manor that was the seat of the Strode family,Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.718‚Äì20, pedigree of Strode whose monuments exist in St Mary's Church. Churches Plympton has two churches. The church of St Thomas at Plympton St Maurice (also known as the church of St Maurice) is of Norman origin. Its tower was rebuilt in the middle of the 15th century. The church was restored by E. H. Sedding in 1878. It includes a monument to Joshua Reynolds that was erected in 1904.Cherry, Bridget & Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England: Devon. Yale University Press, 2004. pp. 683‚Äì5 St Mary's church was dedicated in 1311 and was originally a parish chapel attached to Plympton Priory. It has two aisles on each side of the nave, the outer aisles being shorter than the inner ones. The tower, built of granite ashlar, is visible from afar. The south porch is ornamented with carving and has a lierne vault. The outer north aisle is the earliest part of the church and the rest is mainly of the 15th century, the south aisle being the latest part. There are monuments to the Strode family, including a tomb-chest for Richard Strode (died 1464), the effigy being clad in armour. The monument of William Strode (died 1637) and his family shows husband, two wives and ten children. There is also a monument of W. Seymour (died 1801) in Coade stone and of Viscount Boringdon, the 11-year-old heir to the Earl of Morley of Saltram House who died in Paris in 1817, by Fran√ßois- Nicolas Delaistre. Modern Plympton Between about 1990 and 2010 Plympton has seen considerable growth as the suburban population of Plymouth has doubled. To help manage this rapid growth more efficiently, Plympton has been separated into a series of separate districts: Yealmpstone, Plympton-St Maurice, Colebrook, Underwood, Woodford and Chaddlewood. =Public transport= Plympton has four main bus services: routes 20, 20A, 21 and 21A, which are operated by Plymouth Citybus and services 52 and 59, which are operated by Target Travel. In the past, railway facilities were originally provided at Plympton ‚Äì for goods traffic only ‚Äì by the horse-drawn Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway, but their branch was closed and sold to the South Devon Railway to allow them to build a line from Exeter to Plymouth. A station was opened in the town on 15 June 1848. From 1 June 1904 it was the eastern terminus for enhanced Plymouth area suburban services but it was closed to passenger traffic from 3 March 1959 and all goods related traffic from June 1964.https://www.oldplymouth.uk/Railways-Plympton%20Station.htm |Old Plymouth, UK In addition to this railway connected to the National rail network there is also The Plym Valley Railway which is a preserved railway based at the reconstructed Marsh Mills station on Coypool Road. This was formerly part of the GWR Plymouth to Launceston branch line. The volunteer-run PVR is actively rebuilding the line between Marsh Mills and Plymbridge. Steam and diesel heritage trains run on numerous Sundays throughout the year. Plymouth City Council has stated it would like to see a rail station reopened on the London main line running through the middle of Plympton, which would provide quick and frequent trains into Plymouth. But there are major obstacles to providing such a service on a primarily inter-regional rail route, shown when Ivybridge ‚Äì on the same line ‚Äì got a new station in 1994. Plymouth city council support the reopening of the station to deal with bad traffic congestion in Eastern Plymouth. After a feasibility study in 2017, A Plymouth Joint plan was opened for consultation in 2018 which included a suggested 'Plymouth Metro' with a station at Plympton however, as of May 2020, nothing has been enacted. =Schools= Plympton has two state secondary schools serving pupils from ages 11‚Äì18. Both Plympton Academy and Hele's School attract students from the Plympton area and surrounding areas of Laira, Ivybridge and Dartmoor. =Sports= Amateur club Plympton Athletic F.C. are members of the Devon Football League South and West Division as of 2020. Their home is the Lee Moor Stadium. = Events = Plympton has hosted an annual fete called 'The Lamb Feast' for many years on the local Castle Green. A key part of Plympton's Midsummer Festival in mid June, the Lamb Feast and surrounding activities span over the weekend, organised by the Plympton Civic Association.

In April 2019, the Senate passed a bill in response to the Christchurch mosque shooting which required websites that provide a hosting service to \\"ensure the expeditious removal\\" of audio or visual material documenting \\"abhorrent violent conduct\\" (including terrorist acts, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape or kidnapping), produced by a perpetrator or accomplice, within a reasonable time frame. Hosts must also report such content to authorities. Those who do not remove the materials may face fines and jail time. Several ISP's had already voluntarily blocked websites related to footage of the Christchurch shooting before the bill had passed. Current status In 2009, Australia's internet was considered \\"Under Surveillance\\" by Reporters without Borders A collection of both federal and state laws apply to Internet content in Australia. =Federal law= While the Australian constitution does not explicitly provide for freedom of speech or press, the High Court has held that a right to freedom of expression is implied in the constitution, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government routinely monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can and do engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.\\"Freedom of Speech and Press\\" in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011: Australia, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 25 May 2012 Broadcasting Services Act 1992 Provisions of Schedule 5 and Schedule 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 inserted in 1999 and 2007 allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority to effectively ban some content from being hosted within Australia. Under this regime, if a complaint is issued about material \\"broadcast\\" on the Internet the ACMA is allowed to examine the material under the guidelines for film and video. The content is deemed to be \\"prohibited\\" where it is (or in ACMA's judgement likely would be): * Refused classification, or classified X18+ * Classified R18+, and not protected by an adult verification system * Classified MA15+ and not protected by an adult verification system, where the user has paid to access the content. * Cyberbullying Where content is deemed to be prohibited, the ACMA is empowered to issue local sites with a takedown notice under which the content must be removed; failure to do so can result in fines of up to $11,000 per day.Banned hyperlinks could cost you $11,000 a day (SMH) If the site is hosted outside Australia, the content in question is added to a blocklist of banned URLs. This list of banned Web pages is then added to filtering software (encrypted), which must be offered to all consumers by their Internet service providers. In March 2009, this blocklist was leaked online.Leaked Australian blacklist reveals banned sites A number of take down notices have been issued to some Australian-hosted websites. According to Electronic Frontiers Australia in at least one documented case, the hosting was merely shifted to a server in the United States, and the DNS records updated so that consumers may never have noticed the change. Suicide Related Materials Offences Act 2006 In 2006, the Federal Parliament passed the Suicide Related Materials Offences Act, which makes it illegal to use communications media such as the Internet to discuss the practical aspects of suicide. Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015 In June 2015, an amendment was passed to Australian copyright law, which allows for the court-ordered censorship of non-domestic websites whose primary purpose is to facilitate copyright infringement.  Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019  In April 2019, the Senate passed this bill in response to the Christchurch mosque shooting, which was live-streamed and circulated online. It requires websites that provide a hosting service to \\"ensure the expeditious removal\\" of audio or visual material documenting \\"abhorrent violent conduct\\" (including terrorist acts, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape or kidnapping), produced by a perpetrator or accomplice, within a reasonable time-frame. Hosts must also identify and report such content to authorities. Those who do not remove the materials may face fines (including up to $10.5 million or 10% of annual revenue for corporations) and jail time. This law applies regardless of whether or not the content is hosted on servers in Australia. The bill has faced criticism for being imprecise, with no formal definition of how quickly sites must remove the abhorrent content, and being wider-reaching than needed (it applies to any service that hosts content, while the intent of the bill implied a goal to impose it on social networking services). =State and territory laws= Some state governments have laws that ban the transmission of material unsuitable for minors. In New South Wales, Internet censorship legislation was introduced in 2001 which criminalises online material which is unsuitable for minors. In 2002, the New South Wales Standing Committee on Social Issues issued a report recommending that the legislation be repealed, and in response the New South Wales government stated that the legislation \\"will be neither commenced nor repealed\\" until after the review of the Commonwealth Internet censorship legislation had been completed.New South Wales Internet Censorship Bill 2001 =Notable examples= In October 2000, Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) attempted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) to obtain documents relating to the implementation of the web filter. While a few were released, many were not, and in 2003 new legislation, \\"Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002\\", was passed by the Liberal government and four independents, and opposed by The Greens and the Australian Labor Party. While the stated reason for the bill was to prevent people accessing child pornography by examining the censored sites, this bill exempted whole documents from FOI, many of which did not reference prohibited content at all. EFA state that the bill was designed to prevent further public scrutiny of web filtering proposals.EFA: FOI Request on ABAEFA: Amendments to FOI Act: Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 In 2002, New South Wales Police Force Minister Michael Costa attempted, without success, to shut down three protest websites by appealing to the then-communications minister Richard Alston.NSW seeks to shut down protest sites The Green Left Weekly stated these were Melbourne Indymedia and S11 websites, and that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (the predecessor to ACMA) cleared them of breaching government regulations on 30 October 2002.WTO hides from protesters Also in 2002, and under the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Federal Court ordered Fredrick T√∂ben to remove material from his Australian website which denied aspects of the Holocaust and vilified Jews.Jones v Toben (Federal Court)Racial Vilification in Australia (HREOC) In 2006, Richard Neville published a \\"spoof\\" website that had a fictional transcript of John Howard apologising to Australians for the Iraq War. The website was forcibly taken offline by the government with no recourse. After the devastating bushfires in February 2009, details about an alleged arsonist were posted online by bloggers. Victoria Police deputy commissioner Kieran Walshe has asked the state Director of Public Prosecutions to examine the possibility of removing these blogs from the web, as they might jeopardise any court case.Police move to ban blogs on alleged arsonist (SMH) In March 2009, after a user posted a link to a site on ACMA's blocklist on the Whirlpool forum, Whirlpool's service provider, Bulletproof Networks, was threatened with fines of $11,000 per day if the offending link was not removed. The same link in an article on EFA's website was removed in May 2009 after ACMA issued a \\"link-deletion notice\\", and the EFA took the precautionary step of also removing indirect links to the material in question.Aussie censors implement six degrees of separation policy (The Register) The 2009 winner of the George Polk award for videography shows footage of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan being shot and dying during Iran protests. This footage has also been declared \\"prohibited content\\" by ACMA, attracting fines of $11,000 per day for any Australian website which posts a link to the video.ITWire - I am muzzled On 15 December 2009, the Labor government announced plans to mandate censorship of refused classification material in Australia. The then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, released a statement titled Measures to improve safety of the internet for families, which briefly outlined the proposed purpose and methods of filtering. The scheme aimed to develop \\"a package that balances safety for families and the benefits of the digital revolution\\", and was intended to complement the work of the ACMA by blocking content hosted overseas which is out of the control of Australian authorities. An anti-censorship website was hosted on stephenconroy.com.au and stephen-conroy.com, satirising Senator Conroy and his proposed blocklist. The site referred to Conroy as the \\"minister for fascism\\", and contained humorous graphics and statements condemning censorship. On 18 December 2009, the domain stephenconroy.com.au was seized by auDA, somewhat ironically for an anti-censorship site, and content was then moved to stephen-conroy.com. The basis for seizure regarded the moral owner of the domain, not its content. On 22 May 2009, it was disclosed in the press, citing WikiLeaks, that the Australian Government had added Dr Philip Nitschke's online Peaceful Pill Handbook, which deals with the topic of voluntary euthanasia, to the blocklist maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority used to filter web access to citizens of Australia. Euthanasia groups will hold seminars around Australia teaching how to evade the proposed filter using proxy servers and virtual networks. A spokeswoman for Senator Conroy said that euthanasia would not be targeted by the proposed web filter,Euthanasia workshops 'to fight filter' (smh) however Stephen Conroy has previously stated that \\"while euthanasia remains illegal it will be captured by the RC filter\\". In January 2010, the Encyclopedia Dramatica article \\"Aboriginal\\" was removed from the search engine results of Google Australia, following a complaint that its content was racist. George Newhouse, the lawyer for the complainant, claims the site is \\"illegal\\" and should be blocked by the mandatory web filter. As the address of the site appeared on the leaked ACMA blocklist, it is likely that the whole site would be censored by the filter.Sickipedia: bid to shut offensive 'encyclopedia dramatica' (smh) A search on terms related to the article will produce a message that one of the results has been removed after a legal request relating to Australia's Racial Discrimination Act 1975. In 2010, the website of the Australian Sex Party is banned from within several state and federal government departments, including Stephen Conroy's ACMA. Convenor of the Australian Sex Party Fiona Patten has described this ban as \\"unconstitutional\\".Aussie net censorship turning Chinese The Register In April 2013, it was revealed that an IP address used by more than 1,200 websites had been censored by certain Internet service providers. It was discovered by the Melbourne Free University which was one of the sites censored. It was later revealed that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) had ordered the censorship of the address to target a fraud website, and that the remaining websites were censored unintentionally. The block was subsequently lifted. ASIC subsequently revealed that it had used its censorship powers 10 times over the preceding 12 months, and that a separate action taken in March had also caused the inadvertent temporary censorship of around 1000 untargeted active sites, as well as around 249,000 sites that hosted \\"no substantive content\\" or advertised their domain name for sale. The censorship was carried out under the section 313 legislation, and censorship notices were sent to four or five ISPs on each occasion. In March 2019, several websites disseminating footage of the Christchurch mosque shooting were censored by major ISPs in Australia and New Zealand, including 4chan, 8chan, and LiveLeak . On 2 September 2020, a woman was arrested in Ballarat for making a Facebook post that promoted a protest over COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria. A viral video from before her incitement charge shows her offering to take the post down and trying to convince the police that she did not know it was illegal. Rosalind Croucher of the Australian Human Rights Commission and Wendy Harris of the Victorian Bar both expressed concerns that police had infringed on freedom of expression with a disproportionate response. Politicians Michael O'Brien and Steven Ciobo, while reaffirming their support for the lockdown, also criticized the arrest as heavy handed. Voluntary censorship by ISPs = 2011 child abuse filtering = In June 2011, two Australian ISPs, Telstra and Optus, confirmed they would voluntarily block access to a list of child- abuse websites provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and more websites on a list compiled by unnamed international organisations from mid-year.\\"Telstra, Optus to start censoring the web next month\\", Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson, News Limited newspapers, 22 June 2011 = Christchurch mosque shootings = On 20 March 2019, Telstra, Optus, TPG and Vodafone censored access to several websites in response to the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. The websites, which included LiveLeak, 4chan, 8chan, Voat, Kiwi Farms and Zero Hedge, were blocked for allegedly hosting footage of the shootings that was originally live-streamed on Facebook. Sites were banned using a combination of DNS blocking and IP blocking. DNS blocking is relatively easy to circumvent (whether implemented through ISP-controlled DNS servers or sniffing all DNS requests); whereas IP bans can only be circumvented with a proxy, VPN or Tor. Information on the exact methods and timeframes that sites were blocked is vague and anecdotal, but there was a significant amount of online discussion at the time. Optus appeared to use IP blocks for 4chan and possibly other sites. Telstra took a similar approach. Most bans appeared to be lifted after several weeks, with 4chan and Voat bans extending longer. One source states that the Telstra bans lasted only \\"a few hours\\", but this does not agree with most online discussion. The telecom providers claimed to be acting independently and not under directive of government or law enforcement, which sparked some public controversy. Normally such censorship would be ordered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, but this event exposed the independent power that ISPs may exercise. Telstra released a brief statement soon after blocking the sites, referring to \\"extraordinary circumstances\\" that required an \\"extraordinary response\\". TPG did not officially responded to media inquires other than a statement that it would \\"comply with any request of this nature made to us by authorities\\"; however, user reports indicate that TPG also temporarily blocked access to a subset of these sites. Proposed mandatory filtering legislation In October 2008, the governing Australian Labor Party proposed extending Internet censorship to a system of mandatory filtering of overseas websites which are, or potentially would be, \\"refused classification\\" (RC) in Australia. As of June 2010, legislation to enact the proposed policy had not been drafted.Internet filter draft legislation delayed (iTwIRE) The proposal has generated substantial opposition, with a number of concerns being raised by opponents and only a few groups strongly supporting the policy.Web censorship plan heads towards a dead end In November 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) released a document indicating that the earliest date any new legislation could reach parliament was mid-2013.\\"10. Internet Filtering\\" , Strategy Paper SGSM, 14 November 2010. Retrieved 9 July 2012 However, voluntary filtering by ISPs remains a possibility. =Terminology= Proposed Australian laws on Internet censorship are sometimes referred to as the Great Firewall of Australia, Rabbit Proof FirewallJim Wallace's pro-censorship lies and distortions (a reference to the Australian Rabbit-proof fence), Firewall Australia or Great Firewall Reef (a reference to Great Barrier Reef and the Great Firewall of China).Tear down Australia's Great Firewall Reef (spiked) The proposed filter has been referred to in the media variously as an Internet filter and a web filter. The worldwide-web is a myriad of software documents containing pointers to each other, hosted on server computers around the world. The Internet is the physical network used to convey requests from users' computers to these servers and responses from the servers back to the users. The proposed filter only monitors certain ports specific to conveying web traffic. As it aims to monitor the majority of web traffic, it is appropriately referred to as a web filter. As it is agnostic of the majority (99.99%) of other connections a user's computer might establish with other computers on the Internet, it is something of a misnomer to refer to it as an Internet filter. Since the proposed filter is situated at the Internet service provider (the junction between users and the Internet at large), introducing such a filter cannot possibly slow down the Internet itself. It can only (potentially) slow down access to the Internet by users of that ISP. Ignoring load considerations, communication speed across the Internet for any non-web traffic would be unaffected. =History= In 1995, the Labor Party of Federal Government began inquiries into regulating access to online content as part of expanding the scope of classification material mediums.Senate Committees ‚Äì Parliament of AustraliaConsultation paper on the regulation of online information services - July 1995 In the same year, the Liberal Party of Victoria(Victoria) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) (ENFORCEMENT) ACT 1995 and Western Australia(Western Australia) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) ENFORCEMENT ACT 1996 State Governments and Country Liberal Party of Northern Territory Government(Northern Territory) CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) ENFORCEMENT ACT 1996 implemented changes to law that allows censoring online content as part of expanding the scope of classification material.States to Censor Online Services Queensland introduced similar legislation at the time, but a case of an ISP systems administrator showed it did not apply to online services when the judge ruled that the act did not apply. In 1996, the Labor Party of New South Wales State Government attempted to propose a standard Internet censorship legislation for all Australian States and Territories. The legislation would have made ISPs responsible for their customers' communications. But the proposed legislation attracted widespread protestsSTOP! Campaign and has since been postponed in favour of a national scheme.Censor's hands of the Internet In 1997, following the previous Federal Government, the Liberal Party further commissioned inquiries into a variety of online censorship schemes, including self-imposed censorship by ISPs.National framework for on-line content regulation - Media ReleaseREPORT ON REGULATION OF COMPUTER ON-LINE SERVICES PART 3 By 1999, the then Federal Government attempted to introduce an Internet censorship regime. Some have pointed out it was to gain support from minority senators to assist with the sale of Telstra and introduction of GST,Porn Wars, Episode 2 (zdnet Australia) but as noted above, this censorship plan had been in development for several years. In 2001, CSIRO was commissioned to examine Internet content filtering. The report focused primarily on evaluating the effectiveness of client-side filtering schemes (which were generally ineffective), but also discussed some of the difficulties with ISP-based filteringReport prepared by CSIRO for NetAlert. Original report available at In March 2003, the Fairfax papers The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald reported the results of a survey taken by The Australia Institute of 200 children, which found that many of them had found pornography on the Internet. Over the next few days was a storm of media and political attention, and there were calls for finer Internet filters and tougher censorship laws. Analysis of the report showed little new material, and only 2% of girls had admitted being exposed to pornography, while the figure for boys was 38%; such a difference between boys and girls would seem to indicate that inadvertent exposure was rare, contrary to the conclusions of the report. After the controversy died down, no new action resulted from the new report, media attention, or political speeches. In 2003, the Labor Party opposed filtering at the ISP level, with Labor Senator Kate Lundy stating > \\"Unfortunately, such a short memory regarding the debate in 1999 about > Internet content has led the coalition to already offer support for greater > censorship by actively considering proposals for unworkable, quick fixes > that involve filtering the Internet at the ISP level.\\"Web censorship plan > heads towards a dead end (SMH) Shortly before the 2004 federal election, two political parties issued new policies on Internet censorship. The Australian Labor Party's policy involved voluntary adherence by users. The Family First Party released a far stricter policy of mandatory filtering at the Internet service provider level. The Australian Family Association petitioned the Australian Federal Government in 2004 to further restrict access by children to pornographic material via the Internet. The petition was submitted in December 2004. On 21 March 2006, the Labor Party committed to requiring all ISPs to implement a mandatory Internet blocking system applicable to ‚Äúall households, and to schools and other public Internet points‚Äù to ‚Äúprevent users from accessing any content that has been identified as prohibited by the Australian Communications and Media Authority‚Äù. On the same day, the then communications minister Helen Coonan stated that to > ‚Äúfilter the Internet will only result in slowing down the Internet for every > Australian without effectively protecting children from inappropriate and > offensive content‚Äù =Political party policies, positions and statements= Labor Party On 31 December 2007, Stephen Conroy announced the Federal Government's intention to introduce an ISP-based filter to censor \\"inappropriate material\\" from the Internet to protect children. In this announcement, it was stated that adults could opt out of the filter to receive uncensored access to the Internet. In May 2008, the government commenced an $82 million \\"cybersafety plan\\" which included an additional mandatory filter with no opt-out provision. This ISP-based filter aims to stop adults from downloading content that is illegal to possess in Australia, such as child pornography or materials related to terrorism.Proposed Filter Criticized in Australia New York Times, December 12, 2008. In March 2009, Stephen Conroy dismissed suggestions that the Government would use the filter to crack down on political dissent as \\"conspiracy theories\\". He stated that the filter would only be used to remove \\"refused classification\\" (RC) content, using the same rationale as existing television, radio and print publications, and that the Senate could be relied upon to provide rigorous assessment of any proposed legislation. However, Labor's policy statement on the issueLabor's Plan For Cyber Safety contradicts this. It is also contrary to an earlier ministerial release in 2008.Minister welcomes advances in internet filtering technology The most recent explanation of the government's position on this issue is provided on the ministry website.Internet Service Provider (ISP) Filtering (accessed 1 April 2010) This clearly states that only ISP-level filtering of (designated) refused classification (RC) material will be mandatory under their policy. However, ISP's will be encouraged to offer ISP-level filtering of 'adult content' as an optional (commercial) service to their customers. Such an optional extra service is aimed at parents trying to protect their children from 'undesirable' content that would otherwise be available, because it would not be RC (e.g., it might receive a classification of \\"R\\"). Labor Senator Kate Lundy said in January 2010 that she is lobbying within the party for an \\"opt- out\\" filter, describing it as the \\"least worst\\" option.Tough filter campaign ahead (ZDnet) In February 2010 she said she would propose the opt-out option when the filtering legislation goes before caucus.Lundy calls for net filter opt-out (Canberra Times) Stephen Conroy has stated that 85% of Internet Service Providers, including Telstra, Optus, iPrimus, and iiNet, welcome the Internet filter.Filter goes ahead regardless (smh) In response, Steve Dalby, iiNet's chief regulatory officer, stated that iiNet as a company does not support the Internet filter, and never has.What we really think (iiNet) On 9 July 2010, Stephen Conroy announced that any mandatory filtering would be delayed until at least 2011. On 9 November 2012, Stephen Conroy shelved the proposed mandatory filter legislation in favour of existing legislation, touting that it was successful in compelling the largest ISPs to adopt a filter. As a result, 90% of Australian Internet users are censored from accessing some web-based content.\\"Child abuse material blocked online, removing need for legislation\\" , Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, 9 November 2012 The Liberal/Nationals Coalition In February 2009, then opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin obtained independent legal advice confirming that a mandatory censorship regime would require new legislation. In March 2009, after the ACMA blocklist was leaked and iiNet withdrew from the filtering trials, he stated that Stephen Conroy was \\"completely botching the implementation of this filtering policy\\".Opposition says Government is botching internet filter trial (ABC) In March 2010, shadow treasurer Joe Hockey attacked the filter, saying \\"What we have in the government's Internet filtering proposals is a scheme that is likely to be unworkable in practice. But more perniciously it is a scheme that will create the infrastructure for government censorship on a broader scale\\". During the 2010 Federal Election, Liberal communications spokesman Tony Smith announced that \\"a Coalition government will not introduce a mandatory ISP level filter\\", with Joe Hockey also announcing an intention to vote against the policy if Labor is re-elected.Coalition to dump 'flawed' internet filter This followed the 2010 Federal Conference of the National Party passing a motion proposed by the Young Nationals to \\"oppose any mandatory ISP-level internet censorship\\".National Party says no to filter In November 2012, Coalition Communications spokesman welcomed the proposed legislation being dropped as it endangered freedom and Internet performance. However, some Coalition members voiced concern, citing support for a mandatory filter to protect children and families but will not propose it citing lack of political support at the time.Conroy's scrapped internet filter missed the point on online safety: Coalition The Coalition have proposed an \\"eSafety commissioner\\" to take down undesirable content from the Internet as a means to protect children.Coalition calls for kids‚Äô e-safety commissioner It was met with criticism as a duplication of current government efforts and \\"difficult and expensive\\" to implement. In September 2013, two days before the federal election, the Coalition announced they would introduce an opt-out filter for all Internet connections, including both fixed line and mobile devices. This has since been retracted as \\"poorly worded\\" in a statement from Malcolm Turnbull, who said, \\"The correct position is that the Coalition will encourage mobile phone and Internet service providers to make available software which parents can choose to install on their own devices to protect their children from inappropriate material.\\"\\"Malcolm Turnbull says Coalition will not introduce opt-out internet filter after earlier supporting it\\", Matthew Grimson, ABC News, 5 September 2013. Retrieved 5 September 2013. The Greens The Greens do not support the filter, and Greens senator Scott Ludlam predicts that due to obstruction in the Senate, the legislation will not be introduced until after the next federal election. At the end of 2008, he asked questions in parliament related to the filtering trial, for which the Government provided answers in January 2009: * When asked about the stated public demand for Internet filtering, the government responded that the filtering was an election commitment * The web filter would be easy to bypass using technological measures * 674 out of 1,370 censored sites on the mandatory list relate to child pornography; 506 sites would be classified as R18+ or X18+, despite the fact that such content is legal to view in Australia. The remaining 190 sites from this number on the blocklist can be viewed at the full revealed blocklists on WikiLeaks. Ludlam believes that the Labor party may have hit a wall of \\"technical impossibility\\", and the filter does not suit its purpose: > \\"This isn't a great advertisement for the workability of any large scale > scheme. The proposal has always been unpopular, now perhaps the Government > is starting to come to grips with what the industry has been saying all > along: if your policy objective is to protect children on-line, this is not > the way to go about it.\\" Despite their lack of support for the filter, The Greens preselected Clive Hamilton, whose think-tank The Australia Institute first suggested an ISP- based Internet filter, for the by-election in the seat of Higgins. Independents and minor parties In October 2008, Family First senator Senator Steve Fielding was reported to support the censorship of hardcore pornography and fetish material under the government's plans to filter access to the web. A Family First spokeswoman confirmed that the party wants X-rated content banned for everyone, including adults. A spokesman for independent senator Nick Xenophon said: > \\"should the filtering plan go ahead, he would look to use it to block > Australians from accessing overseas online casino sites, which are illegal > to run in Australia\\".Net filters may block porn and gambling sites (SMH) Senator Xenophon has, however, stated that he has serious concerns about the plan, and in February 2009 withdrew all support, stating that \\"the more evidence that's come out, the more questions there are on this\\". He believes that money would be better spent educating parents and cracking peer-to-peer groups used by paedophiles. A political party associated with the Eros Association, the Australian Sex Party, was launched in November 2008 and plans to campaign on issues including censorship and the federal government's promised web filter.Sex industry is launching a new political party In 2014, the party won a seat in the Victorian Legislative Council. =Two blocklists= As of October 2008, the plan includes two blocklists, the first used to filter \\"illegal\\" content, and the second used to filter additional content unsuitable for children. The first filter will be mandatory for all users of the Internet, while the second filter allows opting out. The government will not release details of the content on either list,No opt-out of filtered Internet Darren Pauli, Computerworld Australia, October 2008. Reprinted by The Industry Standard but has stated that the mandatory filter would include at least 10,000 sites, and include both the ACMA blocklist and UK's Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) blocklist. In December 2008 the IWF list caused problems when the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was added to the list, as it prevented many people in the UK from being able to edit Wikipedia. The ACMA definitions of \\"prohibited content\\" give some idea of what could potentially be blocklisted. Online content prohibited by ACMA includes: * Any online content that is classified RC or X 18+ by the Classification Board. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, depictions of bestiality, material containing excessive violence or sexual violence, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use, and/or material that advocates the doing of a terrorist act. * Content which is classified R 18+* and not subject to a restricted access system that prevents access by children. This includes depictions of simulated sexual activity, material containing strong, realistic violence and other material dealing with intense adult themes. In answer to a question in Parliament in October 2008, the government in January 2009 stated that of the 1,370 websites on the blocklist, 674 were related to child pornography, and the remainder would be classified as R18+ and X18+. Two websites are known to be on the ACMA blocklist after they were submitted to ACMA for review. When ACMA responded with the advice that these sites had been placed upon its denyl list, ACMA's response was in turn posted back to the web by the original submitters, with the purpose of demonstrating that political content would be censored by the mandatory filter. One was an anti-abortion website, with details posted to Whirlpool, and the other was a copy of Denmark's own Internet blocklist, with both the blocklist and ACMA's response posted on WikiLeaks. The web hosting company for Whirlpool, Bulletproof networks, was threatened with $11,000 in fines per day if the link was not removed, so Whirlpool removed the link to the restricted site. Civil liberties campaigners regard the inclusion of these sites on the blocklist as a demonstration that it is not difficult to get a site placed on the blocklist, and that the blocklist includes sites which are themselves not illegal to view.Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list, 16 March 2009Net censorship already having a chilling effect (EFA) =Leaking of the ACMA blocklist= 18 March 2009: WikiLeaks publishes a list which is > \\"derived from the ACMA list for the use of government-approved censorship > software in its \\"ACMA-only\\" mode.\\" Included in the list were \\"the websites > of a Queensland dentist, a tuckshop convener and a kennel operator\\". 19 March 2009: Australian media sources report that the ACMA blocklist has been leaked to WikiLeaks > \\"The seemingly innocuous websites were among a leaked list of 2300 websites > the Australian Communications and Media Authority was planning to ban to > protect children from graphic pornography and violence.\\" ACMA claimed that the list which appeared on the WikiLeaks website was not the ACMA 'blocklist', as it contained 2,300 URLs. ACMA claimed the ACMA list contained only 1,061 URLs in August 2008, and has at no stage contained 2,300. The ACMA report on the issue noted the similarities between the two lists, yet addressed only the claim reported in the media that the list was the blocklist. The report only contains the following claims about the two lists: * \\"The list provided to ACMA differs markedly in length and format to the ACMA blocklist.\\" * \\"The ACMA blocklist has at no stage been 2,300 URLs in length and at August 2008 consisted of 1,061 URLs.\\" 20 March 2009: WikiLeaks published another list, this time closer to the length published by ACMA.

I don't actually know what's on the list but I'm told by [...] ACMA it appears to be closer to the actual, legitimate list.\\" On the program Senator Conroy also explained that the seemingly inexplicable censoring of a dentist's website was due to subversion of the website by the Russian mafia, who had inserted RC material. In the same discussion Bill Henson's website, despite the PG rating given to his photographs by the same body, appeared on the blocklist due to a technical error according to Stephen Conroy'Technical error' behind Henson website black-listing - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) The ACMA has since released a statement claiming the technical error was a \\"computer system caching error\\" and further stated \\"found that this is the only URL where a caching error resulting in the URL being incorrectly added to the list.\\" =Live filtering trials= The government has committed to trials of the mandatory web filter before implementation. On 28 July 2008, an ACMA report entitled ‚ÄúClosed Environment Testing of ISP-Level Internet Content Filtering‚Äù showed performance and accuracy problems with the six unnamed ISP-based filters trialled. EFA analysis of the report showed that:Minister welcomes advances in internet filtering technology EFA says Filtering Trial a Failure * One filter caused a 22% drop in speed even when it was not performing filtering; * Only one of the six filters had an acceptable level of performance (a drop of 2% in a laboratory trial), the others causing drops in speed of between 21% and 86%; * The most accurate filters were often the slowest; * All filters tested had problems with under-censoring, allowing access to between 2% and 13% of material that they should have censored; and * All filters tested had serious problems with over-censoring, wrongly censoring access to between 1.3% and 7.8% of the websites tested. * The trial tested speed on a simple \\"black listed or not\\" basis for all simulated clients on all systems, yet the report outlines the ability of the filters to provide customised filtering to each client (as would be required by the two levels of filtering which ACMA is proposing) which would significantly impact test results. In November 2008, the Government hired Melbourne company ENEX TestLab, an RMIT spin-off, to design a live pilot test on a real network.Opposition rises to internet filter In this trial, in which several ISPs have expressed an interest, 10,000 blocklisted \\"unwanted\\" websites would be censored in addition to 1,300 websites identified by ACMA.Internet Filter to block 10,000 \\"unwanted\\" websites (Courier-Mail) As an incentive for participation, the department states that participating ISPs \\"will be recognised for their participation in the Pilot. This recognition will strengthen their brand image with the community\\". These ISPs will also be allowed to keep any software and hardware purchased by the government for the trial. The trial may include some ability to censor or alert on the presence of proxies. Both filtered and unfiltered users will be surveyed as part of the trial.iTWire - Australian Government calls for live Internet filter trial ISPs participating in the Live Trial will be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with ACMA.Internet Service Provider Filtering Pilot - Request for Expression of Interest Communications from Senator Conroy's office have indicated that the live trial will occur without the participation of any customers due to concerns about the impact on network performance of filtering 10,000 URLs. Telstra and Internode have stated that they will not take part in the trial. iiNet has stated that it will take part in the trial only to show that the filtering will not work. Optus has stated that it will only test a heavily cut-down filtering model containing only 1,300 URLs in a limited geographic area, and customers will be allowed to opt out. At the end of 2008, Stephen Conroy anticipated that the live trial would test the filtering of BitTorrent traffic,Oz net censorship apparatus to target BitTorrent The Register, 22 December 2008. but in March 2009 he stated that the proposed filters would not be effective on peer-to-peer traffic.Conroy admits blacklist error, blames 'Russian mob' Sydney Morning Herald, 27 March 009. The trial was originally scheduled to be commenced in December 2008, but, after the existence of a report critical of the trial became known, the trial was pushed back.List of banned websites in Thailand and Denmark leaked online On 11 February 2009 a new filtering trial was announced, initially with the ISPs iPrimus Telecommunications, Tech 2U, Webshield, OMNIconnect, Netforce and Highway 1. Testing with each ISP will take place for at least six weeks once filtering equipment has been obtained and installed, and iPrimus expects the trial to begin in late April or early May with five or ten thousand participants. The trial will be opt-in, with ISPs asking for volunteers, although all WebShield customers already receive a filtered service. None of the top three ISPs, Telstra, Optus and iiNet, have been included in the trial, although both iiNet and Optus did expect to be involved at a later time. iiNet withdrew itself from consideration for the trial in March 2009, with Michael Malone giving as reasons the media storm around the leaked blocklist, the changing nature of policy, and \\"confused\\" explanations of the trial's purpose.Pilot to assess technical feasibility of ISP filtering (DBCDE) Optus and iiNet snubbed in web filter trials (news)iPrimus to start filtering in April (zdnet)iiNet quits Conroy's filter trial (ZDNet) In July 2009, some results from the trials began to emerge. Five of the nine participating ISPs reported minimal speed or technical problems associated with the trials. Some ISPs reported that thousands of their members had voluntarily participated in the trials; others, that less than 1% had participated, and that this was not a representative sample. Some customers complained about over-blocking, and withdrew from the trial. One example was the censorship of the pornography website RedTube: ACMA refused to confirm or deny if the site was on the list, or if the site was legal.ISPs give clean feed filter a technical green light (ARN) Leading Australian statistic experts, however, have labelled the trials as unscientific, lacking in proper methodology, unrepresentative and \\"about the worst way you can do it\\".Statistics experts label ISP filtering trials unscientific In December 2009, the results of the filtering trial were released. Stephen Conroy stated, \\"The report into the pilot trial of ISP-level filtering demonstrates that censoring RC-rated material can be done with 100 percent accuracy and negligible impact on Internet speed\\".Conroy Reveals Plans to Censor the Internet However, concerns have been raised about the report: only a small minority of ISP users participated; the trial did not test using any high-speed Internet connections similar to those available with the National Broadband Network; there is evidence that the filter was evaded; and with only 600 to 700 sites on the RC blocklists, the effect of the filter would be marginal at best.Conroy's clean feed won't block porn (New Matilda) =Opinion polling= In February 2010, ABC's Hungry Beast program commissioned McNair Ingenuity Research to perform a telephone poll of 1,000 Australians.Internet Regulation Survey Key results were * To the proposition \\"We need Government regulation of content on the Internet the same as we have Government regulation of content for other media\\" 62% agreed, 35% disagreed. * \\"Having a mandatory Government Internet filter that would automatically censor all access in Australia, to overseas websites containing material that is Refused Classification?\\" Refused Classification was defined as \\"Images and information about one or more of the following: child sexual abuse, bestiality, sexual violence, gratuitous, exploitative or offensive sexual fetishes, detailed instructions on or promotion of crime, violence or use of illegal drugs\\". 80% were in favour, 19% against. * \\"A Government appointed body determining whether a website is appropriate for you to visit?\\" 50% in favour, 46% against. * \\"If a mandatory Internet Filter is established, are you in favour or not in favour of the community being advised which websites have been Refused Classification and the reason why they have been refused classification?\\" 91% in favour, 8% against. * \\"Some opponents of the Government's mandatory Internet Filter are concerned that if it were put in place, future Governments could use Internet Filtering technology to restrict free speech or censor other forms of website content they don't approve of. Do you share this concern?\\" 70% concerned, 27% unconcerned. The wide variation to answers to essentially the same question can be attributed to variations in the wording of the questions asked. The results were initially reported as \\"80pc back web filter: poll\\" despite the fact that 46% were against \\"a government body determining whether a website is appropriate to visit\\".80pc back web filter: poll ABC News, 10 February 2010. In February 2009, a national telephone poll of 1,100 people was conducted by Galaxy and commissioned by GetUp!. It found that only 5 per cent of respondents want ISPs to be responsible for protecting children online, and only 4% want Government to have this responsibility. In March 2010, the results of the Whirlpool Australia broadband survey 2009 were published. This survey was of 21,755 experienced Internet users, and only 8% were in favour of the mandatory filter.92% of Whirlpool users against filter (APC magazine) In May 2010, the results of a study commissioned by the Safer Internet Group (consisting of Google, Internet Industry Association, iiNet, Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Library and Information Association) were published. 39 people participated in four focus group interviews. The study consisted of four focus-group interviews of 39 participants and found that while people were aware of the pending legislation, they did not understand its details. When details of the government's proposal was explained, along with the possible alternatives, enthusiasm for the filter dropped.Study casts doubt over net filter support Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 2010. =Australian Law Reform Commission review= In July 2010, Justice Minister Robert McClelland ordered the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to review the criteria for the ‚Äúrefused classification‚Äù (RC) category, while also conducting public consultation and evaluating the practices and codes of companies in the sector. The ALRC's report, released in February 2012, includes recommendations that:ALRC Report 118: Classification‚ÄîContent Regulation and Convergent Media, Australian Law Reform Commission, 29 February 2012\\"Country Under Surveillance: Australia\\", Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2012 * Type of content targeted by filtering rules should focus on adult content * Content should be censored by ISPs only when it is defined as \\"prohibited\\" * Government review prohibitions on \\"the depiction of sexual fetishes in films and detailed instruction in the use of proscribed drugs\\" * Ban on content that \\"promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime\\" be limited only to serious crime * New media content classification act should be enacted to cover the classification of all media in Australia on any platform, and spell out how those responsible for content, including Internet service providers, should rank prohibited content * Because of the large number of online media organisations, it would not be possible to classify everything and ISPs should \\"take reasonable steps\\" to identify prohibited content, including allowing users to report such content online =Internet Industry Association filter code= Internet Industry Association (IIA) had released a filter code on child abuse for the industry. IIA have stated that no new legislation amendments were required because ISPs were installing filters to censor access to facilitate carrying out legal requests under s313 of the Telecommunications Act. However no known code has been publicly released yet. Internode, TPG and Exetel have been against the scheme, unless the law compels them. iiNet is one notable exception in that they will work with the law, without a position on the scheme. Vodafone is supporting the IIA filter code, but it is unclear whether they will implement it. =Legality of mandatory filtering for users= There are concerns that censoring access based on the Interpol blocklist can constitute a criminal act of \\"impairment of an electronic communication,\\" according to Peter Black (QUT internet law lecturer), the maximum penalty for which is ten years in prison. There was concerns that since Telstra's filter is now live, the telco has not changed the end use agreement about restricting access or notified their customers. Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman stopped short of saying Telstra and Optus breached existing contracts, saying the question was \\"hypothetical one\\". Anti-censorship campaigns Protests involving hundreds of people were held on 1 November 2008, with people in all capital cities nationwide marching on state Parliaments, and on 13 December 2008, in all capital cities.In pictures: hundreds protest government net censorship in APC Magazine The Digital Liberty Coalition organised these protests, declaring an intent to rally continuously until censorship as a whole is taken off the table. The Internet-based political activism organisation, GetUp!, which has previously run mainstream campaigns action against WorkChoices and to free David Hicks, is backing the offline action of the DLC to oppose the web censorship plan. GetUp! first called for donations during December 2008 to raise awareness of Internet censorship in Australia. The group raised an unprecedented $30,000 before the end of the appeal's first day.Cash floods in for anti-censorship protests GetUp! teamed up with award-winning,31st non-traditional and digital creative agency Fnuky Advertising to launch a campaign in Australia to raise awareness of the Australian Government's flawed plans to introduce web censorship. The campaign impersonated the Australian Federal Government by presenting web censorship as a mock consumer product branded as Censordyne, a parody of the toothpaste brand Sensodyne.Good Clean Internet Censorship Fnuky Advertising's Creative Director, David Campbell selected toothpaste as the platform for the campaign after Stephen Conroy stated the purpose of web censorship in Australia was to \\"Fight Moral Decay\\". The Censordyne campaign was launched online during July 2009 by a single Twitter post by fake Stephen Conroy, a popular impersonator of the Australian Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy. The campaign featured an online video,YouTube - GetUp! - Censor This? Censordyne - Internet Censorship a Censordyne product websiteCensordyne - Good, clean internet censorship and a Censordyne search engine.http://search.censordyne.com.au Within 24 hours of launch, the words GetUp and Censordyne were the number 2 and 3 most talked about brands on Twitter worldwide. The campaign received widespread coverage in most major Australian newspapers and news websites. Censordyne become a topic of discussion on Nova 96.9 radio in Sydney and was featured on the Australian ABC television program Insiders. GetUp! raised over $45,000 in donations from the general public during July 2009 to see the Censordyne commercial on TV and on Qantas flights during the month of August 2009, where all Australian politicians would be travelling to Canberra. Following the Censordyne campaign launch, Qantas chose to censor the anti-censorship campaign from their flights.Qantas refused to screen Censordny anti-censorship ad =Response= The debate over Internet filtering has incited some tension in Australia, with threatening phone calls and emails being received by advocates of both sides of the debate.Electronic Frontiers Australia member Geordie Guy receives death threat over web filter plan (news.com) In a speech in January 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accuses countries with Internet censorship of breaching the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Australian filter fits her definition for censorship. Stephen Conroy welcomed Clinton's speech, and agrees with her that \\"freedom of expression has its limits\\". Colin Jacobs responded in turn to note that while there are limits to free speech, Clinton had stated that the advantages of the Internet would be jeopardised by introducing censorship.Clinton speech boosts anti-filter campaign (ABC) As part of a diplomatic assault by the United States on Internet censorship in many countries, U.S. State Department spokesman Noel Clay has raised concerns about the filter plan with Australian officials.Stephen Conroy and US at odds on net filter (The Australian) The leaders of three of Australia's largest ISPs (Telstra, iiNet, and Internode) have stated in an interview that the web filtering proposal simply cannot work for various technical, legal and ethical reasons.ISP-level content filtering won't work The managing director of iiNet, Michael Malone, has said of Stephen Conroy: \\"This is the worst Communications Minister we've had in the 15 years since the [Internet] industry has existed\\", and plans to sign up his ISP for participation in live filtering trials by 24 December to provide the government with \\"hard numbers\\" demonstrating \\"how stupid it [the filtering proposal] is\\".Net Censorship Plan Backlash (SMH) Dale Clapperton, then chairperson of EFA, argued that the Labor party cannot implement the clean feed proposal without either new legislation and the support of the Australian Senate, or the assistance of the Internet Industry Association. As the Liberals and Greens have both stated that they will not support legislation, it can only be implemented with the support of the IIA.Can Labor implement 'clean feed' without legislation?

Other child welfare groups continue to support the filters.Children's welfare groups slam net filters In 2008, ChildWise defended the plan as \\"a victory for common sense\\". NSW Young Labor has abandoned the web filtering plan, passing a motion rejecting Conroy's plans, and calling on him to adopt a voluntary, opt-in system. Colin Jacobs, vice-chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering were illustrated by the problems in the UK caused by the blocking of a single Wikipedia page. He also said of the IWF blocklist: > \\"In Australia, not only would the Government have the ability to secretly > add any site to our blocklist, but an unaccountable foreign-based > organisation would as well\\". Conservative South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi does not support the mandatory web filter. He considers Stephen Conroy's plan to be \\"so devoid of detail\\" that it is impossible to form an opinion on it, and says > \\"Parental responsibility cannot and should not be abrogated to government‚Äîif > it is, our society will only become weaker ...

(Crikey) In an open letter to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Reporters Without Borders states that the web filter is not the solution to combating child sex abuse, and the plan entails risks to freedom of expression. The censorship of websites by ACMA, rather than a Judge, is in contravention of laws. The criteria for censoring \\"inappropriate\\" websites is too vague, and it would be a dangerous censorship option to target \\"Refused classification\\" sites, many of which are unrelated to sexual abuse. Subjects such as abortion, anorexia, aborigines and legislation on the sale of marijuana would all risk being filtered, as would media reports on these subjects.Open letter to Australia's Prime Minister (Reporters without Borders) The Howard Government commissioned a number of independent technical experts to examine Internet filtering. The resulting report was delivered to the Australian Government in February 2008, and released publicly in December 2008. Professor Bjorn Landfeldt, one of the report's authors, stated that filtering technology simply does not work, as it can easily be bypassed and slows access to the Internet by up to 87%. In response, Stephen Conroy has stated that the report involved no empirical testing, and was simply a literature review of material available from other sources; any problems raised by the report would be tested during the filter trials scheduled for mid-January 2009.Fatal Flaws in Web Censorship Plan, says reportGovernment rejects negative internet filter report A report by Tim Stevens and Peter Neumann for the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) analyses each of the available ISP-based filtering solutions and concludes that they are ineffective in the fight against terror. A hybrid filtering scheme was rated the best, but it is ineffective against dynamic content such as chat pages and instant messaging, and had political implications because it required the existence of a blocklist of censored pages. The report instead advocates the use of takedown notices for extremist content, and prosecutions to \\"signal that individuals engaged in online extremism are not beyond the law\\".Internet filtering ineffective in the fight against terror (itNews Australia) The Metaverse Journal suggests that because web filtering logs every site visit, and some information about who is visiting the site, then it is ripe for abuse by whoever runs the filters. It potentially allows surveillance of any user of the Internet, such as journalists, political opponents, or even the family members of politicians.Proposed ISP filtering allows surveillance of journalists, citizens, politicians (Metaverse journal) Ross Fitzgerald of The Australian believes that the filter was not introduced in 2010 to defuse it as an election issue, and that if it is re-introduced into the next parliament it could be even more censorious than the current proposal. Australian radio presenter and writer Helen Razer dislikes the filter because she enjoys pornography, does not believe it causes harm to adults, and doesn't think that children are at much risk:Hey, Senator - leave us discerning viewers of pornography alone (SMH) > \\"I enjoy pornography.

In September 2009, the group Anonymous reawakened, in Operation Didgeridie, in order to protest the policy of Internet censorship, and on 9 September initiated a Distributed Denial-of-service attack against the prime minister's website. As a result of this attack, the site was taken offline for approximately one hour. On 10 February 2010, the Parliament of Australia's website, www.aph.gov.au, was attacked by Anonymous once again. The attacks included distributed denial of service, black faxes, prank calls and spam emails. The attacks commenced at 12 midnight local time and the website was down for over two days. The attack, named \\"Operation Titstorm\\" is reportedly in defiance of the government's banning of small-breasted women and female ejaculation in pornography.\\"Operation Titstorm: hackers bring down government websites\\", Asher Moses, Sydney Morning Herald (Fairfax Media), 10 February 2010. Retrieved 7 July 2014. The group called for physical media to be distributed to members of the Australian Labor Party as well as assaulting email addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers with spam and pornographic images that were in the categories to which were going to be filtered by the government's policy. Other expanded censorship proposals In a 2012 \\"Report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation\\", Raymond Finkelstein argued that standards of \\"accuracy, fairness, impartiality, integrity, and independence\\" on the part of the press could only be achieved through government control. He proposed the creation of an independent News Media Council covering all platforms (print, online, radio and television) with the power to order changes to published content, publication of a right of reply by anyone or any organisation that makes a complaint, and the publication of an apology. Refusal to comply could result in the author, media organisation, or blogger being accused of contempt, a trial by a court, and the possibility of the fines and / or prison sentences associated with contempt of court findings.Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation , R. Finkelstein and M. Ricketson, Independent Media Inquiry Secretariat, Department for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, 28 February 2012 The proposal would have the effect of converting the code of ethics of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) into laws enforceable by the courts. As a result, small publishers and bloggers may feel coerced into publishing corrections or apologies when they lack the time, energy, or resources to defend themselves in court against a contempt charge. In a Sydney Morning Herald report published June 29, 2020 in the wake of rising anti-China media after COVID-19 and US/China relations deterioration in the time of Donald Trump, it was revealed that the Australian government has plans to allow the Australian military to design and implement infrastructure capable of rapidly blocking internet access across the country.

The earliest surviving documentary reference to the place is as Plemestocha in the Domesday Book and its name is derived from Old English meaning either \\"outlying farm with a plum-tree\\" or, if it is short for Plympton Stock, \\"outlying farm belonging to Plympton\\". Situated on the east bank of the River Plym it is geographically and historically part of the South Hams. It comprises the villages of Billacombe, Elburton, Goosewell, Hooe, Mountbatten, Oreston, Pomphlett, Staddiscombe, Turnchapel and Plymstock proper, the centrally located village after which the parish and suburb is named. The parish church is St Mary and All Saints. The pedestrianised 1960s Broadway consists of a number of shops including one supermarket (Iceland) within the precinct with a Lidl supermarket nearby, three banks, six estate agents and other local amenities including a fire station and a small police station. At Pomphlett there is a Morrisons superstore and drive-through McDonald's burger restaurant. The population at the time of the 2001 Census was recorded at 24,103 with 11,652 owner occupied homes in the PL9 area. The total population in 2011 increased to 24,758 The local branch railways through the area to Turnchapel and Yealmpton have been removed, the bridges and stations demolished and the land built on. Pomphlett Mill has been demolished and the site used for a roundabout. Pomphlett Creek (shown right), once a popular rowing stretch has been partly filled in and what remains is largely silted up. Until the 20th century Plymstock was a rural parish but began to develop rapidly just before and after the Second World War as a residential area outside Plymouth but acting as a dormitory area for the city. On 1 April 1967, Plymstock, along with Plympton, was absorbed into the City of Plymouth and today, like Plympton, forms a populous and mostly home-owning south- eastern suburb of the city. There are numerous public spaces including a huge public sports area at Staddiscombe. There is a major golf club at Staddon Heights and a commercial driving range near Elburton. Strident campaigning to get permission and funding for a local public swimming pool have so far failed. Rowing is available on the river Plym, there is a sailing club at Oreston and a large water-sports centre at Turnchapel. There are public tennis courts at Dean Cross. There are many state primary schools in the area and two very large Comprehensive Schools, Coombe Dean School and Plymstock School. There are no local independent school options although children who chose to take and get a very high pass in the 11-Plus can attend one of the three grammar schools in Plymouth. In 2008 Coombe Dean School achieved national notoriety after a popular school plan to erect two generating windmills was blocked by local councillors following opposition by residents of surrounding bungalows. Frequent buses connect most areas of Plymstock with routes across the city linking with the railway station and Derriford hospital. There is a water-taxi linking Mountbatten with Plymouth Barbican. The area invariably returns a Tory MP reflecting with Plympton a more right-wing community than the rest of the city. Gary Streeter is the present Conservative MP. It is also part of the South West Devon constituency which encompasses surrounding rural areas of South Devon; separate from the rest of Plymouth, it is, however, under the Plymouth City Council's control. Folklore Childe's Tomb on Dartmoor is the legendary site of the death of Childe who, caught in a snowstorm, killed and disembowelled his horse and climbed inside for shelter, but still froze to death. He left a message to say that the first person to bury him would get his lands at Plymstock. The greedy monks of Tavistock buried him and claimed the lands. The ghosts of monks carrying a bier have supposedly been seen at Childe's Tomb.Hippisley Coxe, Anthony E. (1973). Haunted Britain. Pub. Hutchinson. . p. 30.

Shiel Jr., \\"Medical Definition of Apophenia\\", Medicine.net. Retrieved 11 August 2020. where a patient sees hostile patterns (for example, a conspiracy to persecute them) in ordinary actions. Apophenia is also typical of conspiracy theory, where coincidences may be woven together into an apparent plot.Bruce Poulsen, \\"Reality Play: Being Amused by Apophenia\\", Psychology Today, July 31, 2012. Retrieved 11 August 2020.  Examples  = Pareidolia = \\"The Organ Player\\": an example of pareidolia in Neptune's Grotto, Sardinia Pareidolia is a type of apophenia involving the perception of images or sounds in random stimuli. A common example is the perception of a face within an inanimate object‚Äîthe headlights and grill of an automobile may appear to be \\"grinning\\". People around the world see the \\"Man in the Moon\\". People sometimes see the face of a religious figure in a piece of toast or in the grain of a piece of wood. There is strong evidence that the use of psychedelic drugs tends to induce or enhance pareidolia. Pareidolia usually occurs as a result of the fusiform face area‚Äîwhich is the part of the human brain responsible for seeing faces‚Äîmistakenly interpreting an object, shape or configuration with some kind of perceived \\"face-like\\" features as being a face. = Gambler's fallacy = Apophenia is well-documented as a rationalization for gambling. Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers that appear in lotteries, card games, or roulette wheels. One variation of this is known as the \\"gambler's fallacy\\". = Statistics = In statistics, apophenia is an example of a type I error ‚Äì the false identification of patterns in data. It may be compared to a so-called false positive in other test situations. = Finance = The problem of apophenia in finance has been addressed in academic articles. More specifically, within the world of finance itself, the examples most prone to apophenia are trading, structuring, sales and compensation.  Related terms  In contrast to an epiphany, an apophany (i.e., an instance of apophenia) does not provide insight into the nature of reality nor its interconnectedness, but is a \\"process of repetitively and monotonously experiencing abnormal meanings in the entire surrounding experiential field\\". Such meanings are entirely self-referential, solipsistic, and paranoid‚Äî\\"being observed, spoken about, the object of eavesdropping, followed by strangers\\". Thus the English term \\"apophenia\\" has a somewhat different meaning than that which Conrad defined when he coined the term \\"Apoph√§nie\\". = \\"Patternicity\\" = In 2008, Michael Shermer coined the word \\"patternicity\\", defining it as \\"the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise\\". = \\"Agenticity\\" = In The Believing Brain (2011), Shermer wrote that humans have \\"the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency\\", which he called \\"agenticity\\". = Clustering illusion = A clustering illusion is a type of cognitive bias in which a person sees a pattern in a random sequence of numbers or events. Many theories have been disproved as a result of this bias being highlighted. In 1985, a study of the \\"hot-hand fallacy\\" by Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallon and Amos Tversky found that the idea of basketball players possessing a \\"hot hand\\" (tending to shoot better in streaks) was false, their analysis providing \\"no evidence for a positive correlation between the outcomes of successive shots\\". Another case, during the early 2000s, involved the occurrence of breast cancer among employees of ABC Studios in Queensland. A study found that the incidence of breast cancer at the studios was six times higher than the rate in the rest of Queensland. However, an examination found no correlation between the heightened incidence and any factors related to the site, or any genetic or lifestyle factors of the employees.  Causes  Apophenia is commonly referred to as an error in perception. Although there is no confirmed reason as to why it occurs, there are some respected theories. = Models of pattern recognition = Pattern recognition is a cognitive process that involves retrieving information either from long-term, short-term or working memory and matching it with information from stimuli. However, there are three different ways in which this may happen and go wrong, resulting in apophenia.  Template matching  The stimulus is compared to templates or copies in the long-term memory. These templates are often stored as a result of past learning or educational experiences. For example, D, d, D and d are all recognized as the same letter. These detection routines, when applied on more complex data sets (such as, for example, a painting or clusters of data) can result in the wrong template being matched. A false positive detection will result in apophenia.  Prototype matching  This is similar to template matching, except for the fact that an exact match is not needed. An example of this would be to look at an animal such as a tiger and instead of recognizing that it was a tiger (template matching) knowing that it was a cat (prototype matching) based on the known information about the characteristics of a cat. This type of pattern recognition can result in apophenia based on the fact that since the brain is not looking for exact matches, it can pick up some characteristics of a match and assume it fits. This is more common with pareidolia than data collection.  Feature analysis  The stimulus is broken down into its features and allowed to process the information. This model of pattern recognition comes from the result of four stages, which are: detection, pattern dissection, feature comparison in memory, and recognition. = Evolution = One of the explanations put forth by evolutionary psychologists for apophenia is that it is not a flaw in the cognition of human brains but rather something that has come about through years of need. The study of this topic is referred to as error management theory. One of the most accredited studies in this field is Skinner's box and superstition. This experiment involved taking a hungry pigeon, placing it in a box and releasing a food pellet at a random time. The pigeon received a food pellet while performing some action; and so, rather than attributing the arrival of the pellet to randomness, it repeated its action, and continued to do so until another pellet fell. As the pigeon increased the number of times it performed the action, it gained the impression that it also increased the times it was \\"rewarded\\" with a pellet, although the release in fact remained entirely random.

A slipway, also known as boat ramp or launch or boat deployer, is a ramp on the shore by which ships or boats can be moved to and from the water. They are used for building and repairing ships and boats, and for launching and retrieving small boats on trailers towed by automobiles and flying boats on their undercarriage. The nautical terms ways and skids are alternative names for slipway. A ship undergoing construction in a shipyard is said to be on the ways. If a ship is scrapped there, she is said to be broken up in the ways. As the word \\"slip\\" implies, the ships or boats are moved over the ramp, by way of crane or fork lift. Prior to the move the vessel's hull is coated with grease, which then allows the ship or boat to \\"slip\\" off of the ramp and progress safely into the water. Slipways are used to launch (newly built) large ships, but can only dry-dock or repair smaller ships. Pulling large ships against the greased ramp would require too much force. Therefore, for dry-docking large ships, one must use carriages supported by wheels or by roller-pallets. These types of dry- docking installations are called \\"marine railways\\". Nevertheless the words \\"slip\\" and \\"slipway\\" are also used for all dry-docking installations that use a ramp.  Simple slipways  An old and simple slipway for smaller boats.Ystad/Sweden In its simplest form, a slipway is a plain ramp, typically made of concrete, steel, stone or even wood. The height of the tide can limit the usability of a slip: unless the ramp continues well below the low water level it may not be usable at low tide. Normally there is a flat paved area on the landward end. When used for building and repairing boats or small ships (i.e. ships of no more than about 300 tons), the vessel is moved on a wheeled carriage, which is run down the ramp until the vessel can float on or off the carriage. Such slipways are used for repair as well as for putting newly built vessels in the water. When used for launching and retrieving small boats, the trailer is placed in the water. The boat may be either floated on and off the trailer or pulled off. When recovering the boat from the water, it is winched back up the trailer. Whaling ships are usually equipped with a slipway at the back, to assist in hauling harpooned whales onto the main deck, where they are usually flensed. Swanage lifeboat being winched back up its slipway after a launch. To achieve a safe launch of some types of land-based lifeboats in bad weather and difficult sea conditions, the lifeboat and slipway are designed so that the lifeboat slides down a relatively steep steel slip under gravity.  Slipways in ship construction  Lake freighter Shenango in a parallel slipway in 1909. For large ships, slipways are only used in construction of the vessel. They may be arranged parallel or perpendicular to the shore line (or as nearly so as the water and maximum length of vessel allows). On launching, the vessel slides down the slipway on the ways until it floats by itself.How Biggest Ship Was Safely Launched, February 1933, Popular Science slipway and launching of French passenger liner Normandie in 1933 -- excellent drawing and illustrations showing basics of process The process of transferring the vessel to the water is known as launching and is normally a ceremonial and celebratory occasion. It is the point where the vessel is formally named. At this point the hull is complete and the propellers and associated shafting are in place, but dependent on the depth of water, stability and weight the engines might have not been fitted or the superstructure may not be completed. In a perpendicular slipway, the ship is normally built with its stern facing the water. Modern slipways take the form of a reinforced concrete mat of sufficient strength to support the vessel, with two \\"barricades\\" that extend to well below the water level taking into account tidal variations. The barricades support the two launch ways. The vessel is built upon temporary cribbing that is arranged to give access to the hull's outer bottom, and to allow the launchways to be erected under the complete hull. When it is time to prepare for launching a pair of standing ways are erected under the hull and out onto the barricades. The surface of these ways are greased (Tallow and whale oil were used as grease in sailing ship days). A pair of sliding ways is placed on top, under the hull, and a launch cradle with bow and stern poppets is erected on these sliding ways. The weight of the hull is then transferred from the build cribbing onto the launch cradle. Provision is made to hold the vessel in place and then release it at the appropriate moment in the launching ceremony, these are either a weak link designed to be cut at a signal or a mechanical trigger controlled by a switch from the ceremonial platform. Two slipways at Portland Harbour - one holding a landing craft and the other a split dump barge (on right). Some slipways are built so that the vessel is side on to the water and is launched sideways. This is done where the limitations of the water channel would not allow lengthwise launching, but occupies a much greater length of shore. The Great Eastern built by Brunel was built this way as were many landing craft during World War II. This method requires many more sets of ways to support the weight of the ship. In both cases heavy chains are attached to the ship and the drag effect is used to slow the vessel once afloat until tugboats can move the hull to a jetty for fitting out. The practice of building on a slipway is dying out with the increasing size of vessels from about the 1970s. Part of the reason is the space requirement for slowing and maneuvering the vessel immediately after it has left the slipway, but the sheer size of the vessel causes design problems, since the hull is basically supported only at its end points during the launch process and this imposes stresses not met during normal operation.

The Mancunian Way is a two mile long grade separated elevated motorway in Manchester, England. It is officially made up of the A57(M) and A635(M) motorways, although the latter does not appear on road signs for practical reasons. It is also part of two other roads: the A57 to the west, which runs east‚Äìwest through Greater Manchester linking the M602 and M67 motorways, and a short section of non-motorway A635 to the east. Part of this non-motorway section collapsed on 14 August 2015 due to a sinkhole. Route The road forms a major part of the Manchester-Salford Inner Ring Road and runs south of the city centre. Running eastbound, it starts as a two-lane dual carriageway and passes underneath the A56. Following this, the road widens to three lanes. At the next junction which leads to the A5103, the road reduces to two lanes and becomes an elevated highway. This section runs atop link roads and two roundabouts before reaching the next junction with the A34. At this point the road passes through the centre of the campuses of UMIST (now part of the University of Manchester) and Manchester Metropolitan University. It then runs for around ¬æ mile (1.2 km) before reaching its junction with the A6 which it crosses on a bridge before dropping down to ground level. It then finishes on the A635 and continues eastbound, and also continues to be called the Mancunian Way. History =Design= The Mancunian Way was conceived to form part of the South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire (SELNEC) Highway Plan of 1962, although similar proposals were developed from 1959. A parliamentary bill to authorise the construction of the Mancunian Way was proposed and approved in 1961. During its design it was known as Link Road 17/7. The scheme lies over the geological West Manchester Fault. It would be the first elevated main road to be built outside London, and the UK's second aerial motorway after the Hammersmith flyover.Concrete Quarterly Spring 1967 The road is 3,232 ft (985 m) long and has 28 spans of 105 ft (32 m), and two spans of 60 ft (18 m). The spans are made out of precast concrete, with hollow box-units post-tensioned to form a spine beam. Each of the 105 ft spans is made out of 14 precast concrete hollow box-units 7 ft 3in long. Freyssinet (named after Eug√®ne Freyssinet) multi-strand prestressing cables were threaded through ducts in the box sections. Testing of the design was carried on a 1/12th model at the Research Station of the Cement and Concrete Association at Wexham Springs in South Bucks. The design was made by the consulting engineers G. Maunsell (Guy Maunsell) & Partners, who had designed the similar Hammersmith flyover in 1961. The company was known for prestressed concrete flyovers. Maunsell is now part of AECOM. The design received a Concrete Society award. The designer of the bridges would go on to design the Westway dual carriageway in London, which opened as the A40(M) in July 1970, losing its motorway status in 2000. =Construction= View west at the eastern terminus of the A57(M), from the north of the junction (with the A6 London Road), showing the Maths and Social Sciences Building (former UMIST), and proximate to the Macdonald Manchester Hotel The construction was carried out in two phases: the first stage involved the construction of a dual carriageway of 2,850 ft (869 m) to the east of the A6 road in November 1963 and was opened to traffic as part of the A635 road in November 1965. The second stage was the construction, from December 1964, of a 0.6 mi (1 km) long elevated highway of a motorway standard which ran between the A6 and A56 roads. The second stage was open to traffic as part of the A57 road in March 1967. The previous day it was opened to pedestrians, who were allowed to walk the whole of the high- level route as a sight-seeing publicity exercise. Many people brought picnics which they ate in the centre of the carriageway. At that time, the construction specifications had included cosmetic fairings to the tops of the support piers. These completely enclosed the roller bearings upon which the elevated roadway sits. However, the first time these bearings were serviced, the fairings were removed and never replaced. This leaves the poorer appearance seen today and also allows the ingress of dirt to the bearings. Leonard Fairclough & Son were the contractors, and the prestressed concrete sections were made at its operations in Adlington, Lancashire.Engineering Timelines The contractor's site compound was in Loxford Street. The piling was completed by Pigott Foundations of Ormskirk with auger (screw) boring with reinforcement cages. The piling went 50 ft (15 m) deep through the boulder clay to the Bunter sandstone (Buntsandstein). The road on the structure and kerbing was built by Wilson and Wilkinson of Worsley in Salford. =Opening= The Mancunian Way was officially opened by Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, on 5 May 1967. In the 1970s it was upgraded to motorway status as the A57(M) and the speed limit was raised to .Rural Roads Old Maps Page ‚Äì This page shows a selection of maps that show the road as A class when opened and later on as a motorway. At the time of its opening the Manchester Evening News referred to it as the \\"highway in the sky\\".Manchester Evening News, Manchester Online ‚Äì Eyewitness in Manchester Newsletter The scheme cost was ¬£5.5m (¬£m in today's figures). =Extension as the A635(M)= In 1992, the westbound junction was rebuilt to replace a temporary flyover, whereby the A56 passed over a roundabout where the A57(M) originally ended. At the same time, a new flyover was built at the eastern end, over the A6, but was legally designated as the A635(M) in 1995. =Oddities= Just before the junction with the A34 is an unfinished slip road (stub) that ends 20 feet in the air, although development next to Mancuian Way has meant much of the stub was demolished in October 2018.Manchester Evening News, Manchester Online ‚Äì Eyewitness in Manchester Newsletter Photo & Description The last ¬Ω mile (0.80 km) of the Mancunian Way in the east is part of the A635, the A57 heading south east from the same junction as the A6, though it states A57(M) on the signage as one enters westbound. Department for Transport documentation states differently,Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 so officially the Mancunian Way consists of two motorways, the A57(M) and the A635(M). Part of the easternmost non-motorway section of Mancunian Way collapsed into a 40 ft (12 m) sinkhole on 14 August 2015, after almost half a month's worth of rain fell in parts of Manchester in just six hours. The closure caused significant congestion on the remaining part of Mancunian Way and other nearby roads. It fully reopened on 15 June 2016 after 10 months of repair work. Cultural references *The road is referenced in the BBC television drama Life On Mars. The central character, Sam Tyler, is knocked down by a car and \\"awakens\\" in 1973. The accident occurs by the Mancunian Way, and when he awakens, he does so on wasteland, with a nearby billboard advertising the planned \\"Highway in the Sky\\".

She was awarded a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship in 1959.Ernestine Hill Collection, UQFL18, Fryer Library, The University of Queensland Library. However, while this provided her with a small pension, her final years were characterised by financial and health problems. She died in Brisbane in 1972. Writing career The majority of her writing, which comprised books as well as articles for newspapers and such journals as Walkabout, resulted from her wide travels across Australia. They recorded her adventures and focus on the Australian landscape. She could also be controversial. For example, her reporting of a gold strike at the Granites in the Northern Territory in 1931 contributed to financial ruin for some and was branded irresponsible. She is best known for The Territory. However, her only novel, My Love Must Wait, a fictionalised biography of sailor and navigator Matthew Flinders, sold well overseas as well as in Australia. During the 1930s she formed a friendship with Daisy Bates and later claimed to be mostly responsible for Daisy Bates' The Passing of the Aborigines, although this is a contentious issue.

Logo of the Linguasphere Observatory, seen in blue History It was created in Quebec in 1983 and was subsequently established and registered in Normandy as a non-profit association under the honorary presidency of the late L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, a French-language poet and the first president of Senegal. Its founding director is David Dalby, former director of the International African Institute and emeritus reader in the University of London, and its first research secretary was Philippe Blanchet, a Proven√ßal-language poet currently serving as Professor of Sociolinguistics at the University of Rennes. Since 2010, the deputy director and webmaster of the Observatoire has been Pierrick le Feuvre, with the chairman of its research council being Roland Breton, emeritus professor at the University of Paris VIII. The Observatoire's research hub is currently based in the European Union, in Carmarthenshire, Wales (UK) and in Paris. Its title in Welsh is Wylfa Ieithoedd, literally the \\"Observatory (of) languages\\", and its publishing associate (also in Wales) is the Gwasg y Byd Iaith, i.e., \\"Linguasphere Press\\" or literally \\"Press (of) the world (of) language\\". The Observatoire has developed an innovative scheme of philological classification, coding all living and recorded languages within a global referential framework or \\"linguascale\\". This Linguascale Framework uses a decimal structure (see below) to record both genetic and geographic categories of relationship (termed phylozones and geozones, respectively). In 1999/2000, the Observatoire published David Dalby's 2-volume Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities.David Dalby, Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities, Gwasg y Byd Iaith for Observatoire linguistique: Hebron, Wales, 1999‚Äì2000 (vol.1) & (vol. 2) Reviews were published by Edward J. Vajda in Language and by Anthony P. Grant in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Society.See reviews of the Linguasphere Register by Edward J. Vajda in Language (Linguistic Society of America), Vol.77, 3 (Sept. 2001) pp. 606‚Äì608, and by Anthony P.Grant in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Society (June 1, 2003). The Observatoire has now prepared a revised edition of the Linguasphere Register from 2010, the first of a projected series of regular updates at 10-year intervals. The current edition (LS-2010), comprising substantial materials from the foundation edition of 2000, is published online from 2011 as a freely available public resource and an online data-base, compiled and co-ordinated by David Dalby and Pierrick le Feuvre. Provision is made for the online gathering of additional and improved data, and for the open discussion of proposals and criticisms. From 2001 until December 2005, the Linguasphere Observatory was actively involved in collaboration with the British Standards Institution BSI Group and with ISO/TC 37in the design and development of a four-letter (alpha-4) code covering‚Äîpotentially‚Äîevery recorded language variety in the world. The Observatoire was not, however, associated with or responsible for the final ISO 639-6 standard which was a partial result of this collaboration, and which was approved and published by ISO in 2009. It is the policy of the Observatoire that its on-going independent work on language coding should be complementary to and supportive of the ISO 639 international standards. The Linguasphere Register and Linguascale referential framework The Linguascale framework is a referential system covering all languages, as published in the Linguasphere Register in 2000 and subsequently refined in 2010. It comprises a flexible coding formula which seeks to situate each language and dialect within the totality of the world's living and recorded languages, having regard to ongoing linguistic research. The first part of this linguascale is the decimal classification referred to above, consisting of a linguasphere key of two numerals denoting the relevant phylozone or geozone: from \`00\`. to \`99\`. This provides a systematic numerical key for the initial classification of any of the world's languages, following the principles set out in the Linguasphere Register. The first numeral of the key represents one of the ten referential sectors into which the world's languages are initially divided. The sector can either be a phylosector, in which the constituent languages are considered to be in a diachronic relationship one with another, or a geosector, in which languages are grouped geographically rather than historically. The second numeral is used to represent the ten zones into which each geosector is divided for referential purposes. The component zones, like the sectors, are described as either phylozones or geozones, based on the nature of the relationship among their constituent languages: either historical or geographical. The second part of the linguascale consists of three capital letters (majuscules): from \`-AAA-\` to \`-ZZZ-\`. Each zone is divided into one or more sets, with each set being represented by the first majuscule of this three-letter (alpha-3) component. Each set is divided into one or more chains (represented by the second majuscule) and each chain is into one or more nets (represented by the third majuscule). The division of the languages of a zone into sets, chains and nets is based on relative degrees of linguistic proximity, as measured in principle by approximate proportions of shared basic vocabulary. Geozones are on average divided into more sets than phylozones because relationships among languages within the latter are by definition more obvious and much closer. The third and final part of the linguascale consists of up to three lowercase letters (minuscules), used to identify a language or dialect with precision: from \`aaa\` to \`zzz\`. The first letter of this sequence represents an outer unit (preferred from 2010 to the original term of \\"outer language\\", to avoid the shifting and often emotive applications of the terms \\"language\\" and \\"dialect\\"). The inner units and language varieties that may comprise any outer unit are coded using a second, and wherever necessary a third minuscule letter. =Examples= The application of the linguascale may be illustrated with the concrete examples below, chosen from within the English language. For example, * The code covering all forms of English is \`52-ABA\`, where \`5=\` represents the Indo-European phylosector, \`52=\` represents the Germanic phylozone, \`52-A\` represents the Norsk+ Frysk set (a compound-name chosen to cover the contents of the Germanic phylozone), \`52-AB\` represents the English+ Anglo-Creole chain, and \`52-ABA\` is the English net. Within this net, the outer units are: ** \`52-ABA-a\` ‚Äì Scots+ Northumbrian. ** \`52-ABA-b\` ‚Äì \\"Anglo- English\\" (the traditional localised varieties of southern Great Britain and also Ireland). ** \`52-ABA-c\` ‚Äì Global English (varieties of modern English as spoken and written around the world). * Some more specific examples of English varieties are: ** \`52-ABA-abb\` is the Geordie traditional variety: belonging to \`52-ABA-a\` Scots+ Northumbrian outer language, and \`52-ABA-ab\` Northumbrian. ** \`52-ABA-bco\` is the Norfolk traditional variety: belonging to \`52-ABA-b\` \\"Anglo-English\\" outer unit, and specifically to \`52-ABA-bc\` Southern (British) traditional English. ** \`52-ABA-cof\` covers the range of (non-creolised) Nigerian English : belonging to \`52-ABA-c\` Global English outer unit, and \`52-ABA-co\` West-African English. Nigerian English is thus distinguished from the often overlapping \`52-ABB-bf\` Enpi (or \\"NP\\", from the abbreviation of so-called \\"Nigerian Pijin\\"): belonging to \`52-ABB\` Anglo- Creole net, and \`52-ABB-b\` Wes-kos (West Coast Anglo-Creole). =Languages of London= A practical application of the Linguasphere Register and its linguascale in the study of a complex urban linguistic environment has been as the referential framework for successive surveys of over 200 languages other than English spoken by plurilingual children at state schools in London (representing just under 40% of the total number of children attending), as edited in 2000 by Baker and Eversley and in 2010 by Eversley et al.P.Baker and Eversley, J., Multilingual Capital: the languages of London's schoolchildren and their relevance to economic, social and educational policies, Battlebridge for Corporation of London: London 2000 (also P.Baker and J.Kim, Global London, Battlebridge: London 2003 ) and in J.Eversley, D.

At the outset of a series of 34 illustrated tryptychs, attention was drawn to the historical role of other transnational languages in the development of such concepts, including Greek and German.The bilingual texts of the exhibition's tryptychs are presented in: David Dalby, Le fran√ßais et l'anglais : Langues de la Libert√©, Observatoire linguistique: Cressenville 1989 . The exhibition was sponsored by the government of a bilingual nation, Canada, by the international francophone Agence (ACCT) and by the region of Haute-Normandie. It was inaugurated in Paris at the Centre Georges Pompidou on 6 June 1989, and presented there throughout the summer of 1989 as the official Canadian contribution to the bicentenary celebrations of the French Revolution. At the subsequent presentation of this bilingual exhibition at the H√¥tel de R√©gion in Rouen (Haute-Normandie), from 23 September to 21 October 1989, the Observatoire linguistique organised the first public display of the only surviving contemporary copy of the vernacular (and arguably pre-Latin) text of England's Magna Carta, written in 13th century French. Thanks to continued support from Canada, the exhibition was subsequently presented by the Observatoire in Belgium and England, at the Palais des Congr√®s in Li√®ge and at the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1990, and finally in Australia, at Old Parliament House, Canberra in May 1991. In the context of the need to design a plurilingual framework of ethics for a future planetary society, the Observatoire has announced its intention to return to the transnational theme of Magna Carta in 2015, on the occasion of the 8th centenary of the signing of its formal Latin version at Runnymede in 2020.  \\"In the galaxy of languages, each person's voice is a star\\"  The motto of the Observatoire linguistique dates from 1990‚Äîin French: Dans la galaxie des langues, la voix de chaque personne est une √©toile (translated into English as above). The Observatoire adopted these words as its guiding philosophy on the occasion of the first series of debates organised by the Observatoire linguistique in 1990-1991, at Fleury-sur-Andelle in Haute- Normandie, at Maillane in Provence and at Huy in Wallonie, sponsored by each of the relevant regions, on the subject of Nos langues et l'unit√© de l'Europe (\\"Our languages and the unity of Europe\\"). The guest of honour at the first of these debates was Andr√© Martinet (1908‚Äì1999), doyen of trans-Atlantic linguistics. From the year 2000 UNESCO adopted and adapted the Observatoire's motto in the form: \\"In the galaxy of languages, each word is a star\\".

The road, which remains a primary A road, was officially opened by King George V on 18 July 1934. It links Liverpool to Salford, 3 miles west of Manchester city centre. Purpose The road was built to provide better access between the Port of Liverpool and the industrial areas of East Lancashire around Manchester. The new high-quality trunk road would supersede the indirect and heavily built-up A57 through Prescot, Warrington and Eccles. Journey times for road haulage would be reduced to under an hour. This road was built with a Dutch-style cycle path running its entire length. Many roads at this time were built with cycle paths but most have been lost due to road widening schemes. History Wardley in the City of Salford. =First phase (completed)= The first part, which was completed within three years, was from Walton, Liverpool, to the junction with the A6 at Irlams o' th' Height in Salford. The road was constructed in an almost straight alignment with few curves. To be a high-speed trunk route, its 1930s planners designed some parts to be three roads in one. The central section was exclusively for through traffic while adjacent side roads ‚Äì either side of the main carriageway ‚Äì provided local access. Although the sections within Liverpool were dual carriageway from the beginning, a few short stretches through Salford continue to use the original three-lane layout. The rest of the road was converted to dual with a central reservation in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the original 1930s bridges remain; they were built from steel in preparation for any future expansion as they would be easier to replace than ones constructed from moulded concrete. The road remains the UK's largest pre-motorway project. In 2004 the Highways Agency detrunked the road, passing control and maintenance over to the local authorities along its route. =Second phase (uncompleted)= With the completion of the first phase, the next stage was to extend the road beyond Salford and into East Lancashire proper. However this was never undertaken. Its failure was largely due to the road's location. Despite linking North West England's largest cities, the East Lancs remained isolated from the rest of the UK's national road network. Both ends of the highway began in high-density urban areas that were not close to any comparable infrastructure that could assist rapid transit connections. By 1942, proposals were put forward to extend the A580 across the Pennines to Hull on the east coast of Britain. Although this plan never came to fruition, its purpose became the foundation for the construction of the M62 motorway in 1960.

At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 2,810, rising to 3,493 at the 2011 Census. Melling Rock contains a public house as well as St Thomas and the Holy Rood, a part of the Maghull and Melling Team and the Diocese of Liverpool. The town of Waddicar, of which most of the population of Melling consists, is usually regarded as part of Melling itself and is served by the parish council which is based in the local Melling Primary School. Etymology Historically a part of Lancashire, its name originates from the Anglo-Saxon roots for \\"the homestead of Maella\\" (or Malla). Lying close to Liverpool, the area was settled by Maella's family in the 6th century. Melling may also be derived from the Brittonic mƒô:l meaning \\"bald, bare\\". The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Melinge. History A 'headless cross' is located in the parish church. During surveys undertaken as part of the construction of the M57 motorway, a number of anomalies were found which were concluded as being the remains of a Stone Age settlement based around Melling Rock. It is also noted that the local Wood House Farm was the location of a very minor battle during the English Civil War which was concluded from a number of cannonballs dating from the era along with Melling House, which is shown to have been seriously damaged as a result of such action, evidence of which can be found at ground level where remains of a now-destroyed defensive wall can be seen. Community The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes the village, and during the years of the Industrial Revolution the village flourished through passing trade. Melling is near the Aintree Grand National racecourse, which then crosses Melling Road (which actually runs from Walton to Aintree and does not go to Melling) soon after the start. There is also a Melling Steeplechase at the Grand National meeting. The local Melling Tithebarn Arts Association is based in Melling Tithebarn, which is used as an event venue. The old tithe barn serves as St Thomas' Church Hall as well as a local community centre. The Melling Residents' and Community Association (MRCA) dates from the 1930s. Originally used by the Lords of the Manor of Melling, the Molyneux's, and later a builders' shed, it was given to the people of the village. The village has changed dramatically since the late 1990s with the demolition of the cable factory and the recent construction of a modern housing estate which is located in the heart of the village backing onto the Melling village canal. Transport There are no railway stations serving Melling, the nearest station is Maghull serving the town of Maghull by frequent electric services from Ormskirk to Liverpool.

It was unveiled on April 14, 2004, and was released on May 26, 2004, running the same Symbian OS v6.1 with Series 60 1st Edition FP1. It revised the original N-Gage's physical design, being smaller and rounder. It corrected the flaw of the original's cartridge slot placement with a more convenient one on the bottom of the device as opposed to behind the battery. This design also moved the earpiece to the face of the device, rather than on the side, as in the previous model. The device retailed at a lower price compared to the original N-Gage device, aided by the fact that it was usually sold with service contracts and applicable subsidies. For instance, in the United States the N-Gage QD was available as a prepaid phone offered by Cingular at retail games stores such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop. Hardware specifications: Weight: , dimensions: . Changes Some features available in the original system, such as MP3 playback, FM radio reception and USB connectivity, were removed from the new device, presumably to reduce size and cost. Instead of using the N-Gage with generic USB removable drive drivers, a user could use either Bluetooth or a separate MMC card reader to transfer files onto the device memory or an MMC card for use in the N-Gage QD. The QD did not support MP3 internally; however, it could still play MP3s with third-party software, albeit only in 16 kHz mono. Another change from the original unit was the \\"Orange-and-grey\\" theme of the face of the unit as well as the GUI. Some felt this was an unwanted change from the 'more colorful' GUI of the original N-Gage. Even then there were some third-party applications that enhanced the interface or replaced the system shell. As a telephony device, the newer N-Gage no longer supported three GSM frequency bands 900/1800/1900; instead it came in two dual-band variants, one for the American market and another for the European and Asian markets. The only change made to the device's buttons was the replacement of the original five-way controller (four ordinal directions and a center \\"click\\" or confirm) with a simpler four- way directional controller and a separate \\"OK\\" button with a check logo. The QD was running the same software version as its predecessor, despite the newer Symbian 7.0s Series 60 2nd Edition having been shipped on several smartphones by the time the QD was announced. N-Gage QD Silver Edition Announced in August 2005, the N-Gage QD Silver Edition could be seen as an exercise in extending the life of the N-Gage product range while new N-Gage devices were developed and the N-Gage gaming range was integrated into the mainstream Series 60 product range. Apart from cosmetic changes and the replacement of the two specialist gaming buttons (5 and 7) with standard keys, there was no difference in the N-Gage QD Silver Edition to the regular N-Gage QD. It was made available in the European, Middle Eastern, and African markets on September 1, 2005.

Its mission is to unite the left regardless of political party and was founded by Gayle McGlaughlin and Marylyn Langlois. It supports various community efforts including campaigns to force the local Chevron refinery to pay higher taxes and reduce pollution; opposition to racial profiling; and opposition to urban casino development in Point Molate. It supports candidates for the nonpartisan races in the city. Its members include voters registered in the Democratic, Green, and other parties as well as independents. During the 2000s and 2010s the alliance transformed the politics of the city of Richmond banishing Chevron's control over local government and solidifying itself as a force to be reckoned with. When interviewed McGlaughlin stated that the RPA was designed as, \\"an umbrella organization to bring together Greens, progressive Democrats, libertarians, Peace and Freedom Party members and others who are concerned about Richmond community affairs.\\" The RPA is credited with \\"extracting\\" 114 million dollars on one occasion and another 90 million on a second occasion to fund social programs.

In 2005 the RPA supported transfer of the former Zeneca site at Campus Bay to the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. 2006 through 2008 right In 2006 Gayle McLaughlin won the election for mayor as a Green Party member versus incumbent Democrat Irma Anderson by 189 votes out around 12,000 cast. Jim Jenkins lost his bid for the Richmond city council. 2008 through 2010 Measure T, a ballot measure submitted to the voters that substantially increased business license fees for large corporations like Chevron Corporation owner of the Chevron Richmond Refinery passed. Jovanka Beckles ran for city council of Richmond and lost while Jeff Ritterman won his city council bid. Another ballot measure, Measure U, in favor of casinos, like the one proposed for the former Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot, was successfully defeated at the ballot box. 2010 through 2012 In 2010 the RPA negotiated with Chevron to contribute millions of dollars for the city to reinvest in itself instead of facing Measure T which would have forced a change in the utility tax which would have made them potentially contribute more. In this same year Gayle McLaughlin won re-election as Richmond mayor. Jovanka Beckles in her second bid for Richmond city council won while Eduardo Martinez lost his second attempt at a spot on the Richmond city council. The RPA took a beating in this election as it was flooded by 1.2 million US dollars from Chevron and 2.7 million from the American Beverage Association against measure N a sugar tax and its candidates. 2012 through 2014 In the 2012 election Marilyn Langlois ran for city council and lost as did Eduardo Martinez on his third bid. This while Dr. Jeff Ritterman's brainchild Measure N, a tax on sugary drinks, lost amid massive campaigning for the bottling industry to counter support for it. 2014 election through 2016 In 2014 Mike Parker ran for mayor but withdrew in favor of Tom Butt in order to not splinter the progressive vote in the moderate-progressive divide of the city's politics. Tom Butt, the RPA's candidate went on to face Nat Bates and won. Eduardo Martinez ran for city council yet again and won this year, while former mayor Gayle McLaughlin won her old council seat and Jovanka Beckles won re-election. In 2014 Chevron spent US$ 3 million on a slate of candidates for city council none of which beat the grassroots candidates of the RPA which some have said saved Richmond's fortunes although Tom Butt says it involved collaboration between many stakeholders and was not that simple. 2016 through 2018 In 2016 Ben Choi attempted to gain a seat on the Richmond city council as did Melvin Willis and both won. In 2018 Zak Wear described the group as narcissistic while the Richmond Standard likened it to a political cult. 2018 through present In 2018 Tom Butt endorsed opponent of the California Progressive Alliance's assembly candidate Jovanka Beckels. The CPA is a statewide offspring of the Richmond Progressive Alliance and the brainchild of Gayle McGlaughlin. Butt's endorsement Buffy Wicks went on to win the race. Butt went on to state that the reason was that he believed Beckels did not think for herself and that the RPA candidates rarely stray from the \\"party line\\". Wicks was said to beat Beckels at the RPA's \\"own game, grassroots organizing\\" and she did it 56 to 44%. This same election Gayle McGlaughlin ran for California Lt. Governor but lost. In 2019 mayor Tom Butt blamed the Richmond Progressive Alliance for obstructionism of his choice of appointments to city positions, something usually at the prerogative of the mayor, however he stated that there was a clash between whom he wanted to select for appointments and the people the RPA wanted.

Criticism of Rick Joyner's Book \\"The Final Quest\\" Rick claims to have had many visions, including visions of famous deceased people in Heaven. Joyner is a professional writer but is vague sometimes when it comes to providing actual names of who he meets in his visions. There is an unspoken rule that when a person meets someone they know in a vision, they must provide the name of that person in the description of the vision they write about. We are left with the questions ‚ÄúWhy does Joyner fail to provide names of some of those he meets? Is he worried about readers getting upset if the names are revealed?‚Äù Three examples are included below: 1\\\\. Reformer: \\"We were empty wretches by the end of our lives.....We could trust no one because we were living in such deception ourselves that we did not even trust each other.... But we, ourselves, secretly feared and despised everyone.\\" (p. 108 Final Quest) 2\\\\. Reformer's Wife: \\"That was our demise, and it is the same for many who are here in the lowest place.\\" (p. 113 Final Quest) 3\\\\. What Joyner said about the Modern Evangelist: \\"Then he began to tell me why he was in the lowest rank in heaven.\\" (p. 117 Final Quest) Confusing Theology in Rick Joyner's Books About His Visions Joyner claims to be clearly within the mainstream Protestant arena but the theology in his books about his visions gets some readers confused. There are some quotes below to inspire discussion about Joyner's theology. He seems to some, to have mixed New Age thought with Christianity but it is up to readers to make their own personal opinions about this. 1\\\\. \\"I looked at the fire on the water and I saw that the water was composed of multitudes of beings - people.\\" (p.41, The Torch and the Sword by Rick Joyner) 2\\\\. \\"As they (the evil horde) drank, they changed before our eyes. The hard, tortured, demonic looks softened into human faces. They kept changing until they were like pure children again.

Among the examples shown are a penny farthing and a boneshaker. 1880 Velocipede The American Velocipede, 1868, a wood engraving from Harper's Weekly European \\"boneshaker\\" bicycle, circa 1868. Thomas McCall in 1869 on his velocipede A velocipede () is a human-powered land vehicle with one or more wheels. The most common type of velocipede today is the bicycle. The term was probably first coined by Karl von Drais in French as v√©locip√®de for the French translation of his advertising leaflet for his version of the Laufmaschine, also now called a 'dandy horse', which he had developed in 1817. It is ultimately derived from the Latin velox, veloc- 'swift' + pes, ped- 'foot'.Oxford Dictionary of English, 'velocipede' The term 'velocipede' is today mainly used as a collective term for the different forerunners of the monowheel, the unicycle, the bicycle, the dicycle, the tricycle and the quadracycle developed between 1817 and 1880. It refers especially to the forerunner of the modern bicycle that was propelled, like a modern tricycle, by cranks, i.e. pedals, attached to the front axle before the invention of geared chains and belt and shaft drives powering the rear.  History  Among the early velocipedes there were designs with one, two, three, four, and even five wheels. Some two-wheeled designs had pedals mounted on the front wheel, while three- and four-wheeled designs sometimes used treadles and levers to drive the rear wheels. The earliest usable and much-copied velocipede was created by the German Karl Drais and called a Laufmaschine (German for \\"running machine\\"), which he first rode on June 12, 1817. He obtained a patent in January 1818. This was the world's first balance bicycle and quickly became popular in both the United Kingdom and France, where it was sometimes called a draisine (German and English), draisienne (French), a v√©locip√®de (French), a swiftwalker, a dandy horse (as it was very popular among dandies) or a Hobby horse. It was made entirely of wood and metal and despite the condition of the roads at the time was sometimes ridden for long distances. It was almost 40 years until \\"velocipede\\" came into common usage as a generic term, with the launch of the first pedal-equipped bicycle, developed by Pierre Michaux, Pierre Lallement and the Olivier brothers in the 1860s. The Michaux company was the first to mass-produce the velocipede, from 1857 to 1871. That French design was sometimes called the boneshaker, since it was also made entirely of wood, then later with metal tires. That in combination with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. These velocipedes also became a fad, and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities. In 1891 L'Industrie V√©locip√©dique (Cycling Industry) magazine described 'La Soci√©t√© Parisienne de constructions Velo' as 'the oldest velocipede manufacturer in France', having been founded in 1876 by M. Reynard, and awarded the 'Diploma of honour' at the Exposition Universelle (1878) (World's Fair).Tonton Velo, pour les velos anciens. L'Industrie v√©locip√©dique January 1891. Soci√©t√© Parisienne de Construction V√©locip√©dique During the 1870s advances in metallurgy led to the development of the first all-metal velocipedes. The pedals were still attached directly to the front wheel, which became larger and larger as makers realised that the larger the wheel, the farther you could travel with one rotation of the pedals. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor. This type of velocipede was the first one to be called a bicycle (\\"two wheel\\"), and its shape led to the nickname penny-farthing in the United Kingdom. They enjoyed a great popularity among young men in the 1880s who could afford them. While young men were risking their necks on the high wheels, ladies and dignified gentlemen such as doctors and clergymen of the 1880s favoured the less risky tricycle. Many innovations for tricycles eventually found their way into the automobile, such as rack and pinion steering, the differential, and band brakes, the forerunners to drum brakes.  Boneshaker  Boneshaker (or bone-shaker) is a name used from about 1869 up to the present time to refer to the first type of true bicycle with pedals, which was called velocipede by its manufacturers. \\"Boneshaker\\" refers to the extremely uncomfortable ride, which was caused by the stiff wrought-iron frame and wooden wheels surrounded by tires made of iron. = History = The Michaux velocipede had a straight downtube and a spoon brake. This type of bicycle was invented in the 1860s in France and first manufactured by the Michaux company from 1867 to 1869 ‚Äì the time of the first bicycle craze, and copied by many others during that time. It fell out of favor after the summer of 1869, and was replaced in 1870 with the type of bicycle called \\"ordinary\\", \\"high-wheel\\", or \\"penny-farthing\\". Few original boneshakers exist today, most having been melted for scrap metal during World War I.Those that do surface from time to time command high prices, typically up to about $5,000 US. = Design = The construction of the boneshaker was similar to the dandy horse: wooden wheels with iron tires and a framework of wrought iron. As the name implies it was extremely uncomfortable, but the discomfort was somewhat ameliorated by a long flat spring that supported the saddle and absorbed many of the shocks from rough road surfaces. The boneshaker also had a brakea metal lever that pressed a wooden pad against the rear wheel. The front wheel axle ran in lubricated bronze bearings, and some had small lubrication tanks that would wick oil from soaked lamb's wool into the bearings to help them run smoothly. Like the High Wheel bicycles that became popular later in the 19th century, boneshakers were front-wheel drive, but in comparison they had smaller wheels (only about 1m), and were heavy, with a lightweight model weighing 30 pounds or more.

It is a classic example of comedy arising from an absurd situation which the participants take entirely seriously (comic irony), and a demonstration of the construction of a sketch in order to draw a laugh from the audience with almost every line. Peter Cook said that this was one of the most perfect sketches he had acted in, and that it amazed him, later in his career, that he could have created it so young, at the age of 17 or 18. It first appeared in a Pembroke College revue, Something Borrowed, in 1960 (where it was titled Leg Too Few as the show had an alphabetical theme and the sketch appeared under the letter \\"L\\") and later the same year in the Footlights revue, Pop Goes Mrs Jessop. It appeared on the West End stage for the first time in 1961 as part of One Over the Eight, a revue starring Kenneth Williams. Its first public performance with Dudley Moore in the role of Spiggot was as part of Beyond the Fringe at the Cambridge Arts Theatre on April 21, 1961. Although it was initially omitted from the London production of Beyond the Fringe (due to One Over The Eight running concurrently at a nearby theatre), it was reinstated for the show's transfer to Broadway. Cook and Moore also performed the sketch in their 1973 stage show Behind the Fridge (retitled Good Evening! in the USA), and also gave standalone performances on various occasions, including the 1965 Royal Variety Performance, a 1976 episode of Saturday Night Live, and the 1989 charity show The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball. A version of the sketch, in which Spiggott is applying for a job as a runner, appeared in Cook and Moore's 1978 film The Hound of the Baskervilles. Sketch The sketch takes place in the office of a casting agent. Cook plays the agent and Moore the prospective actor, a Mr Spiggott (this name was a favourite of Cook's, and was re-used as the earthly identity of the Devil in Bedazzled). Cook begins the sketch by calling for his secretary to show the next auditioner into the office. Moore, a one-legged man, enters, hopping on his right foot. Moore's left leg is tied up behind him and obscured beneath an overcoat during the sketch (Moore did actually have a slightly deformed left leg in real life as the result of a club foot). Eventually, Moore comes to a stop, balanced on one leg. He is required to hold this position for most of the sketch, his difficulty in doing so occasioning much amusement from the audience (though in most performances, he has a chair to hold on to for balance). The premise of the sketch is then laid out thus: :Cook: Mr Spiggott ‚Äì you are, I believe, auditioning for the part of Tarzan. :Moore: Right. :Cook: Now Mr Spiggott, I couldn't help noticing ‚Äì almost at once ‚Äì that you are a one-legged person. :Moore: You noticed that? :Cook: I noticed that, Mr Spiggott. When you have been in the business as long as I have, you come to notice these little things almost instinctively. The agent goes on to point out that Tarzan is \\"a role which traditionally involves the use of a two-legged actor\\" and that it would be unusual for the part to be taken by a \\"unidexter\\", but Spiggott's enthusiasm is undimmed. Cook keeps a straight face as he explains exactly why Spiggott is unsuitable for the role. :Cook: Need I say with over much emphasis that it is in the leg division that you are deficient. :Moore: The leg division? :Cook: Yes, the leg division, Mr Spiggott. You are deficient in it to the tune of one. Your right leg, I like. I like your right leg. A lovely leg for the role. That's what I said when I saw you come in. I said, \\"A lovely leg for the role\\". I've got nothing against your right leg. The trouble is - neither have you. Cook would often add the line 'you fall down on your left' in other versions of the sketch. The sketch continues in a similar vein with the agent observing that at least Spiggott scores over a man with no legs at all (in the later versions, Spiggot enthusiastically agrees that he has \\"twice as many\\" as a man with none) and that there is always a chance that no two-legged actor will apply for the role \\"in, say, the next eighteen months\\", in which case Spiggott, as a \\"unidexter\\", is \\"just the sort of person we shall be attempting to contact telephonically\\". Spiggott, clearly an eternal optimist, leaves the office happy with these reassurances. In some early versions of the sketch (including the one recorded by Kenneth Williams), a further punchline follows after Moore has left. A two- legged actor walks in normally: :Cook: Ah, good morning Mr Stanger. Now I believe you are applying for the role of Long John Silver. References *Cook, William (Ed.) (2002).

Contemporary definitions of complexity in the sciences are found in relation to systems theory, in which a phenomenon under study has many parts and many possible arrangements of the relationships between those parts. At the same time, what is complex and what is simple is relative and may change with time.Waldrop, M. Mitchell (1992.) Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster. Current usage of the term \\"complexity\\" in the field of sociology typically refers specifically to theories of society as a complex adaptive system. However, social complexity and its emergent properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of social thought and the study of social change.Eve, Raymond, Sara Horsfall and Mary E. Lee (eds.) (1997). Chaos, Complexity and Sociology: Myths, Models, and Theories. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. The early founders of sociological theory, such as Ferdinand T√∂nnies, √âmile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georg Simmel, all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and exchanges. This emphasis on interconnectivity in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in theoretical thinking in multiple areas of sociology.Giddens, Anthony (1979). Central problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure and Contradiction in Social Analysis. London: Macmillan. As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of micro- and macro-level social phenomena, providing a meso-level or middle-range theoretical platform for hypothesis formation.Freese, Lee (1980). \\"Formal Theorizing.\\" Annual Review of Sociology, 6: 187‚Äì212 (August 1980).Cohen, B. P. (1989). Developing sociological knowledge: theory and method (2nd ed.). Chicago: Nelson‚ÄìHall. Methodologically, the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local (micro) and global (macro) phenomena in sociological research. Theoretical background Illustration of complexity (Penrose tiling fractal) The American sociologist Talcott Parsons carried on the work of the early founders mentioned above in his early (1937) work on action theory.Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers. New York, NY: The Free Press. By 1951, Parsons places these earlier ideas firmly into the realm of formal systems theory in The Social System.Parsons, Talcott (1951). The Social System. New York, NY: The Free Press For the next several decades, this synergy between general systems thinking and the further development of social system theories is carried forward by Parson's student, Robert K. Merton, and a long line of others, in discussions of theories of the middle-range and social structure and agency. During part of this same period, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, discussion ensues in any number of other research areas about the properties of systems in which strong correlation of sub-parts leads to observed behaviors variously described as autopoetic, self-organizing, dynamical, turbulent, and chaotic. All of these are forms of system behavior arising from mathematical complexity. By the early 1990s, the work of social theorists such as Niklas LuhmannLuhmann, Niklas (1990.) Essays on Self-Reference, New York: Columbia University Press. began reflecting these themes of complex behavior. One of the earliest usages of the term \\"complexity\\", in the social and behavioral sciences, to refer specifically to a complex system is found in the study of modern organizations and management studies.Kiel, L. Douglas (1994). Managing Chaos and Complexity in Government: A New Paradigm for Managing Change, Innovation and Organizational Renewal. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco. However, particularly in management studies, the term often has been used in a metaphorical rather than in a qualitative or quantitative theoretical manner. By the mid-1990s, the \\"complexity turn\\"Urry, John (2005). \\"The Complexity Turn.\\" Theory, Culture and Society, 22(5): 1‚Äì14. in social sciences begins as some of the same tools generally used in complexity science are incorporated into the social sciences. By 1998, the international, electronic periodical, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, had been created. In the last several years, many publications have presented overviews of complexity theory within the field of sociology. Within this body of work, connections also are drawn to yet other theoretical traditions, including constructivist epistemology and the philosophical positions of phenomenology, postmodernism and critical realism. Methodologies Methodologically, social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts and there are many possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiatedLuhmann, Niklas (1982). The Differentiation of Society. New York, NY: Columbia University Press. by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses. At the most localized level of analysis, ethnographic, participant- or non-participant observation, content analysis and other qualitative research methods may be appropriate. More recently, highly sophisticated quantitative research methodologies are being developed and used in sociology at both local and global levels of analysis. Such methods include (but are not limited to) bifurcation diagrams, network analysis, non-linear modeling, and computational models including cellular automata programming, sociocybernetics and other methods of social simulation. =Complex social network analysis= Complex social network analysis is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional social network analysis, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory.Carley, Kathleen M. (2003), \\"Dynamic Network Analysis.\\" Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis: Workshop Summary and Papers, Ronald Breiger, Kathleen Carley, and Philippa Pattison (eds.), National Research Council (Committee on Human Factors): Washington, D.C.: 133‚Äì145. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis are coming out of the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others. New methods of global network analysis are emerging from the work of John Urry and the sociological study of globalization, linked to the work of Manuel Castells and the later work of Immanuel Wallerstein. Since the late 1990s, Wallerstein increasingly makes use of complexity theory, particularly the work of Ilya Prigogine.Barab√°si, Albert-L√°szl√≥ (2003). Linked: The New Science of Networks. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing.Freeman, Linton C. (2004). The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science. Vancouver Canada: Empirical Press.Watts, Duncan J. (2004). \\"The New Science of Networks.\\" Annual Review of Sociology, 30: 243‚Äì270. Dynamic social network analysis is linked to a variety of methodological traditions, above and beyond systems thinking, including graph theory, traditional social network analysis in sociology, and mathematical sociology. It also links to mathematical chaos and complex dynamics through the work of Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, as well as fractal geometry through Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si and his work on scale-free networks. =Computational sociology= The development of computational sociology involves such scholars as Nigel Gilbert, Klaus G. Troitzsch, Joshua M. Epstein, and others. The foci of methods in this field include social simulation and data-mining, both of which are sub-areas of computational sociology. Social simulation uses computers to create an artificial laboratory for the study of complex social systems; data-mining uses machine intelligence to search for non-trivial patterns of relations in large, complex, real-world databases. The emerging methods of socionics are a variant of computational sociology.Gilbert, Nigel and Klaus G. Troitzsch (2005). Simulation for Social Scientists, 2nd Edition. New York, NY: Open University Press.Epstein, Joshua M. (2007). Generative Social Science: Studies in Agent-Based Computational Modeling. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Computational sociology is influenced by a number of micro-sociological areas as well as the macro- level traditions of systems science and systems thinking. The micro-level influences of symbolic interaction, exchange, and rational choice, along with the micro-level focus of computational political scientists, such as Robert Axelrod, helped to develop computational sociology's bottom-up, agent-based approach to modeling complex systems. This is what Joshua M. Epstein calls generative science. Other important areas of influence include statistics, mathematical modeling and computer simulation. =Sociocybernetics= Sociocybernetics integrates sociology with second-order cybernetics and the work of Niklas Luhmann, along with the latest advances in complexity science. In terms of scholarly work, the focus of sociocybernetics has been primarily conceptual and only slightly methodological or empirical.Geyer, Felix and Johannes van der Zouwen (1992). \\"Sociocybernetics.\\" Handbook of Cybernetics, C.V. Negoita (ed.): 95‚Äì124. New York: Marcel Dekker. Sociocybernetics is directly tied to systems thought inside and outside of sociology, specifically in the area of second-order cybernetics. Areas of application As a middle- range theoretical platform, social complexity can be applied to any research in which social interaction or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be measured and expressed as continuous or discrete data points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data.Stewart, Peter (2001). \\"Complexity Theories, Social Theory, and the Question of Social Complexity.\\" Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 31(3): 323‚Äì360. Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology.

Conference held at the National Defense War College: Washington D.C., Evidence Based Research, Track 3. (Electronic Publication). theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all areas of sociological research. In the area of communications research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications.Leydesdorff, Loet (1995). The Challenge of Scientometrics: The development, measurement, and self- organization of scientific communications. Leiden: DSWO Press, Leiden University. Scientometrics and bibliometrics are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.Dimitrov, Vladimir and Robert Woog (1997). \\"Studying Social Complexity: From Soft to Virtual Systems Methodology.\\" Complex Systems, 11:(6).

Magach (, \\"battering-ram\\") is the designation of a series of tanks in Israeli service. The tanks are based on the American M48 and M60 Patton tanks. The name continued to be used for all Patton tanks, including the M60. Magach 1, 2, 3 and 5 are based on M48 series tanks where as Magach 6 and 7 are based on M60 series tanks. Service history The first M48 Patton tanks acquired by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were purchased from West Germany in the early 1960s (M48A1 variant), followed by deliveries from the United States after 1965 (both M48A1 and M48A2C vehicles). Several dozen Jordanian M48 tanks, captured intact during the 1967 Six-Day War, were also commissioned, adding to the 150 already in service at that time. During the war, the Israeli tanks served in their original (American) configuration. Following the 1967 war, several modifications were made to improve the tank to M48A3 level, resulting in the Magach 3. These modifications included replacing the original 90 mm gun with the British 105 mm L7 or US M68 equivalent, replacing the commander's machine gun cupola with a lower-profile Urdan Cupola, upgrading the communication suite, and replacing the 650 hp gasoline engine with a 750 hp diesel one, more powerful and less vulnerable to fuel fires. When the Yom Kippur War broke out, Israel had 540 M48A3 (with 105 mm gun) and M60/A1 tanks... During the war, the tanks suffered heavy losses. The location of flammable hydraulic fluid at the front of the turret was discovered to be a severe vulnerability. After the war, Israel had only about 200 M48A3 and M60A1 tanks, after a large number of Israeli tanks were destroyed or terminally hit during the war, mostly in the Sinai front against entrenched Egyptian infantry armed with 9M14 Malyutka anti tank missiles. War losses were replaced with new M48A5 (Magach 5), M60 (Magach 7) and M60A1 (Magach 6) during the 1970s. The older M60's (which still used the smaller M48 turret) were supplied to make up for a shortage of sufficient M60A1s, explaining why the older model has the higher designation. Prior to the 1982 invasion of Lebanon (1982 Lebanon War), Magach 6 and 7 tanks were fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA). Further work has been done on the upgraded Magach 6 models, including new belly armor, Merkava tracks, new fire controls, a thermal sleeve for the gun and smoke grenades, eventually resulting in the Magach 6b (Bet) and ultimate 6b Gal Batash and equivalent Magach 7c Gimel models. Since the 1980s and 1990s, the Magachs have been gradually replaced by Merkava tanks as Israel's front-line main battle tank. However, a large majority of the IDF's armored corps continued to consist of Magach variants until the 1990s, and the tank was continuously upgraded during this time. By 2006, all Magachs in regular units had been replaced by Merkavas. In July 2015, Israel officially unveiled the existence of the Pereh missile carrier. The Pereh is a guided missile carrier disguised as a tank. A Magach is converted into a Pereh tank destroyer by replacing the main battle gun with an anti-tank guided missile launch station. The original turret is enlarged to install a launcher under armor for 12 \\"Tamuz\\" Spike NLOS missiles, which can destroy targets out to . Disguised as a standard tank, the Pereh is fitted with a fake cannon barrel to the front, but can be identified easily by the curved antenna mounted at the rear on the roof of the turret, which is erected in firing position; additional features include add-on frontal armor and stowage boxes on the turret sides. Pictures of the Pereh were first released during Operation Protective Edge in July 2014.Israel unveils officially existence of \\"Pereh\\" based on Magach tank but armed with anti-tank missile ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, 22 July 2015 Source of the name \\"Magach\\" Contrary to a popular belief, \\"Magach\\" is not an abbreviation but a Hebrew word meaning \\"battering-ram\\". However, as the word is very rarely used and is not known to many Hebrew speakers, several popular explanations of the name exist: * Short for Merkevet Giborei Hayil (, literally Chariot of War Heroes). * One version states that the real source of the name is the designation M48A3 (in Gematria, 40 is \\"mem\\" (\\"m\\"), 8 is \\"chet\\" (\\"ch\\") and 3 is \\"gimel\\" (\\"g\\")). * Like the above, but \\"g\\" stands for Germany, a supplier of the first M48 tanks to Israel. * Yet another version says that M48A3 can be read as MAgAch (4 looks like \\"A\\", 8 like \\"g\\" etc.). * A once popular macabre joke in the IDF said that \\"Magach\\" stands for \\"Movil Gviyot Charukhot\\"‚Äî\\"charred bodies carrier\\", probably referring to the Yom Kippur War losses and particularly to the aforementioned flammable hydraulic fluid problem of the M48. * Other variants include \\"Meshupa Gahon\\" (one with sloping belly) and even \\"Mechonat Giluach Hashmalit\\" (electric shaving machine). Versions Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun. *Magach 1: M48A1. *Magach 2: M48A2C. *Magach 3: Modernized M48A1/A2C/A3. The modifications included British 105 mm L7 cannon, low profile commander's cupola, upgraded communication suite, a 750 hp diesel engine Continental AVDS-1790-2A with Allison CD-850-6 transmission. They were eventually fitted with Blazer ERA. *Magach 5: M48A5 in the original configuration. Generally similar to the Magach 3, but had slightly different engine and transmission‚ÄîAVDS-1790-2D and CD-850-6A accordingly. They were eventually fitted with Blazer ERA. *Magach 6: Modernized M60A1 or M60A3. Fitted with the Urdan low profile cupola and Blazer ERA. **Magach 6A (6 Alef): Modernized M60A1. All vehicles were eventually upgraded to the Magach 6B level. **Magach 6B (6 Bet): Similarly modernized M60A1 RISE (M60A1 with AVDS-1790-2C RISE (Reliability Improved Selected Equipment) engine). **Magach 6B Gal (6 Bet Gal): Magach 6B with Gal fire control system. **Magach 6B Gal Batash (6 Bet Gal Batash): Magach 6B Gal fitted with 4th generation passive armor and 908 hp engine. The turret has angled sides and angled mantlet. This variant is sometimes unofficially referred to as Magach 7D or Magach 8. A limited number of vehicles were converted from the Magach 6B Gal variant. **Magach 6B Baz (6 Bet Baz): Magach 6B fitted with Baz fire control system. A limited number of vehicles were converted from the Magach 6B variant. **Magach 6C (6 Gimel): Modernized M60A3. **Magach 6R (6 Resh): Modernized M60, with engine upgraded to the AVDS-1790-2AG level (with more powerful electric generator compared to that of AVDS-1790-2A). **Magach 6R* (6 Resh*): Magach 6R with preparations for mounting Nachal Oz fire control system. **Magach 6M (6 Mem): Magach 6R* fitted with Nachal Oz fire control system. *Magach 7: M60 with 908 hp AVDS-1790-5A engine, additional passive armor, new fire control and Merkava-based tracks. Different configurations exist: **Magach 7A (7 Alef): Fixed flat mantlet with gun \\"slots\\". **Magach 7B (7 Bet): An interim model with armor configuration similar to the 7C. Apparently never reached production. **Magach 7C (7 Gimel): Fixed angled mantlet with gun \\"slots\\". *Pereh missile carrier: Guided missile artillery variant armed with the Spike missile. Magach should not be confused with the Sabra series of upgrade packages for the M60A1/A3, which were developed for export to Turkey. Sabra includes upgrades similar to those of the Magach 7, but an essential difference is that it is armed with the MG251 120 mm smooth-bore gun (the same as used by the Merkava 3).

It is a form of legally binding preventive adjudication by which a party involved in an actual or possible legal matter can ask a court to conclusively rule on and affirm the rights, duties, or obligations of one or more parties in a civil dispute (subject to any appeal).28 U.S.C.S. ¬ß 2201 (‚ÄúAny such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.‚Äù) The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States,Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 284 (1988) (‚ÄúActions for declaratory judgments are neither legal nor equitable . . . .‚Äù). and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 (1971) (‚ÄúAlthough the declaratory judgment sought by the plaintiffs was a statutory remedy rather than a traditional form of equitable relief, the Court made clear that a suit for declaratory judgment was nevertheless ‚Äòessentially an equitable cause of action,‚Äô and was ‚Äòanalogous to the equity jurisdiction in suits quia timet or for a decree quieting title.‚Äô‚Äù) (citations omitted)Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 72 (1985) (‚ÄúThe propriety of issuing a declaratory judgment may depend upon equitable considerations‚Äù). A declaratory judgment does not by itself order any action by a party, or imply damages or an injunction, although it may be accompanied by one or more other remedies. A declaratory judgment is generally distinguished from an advisory opinion because the latter does not resolve an actual case or controversy. Declaratory judgments can provide legal certainty to each party in a matter when this could resolve or assist in a disagreement. Often an early resolution of legal rights will resolve some or all of the other issues in a matter. A declaratory judgment is typically requested when a party is threatened with a lawsuit but the lawsuit has not yet been filed; or when a party or parties believe that their rights under law and/or contract might conflict; or as part of a counterclaim to prevent further lawsuits from the same plaintiff (for example, when only a contract claim is filed, but a copyright claim might also be applicable). In some instances, a declaratory judgment is filed because the statute of limitations against a potential defendant may pass before the plaintiff incurs damage (for example, a malpractice statute applicable to a certified public accountant may be shorter than the time period the IRS has to assess a taxpayer for additional tax due to bad advice given by the CPA). Declaratory judgments are authorized by statute in most common-law jurisdictions. In the United States, the federal government and most states enacted statutes in the 1920s and 1930s authorizing their courts to issue declaratory judgments.See Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.S. ¬ß 2201 Cease and desist The filing of a declaratory judgment lawsuit can follow the sending by one party of a cease-and-desist letter to another party. A party contemplating sending such a letter risks that the recipient, or a party related to the recipient (such as a customer or supplier), may file for a declaratory judgment in their own jurisdiction, or sue for minor damages in the law of unjustified threats. This may require the sender to appear in a distant court, at their own expense. So sending a cease-and-desist letter presents a dilemma to the sender, as it would be desirable to be able to address the issues at hand in a candid manner without the need for litigation. Upon receiving a cease-and-desist letter, the recipient may seek a tactical advantage by instituting declaratory-judgment litigation in a more favorable jurisdiction. Sometimes the parties agree in advance of discussions that no declaratory-judgment lawsuit will be filed while the negotiations are continuing. Sometimes a lawsuit is filed, but not served, before sending such a notice, to preserve a jurisdiction advantage without engaging the judicial process fully. Some parties send cease-and-desist letters that make \\"an oblique suggestion of possible infringement\\" to lower the risk of the recipient filing a declaratory-judgment lawsuit. Declaratory judgment actions in patent litigation Declaratory judgments are common in patent litigation, as well as in other areas of intellectual property litigation, because declaratory judgments allow an alleged infringer to \\"clear the air\\" about a product or service that may be a business's focal point. For example, in a typical patent-infringement claim, when a patent owner becomes aware of an infringer, the owner can simply wait until he pleases to bring an infringement suit.But see 35 U.S.C. 286 (imposing a six-year time limitation on damages). Meanwhile, the monetary damages continuously accrue ‚Äì with no effort expended by the patent owner, apart from marking the patent number on products the patent owner sold or licensed. On the other hand, the alleged infringer could do nothing to rectify the situation if no declaratory judgment existed. The alleged infringer would be forced to continue to operate his business with the cloud of a lawsuit over his head. The declaratory-judgment procedure allows the alleged infringer to proactively bring suit to resolve the situation and eliminate the cloud of uncertainty looming overhead. Common claims for declaratory judgment in patent cases are non-infringement, patent invalidity, and unenforceability. To bring a claim for declaratory judgment in a situation where a patent dispute may exist or develop, the claimant must establish that an actual controversy exists.MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 126‚Äì27 (2007). If there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality, the court will generally proceed with the declaratory-judgment action.MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007). The court may even hear the action if the patentee has not filed a cease and desist letter. The standard for an actual controversy was most recently addressed by the Supreme Court in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118 (2007). But even if an actual controversy exists, the declaratory-judgment statute is permissive‚Äîa district court, in its discretion, may decline to hear a declaratory-judgment action.Grand T. W. R. Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 746 F.2d 323, 325 (6th Cir. 1984) (‚ÄúTitle 28 of the United States Code ¬ß 2201 provides that in ‚Äòa case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction‚Äô a federal court ‚Äòmay‚Äô give a declaratory judgment, a power permissive, not mandatory. Although it is well settled that the granting of a declaratory judgment rests in the \\"sound discretion\\" of the court‚Äù). Usually the claimant is actually making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent owner has claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement.35 U.S.C. 271. An express threat of litigation is not needed, nor is it a guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted.Grand T. W. R. Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp. , 746 F.2d 323, 325 (6th Cir. 1984). Some factors courts have considered in this analysis are whether a patent owner has asserted its rights against an alleged infringer in a royalty dispute, whether the owner has sued a customer of an alleged infringer, or whether an owner has made statements regarding its patents in trade magazines. If a patent owner does suggest that there is patent coverage of what an alleged infringer is doing or planning to do, the alleged infringer may bring suit. The alleged infringer, as the plaintiff in the suit, can choose the venue subject to constitutional restrictions and the state long-arm statute of the forum in question. The suit can be brought in any forum if the local federal district court can properly obtain personal jurisdiction over the alleged infringer. Defendants in infringement cases can ask for declaratory judgment as a counterclaim. A counterclaim of infringement is a compulsory counterclaim to a claim for declaratory judgment of non-infringement.Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng'g Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 802 (Fed. Cir. 1999) If a patent owner fails to assert an infringement counterclaim in a declaratory-judgment non- infringement suit, the patent infringement claim will be deemed waived.

Characteristics of the Brownsville Revival movement, as with other Christian religious revivals, included acts of repentance by parishioners and a call to holiness, inspired by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Some of the occurrences in this revival fit the description of moments of religious ecstasy. More than four million people are reported to have attended the revival meetings from its beginnings in 1995 to around 2000. Description One writer offered this description of the revival in 1998:  History  In 1993, two years before the revival began, Brownsville's pastor, John Kilpatrick, began directing his congregation to pray for revival. Over the next two years, he talked constantly about bringing revival to the church, even going as far as to threaten to leave the church if it didn't accept the revival. Supporters of the revival would also cite prophecies by Dr. David Yonggi Cho, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church, as evidence that the revival was inspired by God. According to Cho, God told him he was \\"going to send revival to the seaside city of Pensacola, and it will spread like a fire until all of America has been consumed by it.\\" On Father's Day June 18, 1995, a Sunday, the revival began, evangelist Steve Hill was the guest speaker, having been invited by Kilpatrick. Later, Hill and Kilpatrick, told of \\"a mighty wind\\" that blew through the church, an account that quickly spread across the Pentecostal community. Kilpatrick had been talking \\"revival\\" for several months and had gotten word that Hill wanted to lead a big revival. As the nightly revival meetings continued, Hill canceled all plans to go to Russia, and preached several revival services each week for the next five years. Hundreds of those who attended services were moved to renew their faith during Hill's sermons. In time, the church opened its doors for Tuesday-through- Saturday evening revival services to accommodate the thousands of people who arrived and waited in the church parking lot before dawn for a chance to enter the packed sanctuary, some even camping overnight waiting for the doors to open . By 1997, it was common to have lengthy and rapturous periods of singing and dancing and altars packed with hundreds of writhing or dead-still bodies from a variety of ages, races and socioeconomic conditions. As the revival progressed, the testimonies of people receiving salvation were joined supernatural healings. In Steve Hill's words, \\"We're seeing miraculous healings, cancerous tumors disappear and drug addicts immediately delivered.\\" However, the church told local news reporters that it did not keep records of the healings. In 1997, the leaders of the revival‚ÄîHill, Kilpatrick, and Lindell Cooley (Brownsville's worship director)‚Äîwent to several cities (Anaheim, Dallas, St. Louis, Lake Charles (Louisiana), Toledo, and Birmingham) and held like meetings. They named this ministry \\"Awake America\\". The primary part of the revival ended in 2000 when Hill moved on to pursue other works. In 2003, Hill founded a church in the Dallas area where he served as senior pastor. After a long bout with cancer, Hill died in March 2014. Cooley left in October 2003. Kilpatrick resigned as senior pastor in 2003 to form an evangelistic association of his own. Until 2006, the church continued to hold special Friday-night services that were a continuation of the revival. Bob Giovoni attended this with his wife and later became the pastor of Pleasant Grove Baptist Church in Pensacola  Aftermath  During the revival, nearly 200,000 people gave their lives to Jesus, and by fall 2000 more than 1,000 people who experienced the revival were taking classes at the Brownsville Revival School of Ministry. Thousands of pastors visited Brownsville and returned to their home congregations, leading to an outbreak of mini-revivals that helped the Assemblies of God recover from what some saw as a denominational decline. One follow-on revival, often called the Smithton Outpouring, occurred in the small town of Smithton, Missouri, at Smithton Community Church. It was significant because it was not connected with the Assemblies of God. The pastor, Steve Gray, visited the Brownsville Revival in 1996 while in the midst of personal turmoil, returned to his church of 150 members and hosted a 3-year revival which saw about 250,000 visitors. The revival is also significant because the ministry of Steve Gray and a significant portion of his followers remains active in Kansas City, where 85% of the congregation moved in 2000. The ministry he pastors, World Revival Church, emphasizes the attitude and mission of revival.\\"Follow the Fire\\" book by Steve Gray, forward by Pat Robertson, published by Charisma House, 2001. In 2001 there was a mini-split which occurred between the leadership of the Brownville Revival Church and the leadership of the Brownville Revival School of Ministry. This split for many marked the end of the Revival. This led to the creation of The F.I.R.E. School of Ministry (Fellowship for International Revival and Evangelism) under the former leader of B.R.S.M. Dr. Michael Brown. B.R.S.M. continued to offer classes for \\"several years\\" before being merged into a Ministry of Tommy Tenney. As of Sep 2018 the Fire School of Ministry was still operating in Concord NC.  Criticism  The meetings were criticized by some Christians and by the local news media. The Pensacola News Journal ran a series of investigative articles which focused on the donations raised during the meetings and where those funds went, as well as the claims of miraculous healings at the services and the spontaneity of the revival's beginnings. The newspaper revealed that a videotape of the Father's Day service that sparked the revival showed it was far less dramatic than later claimed. The News Journal began a four-month investigation after former members told reporters that all was not as it appeared at the church. The series won George Polk awards from such groups as National Headliner, the Scripps-Howard Foundation, and the Society of Professional Journalists. Brownsville Assembly of God responded to the paper's allegations by publishing a paid advertisement (thus shielding them from a response from the paper) in the News Journal entitled, \\"The Facts of The Brownsville Revival\\". Hank Hanegraaff, author of the book Counterfeit Revival, criticized the revival for \\"serious distortions of biblical Christianity\\" in the meetings, comparing the physical manifestations to pagan practices, but later apologized after meeting with dr Michael Brown. The Counterfeit Revival (Part Three) Separating Fact from Fabrication on the Pensacola Outpouring J Lee Grady, editor for Charisma Magazine, was critical of the division that had grown within the leadership at the last stage of the revival. He also reported that numerous former attendees now attend local Baptist churches.

Various sources list its meaning when translated from Irish as \\"the castle of the yellow river,\\" \\"the castle on the little plain,\\" \\"the fort of the gables (or pinnacles),\\" and \\"the fort of the yellow women.\\" The town centre is built on and around two rivers, each of which are tributaries of the larger River Bandon, which passes by at the east end of the town. The town is twinned with Qu√©ven, France. Dunmanway won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1982. More recently, the town came to national and international attention thanks to a visit by Liverpool Football Club for a pre-season soccer friendly. The population of Dunmanway and its environs at the 2011 census was 1,585, rising to 1,655 by the 2016 census. History Dunmanway has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as testified by a Bronze Age trumpet in the British Museum.British Museum Collection From the mid-13th to the late 17th century the surrounding districts of the town of Dunmanway were included in the territory of the MacCarthy Clan. Dunmanway Castle once stood on a bank of the Sally River on the left-hand side of present-day Castle Street. It was one of the chief residences of the MacCarthy Lords of Gleannacroim,Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy Glas (O'Hart 1892) cousins of the MacCarthy Reagh sept. Dating from the late 15th century, the tower house is recorded to have been built by Catherine Fitzgerald. There was likely a small settlement in the environs of the castle. 19th century references date the founding of Dunmanway to the late 17th century, when the English crown settled a colony there to provide a resting place for troops marching between Bandon and Bantry. By 1700, about thirty families lived in the town. Sir Richard Cox, Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1703 to 1707, was the town's most important early patron. In 1693, Cox obtained a grant from King William III to hold market days and fairs in the town and strongly encouraged the development of the local flax industry. To that end, Cox imported artisans from Ulster to teach the required skills. He sponsored numerous incentives for local residents involved in making linen, including rent-free housing for top producers, bonuses for efficient labourers, rewards for schoolgirls who showed strong loom skills, and production contests with generous prizes. In 1735, the town consisted of forty houses and two to three hundred people. By 1747, the linen industry was well established, and Cox's personal census recorded 557 people. Two years later, it rose to 807. Free market economic policies in England led to the removal of protective duties on linen in 1827. In 1837, Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland recorded a population of 2,738. It also recorded the town's changing economic fortunes: > \\"The manufacture of linen continued to flourish for some years, but at > present there are very few looms at work. A porter and ale brewery, > established in 1831, produces 2,600 barrels annually; there are also two > tanyards and two boulting-mills, the latter capable of grinding annually > 15,000 bags of flour, and there are two or three smaller mills in the > vicinity. Since 1810 a considerable trade in corn has been carried on.\\" West Cork was hit hard by the 1840s Great Famine. On 9 February 1847, U.S. Vice President George M. Dallas chaired a famine relief meeting in Washington, D.C. where participants heard a letter addressed to the \\"Ladies of America\\" from the women of The Dunmanway Indian Meal Ladies' Committee: > \\"Oh! that our American sisters could see the labourers on our roads, able- > bodied men, scarcely clad, famishing with hunger, with despair in their once > cheerful faces, staggering at their work ... oh! that they could see the > dead father, mother or child, lying coffinless and hear the screams of the > survivors around them, caused not by sorrow, but by the agony of hunger.\\" In the early 1850s, following the migrations and evictions which characterized the famine's upheavals, more than seventy percent of Dunmanway residents did not own any land. On 28 November 1921, during the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), seventeen British Auxiliary Division troops were killed by the Irish Republican Army at the Kilmichael Ambush (near Dunmanway). The subsequent sacking and burning of the city of Cork by the British forces is thought to be linked to the Kilmichael Ambush. On 15 December 1920, an Auxiliary shot dead the local priest, Canon Magner, for refusing to toll his church's bells on Armistice Day; a local boy, Tadhg Crowley, was also killed in an apparently random incident. There were numerous other actions in and around Dunmanway during the war (see Chronology of the Irish War of Independence). In addition, after a truce was declared in July 1921, the local IRA killed a number of alleged informers. Controversy continues in particular over the killing of ten men (including three residents of Dunmanway) in the spring of 1922, all of whom were Protestants (see Dunmanway killings). Demographics As a person from Ireland is called Irish, or a person from County Cork is Corkonian, a person living in Dunmanway is known as a Doheny. This is as the local Gaelic Athletic Association club is known as \\"The Dohenys\\" in honour of Michael Doheny, a member of the Young Ireland nationalist movement who lived in the area for a short period while on the run from British forces. Immigration to the town in recent years has caused a population growth. The population grew 52% in the period from 2002 to 2006. The 2002 census reported that there were 1,532 people living in Dunmanway and the 2006 census reported that the town had a population of 2,328. =Nationalities= Immigration to the town and surrounding areas began in the 1970s - in particular from the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. Immigration from these countries is still going on, including by people who are attracted to the relaxed pace of life in West Cork. Into the 2000s, immigration to Dunmanway took on a greater pace as the Celtic Tiger economy began to take hold. Today in Dunmanway there are Polish, Latvians and British inhabitants. In addition to these there are small groups of Czechs, Hungarians, Estonians, Germans, Austrian, Dutch and Chinese. =Religion= Dunmanway is predominantly Roman Catholic with a large Protestant minority and a small Neopagan minority. There are two different Protestant denominations in the town, namely the Church of Ireland and Methodism, the former being larger. While still majority Catholic, the rural area around Dunmanway has one of the highest percentage of non-Catholics in the Republic of Ireland using \\"Religion > % Roman Catholic\\" layer. and the town acts as an important focal point for this community. As Christianity is the religion of the vast majority of the town, Christmas and Easter are important times of year in Dunmanway. Many businesses remain closed from Christmas Day for four or five days and then close again for a day or two for New Year's Day. At Easter the case is similar with many businesses closing from Good Friday to Easter Monday. The Corpus Christi procession in June is also a major event for the Catholic faithful.  Culture and leisure  = Festivals = The Ballabuidhe Festival is held annually over the August Bank Holiday weekend and centres around both the Ballabuidhe Horse Fair and Ballabuidhe Races. The Ballabuidhe Horse Fair dates back to the 1615, when King James I granted Randal Og Hurley a charter to hold a fair at Beal Atha Buidhe on the River Bandon. The Dunmanway Agricultural Show, first held in 1946, takes place on the first Sunday in July each year, and with contested classes including horses, cattle and horticulture. The Sam Maguire Festival runs in September, and focuses on the life and ethos of Sam Maguire. = Angling = The stretch of the River Bandon which flows east through Dunmanway holds brown trout, sea trout and salmon. Sport =Gaelic games= Dohenys is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, and the club play their home matches at Sam Maguire Park. Dohenys' under-age teams play under the name \\"Sam Maguires\\". Dohenys currently compete at the senior grade of the Cork county football championship, and reached the county final in 2006, losing to Nemo Rangers. The club's most famous player is probably √âamonn Young, who captained Cork to victory in the National Football League and the Munster Football Championship in 1952, having also been a part of Cork's All- Ireland-winning team of 1945. Although the club has historically enjoyed more success in football, Dohenys became Munster Junior B Hurling champions in 2007. =Soccer= The local soccer club is Dunmanway Town, who play in the Premier Division of the West Cork League. In June 2009, it was sensationally announced that the world-famous Liverpool F.C. had agreed to visit Dunmanway to play Town in a pre-season friendly on 6 August 2009. Liverpool, fielding players from their reserve and youth teams (the home side supplemented their line-up with a number of players from prominent Cork-based clubs like Avondale United and Cobh Ramblers F.C.) won the game by one goal to nil in front of 6,800 fans, and Garda√≠ estimated that more than 15,000 people visited Dunmanway on the day to catch a glimpse of the Liverpool stars of the future. =Other sports= Other sports clubs in the town include rugby, athletics, pitch and putt and badminton. Dunmanway has also been home to an indoor heated swimming pool for many years, with the 25 metre pool being the only public swimming pool in the West Cork area. August 2010 saw the revived \\"Munster 100\\" motorcycle road race take place in Dunmanway. This was followed 24 months later by the first Dunmanway 'Lightning Sprint' Grand Prix motorcycle meet. Like other parts of County Cork, road bowling is a popular sport in the surrounding area, and the All-Ireland road bowling championships took place in Dunmanway in July 2011. Dunmanway is fondly known as 'The Volleyball Capital of Ireland.' Employment Today, the construction industry and agriculture play a large part in the economic environment of the town. Between 1975 and 1999, Swedish multinational firm M√∂lnlycke Health Care operated a manufacturing facility in Dunmanway. The plant employed over 250 people at its peak. Transport Dunmanway is approximately 60km southwest from Cork City, on the N71 national secondary road, and the R586 regional road. The town is served by Bus √âireann bus service from Cork City. The nearest airport is Cork Airport. Dunmanway railway station opened on 12 June 1866 and closed entirely on 1 April 1961. Local lore Chapel Lake. A later scion of the Cox family, Richard, heard that a preacher allied to John Wesley was due to visit the town and decided to give him a ducking in the local lake. To practice he went out in a boat but fell into the water and was drowned. The event was commemorated by the following verse: :\\"'Tis there the lake is, :Where the duck and the drake is, :And 'tis there the crane can have his fine feed of frogs. :When night come's round it, :The spirits surround it, :For in it was drownded Sir Richard Cox.\\" People *Sam Maguire, Gaelic football player/ Irish republican *Con O'Kelly, wrestler, gold medalist at 1908 Olympics *Timothy J.

This phrase is seen multiple times throughout the Christian Bible to describe the activities of the early church, and is historically recorded as continuing, at least in practice, since the time of Christ.Hyatt, Eddie. 2000 Years Of Charismatic Christianity: A 21st century look at church history from a pentecostal/charismatic prospective. Charisma House, 2002 The phrase is primarily derived from Old and New Testament references, and is now used in the Christian and mainstream press, and in scholarly religious discourse to communicate a strong emphasis on recognizing perceived manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the contemporary lives of Christian believers; as well, it communicates a focus on the expectation that divine action would be experienced in the individual and corporate life of the modern Christian church, and a further insistence that followers actively seek the \\"gifts of the Spirit\\". A further major emphasis of belief in signs and wonders is that the message of the Christian \\"good news\\" is communicated more effectively to those who do not believe it if accompanied by such supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit, including such signs and wonders as miraculous healings and modern prophetic proclamations. This is the message of John Wimber's book, Power Evangelism.  Biblical origins  The origin of the phrase in the Old Testament is in , which describes God's actions to free the Israelites from being enslaved in Ancient Egypt. This phrase is used a total of 31 times in the Bible and it became popular again in modern history around the time of the Azusa Street Revival, when attendees claimed miraculous and supernatural events had happened.Welchel, Tommy.

Later in the 1990s, the discussion was taken up by R. E. Jackson (addressing skeptics),R. E.

Williams, Signs, Wonders, and the Kingdom of God: A Biblical Guide for the Reluctant Skeptic (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Vine Books, 1989).  Defense and reflection  The ongoing theological reflection accompanying the signs and wonders movement was evidenced by Fuller Theological Seminary's 1988 Symposium on Power Evangelism*Papers Presented at the Symposium on Power Evangelism (Pasadena, California: Fuller Theological Seminary, 1988). and C. Peter Wagner's book titled The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit.*C. Peter Wagner, The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit: Encountering the Power of Signs and Wonders Today (Ann Arbor: Servant Publications Vine Books, 1988).

Lee, Power Evangelism in the Third Wave Movement and Its Implications for Contemporary Church Growth (Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, 2000). Cessationists object to the existence of charismatic gifts, leading to a cessationism versus continuationism debate. The broader debate specifically over the signs and wonders movement and the present-day function of the manifestation gifts would continue on into the 1990s.D. T.

Greig, et al., The Kingdom and the Power: Are Healing and the Spiritual Gifts Used by Jesus and the Early Church Meant for the Church Today?: a Biblical Look at How to Bring the Gospel to the World with Power (Ventura, California: Regal Books, 1993). Power Evangelism The term power evangelism originally comes from Lonnie Frisbee's ministry but some of his harshest critics for heavy use of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit came from the churches he helped found.John Crowder, Miracle workers, reformers and the new mystics, Destiny Image Publishers, 2006, , , pages 103-6. Power evangelism is a form of evangelism which relies on the supernatural power and gifts of the Holy Spirit, that is, on signs and wonders, to reach new converts and work through born again Christians. It is not the way most churches practice evangelism currently, which relies on an intellectual argument with the hope of salvation through logic and structured rituals. Proponents believe power evangelism is the way Jesus operated, although it is known he also was a great student of the Torah. Although most Christians would believe that a person is brought to faith primarily through the action of God in the person of the Holy Spirit, in this form of evangelism supernatural events such as faith healings, prophetic revelation, words of knowledge and glossolalia (speaking in tongues) are a demonstration of the power, and therefore the reality, of God. Power Evangelism is illustrated in the lives of the disciples in the Book of Acts.  See also  * Acts of the Apostles * Mark 16  References   Further reading  * Stanley M.

The label's name and logo come from the Od√©on-Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe in Paris.  History  Straus and Zuntz bought the company from Carl Lindstr√∂m that he had founded in 1897. They transformed the Lindstr√∂m enterprise into a public company, the Carl Lindstr√∂m A.G. and in 1903 purchased Fonotipia Records, including their Odeon-Werke International Talking Machine Company.Alfred Gutmann: 25 Jahre Lindstr√∂m 1904 - 1929. Berlin 1929, p.12 International Talking Machine Company issued the Odeon label first in Germany in 1903 and applied for a U.S. trademark the same year. While other companies were making single-side discs, Odeon made them double-sided. In 1909 it created the first recording of a large orchestral work -- and what may have been the first record album -- when it released a 4-disc set of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite with Hermann Finck conducting the London Palace Orchestra. Between 1910 and 1911 Odeon was acquired by Carl Lindstr√∂m. On January 30, 1904,25 Jahre Lindstr√∂m, p. 12 Odeon became a part of the Carl Lindstr√∂m Company, which also owned Beka Records, Parlophone, Fonotipia, Lyrophon, Homophon and other labels. Lindstr√∂m was acquired by the English Columbia Graphophone Company in 1926. In 1931 Columbia merged with Electrola, HMV and other labels to form EMI. The Berlin Odeon plant recorded, processed, and exported records to many countries. There were extensive national catalogs for some of these countries: Greece, Scandinavia, India, all of Arabia, Netherlands, Estonia, Portugal, South and Central America, Rumania, Turkey, Hungary, China, Dutch East Indies, Siam, the Balkan countries etc. In the 1920s and 1930s about 70% of the German Odeon production was exported.25 Jahre Lindstr√∂m, pp 75‚Äì119 Some Odeon recordings were leased to the American Okeh Records for distribution in the United States. Odeon discs were first manufactured in America, for export only, in 1905 or 1906 by the American Record Company, which produced lateral- cut, 10¬æ-inch 78 discs made of blue shellac. This business ceased in 1907 when ARC was sued by Columbia for patent infringement. Lindstr√∂m tried again to open an American branch, this time through Otto Heineman, who worked for Lindstr√∂m's company and was living in America when World War I broke out. Stuck in New York, Heineman created the Otto Heineman Phonograph Supply Company in 1915, then four years later started his own label, Okeh Records. In 1919, OKeh began issuing foreign recordings in the United States on the Odeon label. During the 1920s, Odeon issued American jazz records in other countries, such as Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. During the 1930s and 1940s Odeon sold its Swing Music Series. Odeon recorded and issued over 2700 titles of Indian music from the period 1900‚Äì1940. Odeon's shellac disc issues were in two phases: (1) 1912‚Äì1916, and (2) 1932‚Äì38. During the first phase their engineers visited many cities to record the diverse regional music of India, and after production in Berlin shipped records back to India. The company was based in Mumbai and Madras during the second phase. However the outbreak of World War II, and the subsequent trade embargoes, meant that the company had to wind-up its operations in India. The company's output included \\"drama songs, speeches, folk music, classical music, drama sets, skits and plays, vocal and instrumental music\\". It has been estimated that about 600 titles have survived in private collections. The British Museum have digitised some of these records which are free in an online archive. After World War II, the Odeon label continued as a subsidiary of EMI in many non-English-speaking markets, such as West Germany, France, Spain, Scandinavia, Japan and Latin America. The dome logo was still used in most of those places, although they also had their own label designs. With the sale of most EMI properties to erstwhile rival Universal Music Group (UMG) in November 2012, Universal retained the right to reissue from namely Odeon's post-war Japanese, Latin American, German and select European catalogues, while another former competitor Warner Music Group (WMG) acquired the rights to the remainder of EMI in February 2013 and with that, reissues from Odeon's French, Scandinavian, Spanish and most other European releases, to comply with the European Commission's divestiture conditions. Universal Music Enterprises manages UMG's Odeon catalogue with Parlophone and WEA International handling WMG's own.

In 2004, Univision aired the soap opera in the United States. Synopsis Besame Tonto is the story of a young woman who does not know that she grew up in a Mafia family and that she is adopted. Her adoptive father is an Italian mafioso who lives and operates a criminal syndicate in Peru. He is an older man who wants to make his businesses legitimate, and he eventually acquires a newspaper, which he in turn will use to attack his most powerful enemy. \\"Julieta Rossini\\", the young woman, is married to a man against her own wishes. But her real love is \\"Romulo\\", who takes her away from Lima and across northern Peru. Romulo has characteristics that are somewhat atypical of the love heroes of these types of television shows: he wears glasses, greases his hair and chooses to use overalls or plaid shirts. Rossini, however, becomes attracted to his personality and his intelligence, and she does not want to return to a husband she never loved in the first place. But her father sees her leaving as a kidnapping by Romulo, and soon, the police are after Romulo and Julieta. Julieta's father, despite knowing that she is not his real daughter, loves her dearly and felt he would hurt her by revealing information to her about his businesses and about her being adopted. For this reason, he keeps those two facts as a secret from her. Her adoptive mother, however, is a woman who is only interested in her husband's money, and she tries to instill that desire for money in Juliana's personality. Upon learning, by his own daughter's admission to him, that Julieta had fallen in love with Romulo, Mr. Rossini forgives Romulo and actually begins to like him. He eventually gives him non-criminal jobs, such as finding out what his mafia enemies are up to, keeping his finances up to date, etc., etc. When Mr. Rossini becomes injured in an attack, he decides to hide and leaves Lima to live in Peru's interior, from where he contacts Romulo to find out how things are going back at home. Complicating Romulo's family life are a sick father who is in his 60s, a stepmother who becomes pregnant, then loses her baby during another attack by Rossini's rival gang, and a brother who is more interested in money than anything else.

In the , Gordonvale had a population of 6,671 people.  Geography  Gordonvale is on the Mulgrave River. Once a separate town, the urban sprawl of Cairns has resulted in Gordonvale being subsumed into the suburban extremities of Cairns. Gordonvale lies approximately south of the Cairns central business district and is just east of the Gillies Range which leads to the Atherton Tableland. Gordonvale was located within the Shire of Mulgrave until its amalgamation with the City of Cairns in 1995. The City was subsequently merged into the larger Cairns Region in 2008. A prominent natural landmark is Walshs Pyramid, which rises steeply to 922m.  History  Norman Street, located beside the public park Aerial view of Gordonvale, 1937 Gordonvale was established on Yidinji tribal land. Yidinji (also known as Yidinj, Yidiny, and Idindji) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, and the Mulgrave River, and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi. Initially it was called Mulgrave and then Nelson, until the name Gordonvale was chosen as a tribute to John Gordon, a pioneer in the district who was a butcher, dairyman and grazier and early director of Mulgrave Central sugarmill. The area was first settled in 1877 by the Alley and Blackwell families who cut a road through to Trinity Inlet so they could haul out cedar logs. By 1880, the road was well-used by miners and packers and they established the Riverstone Hotel to service the passing trade. After a while, a small town developed, encompassing three pubs, a store and a butcher shop run by John Gordon. In the Cairns area, a Chinese businessman, Andrew Lee On built the first sugar mill in 1882, named Pioneer Mill, and established the Hop Wah Plantation on of land. Other plantations and sugar mills were also established in the area in years following, and the region developed into a sugar cultivation and milling area. In the late 19th century, the Bryce brothers built the town's general store which expanded greatly over the years, supplying the community and farmers with provisions as well as equipment. Also in the late 19th century \\"Snowy\\" Thomas and his family built a butcher shop with adjoining bakery that also became the lifeblood of the town and ran a delivery service using horses. Similarly, the Harris brothers ran a mechanical repair store for farming equipment and personal vehicles, another essential service for the small farming community. Around 1902, Anthony Abdullah (Simon) moved to Gordonvale with his wife, Mary. The Abdullahs were among the earliest Lebanese families to migrate to Australia, hailing from the tiny village of Kfarsghab. Anthony owned the grounds where today stand St Michael's Catholic Church. The convent was his original family home. He ran a drapery business, and was known locally and with fondness as 'Abdullah the Turk'. The family were great benefactors of the Church. They moved to Sydney in 1923, leaving Gordonvale forever. Around 1914 the first cinema in the town was established by Vince and Daisy Medlik with the latter's sister Nellie Sutcliffe. Vince Medlik was a carpenter and was the owner-builder. Running silent movies at first, the cinema was called \\"Vince Medlik's Silent Pictures\\". As well as movies, once a month they presented a vaudeville night produced by Nellie and the dancers from her dancing school. Displaying a rare technical skill in its time, especially for a woman, Nellie also operated the projection and took care of inaugurating the \\"talkies\\" when they later came in. Due to unforeseen circumstances the business had to be moved just before the Great Depression to the newly built and nearby Nelson Hall. It subsequently had to be closed down during the Depression even though by that stage other family members had become involved in its operation such a Vince's son Laurie Medlik. Before the Second World War the cinema reopened with new proprietors and employed Nellie Sutcliffe and Laurie Medlik, the latter managing it. During the Second World War a contingent of approximately 3000 American paratroopers was stationed in Gordonvale and did their training there for their missions in New Guinea. The American Army commandeered some of the town's hotels to use as hospitals as many troops were injured during this training. Quite a number of local women were employed to do parachute packing. In the 1990s a number of mosaics were commissioned by the \\"Friends of Gordonvale\\" commemorating through imagery the original businesses and shops in the town. These mosaics were cemented permanently within the footpaths directly outside the original sites of the businesses. The granddaughter of picture theatre owner Vince Medlik, award- winning artist Jewel Isaacs, designed the image for that business. At the 2006 census, Gordonvale had a population of 4,420. In the 2011 census, Gordonvale had a population of 6,214 people. Heritage listings Gordonvale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 71378 Bruce Highway: Meringa Sugar Experiment Station * Gillies Highway: Alley Family Graves  Facilities  The Gordonvale Library, situated at 88 Norman Street, Gordonvale is operated by the Cairns Regional Council. The Gordonvale Library was opened in 1954.  Education  * Gordonvale State School was opened on 15 March 1897. * Gordonvale State High School was opened 25 January 1965. In 2015, Gordonvale State High School celebrated its 50th anniversary.  Attractions  Mulgrave Central Mill at dusk Delonix regia, the Royal Poinciana tree in flower, Church Street, Gordonvale, Queensland. Seed pods visible on upper branches. Operating since 1896, the Mulgrave Central sugar mill is located near the town centre in Gordon St. The mill services about 300 sugarcane farms in the local region and operates during the 'crush' season (about six months of the year). When operating, the mill emanates a strong sugary smell downwind. Tours of the mill were previously available, but with the increase in global sugar prices, tours have been stopped as the focus is now on sugar production. The Mulgrave Settlers Museum is across Gordon St from the mill. It is operated by the Mulgrave Shire Historical Society. The museum has a number of historical items donated from the local community and displays that represent the early gold miners, cedar cutters, Chinese workers and packers (mule train suppliers to the Atherton Tableland). The museum is open Monday to Saturday from 10AM to 2PM. The Great Pyramid Race and Country Fair - In a local Gordonvale pub, with two cane farmers were having an ‚Äòargument‚Äô after the end of a hard days work! They decided to settle this ‚Äòargument‚Äô, with a race to the peak of the nearby Walsh‚Äôs Pyramid. This was (and still is) no ordinary race. A wager was made between the two cane farmers to see who could run up in the quickest possible time. This race created so much interest that the local bookie took bets on which cane farmer was ‚Äòright‚Äô. From this humorous start, to a full day event with the \\"Great Pyramid Mountain Race\\" now having 175 runners. Since the race began, the training for the competition has gone from \\"no training at all and chasing wild pigs in the scrub\\", to \\"intense training programmes for dedicated athletes\\". The first official race took place in 1959 to coincide with Queensland‚Äôs Centenary Celebrations and now is an annual event hold on the second weekend of August, where some of the finest and strongest from around the world gather and strive to conquer the Mountain. Now recognized on the National Race Endurance Calendar and part of the Australian Mountain Running Association Calendar and with Trans Tasman links and other international attention, it has made this Mountain Challenge a \\"Great Race\\". Gordonvale Golf Club is located centrally in the town and has an 18-hole golf course. The course is unusual as nine holes are shared with a horse-racing track, Gordonvale Racecourse (which predated the golf course by many years), with the other nine going through bushland to run up against the Bruce Highway. The suburb is surrounded predominantly by sugarcane fields and is only a short drive from many interesting places including the Bellenden Ker National Park and Goldsborough Valley State Forest.  Cane toads  Cane toads (Bufo marinus) were deliberately introduced into Australia in an attempt to control the native Frenchi beetle (Lepidiota frenchi) and the greyback beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum) whose larvae (colloquially known as \\"cane grubs\\") were destroying sugar cane crops in North Queensland. The Australian Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations imported 101 cane toads into Gordonvale from Hawaii in June 1935. By March 1937 some 62,000 toadlets had been bred and distributed into sugar cane fields up and down the Queensland coast. Unfortunately the toads were unsuccessful at controlling the cane beetles and began their invasion which continues today. The spread of cane toads was slow at first but by 1959 they had colonised most of Queensland‚Äôs east coast. In 1964 they appeared in the Gulf of Carpentaria and by 1984 had reached the Queensland/Northern Territory border. In March 2001 the invasion front entered the wetlands of heritage-listed Kakadu National Park and by 2009 the toads were within reach of the Northern Territory/Western Australian border. They have also spread south into northern New South Wales, with one isolated community in Port Macquarie and are now found in Sydney at Tarren Point in the south of the city.

This belief has been popularized by the novel, This Present Darkness by Frank Peretti, as well as by the ministry of Peter Wagner. The existence of territorial spirits is viewed as significant in spiritual warfare within these Christian groups. Biblical context =Deuteronomy 32:8-9= In both the Septuagint and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Deuteronomy 32:8-9 refers to a time when God divided the nations of the earth among the \\"sons of God\\" (Israel is excepted as the special possession of God Himself.) Given the meaning of this phrase in the Book of Job, it is suggested that this is a reference to the origin of territorial spirits who were, at one time, angels administering the earth on God's behalf. Wagner appeals to F. F. Bruce, who points out that the Septuagint reading \\"implies that the administration of various nations has been parcelled out among a corresponding number of angelic powers.\\" The question remains, however, as to whether these spirits are malevolent. =Psalm 82= Psalm 82 speaks of \\"elohim\\" (a generic term for spirit beings) who are \\"sons of the most High\\" and are assigned to judge mankind until dying like men or \\"falling like one of the princes\\". Psalm 58 covers similar ground. =Daniel 10= Daniel 10 concerns the visitation of a man \\"His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude\\" to the prophet Daniel. This man explains to Daniel that he was delayed by the \\"Prince of Persia\\" (10:13), but was helped by \\"Michael, one of the chief princes\\" (a reference to the Michael the Archangel, who was recognized in Jewish literature to be a chief angel guarding over Israel). Later in the chapter, the man warns Daniel that soon the \\"Prince of Greece\\" (10:20) will join his Persian counterpart to make war upon them. Wagner regards this chapter is a key passage supporting the existence of territorial spirits, and appeals to Keil and Delitzsch, who suggest that the \\"prince of Persia\\" is the \\"guardian spirit of the kingdom.\\"Wagner, Confronting the Powers, 173. George Otis says that Daniel 10 is \\"a well-defined case of an evil spiritual being ruling over an area with explicitly defined boundaries.\\"George Otis, \\"An Overview of Spiritual Mapping,\\" in Engaging the Enemy How to Fight and Defeat Territorial Spirits, 35. David E. Stevens notes that many scholars take the Prince of Persia to be an earthly political authority, such as Cambyses II. Stevens personally accepts the angelic interpretation, but argues that the \\"influence exerted by these angelic princes is personal and sociopolitical in nature and not territorial.\\" Stevens notes that in Daniel 12:1, Michael the Archangel, is described as \\"the great prince who protects your people\\" (NIV), which \\"emphasizes the protective role of Michael in relation to the people of God rather than with respect to a given territory. Michael remained the guardian angel of the people of God, whether Israel was in the Promised Land or was dispersed in exile among the nations.\\"Stevens, \\"Daniel 10,\\" 427. Criticism Melvin Tinker argues that the literary use of territorial spirits is a misnomer, since spirits referred to in various Biblical passages \\"are to be more associated with political and religious power and ideologies.\\"Melvin Tinker, \\"The Phantom Menace: Territorial Spirits and SLSW,\\" in Evangelical Concerns (Mentor, 2001), 171. Scholars such as Robert Priest, Paul Hiebert and A. Scott Moreau detect animist ideas in the arguments of supporters of the theory of territorial spirits. Robert Guelich of Fuller Theological Seminary does not find the concept of territorial spirits within the Gospels, and has analyzed this problem in a critical review of Frank E. Peretti's novel This Present Darkness. Peter Wagner promotes \\"Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare\\" (SLSW) which involves the practice of learning the names and assignments of demonic spirits as the first step to effective spiritual warfare.Tinker, \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" 167-168. Opponents of this theological construct, and associated beliefs in \\"spiritual warfare\\", point out that while the Bible may describe some form of demonic control over geography, it does not prescribe many of the behaviors and teachings that proponents advocate in response. There is no mention in either the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament of believers banding together and praying a form of \\"spiritual warfare\\" against particular territorial demons. The battles occurring in the spiritual realms (as described in Daniel 10) have no Biblically identified link to the actions and prayers of God's people in the physical world.See Leanne Payne, \\"Spiritual Mapping: A Misguided Focus on the Demonic\\" See also * Genius loci * Tutelary deity References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= * Gross, Edward N.

From 2008 to 2012, he was president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund Canada, part of a global conservation organization. In 2014, Maclean's magazine declared Butts to be the fourteenth most powerful Canadian. As the former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Butts was praised as the architect behind the Liberal Party of Canada platform that led to their victory in October of 2015 and was one of the most senior staffers in the Office of the Prime Minister, along with Katie Telford. Early life and education Butts grew up in the Bridgeport neighbourhood of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, with three older brothers and one older sister. He is the son of Charles William \\"Charlie\\" Butts, a coal miner who was 56 years old when Butts was born and retired when Butts was 6 years old, and Rita Monica (Yorke) Butts, a nurse and a first- generation Canadian daughter of a Ukrainian father and a Polish mother. He attended Bridgeport School (now closed) and then St. Michael's High School (now a junior high school). He received a B.A. and M.A. in English literature from McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. It was at McGill that he was introduced to Justin Trudeau by a mutual friend. There, he was also elected president of the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate and won the national debating championships two years in a row. He briefly attended York University to pursue a Ph.D. Career Upon graduating from McGill University, his first job was working as a research assistant in the Senate office of Allan MacEachen. There, he organized MacEachen's past work for the purposes of his future memoirs. It has been stated that although the MacEachen biography was never published, Butts had a thorough understanding of MacEachen's longstanding political career. In 1999, Butts became a policy director within the Government of Ontario. He was the policy secretary, and later the principal secretary, in the office of the then premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty, in Toronto.The Liberal Team That Dethroned the Tories (Ottawa Citizen, 2003) Prior to the 2007 election, Butts was a McGuinty insider. After the election, he became McGuinty's principal adviser. As one of his biographical notes describes it, Butts \\"was intimately involved in all of the government‚Äôs significant environmental initiatives, from the Greenbelt and Boreal Conservation plan to the coal phase-out and toxic reduction strategy\\". Butts had previously worked with Senator Allan MacEachen and with George Smitherman. Butts advised the campaigns that led to the Ontario Liberal Party's election victories in 2003 and 2007. On June 25, 2008, Butts was announced as the president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund Canada. He officially took up the position on September 2, 2008,WWF-Canada Appoints New CEO (WWF-Canada,2008) succeeding Mike Russill. On October 16, 2012, Butts left WWF Canada to become the political advisor to Justin Trudeau. His position at WWF Canada was filled by David Miller, a former mayor of Toronto. On December 13, 2012, Butts was interviewed by Steve Paikin for The Agenda on the topic of \\"The Best Way to Clean Up the Environment\\". Butts has published articles in the Boston Book Review, the Literary Review of Canada, and Gravitas. He has also appeared on television programs such as W5 and TSN's Off the Record. =2015 Canadian election and premiership of Justin Trudeau= In 2012, stemming from a two-decade-long friendship, Butts became the senior political adviser to Justin Trudeau and one of the few people with whom Trudeau consulted regularly. During Trudeau's initial time as Liberal party leader. He also assisted on the vast majority of policies on which Trudeau campaigned. He was appointed Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister on November 4, 2015. On February 18, 2019, Butts stepped down as Trudeau's principal secretary and stated that it was to defend himself from allegations made against him in relation to the SNC-Lavalin affair and to avoid drawing attention away from the prime minister's work. In a statement released on Twitter, Butts denied influencing the Attorney General, noting that he specifically recruited Jody Wilson-Raybould to join the Liberal Party and was an avid supporter during both her candidacy and her tenure as a minister. Butts reiterated these claims in testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on March 6, 2019. At the time of Butts' resignation, Trudeau had responded by thanking him for his service, while acknowledging the integrity, guidance, and devotion that Butts had provided him. In July 2019, Prime Minister Trudeau hired Butts back to play a key role in the Liberal 2019 election campaign. https://globalnews.ca/news/5664371/gerald-butts-liberal-campaign/ Personal life Butts is the nephew of the former Canadian senator Mary Alice \\"Peggy\\" Butts, whom he cites as major influence on him throughout his life. He is married to Jodi (Heimpel) Butts, a lawyer, and they have two children, Aidan Ignatius (born May 6, 2006) and Ava Augusta (born December 1, 2007). They resided in Toronto for 13 years until the family relocated in the summer of 2016 to Ottawa. Butts currently resides at Champlain Park area of Westboro, Ottawa.

Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, complex statistical methods, and analytic approaches like social network analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions. It involves the understanding of social agents, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate. Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence. Some of the approaches that originated in this field have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity. Social complexity concepts such as complex systems, non-linear interconnection among macro and micro process, and emergence, have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology. A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an \\"artificial society\\", by which researchers can analyze the structure of a social system. History Historical map of research paradigms and associated scientists in sociology and complexity science. = Background = In the past four decades, computational sociology has been introduced and gaining popularity . This has been used primarily for modeling or building explanations of social processes and are depending on the emergence of complex behavior from simple activities.Salgado, Mauricio, and Nigel Gilbert. \\"Emergence and communication in computational sociology.\\" Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 43.1 (2013): 87-110. The idea behind emergence is that properties of any bigger system do not always have to be properties of the components that the system is made of.Macy, Michael W., and Robert Willer. \\"From factors to actors: computational sociology and agent-based modeling.\\" Annual review of sociology 28.1 (2002): 143-166. The people responsible for the introduction of the idea of emergence are Alexander, Morgan, and Broad, who were classical emergentists. The time at which these emergentists came up with this concept and method was during the time of the early twentieth century. The aim of this method was to find a good enough accommodation between two different and extreme ontologies, which were reductionist materialism and dualism. While emergence has had a valuable and important role with the foundation of Computational Sociology, there are those who do not necessarily agree. One major leader in the field, Epstein, doubted the use because there were aspects that are unexplainable. Epstein put up a claim against emergentism, in which he says it \\"is precisely the generative sufficiency of the parts that constitutes the whole's explanation\\". Agent-based models have had a historical influence on Computational Sociology. These models first came around in the 1960s, and were used to simulate control and feedback processes in organizations, cities, etc. During the 1970s, the application introduced the use of individuals as the main units for the analyses and used bottom-up strategies for modeling behaviors. The last wave occurred in the 1980s. At this time, the models were still bottom-up; the only difference is that the agents interact interdependently. =Systems theory and structural functionalism= In the post-war era, Vannevar Bush's differential analyser, John von Neumann's cellular automata, Norbert Wiener's cybernetics, and Claude Shannon's information theory became influential paradigms for modeling and understanding complexity in technical systems. In response, scientists in disciplines such as physics, biology, electronics, and economics began to articulate a general theory of systems in which all natural and physical phenomena are manifestations of interrelated elements in a system that has common patterns and properties. Following √âmile Durkheim's call to analyze complex modern society sui generis, post-war structural functionalist sociologists such as Talcott Parsons seized upon these theories of systematic and hierarchical interaction among constituent components to attempt to generate grand unified sociological theories, such as the AGIL paradigm. Sociologists such as George Homans argued that sociological theories should be formalized into hierarchical structures of propositions and precise terminology from which other propositions and hypotheses could be derived and operationalized into empirical studies. Because computer algorithms and programs had been used as early as 1956 to test and validate mathematical theorems, such as the four color theorem, some scholars anticipated that similar computational approaches could \\"solve\\" and \\"prove\\" analogously formalized problems and theorems of social structures and dynamics. =Macrosimulation and microsimulation= By the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists used increasingly available computing technology to perform macro-simulations of control and feedback processes in organizations, industries, cities, and global populations. These models used differential equations to predict population distributions as holistic functions of other systematic factors such as inventory control, urban traffic, migration, and disease transmission. Although simulations of social systems received substantial attention in the mid-1970s after the Club of Rome published reports predicting that policies promoting exponential economic growth would eventually bring global environmental catastrophe, the inconvenient conclusions led many authors to seek to discredit the models, attempting to make the researchers themselves appear unscientific. Hoping to avoid the same fate, many social scientists turned their attention toward micro-simulation models to make forecasts and study policy effects by modeling aggregate changes in state of individual-level entities rather than the changes in distribution at the population level. However, these micro-simulation models did not permit individuals to interact or adapt and were not intended for basic theoretical research. =Cellular automata and agent-based modeling= The 1970s and 1980s were also a time when physicists and mathematicians were attempting to model and analyze how simple component units, such as atoms, give rise to global properties, such as complex material properties at low temperatures, in magnetic materials, and within turbulent flows. Using cellular automata, scientists were able to specify systems consisting of a grid of cells in which each cell only occupied some finite states and changes between states were solely governed by the states of immediate neighbors. Along with advances in artificial intelligence and microcomputer power, these methods contributed to the development of \\"chaos theory\\" and \\"complexity theory\\" which, in turn, renewed interest in understanding complex physical and social systems across disciplinary boundaries. Research organizations explicitly dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complexity were also founded in this era: the Santa Fe Institute was established in 1984 by scientists based at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the BACH group at the University of Michigan likewise started in the mid-1980s. This cellular automata paradigm gave rise to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized bottom- up designs but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior. Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development. In 1981, mathematician and political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton published a major paper in Science titled \\"The Evolution of Cooperation\\" which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a prisoner's dilemma game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest. Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner's previous action were able to develop \\"norms\\" of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation. Throughout the 1990s, scholars like William Sims Bainbridge, Kathleen Carley, Michael Macy, and John Skvoretz developed multi-agent-based models of generalized reciprocity, prejudice, social influence, and organizational information processing. In 1999, Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist and established its most relevant journal: the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation. =Data mining and social network analysis= Independent from developments in computational models of social systems, social network analysis emerged in the 1970s and 1980s from advances in graph theory, statistics, and studies of social structure as a distinct analytical method and was articulated and employed by sociologists like James S. Coleman, Harrison White, Linton Freeman, J. Clyde Mitchell, Mark Granovetter, Ronald Burt, and Barry Wellman. The increasing pervasiveness of computing and telecommunication technologies throughout the 1980s and 1990s demanded analytical techniques, such as network analysis and multilevel modeling, that could scale to increasingly complex and large data sets. The most recent wave of computational sociology, rather than employing simulations, uses network analysis and advanced statistical techniques to analyze large-scale computer databases of electronic proxies for behavioral data. Electronic records such as email and instant message records, hyperlinks on the World Wide Web, mobile phone usage, and discussion on Usenet allow social scientists to directly observe and analyze social behavior at multiple points in time and multiple levels of analysis without the constraints of traditional empirical methods such as interviews, participant observation, or survey instruments. Continued improvements in machine learning algorithms likewise have permitted social scientists and entrepreneurs to use novel techniques to identify latent and meaningful patterns of social interaction and evolution in large electronic datasets. Narrative network of US Elections 2012 The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor- object. =Computational content analysis= Content analysis has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a \\"big data\\" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. Gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents. The analysis of readability, gender bias and topic bias was demonstrated in Flaounas et al. showing how different topics have different gender biases and levels of readability; the possibility to detect mood shifts in a vast population by analysing Twitter content was demonstrated as well. The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has been pioneered by Dzogang et al., which showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers. A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.Seasonal Fluctuations in Collective Mood Revealed by Wikipedia Searches and Twitter Posts F Dzogang, T Lansdall-Welfare, N Cristianini - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, Workshop on Data Mining in Human Activity Analysis Challenges Computational sociology, as with any field of study, faces a set of challenges.Conte, Rosaria, et al. \\"Manifesto of computational social science.\\" The European Physical Journal Special Topics 214.1 (2012): 325-346. These challenges need to be handled meaningfully so as to make the maximum impact on society. =Levels and their interactions= Each society that is formed tends to be in one level or the other and there exists tendencies of interactions between and across these levels. Levels need not only be micro-level or macro-level in nature. There can be intermediate levels in which a society exists say - groups, networks, communities etc. The question however arises as to how to identify these levels and how they come into existence? And once they are in existence how do they interact within themselves and with other levels? If we view entities (agents) as nodes and the connections between them as the edges, we see the formation of networks. The connections in these networks do not come about based on just objective relationships between the entities, rather they are decided upon by factors chosen by the participating entities. The challenge with this process is that, it is difficult to identify when a set of entities will form a network. These networks may be of trust networks, co-operation networks, dependence networks etc. There have been cases where heterogeneous set of entities have shown to form strong and meaningful networks among themselves. As discussed previously, societies fall into levels and in one such level, the individual level, a micro-macro linkBillari, Francesco C. Agent-based computational modelling: applications in demography, social, economic and environmental sciences. Taylor & Francis, 2006. refers to the interactions which create higher-levels. There are a set of questions that needs to be answered regarding these Micro- Macro links. How they are formed? When do they converge? What is the feedback pushed to the lower levels and how are they pushed? Another major challenge in this category concerns the validity of information and their sources. In recent years there has been a boom in information gathering and processing. However, little attention was paid to the spread of false information between the societies. Tracing back the sources and finding ownership of such information is difficult. =Culture modeling= The evolution of the networks and levels in the society brings about cultural diversity. A thought which arises however is that, when people tend to interact and become more accepting of other cultures and beliefs, how is it that diversity still persists? Why is there no convergence? A major challenge is how to model these diversities. Are there external factors like mass media, locality of societies etc. which influence the evolution or persistence of cultural diversities? =Experimentation and evaluation= Any study or modelling when combined with experimentation needs to be able to address the questions being asked. Computational social science deals with large scale data and the challenge becomes much more evident as the scale grows. How would one design informative simulations on a large scale? And even if a large scale simulation is brought up, how is the evaluation supposed to be performed? =Model choice and model complexities= Another challenge is identifying the models that would best fit the data and the complexities of these models. These models would help us predict how societies might evolve over time and provide possible explanations on how things work.Weisberg, Michael. When less is more: Tradeoffs and idealization in model building. Diss. Stanford University, 2003. Generative models Generative models helps us to perform extensive qualitative analysis in a controlled fashion. A model proposed by Epstein, is the agent-based simulation, which talks about identifying an initial set of heterogeneous entities (agents) and observe their evolution and growth based on simple local rules.Epstein, Joshua M. Generative social science: Studies in agent-based computational modeling. Princeton University Press, 2006. But what are these local rules? How does one identify them for a set of heterogeneous agents? Evaluation and impact of these rules state a whole new set of difficulties. Heterogeneous or ensemble models Integrating simple models which perform better on individual tasks to form a Hybrid model is an approach that can be looked into.Yuan, Y., Alabdulkareem, A. & Pentland, A.S. An interpretable approach for social network formation among heterogeneous agents. Nat Commun 9, 4704 (2018). These models can offer better performance and understanding of the data. However the trade-off of identifying and having a deep understanding of the interactions between these simple models arises when one needs to come up with one combined, well performing model. Also, coming up with tools and applications to help analyse and visualize the data based on these hybrid models is another added challenge. Impact Computational sociology can bring impacts to science, technology and society. =Impact on science= In order for the study of computational sociology to be effective, there has to be valuable innovations. These innovation can be of the form of new data analytics tools, better models and algorithms. The advent of such innovation will be a boon for the scientific community in large. =Impact on society= One of the major challenges of computational sociology is the modelling of social processes . Various law and policy makers would be able to see efficient and effective paths to issue new guidelines and the mass in general would be able to evaluate and gain fair understanding of the options presented in front of them enabling an open and well balanced decision process. .

Views =Christian egalitarianism= Fee is a Christian egalitarian and was a contributing editor to the key Christian egalitarian book Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity without hierarchy (2004). His above mentioned commentary consistently translates the generic \\"men\\" as \\"men and women\\" with an explanatory footnote. He is also a member of the board of reference for Christians for Biblical Equality, a group of evangelical Christians who believe the Bible teaches complete equality between men and women and that all Christians, regardless of gender \\"must exercise their God-given gifts with equal authority and equal responsibility in church, home and world\\".Christians for Biblical Equality, Leadership and Our Mission and History , accessed June 4, 2011. =Pentecostal distinctives= Fee is a Pentecostal; nevertheless, he has disagreed with some long held and deeply cherished Pentecostal beliefs. Specifically, he has questioned article 7 of the Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths, which articulates a classical Pentecostal understanding of baptism in the Holy Spirit as subsequent to and separate from Christian conversion. In \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Issue of Separability and Subsequence\\", Fee writes that there is little biblical evidence to prove the traditional Pentecostal doctrinal position.Gordon D Fee. \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Issue of Separability and Subsequence,\\" Pneuma: The Journal of the Society of Pentecostal Studies 7:2 (Fall 1985), p. 88. On the other hand, he maintains that \\"the Pentecostal experience itself can be defended on exegetical grounds as a thoroughly biblical phenomenon\\".Fee (1985), \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\\", 91. Fee believes that in the early church, the Pentecostal experience was an expected part of conversion: Fee believes the Spirit's empowerment is a necessary element in the life of the Church that has too often been neglected.Fee (1985), \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\\", 95-96. It is this neglect, Fee argues, that led early Pentecostals to seek the presence and power of the Spirit in experiences which they identified as baptism in the Holy Spirit.Fee (1985), \\"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\\", 98. =Opposition to prosperity theology= He is a strong opponent of the prosperity gospel and published a 1985 book entitled The Disease of the Health and Wealth Gospels.See his booklet entitled The Disease of the Health and Wealth Gospels, Regent College Publishing, January 1, 1985, .

It began on July 23, 1944 as part of a secret plan to launch the countrywide all-national uprising codenamed Operation Tempest ahead of the Soviet advance on the Eastern Front. The Lw√≥w uprising lasted until July 27. Shortly afterwards, the Polish troops were disarmed, soldiers merged into the Polish communist armed forces and officers arrested by the Soviet NKVD.Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wr√≥bel, Richard J. Kozicki, Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , Google Print, p. 404. Some were forced to join the Red Army, others sent to the Gulag camps. The city itself was occupied by the Soviet Union. Background In late December 1943, the Red Army initiated yet another offensive upon the 1939 territory of Poland. Already on January 4, 1944, the first Soviet units crossed the pre-war Polish border in Volhynia. By the end of March most of Tarnopol Voivodeship lay in their hands, with the Germans preparing to retreat behind the Bug River. Under such circumstances, the Home Army devised a plan of a gradual uprising that was to break out before the advancing Soviets, defeat the withdrawing German troops, and allow the underground Polish authorities to appear in newly liberated areas as their legitimate governors. The plan, code-named Operation Tempest, was put into action. By early July 1944 the local Lw√≥w Home Army division of the Jazlowce Uhlans (U≈Çani Jaz≈Çowieccy) prepared specific orders for all Polish partisan units in the area.Tarnobrzeski Klub Kawaleryjski, Historia 14 Pu≈Çku U≈Çan√≥w Jaz≈Çowieckich (History of the Jazlowce Uhlans). Internet Archive. According to the order of July 5, 1944, the forces of the Home Army within the city were divided onto five districts, each with its own centre of mobilization and different tasks. On July 18, the German civilian authorities and pro-Nazi Ukrainian Auxiliary Police withdrew from the city. The following day, the forces of the Wehrmacht left Lw√≥w, leaving only a token force. This left large parts of the town practically in Polish hands. However, at the same time, several new divisions of the Wehrmacht appeared at the city's outskirts, causing the Polish headquarters to postpone the uprising. It was not until the afternoon of July 21 that the first reconnaissance units of the Red Army arrived to the area. The uprising Soviet 29th Tank Brigade of the 4th Tank Army under Lt. Gen. Lelushenko reached the city's limits on July 22, 1944. At that moment, the Polish Home Army decided to commence the battle against German fortified outposts throughout Lw√≥w. The German forces relocated from the outskirts of the city's and fortified themselves in the city centre. In the early hours of the following day, what started as a series of skirmishes resulted in an outbreak of heavy urban warfare. The first to join the fight was the 14th Home Army Uhlan Regiment of foot, clearing the suburb of ≈Åyczak√≥w and pushing towards the old town along Zielona and ≈Åyczakowska streets. In the western area, the Polish forces outnumbered the Germans and were able to capture the Main Train Station terminal. The southern area was almost abandoned by the Germans and the Polish forces were able to capture the 19th century citadel with large military supplies depots.Jerzy Wƒôgierski (1989), W lwowskiej Armii Krajowej PAX, Warszawa; via Google Books. This success allowed the supply of the Polish troops with badly needed arms. On July 23 the heaviest fighting ensued in the city centre and the northern district, where the Poles were able to capture only the Gas Works, preventing their demolition by the German troops. In the city centre, the partisans were aided by the entire Soviet 10th Tank Corps that was gradually joining the fight. The Soviets advanced in three wedges. One of them aimed at the southern area, already cleared from any German resistance by the Polish units. The two others reinforced the Polish units attacking along the Zielona and ≈Åyczakowska streets. By the end of the day, the last column reached the Old Town Square and the Poles captured the Old Town Market. Afterwards, the civil and military authorities were summoned for a meeting with Red Army commanders and captured by the NKVD with guarantees of safety for all attendees provided. Despite these guarantees, the Soviets arrested some 5000 Polish soldiers who were sent to \\"Miedniki\\" gulag. The remaining forces of col. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Filipkowski were forcibly conscripted to the Red Army, sent to Gulag or escaped to rejoin the underground.

La Trobe was a strong supporter of religious, cultural and educational institutions.In his first speech in Melbourne La Trobe declared: \\"It will not be by individual aggrandisement, by the possession of numerous flocks and herds, or of costly acres, that we shall secure for the country enduring prosperity and happiness, but by the acquisition and maintenance of sound religious and moral institutions, without which no country can become truly great.\\" \\"The C J La Trobe Society - Melbourne Victoria\\". www.latrobesociety.org.au.

La Trobe was the nephew of British architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Early life Charles La Trobe was born in London, the son of Christian Ignatius Latrobe, a leader of the Moravian Church, from a family of French Huguenot descent, whose mother was a member of the Moravian Church born in the United States. He was educated in England and later spent time in Switzerland and was active in mountaineering; he made a number of ascents in the Alps 1824-26\\\\. La Trobe wrote several travel books describing his experiences: The Alpenstock: Or Sketches of Swiss Scenery and Manners (1829) and The Pedestrian: A Summer's Ramble in the Tyrol (1832). In 1832 he visited the United States along with Count Albert Pourtales, and in 1834 travelled from New Orleans to Mexico with Washington Irving. He then wrote The Rambler in North America (1835) and The Rambler in Mexico (1836). On 16 September 1835 he married Sophie de Montmollin (1809-1854) in Berne, Switzerland. Their first child, Agnes Louisa de La Trobe, was born on 2 April 1837 in Switzerland. Lieutenant-governor In 1837 La Trobe was entrusted with a government commission in the West Indies and reported on the future education of the recently emancipated slaves. On 4 February 1839 he was appointed superintendent of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales though he had little managerial and administrative experience. La Trobe sailed into Sydney on 26 July 1839, with his wife and 2-year-old daughter, for training on procedures. The La Trobes went on to Melbourne on 1 October. La Trobe bought 12¬Ω acres of land on the fringe of the city, now called Jolimont, at auction at the upset price of ¬£20 an acre; the residents of Melbourne having agreed among themselves not to bid against the superintendent. Governor of New South Wales George Gipps was disturbed when he heard about it. La Trobe, however, convinced him that he had acted innocently. On the land he erected his home, which has been preserved and is called LaTrobe's Cottage, which he had transported in sections from London. Melbourne had a population of around 3,000 at the time and was rapidly expanding. La Trobe commenced works to improve sanitation and streets. As Port Phillip District was a dependency of New South Wales at the time, all land sales, building plans and officer appointments had to be approved by Gipps, with whom La Trobe had a good personal and working relationship. Pierre de Salis (1837-1916) in 1875. A Separation Association had been formed in 1840 wanting Port Phillip District to become a separate colony. In 1841 La Trobe wrote to Gipps, asking him to visit Melbourne to form his own opinion on the separation question. La Trobe did not actively campaign for separation, content that Earl Grey had included separation in the reorganisation plan for the colonies. La Trobe acted as lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land for four months in 1846‚Äì47. By 1851, Port Phillip district had gained separation from New South Wales, becoming the colony of Victoria, and La Trobe was lieutenant-governor for three years ‚Äì a position he held until 1854. Soon after separation, gold was discovered at several locations in Victoria and La Trobe had to deal with the mass exodus of the population of Melbourne to the gold fields. He was commonly referred to as \\"Charley Joe\\", and by extension, any government officials or policemen were called \\"joes\\".Edward Ellis Morris, Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words, Phrases and Usages La Trobe, who had suffered self-doubt and criticisms due to his inexperience, submitted his resignation in December 1852 but had to wait until a replacement, Charles Hotham, could take his place. After Victoria Towards the end of his governorship, La Trobe's wife Sophie became ill and returned to Europe with their four children. Sophie died on 30 January 1854. On his return to Europe after his term, La Trobe in 1855 married Sophie's sister, Rose Isabelle de Meuron (1821‚Äì1883), a marriage which was illegal in English law as incestuous at the time. (See Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907.) The couple had two daughters (born 1856 and 1859) in Switzerland and moved to England in 1861.Mytree He did not receive any further British government appointments. His eyesight was increasingly deteriorating, and he was completely blind for the last years of his life. He died in 1875. Geelong keys La Trobe is also linked to the discovery of a minor piece of evidence suggesting early European exploration of Australia. In 1847, at Limeburners' Point near Geelong, Victoria, Charles La Trobe, a keen amateur geologist, was examining the shells from a lime kiln when a worker showed him a set of five keys that he claimed to have found, subsequently named the Geelong Keys. La Trobe concluded that, based on their appearance, the keys were dropped onto the beach around 100 to 150 years beforehand (i.e., between 1700 and 1750). In 1977, Kenneth McIntyre hypothesized they were dropped by Portuguese sailors under the command of Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa.McIntyre, K (1977) The Secret Discovery of Australia, Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook, p.249-262 Souvenir Press, Menindie Since the keys have long been lost, their exact origin cannot be verified. However, research by Geologists Edmund Gill and P.F.B.

It is one of the earliest ambient house concept albums, portraying a mythical night-time journey throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast states, beginning in Texas and ending in Louisiana. Chill Out was conceived as a continuous piece of music, with original KLF music interwoven with samples from songs by Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac, Acker Bilk, Van Halen, 808 State and field recordings of Tuvan throat singers. Context =Composition and recording= \\"\\" first appeared on the 1989 single \\"Kylie Said to Jason\\". According to the sleeve notes, Chill Out was recorded \\"live on location\\" at Trancentral, the spiritual home of the KLF\\", their studio in the basement of KLF member Jimmy Cauty's squat in Stockwell, South London. The KLF have stated that the album was recorded in a 44-minute live take. Said Cauty, \\"There's no edits on it. Quite a few times we'd get near the end and make a mistake and so we'd have to go all the way back to the beginning and set it all up again\\". According to Cauty's co-founder of The KLF, Bill Drummond, the album took two days to put together. Record Collector compared The KLF's production method to that of established electronic musicians: \\"While electronic dinosaurs like Jean Michel Jarre and Klaus Schulze were walling themselves in with banks and banks of synthesizers, computers and electronic gadgetry the KLF were doing the opposite‚Äîmaking a crafted work like Chill Out with the bare necessities of musical survival.\\" After recording, the duo thought the sound to be evocative of a trip through the American Deep South. Drummond said \\"I've never been to those places. I don't know what those places are like, but in my head, I can imagine those sounds coming from those places, just looking at the map.\\" The titles of the parts are poetic descriptions‚Äîoften complete sentences‚Äîincorporating statements of time, place and situation along the Gulf Coast journey. Chill Out is a single continuous musical piece having many distinctive sections, each of which either segues into or introduces the next. The album as a whole is a progression, with percussion gradually introduced during the second half. The album has many recurring musical elements, which unify and merge the parts into the collective whole. Common characteristics of most parts include ethereal background synthesizers, the use of echo and pitch bend, samples of nature and transport, and the punctuation of soft synthesizer loops by sudden flourishes of harmonious sound. The Deep South is variously represented using original pedal steel contributions from Graham Lee and emotionally charged samples of US radio broadcasts: an evangelist's sermon, a range of samples of a very intense salesman, and, in \\"\\", the detailed news report of a fatal road accident. Despite the specific US settings, Chill Out is multi-ethnic, its journey taking in pastoral shepherds, Russian broadcasts, Tuvan throat singers (\\"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\\"), exotic birds, and an African-sounding original female vocal from The JAMs' 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) that later became The KLF's \\"Justified and Ancient\\". Elements of The KLF's \\"Pure Trance\\" singles \\"3 a.m. Eternal\\" and \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\" are brought to the fore during the second half of the album, progressing from the minimalist synths of the opening half. Similarly, samples of other artists' work appear as the composition develops, harmonising with The KLF's original instrumentation. =Identified samples= The samples used in Chill Out contribute fundamentally to the character of the composition. In particular, the recurring sampled sound effects of rolling stock and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of Elektra Records' Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2. The tracks used are \\"Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass\\" and \\"Short Freight Train Pass\\", along with processed versions of \\"F18 Diamond Fly-By\\", \\"Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out\\", and \\"Surf\\".Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2, Elektra Records 1987 ( link to audio samples). Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the BBC pips and a jingle from Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1: \\"Rock radio into the nineties and beyond\\". Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s Disappearing World series on Granada TV in the UK. The phrase \\"Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, savage\\" is taken from the 1957 science fiction film The Brain from Planet Arous. The album features samples of distinctive melodies from the musical recordings of other artists: Elvis Presley's 1969 UK No. 2 single \\"In the Ghetto\\", Fleetwood Mac's 1968 UK No. 1 single \\"Albatross\\", as well as \\"Oh Well Part II\\", and Acker Bilk's 1961 US No. 1 single \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" all feature prominently, in each case set to an accompaniment of original music. The composers of these hits receive co- writing credit for \\"Elvis on the Radio Steel Guitar in My Soul\\", \\"3am Somewhere out of Beaumont\\", and \\"A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back\\" respectively, and the performers are thanked in the Chill Out sleevenotes. Boy George's band Jesus Loves You is also thanked for a sample from the single \\"After the Love\\", which features on \\"3am Somewhere out of Beaumont\\". Short samples from the Van Halen instrumental \\"Eruption\\" emerge throughout the song \\"A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back\\". Shortly after the 2:00 mark of \\"The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By\\", a sample from the theme music of The Big Country can be heard as well as Pacific State by 808 State. Reception and legacy Ian Cranna of Q, in a review published at the time of the album's release, described Chill Out as an \\"impressionist soundtrack\\" whose \\"spartan but melodic electronic strains ease gently through wide open spaces\\", and concluded that the album is \\"both imaginative in itself and successful in inducing a blissed out mood of peace and relaxation (at least at night).\\" NME called the album \\"a riot of running water, birdsong and electronic womb music\\". Ian McCann of The Face proposed that if the listener is not under the influence of drugs, the album sounds \\"hopelessly pompous and almost classical.\\" In a 1994 retrospective review, Qs Andrew Collins described The KLF as \\"ahead of their time\\" and added that \\"the fact that Chill Out was seen largely as a urinary extraction exercise at the time when such sound- painting now shapes young careers lends poignancy to its more balmy yet knowing moments.\\" The Times called the album The KLF's \\"comedown classic\\", while John Bush of AllMusic awarded the album five stars and cited it as \\"one of the essential ambient albums\\". In an \\"On Second Thought\\" review in Stylus Magazine, writer Scott Plagenhoef found Chill Out to be \\"less a morning after and more the slow awakening to a new day\\" and an album which \\"slowly unfolds its charms\\". In a 1996 feature, Mixmag named Chill Out the fifth best dance album of all time, citing Jimmy Cauty and Alex Paterson as having \\"kickstarted\\" ambient music with their DJ sets at the \\"seminal\\" house night \\"Land of Oz\\". Dom Philips of Mixmag described Chill Out as \\"a gorgeous patchwork of sound, noise and melody ... the samples are carefully woven into a beautiful spider's web of sound.\\" Ira Robbins of Trouser Press was less favorable in his assessment of Chill Out, likening it to \\"an accidental recording of 1970 Pink Floyd sessions during which all the participants have either left or fallen asleep\\", adding that \\"it's the pleasantly attenuated soundtrack to a non-existent film that is easily forgotten.\\" In 2008, Pitchfork included \\"Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard\\" in The Pitchfork 500, their list of the 500 greatest songs between 1977 and 2006, and later ranked the track at number 80 in their \\"Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s\\" list in 2010. In July 2004, UK performance collective Popdamage \\"reconstructed\\" Chill Out as a live performance at The Big Chill music festival, recreating many of the album's vocal and musical samples live on-stage. Themes The use of a journey as a unifying musical or conceptual thread featured several times in Cauty and Drummond's work, including The White Room, \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\", \\"Justified and Ancient\\" and \\"America: What Time Is Love?\\". Cauty's Space and The Orb's debut album, The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld also employ the journey concept. Sheep, which appear both on the recording of Chill Out - as guest vocalists according to Scott Piering's press release \\\\- and in its sleeve artwork, became a theme of The KLF's output, featuring in the ambient video Waiting, The White Room album artwork, and later ‚Äî in a macabre gesture ‚Äî after their controversial appearance at the 1992 Brit Awards ceremony. Drummond credits the sleeve of Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother as providing inspiration for the artwork of Chill Out. Bill Drummond has documented his affinity for pedal steel and country music, stating that although he has \\"loved all sorts of music, ... country music is the only music [he's] been totally able to identify with\\", and declaring: \\"the weep of a pedal steel guitar is the sound of heartstrings being torn\\".Drummond, B., \\"They Called Me Up in Tennessee\\", 45, (Little & Brown, / Abacus, ), 2000. According to Drummond, the album and album sleeve has \\"the vibe of the rave scene over here [in the UK]. When we're having the big Orbital raves out in the country, and you're dancing all night and then the sun would come up in the morning, and then you'd be surrounded by this English rural countryside ... we wanted something that kind of reflected that, that feeling the day after the rave, that's what we wanted the music for\\".. Personnel The sleeve notes that the album was \\"Composed Compiled and Collated by the KLF\\". Simon Reynolds (1999) and Mark Prendergast (2003) report the uncredited involvement of Alex Paterson, whereas a 1993 piece in i-D - in which Paterson was interviewed - said that Chill Out was a \\"spin-off\\" from the Cauty/Paterson sessions at Trancentral. Reprinted in Track listing The track listing of Chill Out uses the start- and end-points of the parts, instead of the conventional track numbering system, indicating that the album be treated as a single composition. For the original KLF Communications CD release, the entire album was written to one track. #\\"Brownsville Turnaround on the Tex-Mex Border\\" ‚Äì 1:43 #\\"Pulling out of Ricardo and the Dusk Is Falling Fast\\" ‚Äì 1:29 #\\"Six Hours to Louisiana, Black Coffee Going Cold\\" ‚Äì 3:01 #\\"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\\" ‚Äì 2:37 #\\"\\" ‚Äì 7:41 #\\"Justified and Ancient Seems a Long Time Ago\\" ‚Äì 1:09 #\\"Elvis on the Radio, Steel Guitar in My Soul\\" ‚Äì 2:40 #\\"3 a.m. Somewhere out of Beaumont\\" ‚Äì 9:50 #\\"Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard\\" ‚Äì 5:57 #\\"Trancentral Lost in My Mind\\" ‚Äì 0:56 #\\"The Lights of Baton Rouge Pass By\\" ‚Äì 3:26 #\\"A Melody from a Past Life Keeps Pulling Me Back\\" ‚Äì 1:51 #\\"Rock Radio into the Nineties and Beyond\\" ‚Äì 1:27 #\\"Alone Again with the Dawn Coming Up\\" ‚Äì 0:19 Notes References 1990 albums The KLF albums KLF Communications albums Ambient house albums Concept albums Albums produced by The KLF ","title":"Chill Out (KLF album)"},{"id":"984715","text":"Pierce Mason Butler (April 11, 1798August 20, 1847) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the 56th Governor of South Carolina from 1836 to 1838. He was killed while serving as colonel of the Palmetto Regiment at the Battle of Churubusco, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Born in Edgefield County, South Carolina, Butler was a son of William Butler (1759‚Äì1821) and a brother of Andrew Pickens Butler and William Butler, Jr., all of whom served in the United States Congress. He was educated by Moses Waddel at the Willington Academy in Willington, South Carolina. Butler was appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1818 and rose to the rank of captain before resigning his commission in 1829. Following his term as Governor of South Carolina, he became agent to the Cherokee at Fort Gibson (present day Muskogee County, Oklahoma), a post he held until 1846. Following his death in Mexico, Butler's body was returned to South Carolina for burial. He was first entombed at Trinity Episcopal Church, just across from the State House. In December 1853 he was reburied in the Butler Family Cemetery, in the graveyard of what is now Butler Methodist Church in Saluda County. Others buried in the plot are his father, Major General William Butler, his mother, Behethland Foote Moore Butler, a sister, five of his six brothers, Colonel Zachariah Smith Brooks, grandfather of Preston Brooks, and two children of his brother William, the only sibling not buried there. He is buried at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenville. Collectively they were four Colonels, one General, one Lt. Colonel, three Majors, and one Judge and US Senator.

Through a safe human-machine interface, ADAS increase car and road safety. ADAS systems use automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors, and respond accordingly. Most road accidents occur due to human error. Advanced driver-assistance systems are systems developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle systems for safety and better driving. ADAS‚Äôs automated systems are proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error. Safety features are designed to avoid accidents and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems, implementing safeguards, and taking control of the vehicle if necessary. Adaptive features may automate lighting, provide adaptive cruise control, assist in avoiding collisions, incorporate satnav/traffic warnings, alert drivers to possible obstacles, assist in lane departure and lane centering, provide navigational assistance through smartphones, and provide many more features. History and Development Advanced driver assistance systems were first being used around 50 years ago with the adoption of the anti-lock braking system. Early ADAS include electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, blind spot information systems, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and traction control. These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments or damage from a collision. This has led many manufacturers to require automatic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed. The reliance on data that describes the outside environment of the vehicle, compared to internal data, differentiates ADAS from driver-assistance systems (DAS). ADAS relies on inputs from multiple data sources, including automotive imaging, LiDAR, radar, image processing, computer vision, and in-car networking. Additional inputs are possible from other sources separate from the primary vehicle platform, including other vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle or V2V Communication) and infrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure or V2I Communication) . Modern cars have advanced driver-assistance systems integrated into their electronics; manufacturers can add these new features. ADAS are considered real-time systems since they react quickly to multiple inputs and prioritize the incoming information to prevent accidents. The systems use preemptive priority scheduling to organize which task needs to be done first. The incorrect assignment of these priorities is what can cause more harm than good. ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). ADAS can be divided into five levels. In level 0, ADAS cannot control the car and can only provide information for the driver to interpret on their own. Some ADAS that are considered level 0 are: parking sensors, surround-view, traffic sign recognition, lane departure warning, night vision, blind spot information system, rear-cross traffic alert, and forward-collision warning. Level 1 and 2 are very similar in that they both have the driver do most of the decision making. The difference is level 1 can take control over one functionality and level 2 can take control over multiple to aid the driver. ADAS that are considered level 1 are: adaptive cruise control, emergency brake assist, automatic emergency brake assist, lane- keeping, and lane centering. ADAS that are considered level 2 are: highway assist, autonomous obstacle avoidance, and autonomous parking. From level 3 to 5, the amount of control the vehicle has increases; level 5 being where the vehicle is fully autonomous. Some of these systems have not yet been fully embedded in commercial vehicles. For instance, highway chauffeur is a Level 3 system ,and automatic valet parking is a level 4 system, both of which are not in full commercial use yet. Mobileye, an Intel company, has developed a comprehensive suite of ADAS systems that range between passive and active systems. Passive ADAS systems alert drivers of possible dangerous situations to give the driver ample time to respond. Examples of passive ADAS systems include lane departure warning and forward collision warnings, both of which require the driver to take action to avoid a collision. Whereas active ADAS systems may notify the driver of possible dangerous situations, but take action following what was observed. Examples of active ADAS systems include adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist (LKA), both of which take action without the driver's intervention. Advanced driver-assistance systems are among the fastest-growing segments in automotive electronics due to steadily increasing adoption of industry-wide quality and safety standards. Feature examples This list is not a comprehensive list of all of the advanced driver assistance systems. Instead, it provides information on critical examples of ADAS that have progressed and become more commonly available since 2015. *Adaptive cruise control (ACC) ** Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) can maintain a chosen velocity and distance between a vehicle and the vehicle ahead. ACC can automatically brake or accelerate with concern to the distance between the vehicle and the vehicle ahead. ACC systems with stop and go features can come to a complete stop and accelerate back to the specified speed. This system still requires an alert driver to take in their surroundings, as it only controls speed and the distance between you and the car in front of you * Alcohol ignition interlock devices ** Alcohol ignition interlock devices do not allow drivers to start the car if the breath alcohol level is above a pre-described amount. The Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have called for a Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS) program to put alcohol detection devices in all cars. * Anti-lock braking system ** Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) restore traction to a car‚Äôs tires by regulating the brake pressure when the vehicle begins to skid. Alongside helping drivers in emergencies, such as when their car starts to skid on ice, ABS systems can also assist drivers who may lose control of their vehicle. With the growing popularity in the 1990s, ABS systems have become standard in vehicles. * Automatic parking ** Automatic parking fully takes over control of parking functions, including steering, braking, and acceleration, to assist drivers in parking. Depending on the relative cars and obstacles, the vehicle positions itself safely into the available parking spot. Currently, the driver must still be aware of the vehicle‚Äôs surroundings and be willing to take control of it if necessary. * Automotive head-up display ** An automotive head-up display (auto-HUD) safely displays essential system information to a driver at a vantage point that does not require the driver to look down or away from the road. Currently, the majority of the auto-HUD systems on the market display system information on a windshield using LCDs. * Automotive navigation system ** Automotive navigation systems use digital mapping tools, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and traffic message channel (TMC), to provide drivers with up to date traffic and navigation information. Through an embedded receiver, an automotive navigation system can send and receive data signals transmitted from satellites regarding the current position of the vehicle in relation to its surroundings. * Automotive night vision ** Automotive night vision systems enable the vehicle to detect obstacles, including pedestrians, in a nighttime setting or heavy weather situation when the driver has low visibility. These systems can various technologies, including infrared sensors, GPS, Lidar, and Radar, to detect pedestrians and non-human obstacles. * Backup camera ** A vehicle backup camera provides real-time video information regarding the location of your vehicle and its surroundings. This camera offers driver‚Äôs aid when backing up by providing a viewpoint that is typically a blind spot in traditional cars. When the driver puts the car in reverse, the cameras automatically turns on. * Blind spot monitor ** Blind spots are defined as the areas behind or at the side of the vehicle that the driver cannot see from the driver‚Äôs seat. A blind-spot monitor involves cameras that monitor the driver's blind spots and notify the driver if any obstacles come close to the vehicle. Blind-spot monitoring systems typically work in conjunction with emergency braking systems to act accordingly if any obstacles come into the vehicle‚Äôs path. * Collision avoidance system (Pre- crash system) ** A collision avoidance system, or pre-crash system, uses small radar detectors, typically placed near the front of the car, to determine the car‚Äôs vicinity to nearby obstacles and notify the driver of potential car crash situations. These systems can account for any sudden changes to the car‚Äôs environment that may cause a collision. Systems can respond to a possible collision situation with multiple actions, such as sounding an alarm, tensing up passengers‚Äô seat belts, closing a sunroof, and raising reclined seats. * Crosswind stabilization ** Crosswind stabilization helps prevent a vehicle from overturning when strong winds hit its side by analyzing the vehicle‚Äôs yaw rate, steering angle, lateral acceleration, and velocity sensors. This system distributes the wheel load in relation to the velocity and direction of the crosswind. * Cruise control ** A cruise control system can maintain a specific speed pre-determined by the driver. The car will maintain the speed the driver sets until the driver hits the brake pedal, clutch pedal, or disengages the system. Specific cruise control systems can accelerate or decelerate, but require the driver to click a button and notify the car of the goal speed. * Driver drowsiness detection ** Driver drowsiness detection systems aim to prevent collisions due to driver fatigue. The vehicle obtains information, such as facial patterns, steering movement, driving habits, turn signal use, and diving velocity, to determine if the driver‚Äôs activities correspond with drowsy driving. If drowsy driving is suspected, the vehicle will typically sound off a loud alert and may vibrate the driver's seat. * Driver Monitoring System ** Driver monitoring systems is a vehicle safety system designed to monitor the alertness of the driver. These systems use biological and performance measures to assess the driver‚Äôs alertness and ability to conduct safe driving practices. Currently, these systems use infrared sensors and cameras to monitor the driver‚Äôs attentiveness through eye-tracking. If the vehicle detects a possible obstacle, it will notify the driver and if no action is taken, the vehicle may react to the obstacle. * Electric vehicle warning sounds used in hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles ** Electric vehicle warning sounds notify pedestrians and cyclists that a hybrid or plug-in electric vehicle is nearby, typically delivered through a noise, such as a beep or horn. This technology was developed in response to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ruling that issued 50 percent of quiet vehicles must have a device implemented into their systems that sound off when the vehicle travels at speeds less than 18.6 mph by September 2019. * Electronic stability control ** Electronic stability control (ESC) can lesson the speed of the car and activate individual brakes to prevent understeer and oversteer. Understeer occurs when the car‚Äôs front wheels don‚Äôt have enough traction to make the car turn and oversteer occurs when the car turns more than intended, causing the car to spin out. In conjunction with other car safety technologies, such as anti-lock braking and traction control, the ESC can safely help drivers maintain control of the car in unforeseen situations. * Emergency driver assistant ** The emergency driver assistant facilitates emergency counteract measures if the driver falls asleep or does not perform any driving action after a defined length of time. After a specified period of time, if the driver has not interacted with the accelerator, brake, or steering wheel, the car will send audio, visual, and physical signals to the driver. If the driver does not wake up after these signals, the system will stop, safely position the vehicle away from oncoming traffic, and turn on the hazard warning lights. * Forward Collision Warning (FCW) ** Forward Collision Warnings (FCW) monitor the speed of the vehicle and the vehicle in front of it, and the open distance around the vehicle. FCW systems will send an alert to the driver of a possible impending collision if gets too close to the vehicle in front of it . These systems do not take control of the vehicle, as currently, FCW systems only send an alert signal to the driver in the form of an audio alert, visual pop-up display, or other warning alert. * Intersection assistant ** Intersection assistants use two radar sensors in the front bumper and sides of the car to monitor if there are any oncoming cars at intersections, highway exits, or car parks. This system alerts the driver of any upcoming traffic from the vehicle‚Äôs sides and can enact the vehicle‚Äôs emergency braking system to prevent the collision. * Glare-free high beam and pixel light ** Glare-free high beams use Light Emitting Diodes, more commonly known as LEDs, to cut two or more cars from the light distribution. This allows oncoming vehicles coming in the opposite direction not to be affected by the light of the high-beams. In 2010, the VW Touareg introduced the first glare-free high beam headlamp system, which used a mechanical shutter to cut light from hitting specific traffic participants. * Hill descent control ** Hill descent control helps drivers maintain a safe speed when driving down a hill or other decline. These systems are typically enacted if the vehicle moves faster than 15 to 20 mph when driving down. When a change in grade is sensed, hill descent control automates the driver‚Äôs speed to descend down the steep grade safely. This system works by pulsing the braking system and controlling each wheel independently to maintain traction down the descent. * Hill-Start Assist ** Hill-Start Assist, also commonly known as hill-start control or hill holder, helps prevent a vehicle from rolling backward down a hill when starting again from a stopped position. This feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal and the gas pedal. For manual cars, this feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal, the clutch, and the gas pedal. * Intelligent speed adaptation or intelligent speed advice (ISA) ** Intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) assists drivers with compliance to the speed limit. They take in information of the vehicle‚Äôs position and notify the driver when he/she is not enforcing the speed limit. Some ISA systems allow the vehicle to adjust its speed to adhere to the relative speed limit. Other ISA systems only warn the driver when he/she is going over the speed limit and leave it up to the driver to enforce the speed limit or not. * Lane centering ** A lane- centering system assists the driver in keeping the vehicle centered in a lane. A lane-centering system may autonomously take over the steering when it determines the driver is at risk of deterring from the lane. This system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to stay within a safe distance between both sides of the lane. * Lane departure warning system (LDW) ** A lane departure warning system (LDW) alerts the driver when they partially merge into a lane without using their turn signals. An LDW system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to determine if the driver unintentionally begins to drift. This system does not take control of the vehicle to help sway the car back into the safety zone but insted sends an audio or visual alert to the driver. * Lane change assistance ** Lane change assistance helps the driver through a safe completion of a lane change by using sensors to scan the vehicle‚Äôs surroundings and monitor the driver‚Äôs blind spots. When a driver intends to make a lane change, the vehicle will notify the driver through an audio or visual alert when a vehicle is approaching from behind or is in the vehicle‚Äôs blind spot. The visual alert may appear in the dashboard, heads-up-display, or the exterior rear-view mirrors. * Parking sensor ** Parking sensors can scan the vehicle‚Äôs surroundings for objects when the driver initiates parking. Audio warnings can notify the driver of the distance between the vehicle and its surrounding objects. Typically, the faster the audio warnings are issued, the closer the vehicle is getting to the object. These sensors may not detect objects closer to the ground, such as parking stops, which is why parking sensors typically work alongside backup cameras to assist the driver when reversing into a parking spot. * Pedestrian protection system ** Pedestrian protection systems are designed to minimize the number of accidents or injuries that occur between a vehicle and a pedestrian. This system uses cameras and sensors to determine when the front of a vehicle strikes a pedestrian. When the collision occurs, the vehicle‚Äôs bonnet lifts to provide a cushion between the vehicle‚Äôs hard engine components and the pedestrian. This helps minimize the possibility of a severe head injury when the pedestrian‚Äôs head comes into contact with the vehicle. * Rain sensor ** A vehicular rain sensor is a water-sensitive sensor that automatically triggers electrical actions, such as the raising of open windows and the closing of open convertible tops. This rain sensor can also take in the frequency of rain droplets that are detected to automatically trigger windshield wipers with an accurate speed for the corresponding rainfall. * Omniview technology ** Omniview technology improves a driver‚Äôs visibility by offering a 360-degree viewing system. This system can accurately provide 3D peripheral images of the car‚Äôs surroundings through video display outputted to the driver. Currently, commercial systems can only provide 2D images of the driver‚Äôs surroundings. Omniview technology uses the input of four cameras and a bird‚Äôs eye technology to provide a composite 3D model of the surroundings. * Tire Pressure Monitoring ** Tire pressure monitoring systems monitor the air pressure of tires to determine when the tire pressure is outside the normal inflation pressure range. The driver can monitor the tire pressure and is notified when there is a sudden drop through a pictogram display, gauge, or low-pressure warning signal. * Traction control system ** A traction control system (TCS) helps prevent traction loss in vehicles and prevent vehicle turnover on sharp curves and turns. By limiting tire slip, or when the force on a tire exceeds the tire‚Äôs traction, this limits power delivery and helps the driver accelerate the car without losing control. These systems use the same wheel- speed sensors as the antilock braking systems. Individual wheel braking systems are deployed through TCS to control when one tire spins faster than the others. * Traffic sign recognition ** Traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems can recognize common traffic signs, such as a ‚Äústop‚Äù sign or a ‚Äúturn ahead‚Äù sign, through image processing techniques. This system takes into account the sign‚Äôs shape, such as hexagons and rectangles, and the color to classify what the sign is communicating to the driver. Since most systems currently use camera-based technology, a wide variety of factors can make the system less accurate. These include poor lighting conditions, extreme weather conditions, and partial obstruction of the sign. * Vehicular communication systems ** Vehicular communication systems come in three forms: Vehicle-to- Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). V2V systems allow vehicles to exchange information with each other about their current position and upcoming hazards. V2I systems occur when the vehicle exchanges information with nearby infrastructure elements, such as street signs. V2X systems occur when the vehicle monitors its environment and takes in information about possible obstacles or pedestrians in its path. * Vibrating Seat Warnings ** GM‚Äôs Cadillacs have offered vibrating seat warnings, since the 2013 Cadillac ATS. If the driver begins drifting out of the traveling lane of a highway, the seat vibrates in the direction of the drift, warning the driver of danger. The Safety Alert Seat also provides a vibrating pulse on both sides of the seat when a frontal threat is detected. * Wrong-way driving warning ** Wrong-way driving warnings issue alerts to drivers when it is detected that they are on the wrong side of the road. Vehicles with this system enacted can use sensors and cameras to identify the direction of oncoming traffic flow. In conjunction with lane detection services, this system can also notify drivers when they partially merge into the wrong side of the road Need of standardization According to PACTS, lack of full standardization might make one system difficultly understandable by the driver who might believe that the car behave like another car while it does not.https://www.pacts.org.uk/2019/09/pacts-launches-new-report-what-does- my-car-do/ https://www.pacts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/What-does-my-car- do-2.1_.pdf ADAS might have many limitations, for instance a Pre-Collision System might have 12 pages to explain 23 exceptions where ADAS may operate when not needed and 30 exceptions where ADAS may not operate when a collision is likely.https://www.pacts.org.uk/2019/09/pacts-launches-new-report-what- does-my-car-do/ https://www.pacts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/What-does-my-car- do-2.1_.pdf Names for ADAS features are not standardized. For instance, Adaptive Cruise Control is called Adaptive Cruise Control by Fiat, Ford, GM, VW, Volvo and Peugeot, but Intelligent Cruise Control by Nissan, Active Cruise Control by Citroen and BMW, and DISTRONIC by Mercedes.https://www.pacts.org.uk/2019/09/pacts-launches-new-report-what-does- my-car-do/ https://www.pacts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/What-does-my-car- do-2.1_.pdf To help with standardization, SAE International has endorsed a series of recommendations for generic ADAS terminology for car manufacturers, that it created with Consumer Reports, the American Automobile Association, J.D. Power, and the National Safety Council. Buttons and dashboard symbols might change from car to car due to lack of standardization.https://www.pacts.org.uk/2019/09/pacts-launches-new-report- what-does-my-car-do/ https://www.pacts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/What-does-my- car-do-2.1_.pdf ADAS behavior might change from car to car, for instance ACC speed might be temporarily overridden in most cars, while some switch to standby after one minute.https://www.pacts.org.uk/2019/09/pacts-launches-new- report-what-does-my-car-do/ https://www.pacts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/What- does-my-car-do-2.1_.pdf  Insurance and Economic Impact  The AV industry is growing exponentially, and according to a report by Market Research Future, the market is expected to hit over $65 billion by 2027. AV insurance and rising competition are expected to fuel that growth. Auto insurance for advanced driver assistance systems has directly affected the global economy, and many questions have arisen within the general public. ADAS allows autonomous vehicles to enable self-driving features, but there are associated risks with ADAS. AV companies and manufacturers are recommended to have insurance in the following areas in order to avoid any serious litigations. Depending on the level, ranging from 0 to 5, each car manufacturer would find it in its best interest to find the right combination of different insurances to best match their products. Note that this list is not exhaustive and may be constantly updated with more types of insurances and risks in the years to come. * Technology errors and omissions ‚Äì This insurance will cover any physical risk if the technology itself has failed. These usually include all of the associated expenses of a car accident. * Auto liability and physical damage ‚Äì This insurance covers third-party injuries and technology damage. * Cyber liability ‚Äì This insurance will protect companies from any lawsuits from third parties and penalties from regulators regarding cybersecurity. * Directors and officers ‚Äì This insurance protects a company‚Äôs balance sheet and assets by protecting the company from bad management or misappropriation of assets. With the technology embedded in autonomous vehicles, these self- driving cars are able to distribute data if a car accident occurs. This, in turn, will invigorate the claims administration and their operations. Fraud reduction will also disable any fraudulent staging of car accidents by recording the car‚Äôs monitoring of every minute on the road. ADAS is expected to streamline the insurance industry and its economic efficiency with capable technology to fight off fraudulent human behavior. In September 2016, the NHTSA published the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, which describes the U.S. Department of Transportation's policies related to highly automated vehicles (HAV) which range from vehicles with advanced driver-assistance systems features to autonomous vehicles.  Ethical Issues and Current Solutions  In March 2014, the US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it will require all new vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) to have rear view cameras by May 2018. The rule was required by Congress as part of the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007. The Act is named after two-year-old Cameron Gulbransen. Cameron‚Äôs father backed up his SUV over him, when he did not see the toddler in the family‚Äôs driveway The advancement of autonomous driving is accompanied by ethical concerns. The earliest moral issue associated with autonomous driving can be dated back to as early as the age of the trolleys. The trolley problem is one of the most well-known ethical issues. Introduced by English philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967, the trolley problem asks that under a situation which the trolley‚Äôs brake does not work, and there are five people ahead of the trolley, the driver may go straight, killing the five persons ahead, or turn to the side track killing the one pedestrian, what should the driver do ? Before the development of autonomous vehicles, the trolley problem remains an ethical dilemma between utilitarianism and deontological ethics. However, as the advancement in ADAS proceeds, the trolley problem becomes an issue that needs to be addressed by the programming of self-driving cars. The accidents that autonomous vehicles might face could be very similar to those depicted in the trolley problem. Although ADAS systems make vehicles generally safer than only human-driven cars, accidents are unavoidable. This raises questions such as ‚Äúwhose lives should be prioritized in the event of an inevitable accident?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat should be the universal principle for these ‚Äòaccident-algorithms‚Äô?‚Äù Many researchers have been working on ways to address the ethical concerns associated with ADAS systems. For instance, the artificial intelligence approach allows computers to learn human ethics by feeding them data regarding human actions. Such a method is useful when the rules cannot be articulated because the computer can learn and identify the ethical elements on its own without precisely programming whether an action is ethical. However, there are limitations to this approach. For example, many human actions are done out of self- preservation instincts, which is realistic but not ethical; feeding such data to the computer cannot guarantee that the computer captures the ideal behavior. Furthermore, the data fed to an artificial intelligence must be carefully selected to avoid producing undesired outcomes. Another notable method is a three-phase approach proposed by Noah J. Goodall. This approach first necessitates a system established with the agreement of car manufacturers, transportation engineers, lawyers, and ethicists, and should be set transparently. The second phase is letting artificial intelligence learn human ethics while being bound by the system established in phase one. Lastly, the system should provide constant feedback that is understandable by humans.  Future  Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) highly resemble advanced driver-assistance systems, but experts believe that ITS goes beyond automatic traffic to include any enterprise that safely transports humans. ITS is where the transportation technology is integrated with a city‚Äôs infrastructure. This would then lead to a ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù. These systems promote active safety by increasing the efficiency of roads, possibly by adding 22.5% capacity on average, not the actual count. Advanced driver-assistance systems have aided in this increase in active safety, according to a study in 2008. ITS systems use a wide system of communication technology, including wireless technology and traditional technology, to enhance productivity.

Claude Antoine Jean Georges Napol√©on Coste (27 June 1805 ‚Äì 14 January 1883) was a French classical guitarist and composer. Biography Napol√©on Coste was born in Amondans (Doubs), near Besan√ßon, France. He was first taught the guitar by his mother, an accomplished player. As a teenager he became a teacher of the instrument and appeared in three concerts in the Franche-Comt√©. In 1829, at the age of 24, he moved to Paris where he studied under Fernando Sor and quickly established himself as the leading French virtuoso guitarist [source: Ari van Vliet: Napol√©on Coste, Biography, 2016] However, the demand for guitarists was in decline and, though his brilliance provided financial stability, he published many of his works by himself, which was customary at the time, apart from finding publishers for his music. As such, he had to fund his publications himself. Napol√©on Coste was influenced by the Early Classical-Romantic composers of the time including Hector Berlioz. Coste's Opus no.47, La Source du Lyson is inspired by nature much like Berlioz's program music.http://www.maestros-of-the- guitar.com/napoleoncoste.html Coste injured his left shoulder in 1863 as a result of an accident, which didn't bring his performing career to a premature end because he performed in public until 1881. After Sor's death, Coste edited and republished Sor's original method for guitar as M√©thode compl√®te pour la Guitare par Ferdinand Sor, r√©dig√©e et augment√©e [refingered and expanded] de nombreux exemples et le√ßons par N. Coste. Coste was a member of the masonic lodge Les Fr√®res Unis Ins√©parables.Les Fr√®res Unis Ins√©parables, Coste, Guitare He had a special fondness for playing on a seven string guitar. He is known as one of the first composers to transcribe guitar music of the 17th century into modern musical notation. He died at age 77, leaving a significant catalogue of original compositions. Napoleon Coste was famous for his unique seven string guitar with a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù 7th string typically tuned to D or C called the Lac√¥te Heptachord. Tonally this invention created more depth when played as the floating string would vibrate sympathetically even as the other strings were plucked.http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/multibass.htm List of works =Works published with opus numbers= *Op. 2: Variations et Finale... sur un motif favori de la Famille Suisse de Weigl (\\"Variations and Finale ... on a favorite theme of the Swiss Family Weigl\\") *Op. 3: 2 Quadrilles de contredanses (\\"2 Contredance Quadrilles\\") *Op. 4: Fantasie ... compos√©e sur un motif du 'Ballet d'Armide' (\\"Fantasy ...

Neuropeptides often coexist with each other or with other neurotransmitters in single neurons. According to their chemical nature, coexisting messengers are localized to different cell compartments: neuropeptides are packaged in large granular vesicles (LGVs), whereas low-molecular weight neurotransmitters are stored in small synaptic vesicles. Neuropeptides conjugated to proteins or other carriers, such as liposomes, may be used for targeting radioisotopes or drugs to cells, specialized endothelia, and normal or neoplastic tissues expressing the corresponding binding sites for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.  Mechanism and Synthesis  Neuropeptides are synthesized from large, inactive precursor proteins called prepropeptides, which are cleaved into several active peptides. Prepropeptides often produce multiple copies of the same peptide or many different peptides. The number of repeats of a peptide sequence often changed throughout evolution and served as a hotbed for genetic variation. Peptides are synthesized at the soma, entered into the secretory pathway to pass through the rER-Golgi complex, further processed, then packaged into large dense-core vesicles for transport down the axon or dendrites. The large dense-core vesicles are often found in all parts of a neuron, including the soma, dendrites, axonal swellings (varicosities) and nerve endings, whereas the small synaptic vesicles are mainly found in clusters at presynaptic locations. Release of the large vesicles and the small vesicles is regulated differently. Neuropeptides are released in a calcium- dependent manner to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). Large dense core vesicles release low volumes of neuropeptide compared to synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitters. Neuropeptides are not immediately reuptaken, degraded or recycled and thus are bioactive for long periods of time. Peptidergic expression in the brain can be highly selective and specific. In Drosophila larvae for example, eclosion hormone is expressed in just two neurons and SIFamide is expressed in four. In contrast to its selective expression, peptidergic activity can be broad and long-lasting. Neuropeptides are often co-released with other peptides and traditional neurotransmitters. For example, vasoactive intestinal peptide is typically co-released with acetylcholine. In contrast to its selective expression, peptide action can be broad and diverse. Peptides bind to GPCRs to induce signaling cascades that alter cellular and synaptic activity. There is also tissue-specific processing of neuropeptide precursors. Different tissues have tailored post-translational processing steps which yield structurally and functionally different peptides. Peptides can affect gene expression, local blood flow, synaptogenesis and glial cell morphology.  Receptor Targets  Most neuropeptides act on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Neuropeptide-GPCRs fall into two families: rhodopsin-like and the secretin class. Most peptides activate a single GPCR, while some activate multiple GPCRs (e.g. AstA, AstC, DTK). Peptide-GPCR binding relationships are highly conserved across animals. Aside from conserved structural relationships, some peptide-GPCR functions are also conserved across the animal kingdom. For example, neuropeptide F/neuropeptide Y signaling is structurally and functionally conserved between insects and mammals. Although peptides mostly target metabotropic receptors, there is some evidence that neuropeptides bind to other receptor targets. Peptide-gated ion channels (FMRFamide-gated sodium channels) have been found in snails and Hydra. Other examples of non-GPCR targets include: insulin-like peptides and tyrosine- kinase receptors in Drosophila and atrial natriuretic peptide and eclosion hormone with membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase receptors in mammals and insects.  Examples  Many populations of neurons have distinctive biochemical phenotypes. For example, in one subpopulation of about 3000 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, three anorectic peptides are co- expressed: Œ±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Œ±-MSH), galanin-like peptide, and cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and in another subpopulation two orexigenic peptides are co-expressed, neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (AGRP). These are not the only peptides in the arcuate nucleus; Œ≤-endorphin, dynorphin, enkephalin, galanin, ghrelin, growth-hormone releasing hormone, neurotensin, neuromedin U, and somatostatin are also expressed in subpopulations of arcuate neurons. These peptides are all released centrally and act on other neurons at specific receptors. The neuropeptide Y neurons also make the classical inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Invertebrates also have many neuropeptides. CCAP has several functions including regulating heart rate, allatostatin and proctolin regulate food intake and growth, bursicon controls tanning of the cuticle and corazonin has a role in cuticle pigmentation and moulting. Peptide signals play a role in information processing that is different from that of conventional neurotransmitters, and many appear to be particularly associated with specific behaviours. For example, oxytocin and vasopressin have striking and specific effects on social behaviours, including maternal behaviour and pair bonding. The following is a list of neuroactive peptides coexisting with other neurotransmitters. Transmitter names are shown in bold. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline). In neurons of the A2 cell group in the nucleus of the solitary tract), norepinephrine co-exists with: * Galanin * Enkephalin * Neuropeptide Y GABA * Somatostatin (in the hippocampus) * Cholecystokinin * Neuropeptide Y (in the arcuate nucleus) Acetylcholine * VIP * Substance P Dopamine * Cholecystokinin * Neurotensin * Glucagon-like peptide-1 (in the nucleus accumbens) Epinephrine (adrenaline) * Neuropeptide Y * Neurotensin Serotonin (5-HT) * Substance P * TRH * Enkephalin Some neurons make several different peptides. For instance, Vasopressin co-exists with dynorphin and galanin in magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and with CRF (in parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus) Oxytocin in the supraoptic nucleus co-exists with enkephalin, dynorphin, cocaine-and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) and cholecystokinin.

His friends called him Shimi Lovat, an anglicised version of his name in the Scottish Gaelic language. His clan referred to him as MacShimidh, his Gaelic patronym, meaning Son of Simon. Simon is the favoured family name for the Chiefs of Clan Fraser. While the 15th Lord de jure, he was the 17th Lord Lovat de facto, but for the attainder of his Jacobite ancestor who was executed in 1747. He was also 4th Baron Lovat in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Early life Fraser was the son of the 14th Lord Lovat (commonly known as the 16th Lord), and Laura, daughter of Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale. After being educated at Ampleforth College (where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps) and Magdalen College, Oxford University, where he joined the University's Cavalry Squadron, Fraser was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Lovat Scouts (a Territorial Army unit) in 1930. He transferred to the regular army, while still a second lieutenant joining the Scots Guards in 1931. The following year, Fraser succeeded his father to become the 15th Lord Lovat (referred to as the 17th Lord Lovat) and 25th Chief of the Clan Fraser. He was promoted lieutenant in August 1934. Lovat resigned his regular commission as a lieutenant in 1937, transferring to the Supplementary Reserve of Officers. He married Rosamond Broughton (1917-2012), the daughter of Sir Henry John Delves Broughton, on 10 October 1938, with whom he had six children.\\"Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, 15th Baron Lovat\\" The Peerage 21 August 2010 Lord and Lady Lovat lived at Beaufort Castle at Beauly, Inverness-shire. World War II In June 1939, just months before the Second World War, Lord Lovat also resigned his reserve commission. In July, however, as war approached, he was mobilized as a captain in the Lovat Scouts. The following year, he volunteered to join one of the new commando units being formed by the British Army, and was eventually attached to No. 4 Commando. On 3 March 1941, Nos 3 and 4 Commando launched a raid on the German-occupied Lofoten Islands. In the successful raid, the commandos destroyed fish-oil factories, petrol dumps, and 11 ships. They also seized encryption equipment and codebooks. As well, the commandos captured 216 German troops; 315 Norwegians chose to accompany the commandos back to Britain. As a temporary major, Lord Lovat commanded 100 men of No. 4 Commando and a 50-man detachment from the Canadian Carleton and York Regiment in a raid on the French coastal village of Hardelot in April. For this action he was awarded the Military Cross on 7 July 1942. Lord Lovat became an acting lieutenant-colonel in 1942 and was appointed the commanding officer of No. 4 Commando, leading them in a successful component of the abortive Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August. His commando attacked and destroyed a battery of six 150 mm guns. Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Dieppe Raid 1942, plaque at Sainte- Marguerite-sur-Mer The raid as a whole was a disastrous failure with over 4,000 casualties sustained, predominantly Canadian. Yet No. 4 Commando executed its assault, with most men returning safely to Britain. Queen Red Beach, Sword Area. Lord Lovat, on the right of the column, wades through the water. The figure in the foreground is Piper Bill Millin. Lord Lovat eventually became a brigadier and became the commander of the newly formed 1st Special Service Brigade in 1944. Lord Lovat's brigade was landed at Sword during the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Lord Lovat reputedly waded ashore wearing a white jumper under his battledress, with \\"Lovat\\" inscribed into the collar, while armed with a .45-70 Winchester underlever rifle. (The latter claim has not been verified and is disputed; however, in some earlier pictures y/1942 he is seen with a bolt-action .30-06 Winchester M70 sporting rifle). However, in his memoirs, Lovat states that he was armed with a \\"short barreled U.S. Army carbine\\" (presumably an M1 Carbine) on D-Day.https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2014/6/6/the-most-famous- rifle-of-d-day-wasn-t- there/http://www.pegasusarchive.org/normandy/lord_lovat.htm Lord Lovat instructed his personal piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos ashore, in defiance of specific orders not to allow such an action in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: ‚ÄúAh, but that‚Äôs the English War Office. You and I are both Scottish, and that doesn‚Äôt apply.‚Äù Lovat's forces swiftly pressed on, Lovat himself advancing with parts of his brigade from Sword to Pegasus Bridge, which had been defiantly defended by men of the 2nd Bn the Ox & Bucks Light Infantry (6th Airborne Division) who had landed in the early hours by glider. Lord Lovat's commandos arrived at a little past 1 p.m. at Pegasus Bridge though the rendezvous time as per the plan was noon. It is a common misconception that they reached almost exactly on time, late by only two and a half minutes. Upon reaching the rendezvous, Lord Lovat apologised to Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Pine-Coffin, of 7th Parachute Battalion. He went on to establish defensive positions around Ranville, east of the River Orne. The bridges were relieved later in the day by elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division. During the Battle of Breville on 12 June, Lord Lovat was seriously wounded whilst observing an artillery bombardment by the 51st Highland Division. A stray shell fell short of its target and landed amongst the officers, killing Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Johnston, commanding officer of the 12th Parachute Battalion, also seriously wounding Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade. By a grateful French Fourth Republic, he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre.Burke's Peerage (2003), p.2415 Later life Lord Lovat was a stalwart of the Inverness highlands aristocracy. In 1942 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the county, and two years later a JP.Burke's Peerage (2003), vol.2, p.2415 Lord Lovat made a full recovery from the severe wounds he had received in France but was unable to return to the army (he transferred to the reserve in 1949). Winston Churchill requested that he become Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in the House of Lords; however, Lord Lovat declined the offer and in 1945 joined the Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, \\"becoming responsible for the functions of the Ministry of Economic Warfare when these were taken over by the Foreign Office\\", resigning upon Winston Churchill's election defeat. In 1946 he was made a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John. His formal retirement from the army came on 16 June 1962, he retained the honorary rank of brigadier. Lord Lovat's involvement in politics continued throughout his life, in the House of Lords and the Inverness County Council for the next forty-two years. He also devoted much of his time to the family estates of 250,000 acres in the highlands. He was chieftain of Lovat Shinty Club, the local shinty team which bears his family name. Lord Lovat experienced a great deal of turmoil in his final years; he suffered financial ruin and two of his sons predeceased him in accidents within months of each other. In 1994, a year before his death, the family's traditional residence, Beaufort Castle, was sold. Piper Bill Millin, Lord Lovat's personal piper who had piped the Commandos ashore on D-Day, played at Lord Lovat's funeral.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/piper-bill-millin-the- mad-piper-who-piped-the-allied-troops-ashore-on-d-day-2059271.html Media The Longest Day, a 1962 film based on the book of the same name, features \\"Lord Lovat\\", played by Peter Lawford. There is some suggestion that the charlatan commando character \\"Trimmer\\" in Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy of novels is based on Lovat. Lovat was closely associated with Evelyn Waugh's forced resignation from the Commandos, which is the subject of an exchange of correspondence between them which Waugh pasted into his war diaries. In an article in Standpoint magazine, Paul Johnson wrote: \\"...by vindictive cunning of a high order, [Waugh] manages to foist the ultra- plebeian Trimmer on the exquisite person of Brigadier Lord Lovat, head of the clan Fraser, who had his own family regiment and was known from his looks as \\"the upper-class Erroll Flynn\\". \\"Shimi\\" Lovat committed the unforgivable sin of ejecting Waugh from the Commandos since, he told me, \\"he had made himself so hated by his men they would have shot him in the back as soon as they went into action.\\" So Waugh made Lovat into Trimmer. Once, when I happened to say a word in praise of Waugh, \\"Shimi\\" let forth a scream of rage and pain: \\"Do you realise, thanks to that monster, I am Trimmer?\\"\\" Family Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, Master of Lovat and 15th Lord Lovat (9 July 1911 ‚Äì16 March 1995), was the son and eldest child of Simon Joseph Fraser, 14th Baron Lovat (25 November 1871 ‚Äì18 February 1933), and the Hon.

NPY has been identified as the most abundant peptide present in the mammalian central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord. It is secreted alongside other neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate. In the autonomic system it is produced mainly by neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and serves as a strong vasoconstrictor and also causes growth of fat tissue. In the brain, it is produced in various locations including the hypothalamus, and is thought to have several functions, including: increasing food intake and storage of energy as fat, reducing anxiety and stress, reducing pain perception, affecting the circadian rhythm, reducing voluntary alcohol intake, lowering blood pressure, and controlling epileptic seizures.  Function  Neuropeptide Y has been identified as being synthesized in GABAergic neurons and to act as a neurotransmitter during cellular communication. Neuropeptide Y is majorly expressed in interneurons. NPY exerts most of its effects through G-protein coupled receptor proteins, mainly Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y6. All receptors have been indicated as participants in post-synaptic transmission activity, but the Y2 receptor has also been found to be involved in pre-synaptic processing. The receptor protein that NPY operates on is a G protein-coupled receptor in the rhodopsin like 7-transmembrane GPCR family. Five subtypes of the NPY receptor have been identified in mammals, four of which are functional in humans. Subtypes Y1 and Y5 have known roles in the stimulation of feeding while Y2 and Y4 seem to have roles in appetite inhibition (satiety). Some of these receptors are among the most highly conserved neuropeptide receptors[Reference?]. High concentrations of neuropeptide Y synthesis and action have been found in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, specifically in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dentate gyrus. The arcuate nucleus has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of NPY. This allows NPY to regulate neuroendocrine release of various hypothalamic hormones such as luteinizing hormone. Neuropeptide Y1 receptors have been found in highest density in the dentate gyrus along with a variety of other brain areas. = Cell growth = Neuropeptide Y has been indicated as playing an important role in neurogenesis in various parts of the brain. Two particular brain areas where NPY affects neurogenesis are the sub-ventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These areas are where cell growth and proliferation occur into adulthood.  Dentate gyrus  The dentate gyrus is significantly involved in cell proliferation, a process modulated by various internal factors including neuropeptide Y. Reduction or elimination of NPY released by interneurons decreased cell growth in this brain area. NPY affects neurogenesis by interacting with ERK kinase signaling pathways. Additionally, NPY acting on and stimulating Y1 receptors present on progenitor cell membranes in order to increase cell proliferation.  Sub-ventricular zone  Similar to the dentate gyrus, NPY has been found to increase cellular proliferation and differentiation in the sub-ventricular zone by specifically activating Y1 receptors in the ERK1/2 pathway. Additionally, NPY was found in neuronal fibers that pass through the sub-ventricular zone and extend to other brain areas. A variety of other effects and physiological processes involving NPY in the sub-ventricular zone have been discovered, many of which involve neuron migration patterns.  Olfactory bulb  It was found that after blocking NPY expression in mouse olfactory epithelium, the amount of olfactory precursor cells decreased by half. This in turn caused the mice to develop a lower amount of olfactory cells overall. This study exemplified NPY's influence on precursor cells. Discovery Following the isolation of neuropeptide-y (NPY) from the porcine hypothalamus in 1982, researchers began to speculate about the involvement of NPY in hypothalamic-mediated functions. In a 1983 study, NPY-ergic axon terminals were located in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and the highest levels of NPY immunoreactivity was found within the PVN of the hypothalamus. Six years later, in 1989, Morris et al. homed in on the location of NPYergic nuclei in the brain. Furthermore, in situ hybridization results from the study showed the highest cellular levels of NPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. In 1989, Haas & George reported that local injection of NPY into the PVN resulted in an acute release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the rat brain, proving that NPYergic activity directly stimulates the release and synthesis of CRH. The latter became a hallmark paper in NPY studies. A significant amount of work had already been done in the 1970s on CRH and its involvement in stress and eating disorders such as obesity. These studies, collectively, marked the beginning for understanding the role of NPY in orexigenesis or food intake. Connection to food intake Behavioral assays in orexigenic studies, in which rats are the model organism, have been done collectively with immunoassays and in situ hybridization studies to confirm that elevating NPY-ergic activity does indeed increase food intake. In these studies, exogenous NPY, an NPY agonist such as dexamethasone or N-acetyl [Leu 28, Leu31] NPY (24-36) are injected into the third ventricle or at the level of the hypothalamus with a cannula. Furthermore, these studies unanimously demonstrate that the stimulation of NPYergic activity via the administration of certain NPY agonists increases food intake compared to baseline data in rats. The effects of NPYergic activity on food intake is also demonstrated by the blockade of certain NPY receptors (Y1 and Y5 receptors), which, as was expected, inhibited NPYergic activity; thus, decreases food intake. However, a 1999 study by King et al. demonstrated the effects of the activation of the NPY autoreceptor Y2, which has been shown to inhibit the release of NPY and thus acts to regulate food intake upon its activation. In this study a highly selective Y2 antagonist, BIIE0246 was administered locally into the ARC. Radioimmunoassay data, following the injection of BIIE0246, shows a significant increase in NPY release compared to the control group. Though the pharmacological half-life of exogenous NPY, other agonists, and antagonist is still obscure, the effects are not long lasting and the rat body employs an excellent ability to regulate and normalize abnormal NPY levels and therefore food consumption. neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most potent appetite-regulating neuropeptides and stimulates food intake behavior when injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). NPY not only increases total food intake but also seems to be associated with increased carbohydrate selection. Connection to obesity A study in genetically obese rats to demonstrated the role of NPY in eating disorders such as obesity. Four underlying factors that contribute to obesity in rats are: * an increase in glucocorticosteroid concentrations in plasma; * insensitivity or resistance to insulin; * mutation of leptin receptor; and * an increase in NPY mRNA and NPY release. In obesity chronically elevated levels of NPY can be seen, this has been seen in rats fed on a high fat diet for 22 weeks and resulted in a hormonal derangement that increased NPY release, due to a defective leptin signal compared to control rats. In humans increased levels of free NPY were found in obese women and not in their leaner counterparts, analysing human hypothalamus' for NYP concentration however is more difficult than rats. During weaning in rats there is an early expression of gene mutations that increase hypothalamic release of NPY in rats, however in humans multiple genes are commonly associated with the results of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In most obesity cases the increased secretion of NPY is a central / hypothalamic resistance to energy excess hormone signals such as leptin, that can be a result of a variety of reasons in the CNS. In rodents resistant to obesity when fed on an obesogenic diet they had a significantly lower amount of NPY receptor in the hypothalamus suggesting an increased activity of NPY neurons in obese rats meaning that the reduction in the release of NPY may be beneficial to the reduction of obesity incidence alongside the consumption of a healthy diet and exercise. This would need to be seen in human research before looking at this avenue of weight loss although currently there is some evidence that suggests NPY is a significant predictor in weight regain after weight loss to maintain old levels of energy storage. Furthermore, these factors correlate with each other. The sustained high levels of glucocorticosteroids stimulate gluconeogenesis, which subsequently causes an increase of blood glucose that activates the release of insulin to regulate glucose levels by causing its reuptake and storage as glycogen in the tissues in the body. In the case of obesity, which researchers speculate to have a strong genetic and a dietary basis, insulin resistance prevents high blood glucose regulation, resulting in morbid levels of glucose and diabetes mellitus. In addition, high levels of glucocorticosteroids causes an increase of NPY by directly activating type II glucocorticosteroids receptors (which are activated only by relatively high levels of glucocorticosteroids) and, indirectly, by abolishing the negative feedback of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on NPY synthesis and release. Meanwhile, obesity-induced insulin resistance and the mutation of the leptin receptor (ObRb) results in the abolition of inhibition of NPYergic activity and ultimately food intake via other negative feedback mechanisms to regulate them. Obesity in rats was significantly reduced by adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy.  Clinical significance  =Alcoholism= The role of neuropeptide Y has gained substantial attention for its involvement with alcoholism due to its diverse range of physiological effects. NPY neurons have been shown to interact with dopaminergic reward and emotion pathways in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, respectively. NPY expression levels and alcohol preference have been shown to exhibit an inverse relationship. Expression levels are dependent on the brain area of interest. This indicates that baseline NPY levels could possibly influence innate alcohol preferences. Previous studies have identified NPY's anxiolytic effects to a possible therapeutic drug target for alcoholism. As stated before, NPY levels and ethanol intake show an inverse relationship, therefore, increasing NPY availability could decrease alcohol intake. By creating a chemical antagonist for a Y2 receptor that would indirectly act as an agonist and stimulate Y1 receptors, alcohol consumption was successfully decreased in rats. Additionally, another similar study identified that NPY expression may be connected to behavioral regulation in relation to alcohol dependence. Administration of neuropeptide Y was found to reduce binge-drinking behavior. Although, it has been shown that NPY gene expression, mRNA or neuropeptide levels are not influenced by long-term alcohol consumption, but changes do occur during withdrawal from alcohol. These findings show that neuropeptide Y has varying effects on alcohol consumption. Two results suggest that NPY might protect against alcoholism: * knock-out mice in which a type of NPY receptor has been removed show a higher voluntary intake of alcohol and a higher resistance to alcohol's sedating effects, compared to normal mice; * the common fruit fly has a neuropeptide that is similar to NPY, known as neuropeptide F. The levels of neuropeptide F are lowered in sexually frustrated male flies, and this causes the flies to increase their voluntary intake of alcohol. = Stress and anxiety = Neuropeptide Y is considered to be an anxiolytic endogenous peptide and its levels can be modulated by stress. NPY has connections to the HPA axis and is believed to be necessary for stress modulation. It has been shown that higher levels of the Y1 and Y5 receptors in the amygdala result in reduced level of anxiety. Additionally, the Y1 receptor has been linked to anxiolytic effects in the forebrain while Y2 has been associated with the pons. Conversely, higher levels of NPY may be associated with resilience against and recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder and with dampening the fear response, allowing individuals to perform better under extreme stress. Studies of mice and monkeys show that repeated stress‚Äîand a high-fat, high-sugar diet‚Äîstimulate the release of neuropeptide Y, causing fat to build up in the abdomen. Researchers believe that by manipulating levels of NPY, they could eliminate fat from areas where it was not desired and accumulate at sites where it is needed.

Known as the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, the highway runs between one junction with I-95 in Elkridge and another interchange with I-95 on the east side of Baltimore. I-895 is a toll road that crosses the Patapsco River estuary via the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1), I-695, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in the southwestern suburbs of Baltimore with US 40 on the east side of Baltimore. In conjunction with a pair of spurs, unsigned I-895A and I-895B, I-895 provides access to the tunnel from I-97 and Maryland Route 2 (MD 2) in Glen Burnie. The highway is designed for through traffic by having partial interchanges that require vehicles from almost all starting points (with the two northernmost exits being exceptions) to pass through the tunnel and the tunnel toll plaza, where a $4 toll is charged to passenger vehicles, before exiting the facility. The idea of a crossing of the Patapsco River south of downtown Baltimore had been studied since the 1930s. In the early 1950s, the Maryland State Roads Commission chose to construct a four-lane tunnel between the Canton and Fairfield neighborhoods of Baltimore and approach highways to connect the tunnel with major highways to Washington, Annapolis, Richmond, and Philadelphia. The tunnel and approach highways were constructed beginning in 1955 and opened in November 1957, opening a bottleneck for Baltimore through traffic, which formerly had to navigate the city streets. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was connected with the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in the early 1960s and the portion of I-95 south to Washington in the early 1970s. With these connections, I-895 was burdened with most of the through traffic passing through Baltimore. The congestion was not resolved until I-95 through Baltimore was completed when the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel opened in November 1985. The transfer of most traffic to the new tunnel allowed the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel to be partially shut down for extensive maintenance in the late 1980s. Route description I-895 is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) and, like all Interstate Highways, is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. =Western approach= K-Truss Bridge over railroad tracks southwest of the tunnel I-895 begins at Exit 46 of I-95 in Elkridge with single-lane flyover ramps from northbound I-95 to I-895 and from I-895 to southbound I-95. The highway, which has a speed limit of , expands to four lanes on a viaduct over local roads and CSX's Capital Subdivision and MARC's Camden Line. I-895 crosses the Patapsco River (the Howard-Baltimore county line) and US 1 (Washington Boulevard), then receives the Exit 1 flyover ramps from northbound US 1 and to southbound US 1 before passing under I-195 with no access. I-895 continues east parallel to the Patapsco River. The highway passes along the southern edge of Halethorpe, where it crosses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line along with Herbert Run. I-895 meets I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at Exit 3, which includes a loop ramp from eastbound I-695 and a ramp to westbound I-695. The highway crosses Hammonds Ferry Road in Baltimore Highlands before Exit 4 with MD 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), which includes a loop ramp to southbound MD 295 and a ramp from northbound MD 295. The speed limit drops to , then the highway crosses MD 648 (Annapolis Road) and curves northeast across marshland, the main line of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink, and the Patapsco River into Anne Arundel County. East of the river, I-895 receives flyover ramps from the thruway's southern approach, unsigned I-895B, at Exit 6 in Brooklyn Park. The highway enters the city of Baltimore and curves to the east over Patapsco Avenue before Exit 7 with MD 2 (Potee Street), which includes a loop ramp to southbound MD 2 and a ramp from the intersection of MD 2 and MD 173 (Patapsco Avenue). I-895 parallels CSX's Curtis Bay Branch as the highway passes along the northern edge of the Brooklyn neighborhood. The highway crosses the Curtis Bay Branch on a steel K truss bridge ahead of Exits 8A and 8B. Exit 8A includes a loop ramp to and a flyover ramp from Shell Road, which heads toward the Curtis Bay, Baltimore neighborhood. Exit 8B includes ramps from eastbound Frankfurst Avenue and to westbound Frankfurst Avenue; that street leads to Hanover Street and downtown Baltimore. I-895 passes through the 14-booth toll plaza for the tunnel; immediately to the east of the toll plaza is Exit 9, a half-diamond interchange with Childs Street for traffic to and from the toll plaza. The speed limit decreases to as the highway curves to the northeast through the Fairfield unit of the Port of Baltimore and descends into the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. =Northern approach= Baltimore Harbor Tunnel I-895 surfaces from the tunnel adjacent to the toll plaza for the Fort McHenry Tunnel within the Canton neighborhood. The highway passes over several rail lines of the Canton Railroad and several streets as it curves to the north. The Exit 10 ramp to Holabird Avenue diverges from I-895 immediately before the highway passes under I-95 with no access. I-895 returns to ground level and the highway crosses Ponca and Boston streets; the speed limit increases to ahead of exits 11A and 11B, which serve Boston and O'Donnell streets, respectively (with ramps to/from eastbound Boston Street and loop ramps to/from westbound O'Donnell Street). The highway crosses a rail line before passing through the Greektown neighborhood in a cut. I-895 passes under MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) ahead of Exit 12, a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Lombard Street just to the west of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center that has ramps in both directions of the Interstate, and is the only interchange to be built out that way. The highway veers northeast and crosses both Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision before Exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue); the entrance ramp extends from the US 40-MD 151 partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the north and west. After crossing Herring Run, I-895 meets Moravia Road at Exit 14, a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange that lacks an exit from northbound I-895, which is accessed via Exit 13 and a loop ramp to the northwest. This interchange complements Exit 60 off I-95, where the eastern terminus of Moravia Road meets the planned western terminus of the Windlass Freeway. A branch of the I-95 Express Toll Lanes begin within the interchange with Moravia Road, there is a ramp from northbound I-895 to the northbound toll lanes. The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at Exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), a pair of flyover ramps from I-895 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to I-895 on the boundary between the city of Baltimore and the Baltimore County community of Rosedale. History =Planning and construction= In 1938, the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) commissioned an engineering study, Maryland's Primary Bridge Program, to examine feasibility of major bridges across significant transportation barriers, including a bridge crossing the Patapsco River southeast of the Inner Harbor. Another study in 1944 examined the idea of a bridge with limited-access approach roads running from US 1 in Elkridge to the Patapsco River crossing and from the bridge to US 40 near Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore. The financial resources for the project were established in 1947 when the Maryland General Assembly passed an act allowing for the pooling of revenue bonds and toll receipts between the state's toll facilities--the existing Potomac River Bridge and Susquehanna River Bridge, and the upcoming Chesapeake Bay Bridge--to finance the construction of the Patapsco River Crossing. Finally, a 1953 study examined three different routes--Canton- Fairfield, Canton-Fort McHenry, and a Canton-Fort McHenry-Fairfield dual crossing option--and whether the crossing should be a bridge or tunnel. In 1954, the SRC decided to construct a tunnel between Canton and Fairfield, with three approach highways: a west approach from US 1 in Elkridge, a south approach from MD 2 in Glen Burnie to connect with the west approach in Brooklyn Park, and a north approach from US 40 and Erdman Avenue in east Baltimore. The approach highways were to be limited-access with directional, partial interchanges so that only traffic intending to use the tunnel would use the approach roads. Any vehicles entering an approach road would not be able to exit until having passed through the tunnel and the tunnel toll facility. Shortly after work began on the Patapsco Tunnel Project on April 7, 1955, several changes were made to the plans for the approach highways. The northern terminus at US 40 was altered to allow an extension from US 40 to the southern end of the future Northeastern Expressway (now John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway). As a result, additional connections with US 40 were planned for the area around present day Exit 14. In addition, the south approach was to have a tie-in to the Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) then under construction. The tunnel and approach highways were completed and opened November 29, 1957 as the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, respectively. The opening of the tunnel and approach roads removed a significant amount of traffic from the streets of Baltimore and eliminated 51 traffic lights from the route of motorists passing through the city. View north along I-895 just after entering Baltimore City =Improvements and relief= The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended north to the city limits of Baltimore to seamlessly connect with the Northeastern Expressway when that highway opened northeast to the Baltimore Beltway in 1961. In 1969, Moravia Road was extended east to US 40 using the connector between US 40 and the thruway and several ramps were added to that road's interchanges with US 40 and the thruway. In addition, flyover ramps were constructed at the city limits for I-95 to diverge from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway onto its own path through east Baltimore in 1970. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway was extended at its south end in 1973 to connect with I-95 shortly after that Interstate was completed between the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore Beltway in 1971. Since I-95 had not yet been completed through Baltimore, the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, which was designated I-895 in 1979, was the main route for traffic passing through Baltimore. As a result, the highway was very congested, and travel through Baltimore had once again become a bottleneck. Relief came with the completion of the eight-lane Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-95 on November 23, 1985. With most traffic diverted to the new tunnel, major reconstruction work began on the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. Traffic was reduced to one lane in each direction through the tunnel as each of the two tubes was renovated between 1987 and 1989. More recent changes include the elimination of the entrance ramp from Ponca Street at Exit 10, the expansion of Exit 12 to a full interchange to provide access to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in both directions (thus shortening the toll portion of I-895), and the reconstruction of the northern interchange with I-95 in 2009 so I-895 enters and exits I-95 on the right side of the roadway; previously, I-95 exited itself southbound by forcing traffic to weave to the right and access a flyover ramp, and northbound I-895 merged with I-95 from the left. =Tolls and exit numbers= The original toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway was 40 cents for passenger vehicles and 85 cents for trucks. By 1985, the toll had risen to $1. Electronic toll collection began at the toll plaza in 1999 for M-TAG customers; the M-TAG system was absorbed by E-ZPass in 2001. MdTA increased the toll for passenger vehicles to $2 in 2003. In May 2011, the agency announced the toll for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway and the two other harbor crossings would increase to $3 on October 1, 2011 and to $4 on July 1, 2013. The Harbor Tunnel Thruway has had three different exit number systems throughout its existence. The first numbering scheme was in place by 1963. The northbound exits were numbered between 1 (Holabird Avenue) and 5 (US 40), while the southbound exits were numbered 1 (Hanover Street) to 7 (US 1). The second numbering scheme, which did not change the interchange numbers on the northern approach to the tunnel, was introduced in 1971. The exits on the western approach were renumbered 11 (Hanover Street) to 17 (US 1). Under both schemes, the Childs Street exit did not have a number and the Moravia Road interchange was numbered as Exit 1 of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. The third and present numbering scheme was enacted in 1991. Future The Canton Viaduct, a elevated structure that carries I-895 over a railroad yard, Ponca Street and the ramps connecting I-95 to Keith Avenue, is currently in the process of being replaced. The viaduct, located next to the toll plaza for the Fort McHenry Tunnel, is one of the oldest Interstate bridges in Maryland. Similar to what was done in the late 1980s rehabilitation of the tunnel, one side of the viaduct is closed while the other operates with one lane in each direction. Construction is expected to be completed by 2021. Exit list Auxiliary routes I-895 has two auxiliary routes, I-895A and I-895B. Both highways are portions of the southern approach to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel that connects with the mainline of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway in Brooklyn Park. Both spurs are maintained by MdTA. I-895A and the portion of I-895B north of I-895A are part of the main National Highway System. The segment of I-895B between MD 2 and I-895A is a National Highway System principal arterial. =I-895A= I-895A is the designation for the connector between the northern end of I-97 just north of I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) and I-895B within Glen Burnie. The highway was constructed in 1957 to connect the northern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass with the Harbor Tunnel Thruway. In conjunction with the reconstruction of I-97's interchange with I-695, in which the loop ramp from I-97 north to I-695 west was replaced with a flyover joining I-695 on the left, a loop ramp was added on I-895A in 1995 to allow access to the right side of I-695 west for traffic exiting at MD 648 (Baltimore - Annapolis Boulevard). =I-895B= View looking south along I-895B (Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway - Gov. Ritchie Highway Connector) from overhead bridge for Hammonds Lane in Brooklyn Park I-895B is the designation for the southern approach to the mainline of Harbor Tunnel Thruway between MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Glen Burnie and I-895 in Brooklyn Park. The highway was completed in 1957 with the remainder of the Harbor Tunnel Thruway. The only change to the southern approach is the addition of ramps from I-895B north to I-695 west and from I-695 east to I-895B south to improve access between MD 2 and the Baltimore Beltway; these ramps, now marked as Exit 3A on I-695 east, were completed in 1968.

The continuous Lyapunov equation is of form: AX + XA^H + Q = 0. The Lyapunov equation occurs in many branches of control theory, such as stability analysis and optimal control. This and related equations are named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov. Application to stability In the following theorems A, P, Q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}, and P and Q are symmetric. The notation P>0 means that the matrix P is positive definite. Theorem (continuous time version). Given any Q>0, there exists a unique P>0 satisfying A^T P + P A + Q = 0 if and only if the linear system \\\\dot{x}=A x is globally asymptotically stable. The quadratic function V(x)=x^T P x is a Lyapunov function that can be used to verify stability. Theorem (discrete time version). Given any Q>0, there exists a unique P>0 satisfying A^T P A -P + Q = 0 if and only if the linear system x_{t+1}=A x_{t} is globally asymptotically stable. As before, z^T P z is a Lyapunov function. Computational aspects of solution Specialized software is available for solving Lyapunov equations. For the discrete case, the Schur method of Kitagawa is often used. For the continuous Lyapunov equation the method of Bartels and Stewart can be used. Analytic solution Defining the \\\\operatorname{vec} (A) operator as stacking the columns of a matrix A and A \\\\otimes B as the Kronecker product of A and B, the continuous time and discrete time Lyapunov equations can be expressed as solutions of a matrix equation.

From the 12th century onwards tin mining was regulated by a stannary parliament which had its own laws. Tin is smelted from cassiterite, a mineral found in hydrothermal veins in granite, and the uplands of Dartmoor were a particularly productive area. The techniques used for the extraction of tin from Dartmoor followed a progression from streaming through open cast mining to underground mining. Today, there are extensive archaeological remains of these three phases of the industry, as well as of the several stages of processing that were necessary to convert the ore to tin metal. Stannary law Crockern Tor ‚Äì Parliament Rock as seen from the \\"floor\\" of the Great Court. Mining became such an important part of life in the region that as early as the 12th century, tin miners developed their own set of laws (stannary law) and, ultimately, their own parliaments (stannary parliaments). These laws applied to anyone involved in the industry. Stannaries were established in Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford by King Edward I in 1305. Plympton followed soon after. The Devon stannary parliament met in an open-air forum at Crockern Tor from 1494.Finberg 1950, p.296. Anyone who broke a stannary law could find himself imprisoned in the gaol at Lydford. The stannary courts were abolished in 1836. Geology The majority of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock and most of the lodes trend ENE‚ÄìWSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions.Dines 1956,p.719 In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite.Dines 1956,p.720 In the southern part of the moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality.Dines 1956,p.728 These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period. Mining methods =Streaming= An example of the characteristic pattern of parallel ridges and scarp left by tin-streaming, east of Fox Tor. The earliest means of recovery, known as streaming or streamworking, involved the collection of alluvial deposits from river and stream beds where they had accumulated after being eroded from the ore-bearing lodes. The geological processes that resulted in the deposition of the cassiterite in the stream beds often resulted in very pure tin gravel which was mixed with gravels of other, unwanted, minerals such as quartz, mica and feldspar, collectively known as \\"gangue\\".Newman 1998, p.11. It was relatively easy to separate these minerals on the basis of their very different specific gravities ‚Äì cassiterite about 7 and gangue 3 or less. The separation was performed by passing a stream of water over the gravels: the gangue would be washed away faster than the wanted tin gravel.Newman 1998, p.12. Once a tin-bearing valley had been identified, the stream-workers would arrange a stream of water, probably carried by a leat from higher up the valley, and starting at the lowest end of the deposit they would dig a trench (known as the \\"tye\\") as deep as possible to allow the finer gangue to be washed away.Newman 1998, p.13. (Quoting Hitchens' & Drew's History of Cornwall 1824.) From there they would start working up the valley, using the stream of water to wash over the debris they had loosened from the bed with picks. This method of working leaves characteristic evidence in the valleys - a series of ridges of the larger gangue material, sometimes roughly perpendicular to, sometimes coaxial with the line of the valley, sometimes apparently haphazard, all bounded by a scarp which marked the edge of the worked ground and whose height relates to the depth of the deposits.Newman 1998, p.13-16. Eluvial deposits‚Äîthose that had weathered from the lode in the usual way, but had not then been transported by flowing water‚Äîwere also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits due to the lack of sorting that a stream provides, and they usually did not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.Newman 1998, p.20. A study has shown that a phase of aggradation occurred in the Erme valley between the 4th century and 7th century, providing evidence of late Roman or early post-Roman tin mining activity in this valley.Geoarchaeology, 2004, Vol 19, Issue 3, pp 219-236, Wiley InterScience. Abstract The same study confirmed what documentary evidence also relates: that there was a boom in tin production in the 13th century. The earliest written record of tin streaming comes from the 12th century. =Open cast= Openworks near the Warren House Inn. Looking down one gully towards a group of them in the middle distance, and more on the left side of the ridge beyond. By the 15th century, the sources of stream tin were becoming scarce and since the demand for tin was as strong as ever, the direct working of lodes was considered viable despite the greater effort needed in both extraction and refining.Newman 1998, p.20-21. \\"Beamworks\\" was the name given by the tinners to workings where the lode was followed by digging down from the surface, and the massive gullies that resulted remain prominent features of the moor today. Several of these gullies retain names that include the word beam: Gibby Beam, Willabeam and Scudley Beam, for example. They are also known as \\"openworks\\" or \\"gerts\\".Newman 1998, p.22. Another method of surface mining involved digging pits at intervals along the lode ‚Äì this was known as \\"lodeback-work\\". At times these pits were dug in pairs along the back of the lode and the lode followed underground between them.Newman 1998, p.26. This may have been the precursor to beamworks in a number of locations, but enough lodeback pits survive to indicate that it was a separate technique. The issue that mine managers had to decide was whether it was worth removing the extra overburden to form a gulley in order to be able to mine deeper into the lode. In a similar fashion to streamworking, much use was made of water for the removal of the overburden and gangue. When digging large gullies the overburden, which consisted at least partly of decomposed granite (\\"growan\\"), was loosened with picks, and then water was used to wash away the unwanted material instead of manhandling it. Means of collecting, diverting and storing water were always associated with openworks. In some cases when only poor sources of water were available complex systems of reservoirs were built. =Underground= The Dartmoor tin industry declined in importance during the early 18th century and had fallen to nothing by 1730.Worth 1967, p. 287 This was due to a number of factors, but the most important was likely to be the exhaustion of the easily accessible deposits.Newman 1998, p.55. It was not until the Industrial Revolution fuelled demand for all metals and also provided the technology to mine them that mining resumed on the moor on any scale. Although underground mining technology had been available for many centuries, it is likely that the joint problems of the hardness of the granite rock and the preponderance of underground water together with the relatively easy pickings from near the surface made deep mining unviable until the late 18th century.Newman 1998, p.56. Many small mining enterprises started up on Dartmoor in the late 18th and 19th centuries ‚Äì 48 mines are known to have produced some tin during this period.Harris 1972, p. 45. Many of these ventures were unsuccessful, despite being given optimistic names like Wheal Fortune, Wheal Lucky and Wheal Prosper (the common prefix Wheal is a Celtic word meaning \\"mine\\" or \\"works\\"). Some larger mines, however, such as Eylesbarrow and the Vitifer ‚Äì Birch Tor complex were productive for many years. Almost all of the underground mines re-worked lodes that had already been mined from the surface. Because of the great quantity of underground water, it was necessary to dig horizontal adits into the hillsides to de-water the mines. Dartmoor's topography, cut with deep valleys, helped there and in many cases it was possible to dig to a reasonable depth without the need to pump out water.Harris 1972, p.38. These adits connected with shafts that were either sunk vertically downwards or followed the line of the steeply dipping lode. Working the lode then took place by stoping from the horizontal levels in the usual manner.Harris 1972, p. 40‚Äì41. When it became necessary to go deeper than the lowest adit, it was essential to pump out the water. Large waterwheels were used for this and where the shaft was higher than a good water supply, the waterwheel was located lower down the hillside and the power transferred up to the shaft by a \\"flatrod\\" system. Evidence for these systems survives as double rows of stones with grooves on their tops ‚Äì these held the pulleys that guided the metal rods. Such stone rows are still visible at Eylesbarrow and at Hexworthy.Newman 1998, p. 59. The discovery of extensive tin deposits in Malaya in the later 19th century had a major impact on the Dartmoor industry, and many miners emigrated. The last tin mine on Dartmoor finally closed just before the Second World War, although Hemerdon Mine, or Hemerdon Ball, was mined for tungsten and tin on a trial basis in the 1980s, leading to the re-opening this mine with first production in 2015. Processing After collection the tin ore had to be crushed, concentrated and then smelted. Over time a series of ever more sophisticated processes were used for these operations. =Crushing= Early streamworkers operating on a small scale used a block of hard stone as a mortar and perhaps a metalbound piece of wood or a ball of stone as a pestle to break up the ore when necessary,Harris 1972, p.28. but the rich gravels would have required little or no crushing before concentration.Newman 1998, p.40. A later technique called \\"crazing\\" employed a pair of circular stones used like millstones, the top one rotating on the fixed lower stone. The coarse gravel or crushed ore was introduced into a hole in the centre of the top stone and was rendered to a fine sand. Only three examples of such crazing mills have been found; at Gobbet mine both stones are still visible.Newman 1998, p.44-45. As it became necessary to regularly process pieces of ore- bearing rock that were too large to be directly ground in a crazing mill, stamping was introduced. This involved vertical hammers powered by a waterwheel in a Stamp mill, of which at least 60 are known to have existed on Dartmoor. The first documentary evidence for a stamping mill on Dartmoor is dated 1504, though they would almost certainly have been in use earlier than this (the first reference for Cornwall is from 1400, for instance).Newman 1998, p.42. Stamping mills were also known as \\"knacking\\" or \\"knocking\\" mills; Knacking Mill Gulf, a shallow side valley in the upper reaches of the River Erme, attests to the existence of such a mill there at one time.Worth 1967, p.321. Discarded mortarstones and a broken mouldstone at the Walkham Valley higher tin mill. The hammers or \\"stamps\\" in a stamping mill consisted of vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams attached to the waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone. There were usually two or three of these stamps in a row, powered by the same drive and operating in sequence. At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the stamp heads were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the crushed ore once it was just fine enough to pass through the grill. This was a vast improvement over dry stamping because it was a continuous process that also stopped the production of unwanted very fine dust. The characteristic indicator of a former stamping mill is the mortarstone. These are blocks of granite up to a metre long with flat faces bearing two, three or (rarely) four circular or elliptical hollows usually around 17 cm in diameter and up to about 10 cm deep. Many of these mortarstones have hollows on more than one face, showing that they were turned and reused once the hollows became too deep for effective stamping.Newman 1998, p.42-44. A set of eight Cornish stamps, similar to those in use on the moor in the 19th century Improvements to the technology in the 18th and 19th centuries involved increasing the number of stamping heads and replacing the granite mortarstone with a thick bed of crushed quartz contained in a masonry or iron box.Newman 1998, p.62. By the 1900s there were several different types of stamps in use: Cornish, Californian, Holman's Pneumatic, etc.Richardson 1992, p.154. =Concentration= Although individual grains or pebbles of alluvial tin collected by streaming were often of high purity it was usually still necessary to remove the unwanted \\"gangue\\" material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as dressing the ore, increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted tin ore and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, trommels, and even magnetic separation. An early separation method was the rectangular buddle which was simply a slightly inclined plane over which the crushed material was washed by a gentle stream of water. The heavier ore would settle near the top of the incline while the lighter material would settle lower down or be washed off the buddle altogether. As there was a gradation in quality from the top to the bottom, the mineworker's skill lay in deciding where to make the dividing line between the wanted material and the waste. The division was often made in three parts: the \\"heads\\", which represented the best quality ore; the \\"middles\\", which was often reprocessed; and the \\"tailings\\", which was dumped. The dressing floor at Hooten Wheals, showing the remains of two early 20th century circular buddles. From about 1848 a circular form of the buddle was introduced. The crushed ore, suspended in water was introduced onto a central cone and spread outwards over a slightly inclined conical surface. The \\"heads\\" would settle near the centre and the \\"tailings\\" at the outer edge. The main innovation of the circular buddle was a set of sweep arms, powered by a waterwheel, which rotated above the buddle and carried brushes or pieces of fabric that dragged across the surface of the settling deposits. By continuously disturbing the surface of the deposit, these stopped the formation of rivulets and allowed better separation to be obtained. The buddle would be run until the deposit built up to between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm.) deep. The deposits would then be dug out in three portions, the \\"middles\\" often being reprocessed in another buddle of a slightly different specification. =Smelting= The remains of a Dartmoor blowing house, showing the furnace and mouldstone The earliest method of liberating the metal from the tin ore necessitated two smeltings: the first was done at or near the streamworks and involved no more than a fire used to roast the ore; the second smelting was done at one of the Stannary towns.Newman 1998, p.35. Little is known of the details of these practices, but their existence is confirmed by early documents that mention taxation of first and second smeltings.Worth 1967, p.289-290. The introduction of the efficient blowing house process in around 1300 allowed the use of just one smelting. Later still reverberatory furnaces were used. Both types were in use at Eylesbarrow mine in the first half of the 19th century‚Äîthe last place on Dartmoor where smelting was done. Consequences The effects of the large scale of early tin streaming were felt on the coast, as several harbours silted up due to the amount of fine material that was washed down the rivers. Because of this, in 1532 a Stannary Court decree ordained that all rubbish should be deposited in \\"old Hatches, Tipittes, miry Places, or other convenient Places\\" away from the main streams.Finberg 1949, p.169. The impact of mining on the Dartmoor landscape is still clear to see. Walkers on the moor will often stumble upon ruined blowing houses and mortar stones, featuring rows of semi-circular depressions, in which the ore was crushed. Many of the later mine shafts have now been filled in, but a few do still remain, fenced off to prevent walkers or animals from falling in. Three hares symbol The three hares is a circular motif which appears in sacred sites from the Middle and Far East to the churches of south west England (where it is often referred to as the \\"Tinners‚Äô Rabbits\\"). It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of the West Country of England. The motif appears in architectural wood carving, stone carving, window tracery and stained glass. In South Western England there are nearly thirty recorded examples of the Three Hares appearing on 'roof bosses' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in medieval churches in Devon, (particularly Dartmoor). There is a good example of a roof boss of the Three hares at Widecombe-in-the-Moor,Greeves, Tom, From China to Widecombe: The Extraordinary Journey of The Three Hares, Widecombe-in-the- Moor.

The book depicts a manned mission to Titan ‚Äî the enigmatic moon of Saturn ‚Äî which has a thick atmosphere and a chemical makeup that some think may contain the building blocks of life. Titan was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1998. Plot summary The novel explores a range of possible attitudes toward space exploration and science in the early twenty-first century in which he lays down his concerns about anti-intellectualism and the loss of the pioneering spirit in modern American politics and culture. In Titan, the United States is ruled by a fundamentalist Christian President named Xavier Maclachlan who, believing Earth is the centre of the universe, orders the equal treatment of the Ptolemaic model of the solar system in high school curricula, all the while youth culture goes into a rebellious downward spiral with the widespread adoption of digital entertainment technology. Due to its far-right isolationist policies, the United States have severed ties with the rest of the world (including within themselves with seceding nation-states), especially while tensions grow with the emerging power of China, which is engaged in a determined bid to gain control of space after the American Shuttle program comes crashing down with the loss of Columbia (but not in the same way as actual events. In this timeline, instead of disintegrating on re- entry the shuttle makes an irreparable crash landing with the loss of two of the crew), and NASA has no public or political support to help recover from the accident. Consequently, under Maclachlan's executive plans, the US military merges with the space agency for its resources to be diverted into defence spending, including using its space-faring vehicles as weapons platforms and forcing NASA to develop ethnically-targeted biological weapons tailored to attack Han Chinese. Amid this negative climate and seeing no future for themselves after the permanent shutdown of the space program or for the decadent future of humanity, a small team of scientists and astronauts must persuade NASA to fund a manned mission to Titan to confirm findings of life from the Cassini and to rejuvenate interest in space exploration to the world. They do so by recycling older spacecraft for several purposes: space shuttle Atlantis is refitted to carry cargo into orbit as well as a restored Saturn V for construction of the main ship (a heavily modified version of Discovery using the Shuttle OMS engines for chemical propulsion and powered by a TOPAZ nuclear reactor), using habitat modules from the mothballed International Space Station, and Apollo re-entry capsules are adapted to become Titan landers. On the day of the last launch to begin the mission, with the shuttle Endeavour ready to carry the crew to space, an insane USAF general driven by shallow militarism and hatred for space exploration tries to shoot down the shuttle during lift off. Despite damage sustained from an anti- satellite missile fired from a restored X-15, Endeavour successfully makes it into orbit, and the five crew members begin their six-year journey to Saturn by following the gravity-assisted Interplanetary Transport Network. En route, one crew member dies after a solar storm. The use of a CELSS greenhouse for life support provides a continuous food supply, and the astronauts rely on vegetables, grain and fruit from the greenhouse as they travel on, and dispose of waste via supercritical water oxidation. But things take a dark turn as funding and support for resupply and Earth-return retrieval are cut by Maclachlan's administration (proposed and carried out by the very same men that tried to shoot the shuttle down), leaving the team with no hope for survival beyond what they may find on Titan. Once they reach Saturn and prepare to land on Titan's surface, another crew member is lost during the landing procedure with another effectively crippled. Titan is discovered to be a bleak, freezing dwarf-planet containing liquid ethane oceans, a sticky mud- like surface composed of tholins, and a climate which includes a thick atmosphere of purple organic compounds falling like snow from the clouds; and the only traces of life they find are fossilised remains of microbic bacteria similar to those recovered from Martian meteorites. The remaining astronauts relay their findings back to a largely uninterested Earth. Meanwhile, the Chinese, to retaliate for biological attacks by the US, cause a huge explosion next to an asteroid (2002OA), with the aim of deflecting it into Earth orbit and threatening the world with targeted precision strikes in the future. Unfortunately, their calculations are wrong as they didn't take into account the size of the asteroid which could cause a Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The asteroid strikes Earth, critically damaging the planetary ecosystem. The Titan team members are presumably the last humans left alive. As the surviving astronauts slowly die of disease and in-fighting, they decide to try to ensure life will continue to survive: they take a flask of bacteria and drop it into a crater filled with liquid water, in the hope that some form of life will develop. The novel's final sequence depicts the final two crew members returned to life through some unspecified alien process on Titan where they died, several billion years in the future. The sun has entered its red giant phase, warming the Saturnian system and aiding the evolution of life, in the form of strange, intelligent beetle-like creatures, on Titan. The astronauts watch as the creatures build a fleet of starships to seed new solar systems before the expanding sun boils off the surface of the moon. Literary significance and criticism The novel's final chapter has been heavily criticised for excessive implausibility, but it can be read as deliberate wishful thinking: it epitomises Baxter's moral that if the human race is to survive indefinitely, it must become more proactive in its approach to space travel, and not resort to shallow militarism or nationalist isolationism. The Titanian beetles represent Baxter's dream of what the human race should be. Conceivably, the final chapter can be read as the dying dream of the astronauts, rather than a realistic evocation of Titan's future. Baxter wrote a short story, \\"Sun God\\", that features the final sequence of Titan from the point of view of the Titanian beetles. The story was included in the collection Phase Space. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science The depiction of Titan's surface is speculation based on respectable scientific data that was available in 1997 ‚Äì in fact the book \\"Lifting Titan's Veil\\"R. D. Lorenz and J. M. Mitton, Lifting Titan's Veil, Cambridge University Press, 2002 notes that Baxter's story paraphrases closely sections of papers by Lorenz on raindrops on Titan and the geomorphology of crater lakes. The Cassini probe's study of Titan, which began in 2005, has recently borne out that there do appear to be liquid lakes on the moon.

Biography Marilyn Allene Hickey was born on July 1, 1931, in Dalhart, Texas. When she was a young girl, Hickey's parents were professing Methodists and attended church only casually. Her family suffered from hereditary mental disorders according to one of her telecasts. Her father had it, after her grandfather and her great-grandfather that had it, even before the \\"devil and his imps\\" got to Marilyn, at the age of 36, she was the only one in her family not to suffer a mental disorder. Also in her family, she also said that her family had a history of heart diseases, especially Hickey herself, that at age 11, she was told by her doctors she had an enlarged heart, and progressively got worse until she had surgery. She became a born again Christian when she was a teenager. In college, she studied Spanish, intending to become a public high school teacher. She met Wallace Hickey at an Assemblies of God Church, where Wallace served as a pastor, and together on December 26, 1954, (just 1 day after Christmas), the couple were married. Around the same time, she and Wallace also met Dr. T.L. Osborn, a Pentecostal evangelist, who was 8 years Hickey's senior, when she and Wallace both had traveled around in her husband's car, doing tent revival meetings, in town, she also became lifelong friends with him, until she lost him, only 4 months, after she lost Wallace. Coincidentally, she was also a guest-speaker at one of the conferences in which Dr. Osborn held. After a short time in Texas, they moved to Denver, Colorado to found Full Gospel Chapel. The church, later known as Orchard Road Christian Center, became one of the largest churches in the Denver area. They later turned over the pastorate to their daughter Sarah Bowling and son-in-law Reece Bowling. The church (now called Encounter Church) currently meets in Centennial, Colorado. Hickey holds a Bachelor of Arts in Collective Foreign Languages from the University of Northern Colorado and an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Oral Roberts University. In 2015, Hickey was honored at Oral Roberts University with a Lifetime Global Achievement Award. Hickey has two children and four grandchildren. Hickey's husband of 57 years, Wallace, died after a long battle of Alzheimer's disease, in the care center of Denver, Colorado, on October 19, 2012, at age 87. =Today with Marilyn and Sarah TV program= Hickey has aired a television program since 1973 and, since 1996, has co-hosted it with her daughter Sarah Bowling (born February 1, 1968). Today with Marilyn and Sarah can be seen on various Christian networks such as the DayStar Network, Channel C, and independent stations in both the U.S. and internationally, as well as through her YouTube Channel. She has also been seen on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). =Missionary works= In 2012, Hickey held a three-day prayer and faith healing rally in Karachi, Pakistan which was attended by over 400,000 people. On 12 November 2016 with her 7th trip to Pakistan she aimed at reaching 1,000,000 people in a single meeting in Karachi.

The remorseful person is said to be contrite. A central concept in much of Christianity, contrition is regarded as the first step, through Christ, towards reconciliation with God. It consists of repentance for all one's sins, a desire for God over sin, and faith in Christ's redemption on the cross and its sufficiency for salvation (see regeneration and ordo salutis). It is widely referred to throughout the Bible, e.g. Ezekiel 33:11, Psalms 6:7ff, Psalm 51:1‚Äì12, Luke 13:5, Luke 18:9‚Äì13, and the well-known parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11‚Äì32).  In the Catholic Church  = Nature = The Council of Trent defined contrition as \\"sorrow of soul, and a hatred of sin committed, with a firm purpose of not sinning in the future\\". It is also known as animi cruciatus (affliction of spirit) and compunctio cordis (repentance of heart). The word \\"contrition\\" implies a breaking of something that has become hardened. St. Thomas Aquinas in his Commentary on the Master of the Sentences thus explains its peculiar use: \\"Since it is requisite for the remission of sin that a man cast away entirely the liking for sin which implies a sort of continuity and solidity in his mind, the act which obtains forgiveness is termed by a figure of speech 'contrition'.\\" This sorrow of soul is not merely speculative sorrow for wrong done, remorse of conscience, or a resolve to amend; it is a real pain and bitterness of soul together with a hatred and horror for sin committed; and this hatred for sin leads to the resolve to sin no more. The early Christian writers in speaking of the nature of contrition sometimes insist on the feeling of sorrow, sometimes on the detestation of the wrong committed. Augustine includes both when writing: \\"Compunctus corde non solet dici nisi stimulus peccatorum in dolore p≈ìnitendi\\". Nearly all the medieval theologians hold that contrition is based principally on the detestation of sin. This detestation presupposes a knowledge of the heinousness of sin, and this knowledge begets sorrow and pain of soul. \\"A sin is committed by the consent, so it is blotted out by the dissent of the rational will; hence contrition is essentially sorrow. But sorrow has a twofold signification‚Äîdissent of the will and the consequent feeling; the former is of the essence of contrition, the latter is its effect.\\" = Necessity = The formal doctrine of the Church, announced through the Council of Trent, declares that contrition has always been necessary to obtain pardon of one's sins. Contrition is the first and indispensable condition for pardon. While it is possible for one to receive pardon where confession is impossible, there is no case where sin can be pardoned without contrition. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Catholic writers have always insisted that such necessity arises (a) from the very nature of repentance as well as (b) from the positive command of God. From the very nature of repentance, they point out that the sentence of Christ in Luke 13:5, is final: \\"Except you repent\\", etc., and from the Fathers they cite passages such as the following from Cyprian, De Lapsis, no. 32: \\"Do penance in full, give proof of the sorrow that comes from a grieving and lamenting soul. ... They who do away with repentance for sin, close the door to satisfaction.\\" Scholastic doctors laid down the satisfaction principle, \\"No one can begin a new life who does not repent him of the old\\" (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, Pt. II, art. 1, Q. ii, also ex professo, ibid., Pt. I, art. I, Q. iii), and when asked the reason why, they point out the absolute incongruity of turning to God and clinging to sin, which is hostile to God's law. The Council of Trent, mindful of the tradition of the ages, defined (Sess. XlV. ch. iv de Contritione) that \\"contrition has always been necessary for obtaining forgiveness of sin\\". The positive command of God is also clear in the premises. The Baptist sounded the note of preparation for the coming of the Messiah: \\"Make straight his paths\\"; and, as a consequence \\"they went out to him and were baptized confessing their sins\\". The first preaching of Jesus is described in the words: \\"Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\\"; and the Apostles, in their first sermons to the people, warn them to \\"do penance and be baptized for the remission of their sins\\" (Acts 2:38). The Fathers followed up with like exhortation (Clement in P.G., I, 341; Hermas iii P.G., II, 894; Tertullian in P.L., II). =Perfect and imperfect contrition= If detestation of sin arises from the love of God, who has been grievously offended, then contrition is termed \\"perfect\\"; if it arise from any other motive, such as loss of heaven, fear of hell, or the heinousness of guilt, then it is termed \\"imperfect contrition\\", or attrition.  Perfect contrition  Perfect contrition (also called contrition of charity) is a repentance for sin that is motivated by faith and the love of God. It contrasts with imperfect contrition, which arises from a less pure motive, such as common decency or fear of Hell. The two types of contrition are distinguished by a person's motive for repentance, rather than the intensity of ones feelings or emotions. It is possible for perfect and imperfect contrition to be experienced simultaneously. In perfect contrition its motive is founded on God's own goodness and not merely his goodness to the sinner or to humanity. There is no way of knowing with an absolute certainty if one has made an act of perfect contrition, but all that is required is the standard of all human action, moral certainty. If one says an act of contrition truthfully, intending it, then one would likely have moral certainty. Perfect contrition removes the guilt and eternal punishment due to mortal sin, even before the sinner has received absolution in the sacrament of penance (also Sacrament of Reconciliation. Inaccurately, but strongly related: 'Confession'), provided that the person has a firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as possible. An example of this theological precept is demonstrated in the Code of Canon Law in canon 916, which states: \\"A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.\\" In the case of imminent death, in which sacramental confession may not be possible, the firm resolution to go to sacramental confession, as soon as possible if a person survives, also removes the guilt and eternal punishment due to mortal sin.  Imperfect contrition  According to Psalm 111: 10, \\"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\\" In Philippians 2:12, Paul exhorts Christians to work out \\"our salvation in fear and trembling\\". In contrast to perfect contrition, imperfect contrition (also known as attrition) is a desire not to sin for a reason other than love of God. While attrition does not produce justification, attrition does dispose the soul to receive grace in the Catholic Sacrament of Reconciliation. The Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563) held that while imperfect contrition is motivated by reasons such as \\"the consideration of the turpitude of sin or from the fear of Hell and punishment\\", it also is a gift from God. \\"If any man assert that attrition ... is not a true and a profitable sorrow; that it does not prepare the soul for grace, but that it makes a man a hypocrite, yea, even a greater sinner, let him be Anathema.\\" The question has also been asked apropos of attrition when one receives a sacrament in mortal sin, of which sin he is not then aware, will attrition with the sacrament suffice unto justification? The answer is generally given in the affirmative. Scriptural support for attrition can be found in Proverbs 13:13, Proverbs 14:26‚Äì27, Proverbs 19:23, Matthew 10:28, and Philippians 2:12. = Criticism of imperfect contrition = In his 1537 Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Philipp Melanchthon argued against the concept of imperfect contrition on the basis that it leaves the penitent person uncertain:Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article XII (V): Of Repentance. In his 1537 Smalcald Articles, Martin Luther attacked the Catholic doctrine of imperfect contrition, arguing that \\"such contrition was certainly mere hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins; for they had to grieve, while they would rather have continued to sin, if it had been free to them.\\" Instead he argued that \\"repentance is not piecemeal,\\" and \\"In like manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or piecemeal.\\"Smalcald Articles, Part III, Article III. Of Repentance, = Qualities = In accord with Catholic tradition, contrition, whether perfect or imperfect, must be interior, supernatural, universal, and sovereign.  Interior  Contrition must be real and sincere sorrow of heart.  Supernatural  In accordance with Catholic teaching contrition ought to be prompted by God's grace and aroused by motives which spring from faith, as opposed to merely natural motives, such as loss of honour, fortune, and the like (Chemnitz, Exam. Concil. Trid., Pt. II, De Poenit.). In the Old Testament it is God who gives a \\"new heart\\" and who puts a \\"new spirit\\" into the children of Israel (Ezech. 36:25‚Äì29); and for a clean heart the Psalmist prays in the Miserere (Ps. 51, 11 sqq.). Peter told those to whom he preached in the first days after Pentecost that God the Father had raised up Christ \\"to give repentance to Israel\\" (Acts, v, 30 sq.). Paul, in advising Timothy, insists on dealing gently and kindly with those who resist the truth, \\"if peradventure God may give them full repentance\\" (2 Timothy, 2:24‚Äì25). In the days of the Pelagian heresy Augustine insisted on the supernaturalness of contrition, when he writes, \\"That we turn away from God is our doing, and this is the bad will; but to turn back to God we are unable unless He arouse and help us, and this is the good will.\\" Some of the Scholastic doctors, notably Scotus, Cajetan, and after them Suarez (De Poenit., Disp. iii, sect. vi), asked speculatively whether man if left to himself could elicit a true act of contrition, but no theologian ever taught that what makes for forgiveness of sin in the present economy of God could be inspired by merely natural motives. On the contrary, all the doctors have insisted on the absolute necessity of grace for contrition that disposes to forgiveness (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xiv, Part I, art. II, Q. iii; also dist. xvii, Part I, art. I, Q. iii; cf. Thomas, In Lib. Sent. IV). In keeping with this teaching of the Scriptures and the doctors, the Council of Trent defined; \\"If anyone say that without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and without His aid a man can repent in the way that is necessary for obtaining the grace of justification, let him be anathema.\\"  Universal  True contrition must extend to, at the very least, all mortal sins committed, and not just a select convenient few. This doctrine is intimately bound up with the Catholic teaching concerning grace and repentance. There is no forgiveness without sorrow of soul, and forgiveness is always accompanied by God's grace; grace cannot coexist with sin; and, as a consequence, one sin cannot be forgiven while another remains for which there is no repentance. The prophet Joel urged men to turn to God with their whole heart (Joel 2:12‚Äì19). and Christ tells the doctor of the law that we must love God with our whole mind, our whole strength (Luke 10:27). Ezekiel insists that a man must \\"turn from his evil ways\\" if he wish to live (Ezekiel 33:11). The Scholastics inquired into this question when they asked whether or not there must be a special act of contrition for every serious sin, and whether, in order to be forgiven, one must remember at the moment all grievous transgressions. To both questions they answered in the negative, judging that an act of sorrow which implicitly included all one's sins would be sufficient.  Sovereign  According to Mark 8:35‚Äì37, Jesus admonished his disciples: \\"For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life?\\" Contrition for sin must take precedence over temporal concerns. When the envoys of the Empress Eudoxia threatened John Chrysostom, he responded, \\"Go tell the princess that Chrysostom fears only one thing, and that is sin.\\" = Sacrament of Penance = Contrition is not only a moral virtue, but the Council of Trent defined that it is a \\"part\\", and even more, quasi materia, in the Sacrament of Penance. \\"The (quasi) matter of this sacrament consists of the acts of the penitent himself, namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction. These, inasmuch as they are by God's institution required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament and for the full and perfect remission of sin, are for this reason called parts of penance.\\" In consequence of this decree of Trent theologians teach that sorrow for sin must be in some sense sacramental. La Croix went so far as to say that sorrow must be aroused with a view of going to confession, but this seems to be asking too much; most theologians think with Schieler-Heuser (Theory and Practice of Confession, p. 113) that it is sufficient if the sorrow coexist in any way with the confession and is referred to it. Hence the precept of the Roman Ritual, \\"After the confessor has heard the confession he should try by earnest exhortation to move the penitent to contrition\\" (Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., p. 111 sqq.). For repentance is essential for the effectiveness of this sacrament, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church explains: > Jesus' call to conversion and penance ... does not aim first at outward > works ... but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion (1430). > Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a return, > a conversion to God with all our heart, an end of sin, a turning away from > evil, ... the desire and resolution to change one's life, with hope in God's > mercy and trust in the help of his grace (1431). For Catholics, where there is mortal sin, use of the Sacrament of Reconciliation must follow.  Perfect contrition without the Sacrament of Penance  Regarding that contrition which has for its motive the love of God, the Council of Trent declares: \\"The Council further teaches that, though contrition may sometimes be made perfect by charity and may reconcile men to God before the actual reception of this sacrament, still the reconciliation is not to be ascribed to the contrition apart from the desire for the sacrament which it includes.\\" The following proposition (no. 32) taken from Baius was condemned by Gregory XIII: \\"That charity which is the fullness of the law is not always conjoined with forgiveness of sins.\\" Perfect contrition, with the desire of receiving the Sacrament of Penance, restores the sinner to grace at once. This is certainly the teaching of the Scholastic doctors (Peter Lombard in P.L., CXCII, 885; St. Thomas, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.; St. Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.). This doctrine they derived from Holy Writ. Scripture certainly ascribes to charity and the love of God the power to take away sin: \\"He that loveth me shall be loved by My Father\\"; \\"Many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much\\" (Luke 7:36-50). Since the act of perfect contrition implies necessarily this same love of God, theologians have ascribed to perfect contrition what Scripture teaches belongs to charity. Nor is this strange, for in the Old Covenant there was some way of recovering God's grace once man had sinned. God wills not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live (Ezech. 33:11). This total turning to God corresponds to our idea of perfect contrition; and if under the Old Law love sufficed for the pardon of the sinner, surely the coming of Christ and the institution of the Sacrament of Penance cannot be supposed to have increased the difficulty of obtaining forgiveness. That the earlier Fathers taught the efficacy of sorrow for the remission of sins is very clear (Clement in P.G., I, 341 sqq.; and Hermas in P.G., II, 894 sqq.; Chrysostom in P.G., XLIX, 285 sqq.) and this is particularly noticeable in all the commentaries on Luke, vii, 47. The Venerable Bede writes (P.L., XCII, 425): \\"What is love but fire; what is sin but rust? Hence it is said, many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much, as though to say, she hath burned away entirely the rust of sin, because she is inflamed with the fire of love.\\" Theologians have inquired with much learning as to the kind of love that justifies with the Sacrament of Penance. All are agreed that pure, or disinterested, love (amor benevolenti√¶, amor amiciti√¶) suffices; when there is question of interested, or selfish, love (amor concupiscentia) theologians hold that purely selfish love is not sufficient. When one furthermore asks what must be the formal motive in perfect love, there seems to be no real unanimity among the doctors. Some say that where there is perfect love God is loved for His great goodness alone; others, basing their contention on Scripture, think that the love of gratitude (amor gratitudinis) is quite sufficient, because God's benevolence and love towards men are intimately united, even inseparable from His Divine perfections (Hurter, Theol. Dog., Thesis ccxlv, Scholion iii, no 3; Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., pp. 77 sq.). = Obligation of eliciting the act of contrition = In the very nature of things the sinner must repent before being reconciled with God (Sess. XIV, ch. iv, de Contritione, Fuit quovis tempore, etc.). Therefore, whoever falls into grievous sin must either make an act of perfect contrition or supplement the imperfect contrition by receiving the Sacrament of Penance; otherwise reconciliation with God is impossible. This obligation urges under pain of sin when there is danger of death. In danger of death, therefore, if a priest be not at hand to administer the sacrament, the sinner must make an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. The obligation of perfect contrition is also urgent whensoever one has to exercise some act for which a state of grace is necessary and the Sacrament of Penance is not accessible. Theologians have questions how long a person may remain in the state of sin, without making an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. They seem agreed that such neglect must have extended over considerable time, but what constitutes a considerable time they find it hard to determine (Schieler-Hauser, op. cit., pp. 83 sqq.). Probably the rule of St. Alphonsus Liguori will aid the solution: \\"The duty of making an act of contrition is urgent when one is obliged to make an act of love\\" (Sabetti, Theologia Moralis: de necess. contritionis, no. 731; Ballerine, Opus Morale: de contritione).  In other Christian theology  penitential psalm in this 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld, a Lutheran The Augsburg Confession, the primary confession of faith of the Lutheran Church, divides repentance into two parts: \\"One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.\\" Puritan preacher Thomas Hooker defined contrition as \\"nothing else, namely, when a sinner by the sight of sin and vileness of it, and the punishment due to the same, is made sensible of sin, and is made to hate it, and hath his heart separated from the same.\\" Anglo-Catholic rector of St. Mark's Church in Philadelphia, Alfred Garnett Mortimer, pointed out that \\"feelings\\" are not an adequate gauge of contrition. The signs of true contrition are a readiness to confess, a readiness to amend one's life and avoid temptation, and a readiness to forgive others.

The village has a population of 831 (2011 census). The name Montacute is thought by some to derive from the Latin \\"Mons Acutus\\", referring to the conically acute St Michael's Hill dominating the village to the west. An alternative view is that it is named after Drogo de Montagu, whose family originated from Montaigu-les-Bois, in the arrondissement of Coutances. Mortain held Montacute after 1066, Drogo was a close associate. The village is built almost entirely of the local hamstone. From the 15th century until the beginning of the 20th century it formed the heart of the estate of the Phelips family of Montacute House. The village has a fine medieval church, and was the site of a Cluniac priory, the gatehouse of which is now a private house. At the centre of the village is a large square known as the 'Borough' around which are grouped picturesque cottages and a pub, the Phelips Arms; there is a second public house and hotel situated in the village, called the King's Arms. History To the west of the village is the Iron Age hill fort of Ham Hill, a large tribal fort of the Durotriges. The fort was conquered by the Roman Legio II Augusta sometime around 45 AD. The Romans briefly occupied the fort, then moved to a more permanent garrison at nearby Ilchester (Lindinis), and constructed the Fosse Way Roman road a few miles west of the village. A Roman villa was excavated near Batemoor Barn early in the 20th century and an extensive mosaic documented. Never adequately protected, this has probably been damaged by deep ploughing in the last 20 years. Motte and bailey castle at St Michael's Hill Variously called Logaresburgh by the Saxons, later Bishopstone or Biscepstone, the estate was owned by Tofig, a staller (placeman or court office-holder) to Danish King Canute.Williams et al., A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, page 229. Local tradition remembers Tofig as \\"Cnut's standard bearer\\". In 1030 (1035 in some records) following a series of dreams in which the Devil told him where to dig, a local blacksmith found buried on St Michael's Hill a black flint crucifix or Holy Rood. (Some early versions state two black flint crosses were found, one large, one small. Another variant is that the second cross was wooden, and accompanied by a bell and a book/copy of the gospels.) Tofig loaded the life-sized cross (or crosses) onto a cart, and then named a series of possible destinations owned by him. The oxen pulling the wagon (six red and six white in one version of the tale) refused to move until he said Waltham in Essex, where Tofig already had a hunting lodge.The Waltham Chronicle, ed. Watkiss and Chibnall, page 15. They then started, and continued non-stop until they reached Waltham, and where they stopped Tofig decided to build an abbey at the site ‚Äì this became Waltham Abbey. In the meantime, Tofig rebuilt the church at Waltham to house the cross, on which he bestowed his own sword, and his second wife Gytha (or Glitha), the daughter of Osgod Clapa, adorned the figure with a crown, bands of gold and precious stones.Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective, page 119. The cross became the object of pilgrimage, notably by Harold Godwinson. It was at Tofig's wedding at Lambeth on 8 June 1042 that King Harthacnut suddenly died of a convulsion \\"while standing at his drink\\".Barlow, The Godwins: The Rise and Fall of a Noble Dynasty, page 109. \\"Holy Cross\\" became the battle-cry of Harold's armies at the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings. The Holy Rood is said to have foretold Harold's defeat at Hastings: on the way there from the Battle of Stamford Bridge he stopped off at Waltham Abbey to pray, and the legend is that the cross \\"bowed down\\" off the wall as he did so, taken as a portent of doom. There have been suggestions that the smaller cross became the \\"Holy Rood\\" which was carried to Scotland from Waltham Abbey by St Margaret. There has been further speculation that the site the relics were excavated from was the burial site of Joseph of Arimathea. On Tofig's death in circa 1043, his estates passed to his son Athelstan (or √Üthelstan) and then to his grandson Asgar. Following the invasion of 1066 it was held by Robert, Count of Mortain, who built the motte-and-bailey Montacute Castle at his English seat in 1068. The site of the castle was a deliberate affront to the defeated English, because it was the site where Tofig had discovered the \\"Holy Rood\\" crucifix. Robert later founded the Cluniac priory on an adjacent site. The parish of Montacute was part of the Tintinhull Hundred. Montacute Castle was besieged by English rebels from Somerset, Dorset and neighbouring areas in 1069 and its relief required the assembly of a considerable force, drawn chiefly from the Norman garrisons of London, Winchester and Salisbury. This army was led by the Norman bishop, Geoffrey of Coutances, whose large landholdings were also threatened. The rebels were taken by surprise and bloodily defeated, putting an end to the revolt. Joseph Bettey has suggested that \\"the devastation in the surrounding area which followed the English defeat may explain why so many manors in south Somerset are recorded in the Domesday Survey as having decreased in value\\". The English dead were buried in a mass grave to the west of the village in a sloping field now known as \\"Under Warren\\". Village tradition has it that two hilltop fortifications were built: first a wooden clamshell fort with motte & bailey, later replaced by a stone castle. However little evidence to prove the existence of the stone structure exists, except a note in the parish records that two loads of stone were taken from the site by the neighbouring parish of Martock. A church or chapel dedicated to St Michael later replaced the castle. Excavations of the hilltop have been limited and inconclusive. St Michael's Tower A folly tower, built in 1760 by Edward Phelips V now occupies the hill- top. Known as St Michael's Tower it stands on Mons Acutus which was the site of the former castle. The Hamstone tower is about in diameter, and rises before curving inwards to a viewing platform which reached via a 52 step spiral staircase. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building and scheduled monument. Local tradition has it that a tunnel runs between the tower and Montacute House. This has never been found, and the tradition of its existence may be due to folk memories of the old castle keep. Considerable earthworks are built into St Michael's Hill, and the common belief is that these are the remains of an extensive motte & bailey, however a report by the Somerset County Archeologist unit suggests that these are in fact wine-growing terraces. Montacute is visited by tourists who come to the area, attracted by the nearby Ham Hill Country Park, and Montacute House (now owned by the National Trust) which is one of the finest examples of an Elizabethan house in England, and several other mansions open to the public in the immediate vicinity. In 2009 Montacute was identified as having England's longest life expectancy in a report compiled by Watson Wyatt Worldwide. In November 2014 Montacute featured in the programme 'Hidden Villages' presented by Penelope Keith. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within 'St Michel's' electoral ward. Although Martock is the most populous area the ward stretches to the River Yeo beyond Tintinhull in the north. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,307. It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election. Geography An area of grass parkland lies to the east of the village; this formed the eastern approach to Montacute House though the drive through the park is now unused. Although associated with the Montacute estate, the park lies mainly within the neighbouring village of Odcombe. To the south of the village, bounded by Woodhouse Lane, and the Roman roads of Park Lane and Hollow Lane lies the older Deer Park: this is divided into High Park and Low Park by the woodland path known as Ladies Walk. The oldest extant known road in the village is a track leading from the front of the Abbey Gatehouse to Ham Hill, via the defensive ramparts of Ham Hill. This track crosses another presumed Roman Road which runs on the line of Stanchester (site of a Roman villa and the Stanchester Hoard found there) - Under Warren (abandoned settlement) Batemore (Roman villa) - Witcombe (abandoned settlement) - Norton Lane ‚Äî High Wood. Another ancient track struck northeast from The Borough toward Ilchester, and is revealed by the housing layout but the route across the park has been lost. This and the track to Ham Hill may possibly mark a Roman route between the fortifications of Ilchester and Ham Hill, but are probably older. In addition to being a scheduled monument, Iron Age hill fort and Roman site, Ham Hill itself is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), local nature reserve and country park. The geology supports a wide range of fauna including mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians living on lichens, fungi, ferns and flowering plants. =Climate= Typical for South West England, Montacute has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the temperatures of the nearby sea. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . Winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In summer high pressure in the Azores often affects the south-west, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at nearby Yeovilton. Most of the south-west's rainfall is caused by either Atlantic depressions or convection. Most of the autumn and winter rainfall is caused by Atlantic low pressure systems, their period most frequent activity. In summer, a significant proportion of the rainfall is caused by convection, where the sun warms the ground causing showers or thunderstorms. Average summer rainfall is . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. The highest mean wind speeds occur from November to March, whilst June to August sees the lowest. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Religious sites St Catherine's Church The Church of St Catherine has 12th century origins, and is a Grade II* listed building. The church was altered in the 13th and 15th centuries and was extensively restored in 1870 by Henry Hall. The church contains monuments to the Phelips family including David and Ann, who died in 1484, and Bridget, who died 1508. There are canopied effigies of Thomas, died 1588, and Elizabeth, died 1598. On the west wall is a marble monument to Edward, who died in 1690. An Anglo-Saxon Hamstone font lay unidentified in the churchyard for many years, but has now been reinstated replacing its Tudor successor. Little now remains of the Cluniac Montacute Priory, which fell during the Reformation, except the inaccurately named \\"Abbey Gatehouse\\" (a private dwelling) and its attached stew pond and pigeon cote. The former infirmary for the Priory ‚Äî the Grade II thatched \\"Monk's House\\" dating from the 15th century ‚Äî is also a private dwelling. St Michael's Hill is named for a similarly dedicated chapel which stood at its summit. No remains of the chapel are now visible, presumably it was demolished prior to the building of the tower in 1760. Village tradition had it that the current St Catherine's Church was predated by an older building which was destroyed by fire. There is little evidence of this, except for the occasional burnt stonework included in more recent buildings. One such example was burnt ancient stonework re-used at the back of the old village school. (This is now a private residence and not visible). Notable residents The dissolved Priory of Montacute was obtained from King Henry VIII by the poet Thomas Wyatt in 1542 and after his death was passed in 1544 by his son, Thomas Wyatt the Younger, to Elizabeth Darrell, the poet's mistress, and their young son Francis, and they soon took up residence there.E.K. Chambers, Sir Thomas Wyatt and Some Collected Studies (London, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1933) p. 144; Letters and Papers foreign and domestic of the reign of Henry VIII, ed. J.S. Brewer et al.

The vicar of Montacute between 1885 and 1918 was the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843‚Äì1923), father of the writers John Cowper Powys, Llewelyn Powys and Theodore Francis Powys. Philippa Powys, their sister and another author, was born in Montacute. Llewelyn Powys, in his \\"Somerset Essays\\", devoted a chapter to Thomas Shoel (1759-1823), a native of the village who wrote poetry and composed music including many hymn tunes, some of them still well knownPowys, Llewelyn, Somerset Essays, John Lane The Bodley Head, 1937, pp. 131-151 In John Cowper Powys's novel first Wood and Stone (1915) the fictional village of Nevilton is based on Montacute.Herbert Williams, John Cowper Powys. Bridgend: Seren, 1997, p.25. Richard Foister (or Foster) was reputedly the last highwayman to be gibbeted alive in England. In reality he seems to have been a local footpad who attacked travellers along the old coach route across Ham Hill. He was found guilty of murder and bound into a metal cage at what is now known as Foister's Gully - a hollow-way which passes along the route of the Roman road through Batemore Barn, close to the abandoned medieval hamlet. Village tradition has it that his screams of hunger could be heard in the village. On his death his wrists were found to be eaten to the bone. A local girl who offered him (tallow) candles to eat was nearly lynched for feeding him.

It is located on the banks of the River Ribble in Preston, Lancashire in the north west of England. The park is one of two city centre Victorian era parks, the other being the adjacent and larger Avenham Park. It was designed and built in the 1860s and has matured over the last 140 years into one of the most attractive parks in the region. As an English Heritage Grade II* listed park, it features a number of historical structures including a sundial, a grotto and a fountain. There is also an impressive statue of the 14th Earl of Derby who was British prime minister 1866 - 1868 . The two parks are separated by the East Lancashire Railway embankment and access is through the Ivy Bridge and along Riverside Walk. The East Lancashire Railway line closed in the 1970s although the viaduct across the river, which is a Grade II listed building, remains, as it carries a public footpath across the river. The west edge of the park is bounded by the embankment carrying Preston's main rail link, the West Coast Main Line. The land for the park was donated by local cotton manufacturer Thomas Miller (1811-1865) in 1864. The house that he built for himself, in 1845, stands on the north side of Winckley Square and bears a blue plaque in his honour. The park was designed by Edward Milner as a 'Harmonious Whole' including the adjacent Avenham Park. This park is more formal than its neighbour and includes beautiful bedding displays, a Rose Garden and the regal Derby Walk, all of which are maintained by Preston City Council's Horticultural Services. It is overlooked by the Park Hotel, a Victorian former hotel used as offices by Lancashire County Council until 2016. A modern extension to the council offices, which also overlooked the park, is being demolished in 2020 as part of works to convert the building back into a hotel. Apart from this office block, the appearance of the park has hardly changed since it was first laid out; the only other modern construction, a brick toilet block, was demolished in March 2006. A map of 1889 still provides an accurate representation of the park's layout. The inauguration of the park Preston's Avenham Park, Moor Park and Miller Park were inaugurated on the same day that the former Town Hall was opened in 1867. On September 28, 1867 the Preston Chronicle commented that the preparations were in place and that the expectation was that \\"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we shall have a gayer, a busier, and a more bustling town than we have had on any previous occasion, excepting, perhaps, at some of our Guilds\\".The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser, 28 September 1867, p.5, col. e The following week's edition for October 5, 1887 devoted several columns to \\"The Opening of the New Town Hall and Inauguration of the Parks\\". It was a civic event of considerable size and importance and when the opening ceremony for the town hall was concluded a procession was formed which made its way to Avenham and Miler Parks. Schoolchildren from across Preston had gathered in the parks and it was estimated that 23,000 to 25,000 were present. The Duke of Cambridge, cousin to Queen Victoria, was in attendance and the band of the Third Royal Lancashire Militia entertained the crowds.The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser, 05 October 1867, p.6, col. c  Proposed developments  As part of a multimillion-pound Heritage Lottery Funded restoration project, both Avenham and Miller Park will see a facelift over the next few years. The refurbishment will include restoration of all of the historical features (including The Fountain, Derby Walk etc.), improved lighting and footpaths, vehicle controls and the new Pavilion in Avenham Park which has a cafe, new public toilets and incorporates a police post as well as being a base for dedicated Parks staff. The old stage, which was removed in early 2006, has been replaced by a small performance area and the facilities to install temporary concert stages like those used at music festivals throughout the country. These improvements help the park become cleaner, safer and provide more events and activities for the people of Preston.

In addition to the cast members with speaking parts, the read-through is usually attended by the principal financiers or studio executives, producers, heads of department, writers, and directors. It is generally attended only by people involved in the production. It is usually the first time everyone involved in the production will have gathered together and it is traditional for everyone to introduce themselves by both name and job. The director may then open proceedings by making a short speech outlining their aspirations for the project. An additional professional actor not otherwise involved in the production may be hired to read the non-dialogue parts of the script such as scene headings and action. These parts of the script are usually edited down severely for the purposes of the read-through to keep the pace of the reading up. In film The read-through is an important milestone in the production of most films. It is a clear signal that all of the key elements, including cast, finance, and heads of department, are in place and that pre-production is almost complete. It is often the first time that the script has had a life beyond the written word, and it is also an opportunity for everyone involved in production to get at least a partial insight into the way the actors may approach their roles. In addition, a read-through is often a surprisingly powerful tool for identifying problem areas in the script. Wooden dialogue, unbelievable situations, or boring sections of the film which have not been addressed during the script development process often become apparent during the read-through.

Its teachings are found on radio, the internet, television, and in many Charismatic denominations and communities. The movement renounces poverty and physical suffering as either necessary to a godly life or glorifying Jesus Christ. It teaches that the salvation won by Jesus on the cross included wealth and prosperity for believers. Historical origins Evangelist E.W. Kenyon (1867‚Äì1948) is usually cited as the originator of Word of Faith teaching. Kenyon's writings influenced Kenneth Hagin Sr., the recognized \\"father\\" of the Word of Faith movement. Douglas Mcconnell has provided significant evidence that all of Hagin's major ideas came from the works of KenyonBen Pugh, Bold Faith: A Closer Look at the Five Key Ideas of Charismatic Christianity (Eugene, Oregon: Wipf & Stock, 2017), 76. Teachings Distinctive Word of Faith teachings include physical, emotional, financial, relational, and spiritual healing or prosperity for those who skillfully manage their covenant with God.. The movement urges believers to speak what they desire, in agreement with the promises and provisions of the Bible, as an affirmation of God's plans and purposes. They believe this is what Jesus meant when he said in that believers shall have whatsoever they say and pray with faith. The term word of faith itself is derived from which speaks of the word of faith that we preach.. =Healing= The Word of Faith teaches that complete healing (of spirit, soul, and body) is included in Christ's atonement and therefore is available here and now to all who believe. Frequently cited is , \\"by his stripes we are healed\\", and , which says Jesus healed the sick so that \\"it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet, 'Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses'.\\" Because Isaiah speaks in the present tense (\\"we are healed\\"), Word of Faith teaches that believers should accept the reality of a healing that is already theirs, first by understanding that physical healing is part of the New Testament's promise of salvation. It is reinforced by confessing the Bible verses which assert this healing and believing them while rejecting doubt. This does not deny pain, sickness, or disease, but denies its right to supersede the gift of salvation in Isaiah 53:5 and many other passages.Kenneth E. Hagin, Right and Wrong Thinking, (Kenneth Hagin Ministries, 1966) According to adherents, sickness is generally Satan's attempt to rob believers of their divine right to total health.Jerry Savelle, If Satan Can't Steal Your Joy..., (Harrison House, 1982) =Prosperity= Word of Faith teaching holds that God wants his people to prosper in all areas of life, including finances, health, marriage, and relationships. Word of Faith teaches that God's blessing empowers his people to achieve the Bible's promises.Creflo Dollar, True Prosperity v. False Prosperity, Creflodollarministries.org Thus, suffering does not come from God, but from Satan.

Copeland posits that ‚Äúas the seeds of prosperity are planted in your heart, in your will and in your emotions...they eventually produce a great financial harvest.\\"‚ÄùKenneth Copeland, How to Prosper from the Inside Out, Kenneth Copeland Ministries, KCM.org =Faith and confession= In Word of Faith teaching, a central element of receiving from God is \\"confession\\", often called \\"positive confession\\" or \\"faith confession\\" by practitioners. While similar, it should not be confused with Norman Vincent Peale's positive thinking theology focusing on the individual, as evidenced by the motto, \\"Faith in God and believe in oneself\\". Noted Word of Faith teachers, such as Kenneth E. Hagin and Charles Capps, have argued that God created the universe by speaking it into existence (), and that God has endowed believers with this power. Thus, making a \\"positive confession\\" of God's promise and believing God's word stirs the power of resurrection which raised Christ from the dead ( ), and brings that promise to fulfilment. This teaching is interpreted from . A more recent variant of positive confession is \\"decree and declare\\".Denver Cheddie, Is Decree and Declare Scriptural?, Bible Issues, bibleissues.org Word of Faith preachers have called faith a \\"force\\".Kenneth Copeland, The Force of Faith, (KCP Publications, 1989) Conversely, \\"negative confession\\" can harm, so believers should be conscious of their words. This is argued on the interpretation of , \\"Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and they that love them will eat the fruit thereof\\", also , \\"...saith the Lord, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do\\", among other scriptures. Critics and controversy =Critics= Many of the movement's essential beliefs are often criticised by some Christians as diverging from Christian orthodoxy. Christian author Robert M. Bowman, Jr. states that the word of faith movement is \\"neither soundly orthodox nor thoroughly heretical\\".. One of the earliest critics of Word of Faith teaching was Oral Roberts University professor Charles Farah, who published From the Pinnacle of the Temple in 1979. In the book, Farah expressed his disillusionment with the teachings, which he argued were more about presumption than faith.. In 1982, one of Farah's students, Daniel Ray McConnell, submitted a thesis, Kenyon Connection, to the faculty at Oral Roberts University, tracing the teaching back through Hagin to Kenyon and ultimately to New Thought, and calling the distinctive Word of Faith beliefs a heretical \\"Trojan Horse\\" in the Christian church. McConnell's repeated this argument in his book, A Different Gospel, in 1988. One of McConnell's classmates, Dale H. Simmons, published his own doctoral research at Drew University, arguing that Kenyon was influenced by heterodox metaphysical movements and the Faith Cure movement of the nineteenth century. In 1990, The Agony of Deceit surveyed the critiques of Word of Faith doctrines. One of the authors, Christian Research Institute founder Walter Martin, issued his personal judgment that Kenneth Copeland was a false prophet and that the movement as a whole was heretical. Milder criticisms were made by William DeArteaga in his book Quenching the Spirit. He concedes some New Thought influence in Kenyon's teaching, but argues that Kenyon's views helped the church rediscover some biblical truths. Arguing similarly but in an opposite direction is Robert M. Bowman, Jr., formerly of the Christian Research Institute. His book The Word-Faith Controversy is more sympathetic to Kenyon's historical background yet more critical of his doctrine than is DeArteaga's work. Baptist evangelist Justin Peters, an outspoken critic of the Word of Faith movement, wrote his Master of Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has appeared frequently as an expert on Word of Faith pastors in documentaries and TV news stories. In his seminar \\"A Call for Discernment\\", he traces the movement's origins to the Phineas Quimby's New Thought Movement and Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In contrast, Pastor Joe McIntyre, now head of Kenyon's Gospel Publishing Society in Washington, argues that the primary influences of Kenyon were A.B. Simpson. and A.J. Gordon of the Faith Cure branch of the evangelical movement. McIntyre's version is told in the authorized biography, E.W. Kenyon: The True Story. That same year, Pentecostal scholar Gordon Fee wrote a series of articles denouncing what he called The Disease of the Health-and-Wealth Gospel. In 1993, Hank Hanegraaff's Christianity in Crisis charged the Word of Faith movement with heresy and accused many of its churches of being \\"cults.\\" He accused the Word of Faith teachers of \\"demoting\\" God and Jesus, and \\"deifying\\" man and Satan.Hank Hanegraaff, Christianity in Crisis, (Harvest House, 1993) Hanegraaff has focused a significant portion of his anti-heresy teaching since the 1990s on addressing and refuting Word of Faith teachings. Other critics, such as Norman Geisler, Dave Hunt and Roger Oakland, have denounced Word of Faith theology as aberrant and contrary to the teachings of the Bible. Critics have also condemned the teachings on wealth, arguing that the Bible condemns the pursuit of riches.\\"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\\" .\\"But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort\\", . John Piper points out that Christ warned the apostles that they would suffer great persecution for his sake: except John, all eleven, after Judas Iscariot, suffered martyrs' deaths. In a January 2006 sermon entitled \\"How our Suffering Advances the Gospel,\\" Piper stated bluntly that \\"the prosperity gospel will not make anybody praise Jesus; it will make people praise prosperity.\\" ='Little gods' controversy= Many Word of Faith teachers have sought to emphasize the full meaning of the believer's status as a child of God (through Christ) by using phrases such as \\"little gods\\" to describe them, a practice that has garnered some criticism from some other segments of the Christian community. Kenneth Hagin wrote that God \\"made us in the same class of being that he is himself,\\" and that the believer is \\"called Christ\\" because \\"that's who we are, we're Christ!\\"Kenneth E. Hagin, Zoe: The God-Kind of Life, (Kenneth Hagin Ministries, Inc., 1989) According to Hagin, by being \\"born again\\", the believer becomes \\"as much an incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth\\".Kenneth E. Hagin, \\"The Virgin Birth\\" in Word of Faith Magazine (December 1977) Hagin like Kenyon reasons that humans are made in God's image.

Although The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, citing the Bible and the early Christian church, teaches that men can become gods after eons of exaltation, the LDS scholar Stephen E. Robinson has declared the \\"little gods\\" teaching heretical.Robinson, Stephen E., Are Mormons Christians? ()Deification of Man - FairMormon http://en.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_the_nature_of_God/Deification_of_man (The LDS view is also considered heretical by mainstream Christianity.) Many Evangelical critics have condemned the \\"little gods\\" teaching as cultic; Hank Hanegraaff, for example, contends the 'little gods' doctrine is on a par with the teaching of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Jim Jones.Hank Hanegraaff, Christianity in Crisis, (Harvest House, 1992) Justin Peters, whose first encounter with Word of Faith doctrine came at the age of 16 when a faith healer \\"slayed [him] in the spirit\\" in an attempt to cure his cerebral palsy, states in A Call for Discernment that the \\"little gods\\" teaching is the foundation of the Word of Faith focus on health and wealth: \\"A god should never be sick, and a god should never be poor.\\"Peters, Justin, \\"A Call For Discernment\\", 2005-2006; retrieved 2008-03-18. Word of Faith defenders have responded that the teaching simply underscores the biblical view of the believer's \\"true identity in Christ\\". Critics, such as Christian apologist and CARM founder Matt Slick and Bible critique author W. Gary Phillips, believe referencing scriptures and , where it is said that men are gods, is using these Scriptures out of context.Christian Apologists Bible Commentary, ; retrieved May 15, 2008. These verses were originally addressed to the Judges of Israel, who they were called gods not because they were themselves divine, but because they pronounced the judgement of the true and only God. The Hebrew and Greek words used in both Scriptures for \\"gods\\" can also be applied to magistrates, and may be translated as \\"mighty\\".Dictionary to the Hebrew Bible by James Strong, no. 430 However, Jesus himself uses this same passage, in John 10, to refer to his own divinity. =Jesus died spiritually= Jesus died spiritually (abbreviated JDS) is a view of the substitutionary atonement of Christ in which Jesus is considered to have suffered both physical death (on the cross) and spiritual death (in Hell) as the complete penalty for sin. In this view, spiritual death (defined as separation from God) is considered the ultimate penalty for original sin, and proponents assert that Jesus must have suffered the complete penalty for sin in order for his substitutionary sacrifice to be effective. Accordingly, those who support the JDS view also teach that Jesus was spiritually born again at his resurrection. Not all Word of Faith teachers believe this, rather preaching something similar to the Harrowing of Hell. The Word of Faith group does believe that the Harrowing of Hell was part of the plan of redemption, and that Jesus himself was never a sinner, but on the cross Jesus was forsaken by God as a payment for all sins. E.W. Kenyon, a minister important to the Word of Faith movement and some other Pentecostal denominations, popularized the idea that Jesus died spiritually in his books What Happened From The Cross To the Throne and Identification: A Romance In Redemption. It is claimed that Kenneth E. Hagin taught JDS ideas but such citations are singletons taken out of context.D.R. McConnell, A Different Gospel, updated edition, (Hendrickson, 1995), p117 Kenneth Hagin mentioned Jesus harrowing hell in The Name of Jesus (1978 edition), which has caused many to believe that he supported JDS. Kenneth Copeland did claim that Jesus suffered in Hell, nor that Christ's resurrection parallels the believer's born again experience. While it is not a central doctrine of the movement, it has received some condemnation for this belief. For example, D.R. McConnell claims the teaching to be heresy.D.R.

These cavities, known collectively as the ventricular system, consist of the left and right lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The fourth ventricle extends from the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) to the obex, and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The fourth ventricle has a characteristic diamond shape in cross- sections of the human brain. It is located within the pons or in the upper part of the medulla oblongata. CSF entering the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct can exit to the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord through two lateral apertures and a single, midline median aperture. Boundaries Fourth ventricle location shown in red (E), pons (B); the floor of the ventricle is to the right, the roof to the left The fourth ventricle has a roof at its upper (posterior) surface and a floor at its lower (anterior) surface, and side walls formed by the cerebellar peduncles (nerve bundles joining the structure on the posterior side of the ventricle to the structures on the anterior side). The caudal tip of the fourth ventricle - where it becomes the central canal - is known as the obex; the obex is also a marker for the level of the foramen magnum of the skull and therefore is a marker for the imaginary dividing line between the medulla and spinal cord The superior portion of the roof (i.e. of the posterior edge) is a thin lamina - the superior medullary velum - connecting the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles together. The inferior portion of the roof - the inferior medullary velum - has a tricorn cross section, directed caudally and laterally, and is formed by the Cerebellum directly. Near each of the 3 corners of the inferior roof is an opening into the cisterna magna, the caudal opening being the foramen Magendie, while the lateral openings are the foramina of Luschka. The roof rises (i.e. posteriorly) to a peak, known as the fastigium (Latin for \\"summit\\"); the fastigial nucleus lies immediately above the roof of the fourth ventricle, in the cerebellum. The floor (i.e. the anterior edge) of the fourth ventricle constitutes the rhomboid fossa, and comprises a number of general features. A sulcus - the median sulcus - extends the length of the ventricle (from the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain to the central canal of the spinal cord), dividing the floor into right and left halves. Each half is further divided by a further sulcus - the sulcus limitans - along a line parallel to the median sulcus; within the floor, motor neurons are located medially of the sulcus limitans, while sensory neurons are located laterally. The elevation between the median sulcus and sulcus limitans (i.e. the region for motor neurons), is known as the medial eminence, while the lateral region (i.e. that for the sensory neurons) is known as the vestibular area. The sulcus limitans bifurcates at either end - the superior fovea cerebrally, and the inferior fovea caudally. The pons is located behind the middle and superior portion of the floor. In the superior region of the pons is the locus coeruleus, which due to its concentration of noradrenaline has a sky blue appearance, visible (in a colour closer to teal) through the floor of the ventricle, superiorly to the superior fovea. The internal part of the facial nerve bulges into the ventricle, forming the facial colliculus, in the process of looping around the abducens nucleus within the inferior region of the Pons. The medulla oblongata is located behind the inferior portion of the floor (and continues caudally of the ventricle). Medullary striae emerge via the median sulcus and run transversely across the floor to become part of the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The hypoglossal nucleus bulges into the floor, creating the hypoglossal trigone, located slightly superiorly to the inferior fovea, within the median eminance. The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve, within the medulla oblongata, comprises cells that are spindle shaped, also creating a bulge‚Äîthe vagal trigone‚Äîin the region of the floor which overlies them; this is the region inferior of the inferior fovea.  Development  The ventricular system including the fourth ventricle, develops from the central canal of the neural tube. Specifically, the fourth ventricle originates from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing rhombencephalon. During the first trimester of pregnancy the central canal expands into the lateral, third and fourth ventricles, connected by thinner channels. Choroid plexuses appear in the ventricles which produce cerebrospinal fluid. If the flow of fluid is blocked ventricles may become enlarged and cause hydrocephalus. Clinical significance The fourth ventricle is a common location of an intracranial ependymomal tumour.

He was born January 18, 1830 in Ohrid, Ottoman Empire and died in the same town January 25, 1893. Although he thought of himself as a Bulgarian,Raymond Detrez, Grigor Parlichev‚Äôs Autobiography as a ‚Äúself- hagiography‚Äù, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Journal: –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞ –º–∏—Å—ä–ª, 2015, Issue No: 2, Page Range: 56-79. Summary/Abstract: Among the many Bulgarian autobiographies written in the national revival period, that by Grigor Parlichev one occupies a particular place due to its highly fictional nature. On the one hand, the author provides very little factual information on the historical developments he participated in; on the other hand, he widely elaborates on events with little documentary relevance, inserting dramatic dialogues that cannot possibly be authentic. These particularities of Parlichev‚Äôs Autobiography can be explained assuming that Parlichev used the medieval zhitiye (hagiography, vita) as a model for his own biography. Strikingly, nearly all the topoi of the zhitiye as described by Th. Pratsch in his exhaustive Der hagiographische Topos. Griechische Heiligenviten in mittelbyzantinischer Zeit (Berlin, New York, 2005) also feature in Parlichev‚Äôs work, moreover in roughly the same order. The most elaborate episodes in Parlichev‚Äôs Autobiography ‚Äï his victory at the Athenian poetry contest on 1860, which made him a Greek celebrity, and the weeks he spent in prison in Ohrid and Debar in 1868 ‚Äï transpire to be secularized versions (in the spirit of national revival) of the main topoi in most hagiographies: the temptation of the saint and his or her suffering for the sake of Christ. As a result, Parlichev succeeds in similarly representing himself in his Autobiography as a ‚Äúmartyr‚Äù for the Bulgarian national cause. Happily for the reader, this whole operation is accompanied by a refreshing dose of (unconscious?) self-irony that sometimes makes Parlichev‚Äôs Autobiography remind of Sofroniy‚Äôs Life and sufferings. according to the post-WWII Macedonian historiography,\\"Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.\\" For more see: Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture.\\"At any rate, the beginning of the active national-historical direction with the historical ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù, which was for the first time possible in 1944, developed in Macedonia much harder than was the case with the creation of the neighbouring nations of the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and others in the 19th century. These neighbours almost completely \\"plundered\\" the historical events and characters from the land, and there was only debris left for the belated nation. A consequence of this was that first that parts of the ‚Äúplundered history‚Äù were returned, and a second was that an attempt was made to make the debris become a fundamental part of an autochthonous history. This resulted in a long phase of experimenting and revising, during which the influence of non-scientific instances increased. This specific link of politics with historiography in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia... was that this was a case of mutual dependence, i.e. influence between politics and historical science, where historians do not simply have the role of registrars obedient to orders. For their significant political influence, they had to pay the price for the rigidity of the science... There is no similar case of mutual dependence of historiography and politics on such a level in Eastern or Southeast Europe.\\" For more see: Stefan Trobest, ‚ÄúHistorical Politics and Histrocial ‚ÄòMasterpieces‚Äô in Macedonia before and after 1991‚Äù, New Balkan Politics, 6 (2003).\\"The origins of the official Macedonian national narrative are to be sought in the establishment in 1944 of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian.\\" For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301. he was an ethnic Macedonian.  Biography  Parlichev studied in a Greek school in Ohrid. In the 1850s he worked as a teacher of Greek in the towns of Tirana, Prilep and Ohrid. In 1858 Parlichev started studying medicine in Athens but transferred to the Faculty of Linguistics in 1860. The same year he took part in the annual poetic competition in Athens winning first prize for his poem \\"O Armatolos\\" (Œü ŒëœÅŒºŒ±œÑœâŒªœåœÇ, in Bulgarian \\"The Serdar\\"), written in Greek. Acclaimed as \\"second Homer\\", he was offered scholarships to the universities at Oxford and Berlin. At that time he was pretending to be a Greek, but the public opinion in Athens emphasized his non-Greek origin. Disappointed Parlichev declined offered scholarships and returned to Ohrid in the next year.Elka Agoston-Nikolova ed., Shoreless Bridges: South East European Writing in Diaspora, Rodopi, 2010, , pp. 56-57. The house of Grigor Prliƒçev in Ohrid, North Macedonia In 1862 Parlichev joined the struggle for independent Bulgarian church and schools, though he continued to teach Greek. After spending some time in Constantinople in 1868 acquainting himself with Church Slavonic literature, he returned to Ohrid where he advocated the substitution of Greek with Bulgarian in the town's schools and churches. The same year Parlichev was arrested and spent several months in an Ottoman jail after a complaint was sent by the Greek bishop of Ohrid. At that time he began to study of standard Bulgarian, or, as he called it himself, the Slavonic language.Jolanta Sujecka, Institute of Slavic Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Profile of Grigor Prliƒçev, (Grigorios Stawridis), p. 240. From this time until his death Parlichev continued writing only in Bulgarian. From 1869 Parlichev taught Bulgarian in several towns across Ottoman Empire, including Struga, Gabrovo, Bitola, Ohrid and Thessaloniki. He initiated the creation of the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. In 1870 Parlichev translated his award-winning poem \\"The Serdar\\" into Bulgarian in an attempt to popularize his earlier works, which were written in Greek, among the Bulgarian audience. He also wrote another poem \\"Skenderbeg\\". Parlichev was the first Bulgarian translator of Homer's Iliad in 1871, though critics were highly critical of his language. Parlichev used a specific mixture of Church Slavonic and his native Ohrid dialect. He is therefore also regarded as a founding figure of the literature of the later standardized Macedonian language.L. M. Danforth: The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Princeton University Press 1995, p.50, 62. In 1883 Parlichev moved to Thessaloniki, where he taught at the Thessaloniki Bulgarian Male High School (1883-1889). In the period April 16, 1884 - May 1, 1885 he wrote his autobiography. After his retirement in 1890, he returned to Ohrid, where he died on January 25, 1893. Parlichev's son Cyril Parlichev was also a prominent member of the revolutionary movement in Macedonia and a Bulgarian public figure. = Identification = Per Raymond Detrez, who is an expert of the issue,In 1986, Detrez received his Ph. D. from the University of Ghent. In his thesis, he investigated nineteenth century Balkan nationalism on the basis of the life and work of the poet and activist Grigor Parlichev (Ohrid 1831-1893). in his early life Parlichev was a member of the ‚ÄúRomaic community‚Äù, a multi- ethnic proto-nation, to comprise all Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire. It had been under way until the 1830s, when the rise of Greek nationalism destroyed it and that lead later to the formation of the modern nations on the Balkans. Parlchev, is seen by Detrez as belonging basically to the Romaic community, and initially he had no well-defined sense of national identification. However in his youth he developed Greek,Although modern Greek identity has been based on this assumption of continuity, the \\"proper\\" geographical boundaries of Greece and the ethnic characteristics of the Greeks remained vague for some time. Only during the second half of the nineteenth century did the consolidation of the national narrative take place. As late as 1824, the Phanariot Theodore Negris identified Serbs and Bulgarians as Greeks, a definition that was closer to that of the Orthodox religious community of the Rum millet than to the definition of a modern secular Greek identity. But between 1839 and 1852 an important ideological change occurred... The gradual rise of the Bulgarian national movement, and the religious revival within the Greek kingdom all collided, suggesting the need for a different evaluation of Greece's historical past... and transforming the religiously based identity of the Rum millet into a modern, secular national identity. But this project did not put down strong roots in the local \\"Romaic\\" popular consciousness. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question. Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301. and as an adult, finally he adopted Bulgarian national identity.Yordan Ljuckanov, Bulgarian Cultural Identity as a Borderline One, INTERLITTERARIA 2015, 20/2: 88‚Äì104, p. 96. DOI: https://doi.org/10.12697/IL.2015.20.2.9 . In the last decade of his life, he adhered some form of vague local patriotism, though continued to identify himself as a Bulgarian. In this way Parlichev‚Äôs national identity has been used by Macedonian historians to prove the existence of some kind of alleged Macedonian ethnic identification during the late 19th century.Raymond Detrez, Canonization through Competition: The Case of Grigor PƒÉrliƒçev, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 2007, Journal: –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞ –º–∏—Å—ä–ª, Issue No: 1, Page Range: 61-101, Summary/Abstract: The normal criteria for an author to be included in a national literary canon are that he should belong to the nation to which the canon is related, that he must write in the nation‚Äôs (standard) language, and that his work is of reasonable size and aesthetic value. A criterion of secondary importance, valid in societies marked by nationalism, may also contribute to an author‚Äôs canonization: the ‚Äúnational‚Äù character of his work in the sense that it deals with national themes, displays the national identity, or attests to the author‚Äôs devotion to the national cause ‚Äî a devotion preferably supported by his real-life heroism or martyrdom. PƒÉrliƒçev‚Äôs canonization has proven to be problematic in all respects. To which nation did he actually belong? In his youth he had no well-defined sense of national identity and probably considered himself a ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù in the sense of being a Greek Orthodox Christian. As an adult he explicitly identified himself initially with the Greek and later with the Bulgarian nation. In the later decades of his life, he seemed to have been inclined to adhere to some form of vague local particularism, though apparently continuing to perceive himself as a Bulgarian. Given this evolution, it is understandable that PƒÉrliƒçev‚Äôs national identity grew into a sensitive issue in the framework of discussions about the existence of Macedonian nation between Bulgarian and Macedonian (literary) historians...\\"Until the late 19th century both outside observers and those Bulgaro-Macedonians who had an ethnic consciousness believed that their group, which is now two separate nationalities, comprised a single people, the Bulgarians. Thus the reader should ignore references to ethnic Macedonians in the Middle ages which appear in some modern works. In the Middle ages and into the 19th century, the term ‚ÄòMacedonian‚Äô was used entirely in reference to a geographical region. Anyone who lived within its confines, regardless of nationality could be called a Macedonian. Nevertheless, the absence of a national consciousness in the past is no grounds to reject the Macedonians as a nationality today.\\" \\"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century,\\" John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1991, , pp. 36‚Äì37.

He is one of the series' main villains and notable for his wrinkly face despite being a young man.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gould.htm Fictional character biography Pruneface's surname is Boche, a typically Dickensian-style naming of a character by Gould, since \\"Boche\\" is a French derogatory term for \\"German\\". He is a brilliant industrial engineer with a horribly deformed face. He sells out to the Nazis and is involved in espionage against the United States, as well as the development of nerve gas. Pruneface first appeared (and apparently died) in 1942, having nearly frozen to death due to exposure during a shootout with the police. The character was revived in 1983. The 1983 story explains that he had been used in an early cryogenics experiment by Dr. Kryos Freezdrei and is reanimated using modern medicine. Freezdrei uses Pruneface's revival as a publicity stunt, however, to advertise the services of his cryogenics institute to the wealthy and gullible, whom the doctor and Pruneface plan to bilk for millions which would go towards funding neo-Nazi groups. This storyline ends with the bombing of the institute, Freezdrei's apparent death and Pruneface's disappearance, all at the hands of a Mossad agent. A cryogenics tube containing the frozen body of Adolf Hitler can be seen in the background as a fire destroys both him and the institute.Dick Tracy's Fiendish Foes! A 60th Anniversary Celebration - 1991, St. Martins Press, page 272. A later story arc explains, mostly through an extended flashback, that prior to his first meeting with Tracy, Pruneface led an espionage ring for the Axis powers to acquire a new secret formula for the deadly Xylon bomb, a non-radioactive explosive capable of devastating 10 city blocks. Xylon was developed by Professor Roloc Bard, a mad scientist who was taken hostage by a fake swami named Yogee Yammi during an earlier storyline of the 1940s. The ring consisted of Pruneface (hidden from the readers, going by Boche until halfway through the storyline) and his wife, Mrs. Pruneface, Shaky Trembly, Flattop Jones and his gang, and Frieda Smith (the professor's love interest and a secret Bundist). Pruneface kidnaps Bard and forces him to build several of the bombs, all of which but one is seized by Tracy and FBI agent Jim Trailer, hence the reason for the story being \\"suppressed\\" during the actual war. Returning to the present, de-classified documents on the Xylon case show that the case was still unsolved and that one final bomb was still out there, as potent and deadly as ever. This leads Tracy, Wendy Wichel and FBI Agent Jim Trailer to finding the last bomb hidden 10 blocks away from the Oval Office in an elderly Frieda Smith's basement. Right after she is arrested by Tracy and Jim Trailer, the bomb is defused. Her empty house soon after receives a telephone call from Pruneface to set the bomb off, causing him and Dr. Freezdrei to change their plans and go back into hiding. Freezdrei would eventually die in an explosion. Pruneface made one final reappearance in 1999, being held in a Mossad prison. He was the target of a liberation attempt by his granddaughter Prunella and great-granddaughter Prune Hilda, but the plan failed at the last second, and Pruneface was sent plunging to his death from a mountain gondola. His final words were \\"Sieg Heil\\". In other media Pruneface is a featured villain in The Dick Tracy Show, a syndicated animated children's program which aired in the 1960s. He is voiced by either Mel Blanc or Paul Frees, and his vocal characterization is modeled after that of Boris Karloff. His complexion is lavender, lending him the color and wrinkled look of an actual prune. He is nearly always partnered with Itchy Oliver. As The Dick Tracy Show was produced by UPA, which also produced the original Mr. Magoo cartoons, Pruneface appeared in an episode of The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo. In this Tracy/Magoo crossover episode entitled, \\"Dick Tracy and the Mob\\", Pruneface is depicted as the chairman of a mob organization, the other board members consisting of fellow Tracy villains Flattop, Ichy Oliver, the Brow, Mumbles, the Mole, and Oodles. The character also makes a brief appearance in the 1990 film adaptation of Dick Tracy, in which he is portrayed by R. G. Armstrong. In this adaptation, he is an American mobster, operating in Tracy's city, who accepts Big Boy Caprice as his superior. He is eventually gunned down by the Blank. In Kyle Baker's graphic novels that served as prequels to the movie, Pruneface's real name is given as Lorenzo Prunesti. In the 1943 Looney Tunes cartoon short Porky Pig's Feat by Frank Tashlin, Daffy Duck confronts the manager of the Broken Arms Hotel, pretending to be intimidated by something he said. Daffy moves closer to his face so intensely that it is pushed inward, making it resemble a prune. Daffy, noticing this, says to the audience, \\"Hey, look! A Dick Tracy character: Pruneface!\\" Another Looney Tunes short, 1946's The Great Piggy Bank Robbery by Bob Clampett, has Daffy (as \\"Duck Twacy\\") encountering a pack of Dick Tracy-style villains, including an obvious Pruneface parody called \\"Pickle Puss\\". Pruneface appears in Jason Yungbluth's 2002 graphic novel Weapon Brown, which re-imagines many syndicated comic strip characters in a post-apocalyptic setting, as a member of the Syndicate, a group of crime lords and scientists ruling over a post- apocalyptic America. The group also consists of \\"Chairman Horns\\" (the Pointy- Haired Boss from Dilbert), Mary Worth, Uncle Duke from Doonsbury, and (until Horns brutally kills him) Mr. Dithers from Blondie. Pruneface, alongside the Brow, is one of the antagonists in Dick Tracy Forever.

The park is located in Preston's Conservation area and leads down to the banks of the River Ribble. It was designed and built in the 1860s. Overview As an Historic England Grade II* listed park, it features a number of historical structures such as The Belvedere, The Swiss Chalet, The Boer War Memorial and Riverside Walk. The park is one of two city centre Victorian parks in Preston, the other being its neighbour - Miller Park. The two parks are separated by the East Lancashire Railway embankment and access is through the Ivy Bridge and along Riverside Walk. The East Lancashire Railway line closed in the 1970s although the viaduct across the river, which is a Grade II listed building, remains. The park was designed by Edward Milner as a \\"harmonious whole\\" including the adjacent Miller Park. The park includes long open lawn areas and hosts a number of annual events throughout the year. Most notable among its many features is the Japanese garden or Rock Garden, which was added in the 1930s when this type of design became fashionable. The Belvedere (in 2007, before renovation) Another major feature of the park is The Belvedere, a pavilion on high ground at the northeastern corner of the park, overlooking the main park and river. It was originally located in Miller Park but was moved to make way for the statue of the Earl of Derby. The Belvedere is known locally as the \\"White House\\" or the \\"Light House\\". tramway bridge across the Ribble A path on the northern edge of the park follows the route of the Old Tram Road, which used to link the northern and southern parts of the Lancaster Canal. The path descends an incline to the River Ribble. On the site of the current Belvedere was once a stationary steam engine that hauled waggons up the hill. The path crosses the river on a concrete footbridge built in the 1960s on the site of the original tramway trestle bridge. The modern bridge has been built in the same style as the original wooden structure. The field in the centre of the park has a gentle slope towards the river, and acts as a natural amphitheatre. The original Victorian Bandstand was demolished and replaced with a brick and concrete stage during the 1950s to enable the area to be used for concerts. This construction had surprisingly good acoustic qualities but fell into disuse and was demolished in March 2006, although the Park is still used for many local and regional annual events. These include Preston's Mela, which celebrates the culture of the city's large Asian community and on Easter Monday children have traditionally rolled decorated eggs down its grassy slopes since Victorian times. Bands and musicians such as Oasis, The Spice Girls, Natasha Bedingfield, Sushi, Mark Owen, and Labyrinth have also performed in Avenham Park in more recent years. In general, the layout of the park is little changed from when the park was first laid out. An 1889 map still provides an accurate representation of the park today. The inauguration of the park Preston's Avenham Park, Moor Park and Miller Park were inaugurated on the same day that the former Town Hall was opened in 1867. On September 28, 1867 the Preston Chronicle commented that the preparations were in place and that the expectation was that \\"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we shall have a gayer, a busier, and a more bustling town than we have had on any previous occasion, excepting, perhaps, at some of our Guilds\\".The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser, 28 September 1867, p.5, col. e The following week's edition for October 5, 1887 devoted several columns to \\"The Opening of the New Town Hall and Inauguration of the Parks\\". It was a civic event of considerable size and importance and when the opening ceremony for the town hall was concluded a procession was formed which made its way to Avenham and Miller Parks. Schoolchildren from across Preston had gathered in the parks and it was estimated that 23000 -25000 were in present. The Duke of Cambridge, cousin of Queen Victoria, was in attendance and the band of the Third Royal Lancashire Militia entertained the crowds.The Preston Chronicle and Lancashire Advertiser, 05 October 1867, p.6, col. c Recent developments As part of a multi-million pound Heritage Lottery-funded restoration project, both Avenham and Miller Parks have undergone a facelift over the last few years. The refurbishment, which is nearing completion, included restoration of all of the historical features (including The Belvedere, The Boer War Memorial etc.), improved lighting and footpaths, vehicle controls and a new Pavilion incorporating a caf√©, better public toilets and a police post and acting as a base for dedicated park staff. These improvements are intended to make the park cleaner and safer, and provide more events and activities for the people of Preston. The old stage, which was removed in early 2006, was replaced by a small performance area and facilities to install temporary concert stages like those used at music festivals throughout the country. An architectural design competition was launched by RIBA Competitions and McChesney Architects were chosen by Preston City Council and in September 2008 the new Pavilion, with its cafe, opened. A programme of public lunchtime walks has been scheduled and the function room may also be booked. Attractive new lamps have been installed on the pathways leading to the Pavilion. The Japanese garden has also been restored and improved. As part of the refurbishment, the path along the railway embankment and the viaduct was widened and given a hard surface. The Council intends to open this path onto the Fishergate Centre car park, to allow direct pedestrian and cycle access from the railway. In April 2015 an unexploded military mortar bomb was discovered by metal detectorists near the park. An area close to the Old Tram Bridge was cordoned off.

In both cases the name is a pseudonym: the author's name has been lost, while the character goes unnamed. In the court manners of the time (the Heian Period), it was considered unacceptably familiar and vulgar to freely address people by either their personal or family names. As a result, the real name of the author is lost, and she was called \\"Murasaki Shikibu\\", as an alias: Murasaki after the heroine she invented; Shikibu after her father's official rank. The author Murasaki was an aristocrat, the daughter of a provincial governor who probably belonged to a minor branch of the Fujiwara clan. She served as a lady-in- waiting to Empress Shoshi, a daughter of Fujiwara Michinaga, and was a literary contemporary and rival of Sei Sh≈çnagon. When Murasaki Shikibu wrote The Tale of Genji, she followed the customs of her class and time, so that most of the characters in the novel are never identified by name, but rather by either their rank and title (in the case of male persons), rank and title of their male relatives (in the case of female persons), or after the name of their habitation (in the case of the great court ladies). As such, the Genji character Murasaki is often referred to as the \\"Lady of the West Wing\\". This phrase is typically replaced with \\"Murasaki\\" in commentaries and translations to improve readability. The author's contemporaries also referred to this character by this name, and nicknamed the author after her. The name Murasaki is inspired by a poem that the novel's hero, Genji, improvises when contemplating his first meeting with the novel's heroine, the little girl who will grow up to be \\"Murasaki\\". \\"How glad I would be to pick and soon to make mine that little wild plant sprung up from the very root shared by the murasaki.\\"The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, translated by Royall Tyler, 2001, , p. 100 is the Japanese word for the color purple. Other translations include Lavender, as used by Edward Seidensticker in his English version of the Genji Monogatari; Violet; and Violet Root, which in Japanese poetry denotes love and constancy. Genji, in his poem, names the murasaki or purple gromwell, because its color resembles the color of the wisteria (in Japanese, fuji) thereby obliquely referring to Fujitsubo, \\"the Lady of the Wisteria Court\\", a woman he is violently in love with for the first part of the novel. This lady Fujitsubo is little Murasaki's aunt. Thus, in a word association game very characteristic of Japanese poetry, the similarity between two colors - the deep purple of the violet, and the light purple of the wisteria - led to the name Murasaki, a well-known name in Japanese literature.

His books mainly feature short stories that lead the reader through an unusual series of events that end with a twist. Early life and education Paul Jennings was born on 30 April 1943 in Heston, Middlesex (now part of Hounslow in London). In 1949 his family emigrated to Australia. He first attended Bentleigh West Primary School in Bentleigh, a suburb of Melbourne, and then Caulfield Grammar School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Education Studies from Frankston Teachers College at Monash University in 1978 and taught at Frankston State School, Kangaroo Flat State School, the Turana Youth Training Centre and the Royal Children's Hospital State School in Mount Eliza. He then went to the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences (now part of Monash). Career After graduating, he became a speech pathologist that he became a lecturer in special education at the Burwood State College and then, in 1979, Senior Lecturer in Language and Literature at Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education (both now part of Deakin University). In 1985, Jennings' first book of short stories, Unreal!, was published, during which he worked as a teacher, lecturer and speech therapist. In 1989, he made the decision to devote himself full-time to writing. He began writing for children when his son, aged 11, was having trouble reading. Jennings' short stories were adapted for the first two seasons of children's television series Round the Twist in 1989 and 1992, and then later in 1998 for the only season of series Driven Crazy. In 2020 Jennings' memoir, Untwisted: The Story of My Life, was published by Allen & Unwin. Jennings started writing it ten years earlier, and is his longest piece of writing. In it, he examines many aspects of his life, including harbouring feelings of guilt about not liking his cold and emotionally abusive father, and having thoughts of attacking him with a hammer. Personal life Jennings first married aged 22. He has six children, and is a great-grandfather.

It works jointly with the Rugby Football League through the RFL Community Board. History BARLA was created in 1973 in Huddersfield at the George Hotel by a group of enthusiasts concerned about the dramatic disappearance of many amateur leagues and clubs. Fewer than 150 amateur teams remained with a mere thirty youth rugby league teams. The 'breakaway' from the RFL was acrimonious and was strongly contested with a vote 29‚Äì1 against recognising BARLA. Thanks to Tom Mitchell, this changed to a unanimous vote of approval for BARLA within twelve months. One of BARLA's first acts was to merge the vast majority of the district leagues into five regional leagues: the Yorkshire League (initially still called the Leeds & District League), the short-lived Cumbria League, the West Yorkshire Sunday League, the Pennine League and the North Western Counties League. For geographical reasons the Hull & District League (renamed Humberside League) and the Southern League were left unmerged. This allowed clubs to play at more appropriate standards as there were more divisions, and this factor along with the improved governance of BARLA saw the standard and numbers of clubs rise quickly. The Yorkshire County Cup and Lancashire County Cup knock-out competitions were started in 1973 as well as the BARLA National Cup. In 1977 BARLA toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time. In that year the BARLA Young Lions made their first inaugural tour setting a lasting trend by giving future stars of the game such as David Hobbs their first taste of international rugby league. A Cumbria County Cup was started in 1982. The best amateur clubs were still divided between six leagues and thus the desire for an amateur National League arose. The BARLA National League first took place in the 1986/1987 season with 10 teams. The association has always been a champion of the amateur ethos and in 1987 BARLA played a major role in the establishment of the 'free gangway' between the two codes at amateur level. The agreement allowed players to inter-change between rugby league and rugby union without fear of discrimination. The BARLA National League soon proved popular and the 1989/90 season also saw the addition of a second division. On 30 November 1990, BARLA's new headquarters at West Yorkshire House, Huddersfield was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1993, BARLA provided the first Great Britain team to tour South Africa. The BARLA National League was rebranded the National Conference League and expanded to three divisions (now named premier, first and second) in 1993. By 1999, there were more than 1,400 teams and 900 youth and junior teams. On an average weekend in the season, almost 23,000 players will be in action. BARLA's work in the international expansion of the game was recognised by their inclusion as affiliate members of the International Federation (equivalent to the International Board at the time) in 1999 and by BARLA's inclusion in the Emerging Nations World Championship in 2000. BARLA won the Emerging Nations World Championship beating Italy 20‚Äì14 in the final. Competitions BARLA runs many leagues, mainly based in the 'heartland' areas of the sport (Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria). The top division under their control is the National Conference League, with regional leagues including the North West Counties, Yorkshire, Cumberland, Pennine Hull & District and Barrow & District leagues. Its top knock-out competition is the BARLA National Cup and there are county cups for Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria. There is an InterTown Series played over the summer between sides representing different districts. It also runs youth leagues such as the Yorkshire Combination Youth League and Hull Youth and Junior. There are county cups at age group level, known as the Yorkshire Youth Cup, Lancashire Youth Cup and the Cumbria Youth Cup. Representative rugby league BARLA selects an international team consisting of community players, the BARLA Lions. This team tours many parts of the rugby league world, and have competed in the Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament. The association has made 31 tours to and from the Southern Hemisphere. These include pioneer visits with matches against Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands and South Africa. In the Northern Hemisphere games have been played against Moldova, Russia, Morocco Pakistan and the USA. =Cumbria= North West Allerdale, Barrow & South Lakes, Copeland and Eden =North West= Halton, Lancashire, Rochdale, Oldham, Salford, St Helens, Warrington & Cheshire, Wigan & Leigh, fylde =Yorkshire= Bradford, Calderdale, Hull, Kirklees, Leeds, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Wakefield =Non-heartlands= London & South East, North East, Scotland, Wales See also * Rugby Football League * Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament * Victory Cup * Rugby league in England External links * BARLA Official Website * Lancashire Service Area * Hull & District Youth & Junior * Yorkshire Combination Youth League Amateur rugby league Rugby Organisations based in Huddersfield Sports organizations established in 1973 Rugby league governing bodies in Europe Rugby league in the United Kingdom Sport in Huddersfield Rugby 1973 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"British Amateur Rugby League Association"},{"id":"984827","text":"Martock is a large village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels north west of Yeovil in the South Somerset district. The parish includes Hurst, approximately one mile south of the village, and Bower Hinton, which is located at the western end of the village and bounded by Hurst and the A303. Martock has a population of 4,766 and was historically a market town.West Country Genealogy Martock Parish, Somerset History =Etymology= Martock was known in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Mertoch. It means ‚ÄòRising bright from the shining sea‚Äô from the Old English ‚Äòmeretorht‚Äô. It was the property of Queen Edith (Eagdith), wife of Godwin and mother of Earl Harold (Harold II). By 1066 it was the property of Queen Edith, wife of Edward the Confessor. The word root ‚ÄòMer-‚Äô can also refer to ‚Äòa boundary or shore line‚Äô from the Old English ‚Äòmaere‚Äô. It is possible that the name included the Old English element ‚Äòstoc‚Äô meaning ‚Äòby a lake‚Äô. An alternative theory to the origin of the name Martock comes from the Old English words \\"mart\\" meaning market and \\"ac\\" for oak. This might relate to an oak tree on the spot now occupied by the Market House or more precisely the column there. Ekwall suggested that the name derives from ‚Äòmerkestoc‚Äô meaning ‚Äòa place on a boundary‚Äô. However, Prebendary G.W. Saunders, vicar of Martock from 1917 to 1951, cites two more possibilities. Firstly, from Collinson, who wrote in 1790, that the name Martock is derived from ‚Äòmarket oak‚Äô. But unfortunately Martock was not granted a market until 1247 and long before that it was called by this name. His second suggestion is that the name is derived from a Celtic personal name ‚ÄòMerti‚Äô, who gave his name to a settlement, hence Merti-oc, the settlement of Merti. Both of these seem to be flights of fancy.‚ÄòThe Hundred of Martock‚Äô, Prebendary G.W. Saunders, Yeovil (Western Gazette), 1933-34. Bower Hinton was called ‚ÄòHanton Mertoc‚Äô in 1225 and ‚ÄòBurhenton‚Äô in 1280. ‚ÄòHinton‚Äô meaning a poor enclosure, from the Old English ‚Äòhean‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô. Newton means the new enclosure from the Old English ‚Äòniwe‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô. The medieval hamlet of Newton, which lay between Bower Hinton and Hurst, was first referred to in 1327. Stapleton was first recorded in 1195. It means the steep enclosure from the Old English ‚Äòsteap‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô. Alternatively it may be from the Old English ‚Äòstapel‚Äô and ‚Äòtun‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòsettlement by a post‚Äô. =Domesday book= Martock had a single entry in the Domesday book and expanded rapidly in the succeeding years to include dependent settlements at Bower Hinton, Hurst, Newton, Coat, Stapleton, Ash, Witcombe, Milton and Long Load, expanding between 1086 and 1302 from 89 tenants to more than 200. It was the only parish in the Martock Hundred. =Later history= In 1810 1,025 acres of common land were enclosed as a result of the Inclosure Acts. The village was once a junction on local branches of the Great Western Railway, now dismantled. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. An electoral ward exists in the same name. Although Martock is the most populous area the ward stretches north to Long Load. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 5,724. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Notable dwelling houses include Church Lodge. Local places of interest include the Burrow Hill Cider Farm. The Parrett Iron Works was a series of industrial buildings next to the River Parrett. The site was originally named Carey's Mill and the adjoining bridge is called Carey's Mill Bridge which was built of Ham stone in the 18th century. The Iron Works was founded in 1855, on the site of a former snuff mill. The site included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keepers cottage still exist. The hamstone Market House on Church Street was built around 1753 and restored and reopened in 1960. It is a Grade II listed building. Grants of over ¬£200,000 have been obtained to restore the building and establish a community office. In front of the Market House is a Market Cross, also known as The Pinnacle, with a column which dates from 1741 with a fluted Tuscan column, on a stepped plinth, which supports a ball finial crowned with a wrought-iron weathervane. Madey Mill is a Grade II* listed watermill with medieval origins. The current buildings date from the 17th century. It has suffered from a lack of maintenance and has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. Religious sites The Church of All Saints dates from the 13th century. It was acquired by the Treasurer of Wells Cathedral in 1227 and he became the rector and patron of the church. The church was restored by Benjamin Ferrey, who was architect to the Diocese of Bath and Wells from 1841 until his death, and also in 1883‚Äì84 by Ewan Christian. The tower was built in four stages, to replace the previous one over the central crossing. It has offset corner buttresses to the full height of the tower. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. It is said to be the second largest in Somerset and has unique carved wooden statues in the eaves.

Creech St Michael was part of the hundred of Andersfield. The Bridgwater & Taunton Canal provides a picturesque route through the village for pleasure boats, and the towpath is open to pedestrians and cyclists. There are also dramatic remains of the Chard Canal, including the (filled) junction with the Bridgwater & Taunton Canal, a raised embankment leading south from the village, a ruined aqueduct that would have carried the canal over the River Tone, and the abutments of a second aqueduct across a local road. The Bristol and Exeter Railway line was opened through the village in 1842 and the junction of the Chard Branch Line was located here in 1860, but Creech St Michael railway station was not opened until 13 August 1928. The station was actually north of the junction so was only used by trains to Yeovil and Bristol. It closed on 5 October 1964 but the line is still open, forming a part of the London to Penzance main line. The branch is closed but remains of it are visible. including the skeleton of a five-arched bridge across the River Tone, and an embankment curving south, parallel to the abandoned canal. A large paper mill was built on the river to the west of the village in 1875, finally closing in 1993. In the Second World War, a line of fortifications was built on the boundary of the village, as part of the Taunton Stop Line. The line was meant to contain any German invasion of the south west peninsula. Several pillboxes remain along the Bridgwater & Taunton Canal, one at the old junction with the Chard canal, and one on the embankment of the Chard railway.

In English-speaking countries it is generally known as \\"Here Comes the Bride\\" or \\"Wedding March\\", though \\"wedding march\\" refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride, notably Felix Mendelssohn's \\"Wedding March\\". Wagner‚Äôs piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858. The chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony, as they accompany the heroine Elsa to her bridal chamber. Text Although at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without singing, in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three. Eight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody. The chorus then repeats the first section, gradually proceeding offstage.  Religious attitudes  Many pastors of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod oppose the \\"Bridal Chorus\\" because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner's operas. The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the \\"Bridal Chorus\\"; one diocese's guidelines regarding the chorus state that the chorus is a secular piece of music, that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera, and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship.

Grudem (born 1948) is an American evangelical theologian, seminary professor, and author. He co-founded the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood and served as the general editor of the ESV Study Bible. Life Grudem was born on February 11, 1948, in Jim Falls, Wisconsin. As a child, he attended First Baptist Church in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He holds a B.A. in economics from Harvard University, an M.Div and D.D. from Westminster Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D in New Testament studies from the University of Cambridge. In 2001, Grudem became Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary. Prior to that, he had taught for 20 years at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, where he was chairman of the department of biblical and systematic theology. Grudem served on the committee overseeing the English Standard Version translation of the Bible, and from 2005 to 2008 he served as general editor for the 2.1-million-word ESV Study Bible (which was named \\"2009 Christian Book of the Year\\" by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association). In 1999 he was the president of the Evangelical Theological Society. Grudem announced having been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease on December 22, 2015. On July 28, 2016, Grudem published an opinion piece on Townhall called \\"Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice\\".. On October 9, the piece was retracted and replaced with one entitled \\"Trump's Moral Character and the Election\\".. On October 19, the original piece was reinstated and another piece was published, entitled \\"If You Don't Like Either Candidate, Then Vote for Trump's Policies\\"... Grudem endorsed Trump for re-election in 2020. Theology He is the author of multiple books, including Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine, which advocates a Calvinistic soteriology, the verbal plenary inspiration and inerrancy of the Bible, believer‚Äôs baptism, a plural-elder form of church government, and the complementarian view of gender relationships. Systematic Theology is a highly influential theology textbook that has sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Grudem holds to noncessationist charismatic beliefs and was at one time a qualified supporter of the Vineyard Movement and one of the main apologists and spokesmen for reuniting charismatic, Reformed, and evangelical churches. In his theological method, Grudem aims to compile what the entire Bible says about any given topic. He applied this approach in his Systematic Theology and has now done so more recently in Christian Ethics. Grudem describes the task of assembling verses and passages from the Bible on the analogy of a ‚Äújigsaw puzzle.‚Äù This manner of deploying scripture has been criticized. Carl Braatan, an ≈ìcumenical Lutheran, argues that Grudem ‚Äúpiles up biblical proof-texts in blithe indifference to critical scholarship‚Äù; his ‚Äúmethod is captive to the fundamentalist notion that the canon of biblical texts and their interpretation can be detached from the community that determined canonicity in the first place.‚Äù. =Gender= Grudem is a co-founder and past president of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. He also edited (with John Piper) Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (which was named \\"Book of the Year\\" by Christianity Today in 1992). All of Grudem's research on gender- related issues is now contained in his major reference work Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: an Analysis of over 100 Disputed Questions (Multnomah, 2004; Crossway, 2012). Works In recent years, Grudem's publications have focused on the application of the ethical teachings of the Bible to broader areas of the culture including government and economics. =Books=   * Condensed version of Systematic Theology  * .

Prior to becoming the mayor of Chicago, Gurnee was the primary partner of Gurnee & Matteson, a saddlery and leather firm. Gurnee did well enough in this business, and in his tannery, that he amassed a large fortune before moving to New York City. Gurnee campaigned for the mayoralty on the issue of public ownership of the city's water supply. Once in office, he fought against the merger of the Illinois Central and Michigan Central railroads, originally planned to meet up south of the city. He was elected to two terms, winning the mayoralty in 1851 and being reelected in 1852. Gurnee unsuccessfully attempted to stage a return to the mayor's office in the 1860 mayoral election. He lost to \\"Long John\\" Wentworth, who had previously served a term as mayor as a Democrat, but had switched to the Republican Party.

It was released on July 27, 1993. At the time of Windows NT's release, Microsoft's Windows 3.1 desktop environment had established brand recognition and market share; but Windows 3.1 relied on the DOS operating system for essential functions, and it had a constrictive 16-bit architecture. Windows NT, however, was a complete, 32-bit operating system that retained a desktop environment familiar to Windows 3.1 users. By extending the Windows brand and beginning Windows NT at version 3.1, Microsoft implied that consumers should expect a familiar user experience. The name Windows NT (\\"New Technology\\") advertised that this was a re-engineered version of Windows. Windows NT began as a rewrite of the OS/2 operating system, which Microsoft had co-developed with IBM in the 1980s. For several reasons, including the market success of Windows 3.0 in 1990, Microsoft decided to advance Windows rather than OS/2. They relinquished their OS/2 development responsibilities to IBM, and forked their work on OS/2 v3.0 into a competing operating system. Windows NT 3.1 was available in two editions: Windows NT 3.1 for workstations, and Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server for servers. When these premiered, their sales were limited by high system requirements, and a general lack of 32-bit applications to take advantage of the OS's data processing capabilities.  History  = As NT OS/2 = While Microsoft had a major foothold on the personal computer market due to the use of its MS-DOS as the de facto operating system of IBM PC compatibles, Nathan Myhrvold (who had joined Microsoft after its acquisition of Dynamical Systems Research) identified two major threats to Microsoft's monopoly‚Äîthe RISC architecture, which proved to be more powerful than the equivalent Intel processors that MS-DOS ran on, and Unix, a family of cross-platform multitasking operating systems with support for multiprocessing and networking. While the widespread use of Unix was hindered by the need to adapt programs for each individual variant, Bill Gates believed that the combination of a Unix-like operating system with RISC processors could be a market threat, prompting the need for Microsoft to develop a \\"Unix killer\\" that could run on multiple architectures. Gates hired Dave Cutler from Digital Equipment Corporation to assist in developing the new operating system; Cutler had left the company after a series of conflicts surrounding its work on the Prism architecture and its microkernel operating system Mica, and agreed to join Microsoft on the condition that he be able to bring a number of staff members from his team at DEC with him. Cutler arrived at Microsoft on October 31, 1988, and work on the future operating system started in November. The operating system was first developed as a revised version of OS/2, an operating system Microsoft had jointly developed with IBM. While OS/2 was originally intended to succeed MS-DOS, it had yet to be commercially successful. The OS was to be designed so it could be ported to different processor platforms, and support multiprocessor systems, which few operating systems did at that time. To target the enterprise market, the OS was also to support networking, the POSIX standard, and a security platform compliant with the \\"Orange Book\\" standards; which would require the OS to be a multi-user system with a permission framework and the ability to audit security-related events. Both Microsoft and IBM wanted to market an operating system that appealed to corporate \\"enterprise software\\" customers. That meant greater security, reliability, processing power, and computer networking features. However, since Microsoft also wanted to capture market share from Unix on other computing platforms, they needed a system design that was more portable than that of OS/2. To this end, Microsoft began by developing and testing their new operating system for a non-x86 processor: an emulated version of the Intel i860. Alluding to the chip's codename, \\"N10\\", Microsoft codenamed their operating system NT OS/2. DEC preemptively sued Microsoft, alleging that they stole code from Mica for use in the new operating system. In an out-of-court settlement, Microsoft agreed to make NT OS/2 compatible with DEC's Alpha processor. The development team originally estimated that development would be complete within 18 months. By April 1989, the NT OS/2 kernel could run inside the i860 emulator. However, the development team later determined that the i860 was unsuitable for the project. By December they had begun porting NT OS/2 to the MIPS R3000 processor instead, and completed the task in three months. Senior Microsoft executive Paul Maritz was targeting a release date in 1992, but the development schedule was uncertain. The company was eager to silence naysayers who speculated that NT wouldn't be on the market until 1994, and had planned to present the new OS at COMDEX in 1990. = As Windows NT = In May 1990, Microsoft released Windows 3.0, a new version of its MS-DOS-based Windows desktop environment. Windows 3.0 sold well, and the resulting shift in Microsoft's marketing strategy eroded their partnership with IBM‚Äîwho wanted Microsoft to concentrate solely on developing OS/2 as its primary platform as opposed to building their future business around Windows. Users and developers were unsure of whether to adopt Windows or OS/2 due to these uncertainties (a situation magnified by the fact that the operating systems were incompatible with each other at the API level), while Microsoft's resources were also being drained by the simultaneous development of multiple operating systems. In August 1990, as a response to the popularity of Windows 3.0, the NT OS/2 team decided to re-work the operating system to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32. Win32 maintained the familiar structure of the 16-bit APIs used by Windows, which would allow developers to easily adapt their software for the new platform while maintaining a level of compatibility with existing software for Windows. With the shift to a Windows-like architecture, the operating system's shell was also changed from OS/2's Presentation Manager to Windows' Program Manager. Due to these changes, NT was not presented at COMDEX 1990 as was originally planned. Neither the general public nor IBM knew about the transformation of NT OS/2 into Windows NT at the time. Although the companies did agree to a revised partnership where IBM and Microsoft would alternate developing major versions of OS/2 instead of collaborating on each version, IBM eventually learned of Microsoft's Windows NT plans in January 1991, and immediately ended the OS/2 partnership. IBM would solely develop OS/2 2.0 (as was planned under the amended version) and all future versions, without any further involvement from Microsoft. In October 1991, Windows NT received its first public demonstration at COMDEX. In an effort to ensure software taking advantage of Windows NT was available upon its release (scheduled for late-1992), Microsoft also distributed a 32-bit software development kit to selected developers in attendance. The demonstration was positively received; PC Magazine called Windows NT \\"the modern reinvention of the operating system\\", but at the same time claimed that it was unlikely that the promised backward compatibility would be kept for the final release. In March 1992, Microsoft also released Win32s, which would allow Windows 3.1 to have partial compatibility with Windows NT programs for the purposes of developing software optimized for the platform. At Microsoft's Win32 Professional Developers Conference in June 1992, Windows NT was demonstrated running on x86 and MIPS processors, while a beta version of Windows NT and an updated development kit were also made available. Concurrently, Microsoft announced a new version of its SQL Server product for Windows NT; Unix vendors feared that the software could be a killer app that would affect the market share of Unix systems. Concerns were also raised over NT's memory usage; while most computers of the era shipped with 4 megabytes of RAM, 16 MB was recommended for NTs. Due to the high cost of RAM at the time, critics thought that its high system requirements could affect the sales and adoption of Windows NT. Steps were taken to reduce its memory usage through methods such as paging. Microsoft began releasing public beta builds of NT in October 1992, and a month later at COMDEX, a presentation focusing on third- party software for Windows NT was held. The final pre-release version of NT was released in March 1993, alongside the unveiling of the server version, Windows NT with LAN Manager. Although its stability and performance had improved, there were still fears that the OS could be released in an unfinished state or delayed further into 1993. = Release = Windows NT 3.1 and Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server (so numbered to associate them with Windows 3.1) were released on July 26, 1993. At first, only the x86 and MIPS versions shipped; the DEC Alpha version followed in September. Microsoft sold the workstation version for $495, and the server version for $1,495. Ostensibly, the server price was meant to be a promotional discount offered only during the first six months of sale, but they never raised the retail price to the listed one‚Äî$2,995. 250 programmers wrote 5.6 million lines of code; the development cost $150 million. In the last year of development, the team fixed more than 30,000 bugs. During the product's lifecycle, Microsoft published three service packs: Service Pack 1 was released on October 8, 1993; Service Pack 2 followed on January 24, 1994; and Service Pack 3's release date was October 29, 1994. The Service Packs were distributed on CD-ROM and floppy disk, and also through bulletin board systems, CompuServe, and the Internet. Microsoft terminated support for the operating system on December 31, 2000. Windows NT 3.1 was localized into various languages, besides English, it was available in Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Spanish and Swedish. Only the workstation, but not the server was available in Danish, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian and Portuguese.  Operating system goals  Cutler set three main goals for Windows NT. The first goal was portability: in contrast to previous operating systems, which were strongly tied to one architecture, Windows NT should be able to operate on multiple architectures. To meet this goal, most of the operating systems, including the operating system core, had to be written in the C programming language. During the planning phase it was clear that this would cause Windows NT to have higher memory consumption than all previous operating systems. Besides the graphics system and parts of the networking system, which were written in C++, only parts of the operating systems which required direct hardware access and performance critical functions were written in assembly language. These parts were isolated so that they could easily be rewritten when porting the operating system to a new architecture. The second goal was reliability: The system should no longer crash due to a faulty application or faulty hardware. This way, the operating system should be made attractive for critical applications. To meet this goal, the architecture of Windows NT was designed so that the operating system core was isolated and applications could not access it directly. The kernel was designed as a microkernel and components of the core were to run atop the kernel in a modular fashion; Cutler knew this principle from his work at Digital. Reliability also includes security, and the operating system should be able to resist external attacks. Mainframes already had a system where every user had their own account which was assigned specific rights by the administrator, this way, users could be prevented access to confidential documents. A virtual memory management was designed to thwart attacks by malware and prevent users from accessing foreign areas of memory. The third goal was called personality: The operating system should be able to run applications designed for various operating systems, such as Windows, MS-DOS and OS/2 applications. The Mach kernel followed a similar concept by moving the APIs to components which operated in user mode as applications, these could be changed and new ones could be added. This principle was applied to Windows NT. Despite all these goals, the performance of the operating system was optimized where possible, by adapting critical sections of the code to fast execution speed. To improve networking performance, large parts of the networking system were moved to the operating system core. Windows NT was designed as a networking operating system. In this branch, Novell had a lead with its product NetWare, mostly because of a lack of competition, and Microsoft failed to develop a product which could challenge NetWare's lead. Cutler hoped to gain additional customers with a reliable networking operating system. Bill Gates already dominated the market of desktop operating systems with MS-DOS and Windows and hoped to do the same in the networking market with Windows NT. He especially hoped to find a market in the emerging number of servers, while at the same time he did not expect a success in the desktop market until 1995. Therefore, Windows NT was positioned as a high-end operating system in an interview with the product manager David Thacher. It was not designed to replace Windows 3.1 completely, but it should rather supplement Microsoft's product palette with an operating system for critical applications. The expectations were 10% to 20% among all Windows sales and a market share of 10% in the high end market, which amounted to one million copies.  Platform  = Architecture = While Windows NT 3.1 uses the same graphical user interface as Windows 3.1, it was developed anew. The operating system is not DOS-based, but an independent 32-bit operating system; many concepts were taken from Cutler's previous operating system, VMS. The architecture of Windows NT takes some ideas of the client-server model, like the modular structure and the communication between the modules. System resources like memory, files or devices are viewed as objects by the operating system, which are all accessed in the same way through handles and which can in this way be secured against unauthorized access. The operating system was designed for multiprocessor systems; it supports preemptive multitasking and can make use of threads to run multiple processes in parallel. Using symmetric multiprocessing, the processing usage is evenly distributed among all available processors. The inter-process communication in Windows NT 3.1 is designed around networks; two newly introduced functions, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Network DDE, an extension of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), facilitate the access and data exchange between processes running on different computers inside a network. The operating system is designed to combine certain elements of a monolithic kernel and a microkernel; nowadays this is most often referred to as a hybrid kernel. The hardware abstraction layer represents the lowermost layer and isolates the operating system from the underlying hardware to make it easy to port the operating system to other platforms. The kernel running atop only has very basic functions like interrupt management and processor synchronization. All other functions of the operating system core are handled by modules which operate independently from one another and can be swapped without affecting the rest of the operating system. Positioned above the operating system core are the subsystems. There are two types of subsystems: one are the integral subsystems, which perform important operating system functions. One such subsystem is the security subsystem, which handles the logon process and monitors the security of the system. The other type of subsystem is the environment subsystem, which exposes the operating system functions to applications via application programming interfaces. The base subsystem is the 32-bit subsystem which runs 32-bit applications written for Windows NT. Windows NT applications can only run on one platform, and must be recompiled for every platform. The 32-bit subsystem also contains all output functions, including the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), so all other subsystems have to call the 32-bit subsystem to be able to output text or graphics. Other subsystems contained in Windows NT 3.1 are the POSIX subsystem, which supports POSIX-compatible applications built for Windows NT, and, in the x86 version only, the OS/2 subsystem, which allows command-line based OS/2 1.x applications to run. The Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) is sometimes also viewed as a subsystem, but is, strictly speaking, a normal 32-bit Windows application. It manages applications originally built for DOS. Built on top is Windows on Windows (WoW), which allows applications built for 16-bit Windows operating systems like Windows 3.1 to run. On x86 computers, the virtual DOS machine uses the virtual 8086 mode to run DOS applications directly, on RISC computers, an emulator licensed from Insignia Solutions is used which emulates a 80286 processor. However, not all DOS and 16-bit Windows applications can be run on Windows NT 3.1 due to various limitations, one of them being the inability of applications to directly access the hardware. As well, VxD files sometimes needed by applications cannot be used with Windows NT 3.1. While pure DOS applications are run in separate memory spaces, 16-bit Windows applications have to share one memory space. While this is done due to compatibility reasons with applications which depend on this ability, like Schedule+ and Microsoft Mail, it also means that 16-bit Windows applications only run in cooperative multitasking. A faulty 16-bit Windows application is in this way able to cause all other 16-bit Windows applications (but not Windows NT itself) to crash. Graphical view of the architecture of Windows NT 3.1. Shown are the following components of the operating system core: I/O Manager, Object Manager, Security Reference Monitor, Process Manager, Local Procedure Call Facility, Virtual Memory Manager. = System = Windows NT 3.1 provides a boot manager called NTLDR which is loaded during the startup process of the operating system on x86-based computers. It allows a multiboot setup of multiple instances of Windows NT 3.1, as well as MS-DOS and OS/2 1.x. NTLDR is not used for the RISC versions because the RISC computers' firmware provides their own boot manager. Every user has to log on to the computer after Windows NT 3.1 is booted up by pressing the key combination Ctrl+Alt+Del and entering the user name and password. All users have their own user account, and user-specific settings like the Program Manager groups are stored separately for every user. Users can be assigned specific rights, like the right to change the system time or the right to shut down the computer. To facilitate management of user accounts, it is also possible to group multiple user accounts and assign rights to groups of users. Windows NT 3.1 introduced the new NTFS file system. This new file system is more robust against hardware failures and allows assignment of read and write rights to users or groups on the file system level. NTFS supports long file names and has features to accommodate POSIX applications like hard links. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 also supports FAT16 as well as OS/2's file system HPFS. Designed as a networking operating system, Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple network protocols. Besides IPX/SPX and NetBEUI, the TCP/IP protocol is supported allowing access to the Internet. Similar to Windows for Workgroups, files and printers can be shared and the access rights and configuration of these resources can be edited over the network. When a network printer is installed, the required drivers are automatically transferred over the network, removing the need to manually install the drivers for every computer. The Remote Access Service (RAS) allows a client from outside the network to connect to the network using a modem, ISDN or X.25 and access its resources. While the workstation allows one RAS connection at a time, the server supports 64. Windows NT 3.1 supports the then-new Unicode standard, a character set which allows multiple languages to be displayed. This facilitates localization of the operating system. All strings, as well as file and folder names, are internally processed in Unicode, but the included programs, like the File Manager, are not Unicode aware, so folders containing Unicode characters cannot be accessed. For demonstration purposes, a Unicode typeface called Lucida Sans Unicode is shipped with Windows NT 3.1 even though it is not installed by default. The previous code pages are still supported for compatibility purposes. The Windows registry, introduced with Windows NT 3.1, is a central, hierarchical configuration database designed to allow configuration of computers over the network and to replace the commonly-used text-based configuration files, like INI files, AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. Using the undocumented registry editor, the Windows registry can be viewed and edited by the user. The Advanced Server is designed to manage the workstation computers. It can function as a Domain controller, where all users and groups as well as their rights are stored. This way, a user can log on from any computer in the network, and users can be managed centrally on the server. Trust relationships can be built to other domains to be able to exchange data cross-domain. Using the replication service, files like logon scripts can be synchronized across all computers on the network. The Advanced Server supports the AppleTalk protocol to allow connections to Macintosh computers. Hard drives can be combined to RAIDs in Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, the supported configurations are RAID 0, RAID 1 and RAID 5. = Included programs = Windows NT 3.1, for the most part, comes with 32-bit versions of the components featured in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups. However, it also included applications specifically aimed at the needs of Windows NT, like the User Manager, the Performance Monitor, the Disk Administrator, the Event Viewer and the Backup application. The Advanced Server contained further, server-specific administration tools. Because Windows NT 3.1 is not DOS-based, a new 32-bit command-line processor, called CMD.EXE was included which was compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 shipped with a few 16-bit applications, like Microsoft Write or EDLIN.. Windows NT 3.1, being an all-new operating system for which no previous drivers could be used, includes a wealth of drivers for various common components and peripherals. This includes common SCSI devices like hard drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives and image scanners, as well as ISA devices like graphics cards, sound cards and network cards. The PCI bus, however, is expressly not supported. Windows NT 3.1 supports an uninterruptible power supply. Windows NT 3.1 could be installed either by using the CD-ROM and a provided boot disk, or by utilizing a set of twenty-two 3.5\\" floppies (twenty-three floppies for Advanced Server). Windows NT 3.1 could also be installed over the network. A coupon was included that made it possible to order a set of twenty-seven 5.25\\" floppies (or twenty-eight floppies for Advanced Server). Compared to the floppies, the CD-ROM contained additional drivers and applications.  System requirements  Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple platforms: Aside from the x86 architecture, it runs on computers with DEC Alpha or MIPS (R4000 and R4400) processors. Minimum system requirements on x86 systems include a 25 MHz 80386 processor, at least 12 megabytes of memory, 75 megabytes of hard drive space, and a VGA graphics card. RISC systems require 16 megabytes of memory, 92 megabytes of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive. The Advanced Server edition requires an 80386 processor with 16 megabytes of memory and 90 megabytes of hard drive space. On RISC systems, 110 megabytes of hard drive space is needed. Windows NT 3.1 supports dual processor systems, while the Advanced Server edition supports up to four processors. Due to an error in the processor detection routine, Windows NT 3.1 cannot be installed on Pentium II or newer processors. Microsoft never fixed the problem, but unofficial patches are available.  Reception  Windows NT 3.1 sold about 300,000 copies in its first year. The hardware requirements were deemed to be very high at that time; the recommended system requirements of a 486 processor with 16 megabytes of memory were well above the average computer's configuration, and the operating system turned out to be too slow to use. 32-bit applications which could have used the capabilities of Windows NT 3.1 were scarce, so users had to resort to the old 16-bit applications; however, these ran slower than on Windows 3.1. Estimates in November 1993 counted only 150 Windows NT applications. Common types of software, like office suites, were not available for Windows NT 3.1. During the development of the operating system, the API calls were changed so 32-bit applications built on the 1992 pre-release version of Windows NT 3.1 could not be run on the final version. This affected even software like Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0 and Microsoft Fortran PowerStation. RISC systems with Windows NT 3.1 had an even bigger disadvantage: even though they were more powerful than x86 systems, almost no 32-bit applications or drivers were ported to these platforms. 16-bit applications ran much slower under RISC systems because of the 80286 emulation compared to x86 systems which could run 16-bit applications natively, and DOS and 16-bit applications which depended on 386 calls could not be run at all on RISC systems. However, not all reception was negative; the multitasking capabilities of the operating system were rated positively, especially compared to Windows 3.1. Compared to the size of the operating system, the installation turned out to be very easy, even though installing from floppies was a very time-consuming task. The Advanced Server, intended to be the successor to the unsuccessful LAN Manager product, was technically much superior to its predecessor, and only failed to gain success because it shared the same problems with its workstation pendant, such as the low performance running 16-bit applications. The Advanced Server provided a financial advantage for large networks because its price was not dependent on the number of clients, unlike its competitor Novell NetWare. With Windows NT, Microsoft entered a market it could not previously address and which was mostly dominated by Unix, Novell NetWare and OS/2. A test performed by the InfoWorld magazine in November 1993, where the networking capabilities of several operating systems were tested, showed that Windows NT 3.1 was seriously lacking in inter-client communication: it could only connect to its own server via NetBEUI; attempts to connect to Unix, NetWare and OS/2 all failed because no client software was available. For the Advanced Server, only their own client, the Macintosh and, if only limited, OS/2 were able to connect to the server. Even though the operating system's actual success was only moderate, it had a huge lasting impact. Developers of Unix derivations for the first time strived to standardize their operating systems, and Novell was so concerned about its market share that it bought a Unix vendor. Manufacturers of microprocessors hoped to use the portability of the new operating system to increase their own sales, and thus ports of Windows NT were announced for various platforms, like the Sun SPARC architecture and the Clipper architecture. It was recognized that Windows NT would dominate the desktop market as soon as the hardware became powerful enough to run the operating system at an acceptable speed. Eight years later, Microsoft would unify the consumer-oriented Windows line (which had remained MS-DOS based) with the NT line with the October 2001 release of Windows XP‚Äîthe first consumer-oriented version of Windows to use the NT architecture.

It is the second release of Windows NT. One of the primary goals during Windows NT 3.5 development was to improve the operating system's performance. As a result, the project was codenamed \\"Daytona\\", after the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Like many other older Windows versions before 1996, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows NT 3.5 on December 31, 2001. Support for Windows NT 3.51 Workstation also ended on that date. Features Windows NT 3.5 comes in two editions: NT Workstation and NT Server. They respectively replace the NT and NT Advanced Server editions of Windows NT 3.1. The Workstation edition allows only 10 concurrent clients to access the file server and does not support Mac clients. Windows NT 3.5 includes integrated Winsock and TCP/IP support. (Its predecessor, Windows NT 3.1, only includes an incomplete implementation of TCP/IP based on the AT&T; UNIX System V \\"STREAMS\\" API.) TCP/IP and IPX/SPX stacks in Windows NT 3.5 are rewritten. NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) support as a compatibility layer for TCP/IP was introduced as also the Microsoft DHCP and WINS clients and DHCP and WINS servers.

The parish had a population of 573 at the 2011 census. The name, spelled Branzingtune in the Domesday Book, is thought to mean \\"Brand's people's place\\". Most of the houses in the village are built of local limestone, and most are 200 or 300 years old; there are 20th-century houses at the south end of the village. The oldest dated house, named Tudor House since the late 19th century, was built in 1615. It is located on Town Street () and was an inn until 1820, when it was bought by the parish and was used as a workhouse until 1848. There were 15 inmates at the 1841 census, but the number rose considerably in 1845, when the Brassington Poor Law Union was wound up and Brassington joined the new Ashbourne Union. The Brassington workhouse, augmented by the nearby George and Dragon pub, served the new union while a new workhouse was built in Ashbourne. The workhouse could hold 130 inmates. The house has been a private house since 1848, and its owner in the 1890s added the words Tudor House to its 1615 datestone. This has the initials of Thomas Westerne, its builder, and his wife Anne. The Norman church, repaired and enlarged in the 19th century, stands on the north side of the steep valley in which the village lies. There were formerly three Nonconformist chapels, two of which are now closed and one demolished. The former Congregational chapel, at the northern entrance to the village, is now the village hall; the Primitive Methodist chapel, built by its members in 1834 above the church on the hillside, is a private house; the Wesleyan Reform chapel, at the west end of the village, was demolished in 2007. A house built on the site incorporates a plaque formerly set high on the chapel's frontage and a brass commemorative plate. In addition to the village hall, a meeting place was provided in the 1990s by a British Legion building in the village centre. There are two pubs, the Olde Gate (where Bonnie Prince Charlie‚Äôs soldiers were billeted on their march to London and some of the oak beams came from ships of the Spanish Armada) which has a 1616 datestone and a largely 19th-century interior, and the Miners Arms, which was modernised thirty years ago, and which was once the venue for the manor court and the lead miners' Barmote Court. The school was built in 1872, after the passing of the 1870 Education Act, and is now a primary school. In addition to agriculture, which still provides employment for a few villagers, Brassington was for centuries dependent on lead mining. The rough ground to the east, west and north has the hillocks and hollows of hundreds of abandoned mines; there are also remains of the miners' buildings on some of the sites. There is current employment in the village in heavy goods transport, steel fabrication and furniture manufacture, though most of the villagers are employed elsewhere. Until recently, there was no shop, but in July 2014 the village became the second in the UK (after Clifton, Derbyshire) to have a 'Speedy Shop' installed by local business Villagevending.com. The shop sells a range of essentials and other items using an automatic retailing machine styled like a traditional shop. There are bus services to Ashbourne and Wirksworth. The nearby Harboro' Rocks and Rainster Rocks are dolomitic limestone outcrops. Harboro' Rocks has a history of mining lead and baryte. Harboro' Cave is a natural cavern which was occupied as far back as the Ice Age and it is a Scheduled Monument. The remains of a Romano-British settlement at Rainster Rocks is also a protected Scheduled Monument. The Limestone Way long-distance footpath passes close to the village.

Sawyer was selected as the 53rd Mayor of Chicago, Illinois after the sudden death of then‚Äìmayor Harold Washington, serving from December 2, 1987 until April 24, 1989. Sawyer was the second African-American to serve as mayor of Chicago. Sawyer was a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Born to Bernice and Eugene Sawyer Sr. in Greensboro, Alabama,Chicago Public Library ‚Äì Mayor Eugene Sawyer (1987‚Äì1989) the oldest of six children, Sawyer spent summer vacations in Chicago with his aunt during his childhood. Sawyer enrolled Alabama State University, where he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. During college, Sawyer and other members of his fraternity provided security for Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.Chicago's Mayors: A Collection of Biographies Of All Chicago‚Äôs Mayors By Elaine C. Shigley He graduated from Alabama State in 1956 with bachelor's degree in chemistry. He had a brief stint as a chemistry and mathematics teacher in Prentiss, Mississippi, before moving to Chicago to do laboratory work in 1957. Shortly after moving to Chicago, Sawyer took a job in Chicago‚Äôs Department of Water, where he worked from 1959 until 1971. While working for the city's water department, Sawyer became involved with the Six Ward Regular Democratic organization and the Young Democrats (YD) through family friends, becoming the organization president and financial secretary in October 1968. Career =Chicago Alderman (1971‚Äì1987)= In February 1971, Sawyer was elected Alderman of Chicago's 6th Ward. By 1987, he was the longest-serving black alderman on the Chicago City Council. The sudden death of Mayor Harold Washington created a vacancy at city hall. With David Duvall Orr serving as interim mayor, the city council met to select a permanent successor as mayor. Washington's supporters in the city council split, with some supporting Alderman Sawyer, but most voting for Timothy C. Evans. The City Council elected Sawyer mayor in a tumultuous and lengthy meeting. Having received the majority of votes from the council‚Äôs white aldermen, Sawyer faced accusations of \\"selling out\\" to the white community, which led to protests from Evans‚Äô supporters. =Mayor of Chicago (1987‚Äì1989)= Sawyer's inauguration as mayor occurred in the parking lot of a closed restaurant at North and Bosworth Avenues at 4:01 am on December 2, 1987,\\"Chicago Gains Acting Mayor.\\" Eugene Register-Guard, December 3, 1987. in an effort to avoid public demonstration. He was soft-spoken, which led to local media to refer to him as \\"Mr. Mumbles\\", or \\"Mayor Mumbles\\". Sawyer enacted Washington's budget for the 1988 fiscal year. In January 1988, Sawyer was able to get the council to approve legislation that broke the taxi monopoly in the city, something which Washington had been unable to do. Despite the division surrounding his selection, Sawyer pushed several initiatives through the city council, including the installation of lights at Wrigley Field and the Clean Indoor Air Ordinance, which banned indoor smoking. Building on groundwork laid under Mayor Washington, Sawyer championed the Human Rights Ordinance, passed in 1988, to protect individuals against discrimination. This was the first Chicago city ordinance to assert the rights of gay and lesbian Chicagoans. Sawyer helped spur private development of land surrounding O'Hare International Airport. Sawyer reached an unprecedented four-year agreement with the firemen's union. In 1989, Sawyer ran for re- election. In the Democratic primary election, Richard M. Daley, the son of the late mayor Richard J. Daley, defeated Sawyer, taking 57% of the vote to Sawyer‚Äôs 40%. Retirement and death After losing the mayoral contest, Sawyer lost his reelection bid for Democratic committeeman of the 6th Ward and subsequently retired from politics. After retiring, he became involved in business again. Sawyer was also an active member of the Vernon Park Church of God in Chicago's Pill Hill neighborhood. Sawyer died at age 73 on Saturday, January 19, 2008, at approximately 11 PM after a series of strokes and other health setbacks over the previous month. Public viewing for Sawyer took place on January 25 and his funeral took place on January 26 followed by burial at Oak Woods Cemetery, where Harold Washington is buried. Sawyer's mayoral papers are available as the Eugene Sawyer Collection at Special Collections department of the Chicago Public Library located in the Harold Washington Library. Personal life Sawyer was married to Veronica Smith-Sawyer from September 7, 1996 until his death. From 1955 until 1984, Sawyer was married to Eleanor Taylor.Chicago Tribune - SAWYER UNKNOWN TO MOST CHICAGOANS - Mitchell Locin and John McCarron - December 3, 1987 Together, they had three children; sons, Roderick and Shedrick, and a daughter, Sheryl Sawyer McGill.

This firm, then known as Newberry and Dole, sent out the first shipment of grain from Chicago in September 1839. In 1852 Dole retired, and the firm, which was for a time known as Rumsey Brothers, devoted itself exclusively to the grain commission business. Rumsey was identified with the history of Chicago for more than half a century. During that period he was mayor, county treasurer, and president of the Chicago Board of Trade. He was a charter member of the Board of Trade, and through his efforts the present system of grain inspection and grading was adopted.

He served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1865‚Äì1869) as a member of the Republican Party. Early life and career Rice was born in Easton, Maryland and made his acting debut in Annapolis in 1829. His first professional role was as Uncle Barnwell in George Lillo's The London Merchant. He toured up and down the East Coast, as well as in the West Indies. While living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he married into a local theatre family. By 1839, he moved his family to Buffalo, New York, where he managed a theatre during the summers. In winter, he managed a theatre in Albany. Rice arrived in Chicago in 1847 to work as an actor and entertain the politicians at the River and Harbor Convention, Chicago's first national convention. He decided to stay and establish a permanent theater, called Rice's Theater. On July 30, 1850, in the middle of Vincenzo Bellini's opera La Sonnambula, a fire broke out in the theater. Rice addressed the crowds, saying \\"Sit down. Do you think I would permit a fire to occur in my theater?\\" The crowd sat, but a prompter stage-whispered to Rice that the theater was on fire and panic ensued. The theater was destroyed, and he lost about $4,000. When a benefit only raised $60, he left Chicago for Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rice returned to Chicago in 1851 and built a new theater, entirely of brick. He hired James McVicker to serve as manager, and was active in the theater until 1857. Mayoralty In 1865, near the end of the Civil War, Rice ran for mayor of Chicago as a very conservative Republican. Aided by the end of the war and the subsequent assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days before the election, Rice won easily. Rice was sworn-in as mayor on May 3, 1865. As mayor, Rice was anti-labor, and he vetoed a plan to enforce an eight-hour work day. This veto led to a spontaneous demonstration on May 1, 1867 by workers which led to the international May Day observance. The City Council eventually overrode his veto. Rice and the City Council were connected with graft, prostitution and gambling. Rice was reelected in 1867. Rice was defeated in his bid for a third term by Roswell B. Mason in 1869. Rice's mayoralty ended on December 6, 1869, when he was succeeded Mason. Congressional career Rice was elected to represent Illinois' 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in 1872. While serving in the House, he died from liver cancer on December 17, 1874 in Norfolk, Virginia. He had not sought re-election in 1874, and his death soon after the election raised issues about whether Illinois Governor John Beveridge was required to appoint a replacement to complete his term. In the end, Bernard G. Caulfield won a special election to complete the term, after having already been elected to succeed Rice. Rice was buried in Chicago's Rosehill Cemetery.

One month after taking office as mayor, Colvin was met with a mass demonstration at City Hall when more than 12,000 unemployed workers marched for jobs and relief. The crowd dispersed after being promised the city would provide relief when an alderman offered to buy them food throughout the winter if the city would reimburse him. Colvin's administration repealed a Sunday ban on liquor sales which his predecessor, Joseph Medill and Bond supported. In 1874, Colvin's administration was rocked by allegations of patronage and a scandal in the city treasurer's office. Colvin was mayor at the time of the Chicago Fire of 1874, which occurred on July 14, and his administration had to coordinate the response both to the fire and to an outraged fire insurance industry that blamed the city in the wake of the fire for its negligence in coordination of fire prevention. When the city council called for elections following the adoption of the Cities and Villages Act of 1872 in 1875, they left the office of mayor off the list of offices for the election. Despite this, Thomas Hoyne ran for the office and was elected. Colvin, however, refused to vacate the office and retained the title and position of mayor despite Hoyne's inauguration, partly due to the support of the city comptroller.

Founded in 1983, Tseng Labs' first product was designed to allow IBM PCs to run the CP/M Operating System. When an OEM deal for that product was cancelled, TLI introduced a combination multifunction and graphics, called Ultrapak, which upgraded IBM PC and XT compatible computers with some features of an IBM AT.CNN Money 1989 *Companies to watch - Tseng Labs Ultrapak also foreshadowed Tseng Labs penchant for enhancing graphics - by providing IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) compatibility along with their own special 132 column text modes. These extended text modes created a successful niche for TLI - the cards were popularly used by corporations for PCs that also emulated mainframe terminals that displayed 132 columns. The UltraPAK Short (a graphics-only version of UltraPAK) was the base design for the DFI MG-150, which was reported to be the best selling MDA/HGC compatible card of all time. Future Tseng products continued to push beyond mere IBM compatibility. ColorPAK - the company's CGA compatible product - offered 'high resolution' 400 line graphics in 1985. The EVA and EVA/480 products of 1986 were the first recorded instances of a graphics chip company extending the IBM register set. EVA products enabled 130 more lines of graphics (640x480) than IBM EGA, as well as advanced features like hardware accelerated windowing, panning, and zooming. Tseng migrated from a retail / commercial board supplier to OEM sales of their chips. Ultimately, Tseng Labs VGA controllers were found in PCs from major system and board companies including Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC, STB Systems, Diamond Multimedia and several major Taiwanese add-in brands. Tseng's best-known products were the Tseng Labs ET3000, Tseng Labs ET4000 and Tseng Labs ET6000 VGA-compatible graphics chips, which were highly popular between 1990 and 1995 (the era of Windows 3.x).

Using IMA bus, Tseng created the category of mainstream motion video accelerator with a series of video image processing circuits, branded VIPeR. VIPeR chips provided relatively high quality live and computer generated video. The chips were used in on high-end video solutions from companies like Matrox and Jazz Multimedia. Competitors integrated less elegant algorithms inside their mainstream graphics controllers - a trend Tseng followed with its latter generation of chips. Tseng was a victim of the graphics card shakeout of the mid-1990s, losing market share to S3 Graphics and ATI Technologies. Tseng was especially late to integrate a RAMDAC into its product-line, not succeeding until the ET6000. In the later years of the ET4000's lifetime, the lack of an integrated RAMDAC severely hurt Tseng's competitiveness. Struggling to source adequate supplies of memory for their updated cards, and lacking the funds to complete development of a modern integrated 3D engine (the ET6300), the board decided to abandon plans to ship a next generation part, and chose instead to preserve the cash pile, and seek a buy out instead.

He was Secretary of the Admiralty in England, a position he held for almost fifty years from 26 September 1694 to 14 October 1742. In addition to his administrative duties, he was the author of the first general history of the Royal Navy, published in 1720 and based on official Admiralty records. Early life Burchett was probably the eldest surviving son of John Burchett of Sandwich and his second wife Katherine. He married on 24 December 1695, Thomasine Honywood, daughter of Sir William Honywood, 2nd Baronet. Career Burchett was clerk to Samuel Pepys, the English civil servant famous for his diary from about 1680. He fell out of favour with Pepys in about August 1687, but gained the respect and favour of Lord Admiral Edward Russell, and in June 1691 he was appointed Russell's secretary. In this role he alternated between active service when Russell was at sea and employment at the Admiralty Board. In September 1694 he was appointed Secretary of the Admiralty and served continuously until he retired at age 76.Winfield 2007, p. ix Burchett served on Russell's flagship, the 100-gun HMS Britannia, at the battle of Barfleur in 1692 during the War of the Grand Alliance. In 1693 he became the Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet, replacing Samuel Pepys in that office. Burchett was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Sandwich and as a member of the 'Court Group' at the 1705 English general election. He remained MP until the 1713 British general election. He was then returned in 1721 continuing as a member for 20 years. Using official reports received by the Admiralty, Burchett wrote the Memoirs of Transactions at Sea during the War with France, which was published in 1703 by the Queen's Printer, Edward Jones. In 1720 he published the lengthy book A Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea, which was reissued in 1995 by John Hattendorf of the U.S. Naval War College. This 1720 book was the first general naval history published in the English language. This book was published by the printing firm J. Walthoe under royal licence of King George I of Great Britain and was clearly based on the official reports received in the Admiralty. Burchett's A Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea, along with Thomas Lediard's 1735 The Naval History of England, has become a key source of naval history of that era. Burchett's first wife died in 1713, leaving him with a son and one surviving daughter and a property at Hampstead. He married secondly on 22 July 1721, Margaret Arris, widow of Captain Robert Arris. Following her death in 1740, he married on 10 June 1740, his third wife Isabella Wood, widow of Mr. Wood, and daughter of John Robinson, MP. Later life and legacy Following his retirement with a pension of ¬£800 p.a. Burchett spent his last years at Hampstead, where he died on 2 October 1746. His widow, who died in 1756, received a pension of ¬£100 p.a. Since he held the office of Secretary of the Admiralty, the key administrator of the Royal Navy, longer than any other person and had extensive official correspondence and Admiralty papers that have been preserved, his books and writings are relied upon by maritime and naval war historians. Unlike his predecessor Samuel Pepys, Burchett left no known diary or private papers. He died at age 80 at Hampstead near London. Most of his savings were spent on a collection of about 312 paintings. The \\"Entire and Genuine Collection of Pictures of Josiah Burchett, Esquire\\" was auctioned by Christopher Cock from his house in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden on 6‚Äì9 April 1747.

Busse's mayoral tenure is noted for its extensive corruption and presence of organized crime in the city. Busse had connections and was a political ally with a number of organized crime figures. Busse's inaction in the face of growing popular concern led to the formation of several organizations opposed to crime and desirous of cleaning up the city government.

He had previously served as a municipal judge and before that an alderman. As an alderman and judge he would work to become the Democratic candidate for mayor for over two decades. Born in Massachusetts but moving to Chicago in young adulthood, William Dever became an alderman and prominently supported municipal ownership of mass transit. He was a member of the Dunne wing of the local Democratic party. As mayor, he focused on reform and infrastructure during his tenure. Later he would turn his attention to the enforcement of Prohibition despite his personal opposition to it. Such enforcement was initially effective, but indifference from government at other levels limited its efficacy and the lower amount of alcohol increased violence among bootleggers, souring Chicagoans' view on it. Losing to William Hale Thompson in 1927 over the issue, he is the last Democratic nominee in a partisan Chicago mayoral election to lose. Never in particularly good health, he retired from politics after the election and would die of pancreatic cancer two years later. Early life Dever was born in Woburn, Massachusetts and entered his family's leather tanning business when he was fifteen. He left Woburn in 1882 and moved to Boston, where he was based while he traveled on tannery business for two years. During this time Dever met Katherine E. Conway and they married in 1885. The two would go on to adopt two sons during their marriage. When Kate noticed an ad stating that leather tanners could make good money in Chicago, the couple moved west. Upon arriving in Chicago in 1887, Dever got a job working at a leather tannery on Goose Island and he also began taking law courses at night at the Chicago College of Law. Upon his graduation in 1890, Dever opened his own law practice. Aldermanic career Dever ran for alderman in 1900, but was defeated. Two years later, he was elected alderman of the 17th Ward. Dever was elected as a steadfast supporter of municipal ownership of the city's streetcar services amid the Chicago Traction Wars.Chicago Record-Herald March 27, 1902 He would maintain this position throughout his aldermanic tenure, and continue it into his later mayoralty. Dever was regarded as an \\"honest\\" alderman. He had a clean voting record and was frequently endorsed by the Municipal Voters League in his runs for reelection. Dever became one of the most influential aldermen during the first mayoralty of Carter Harrison Jr. Dever got heavy buzz as a potential Democratic mayoral candidate in 1905, but did not run. Dever became a key ally of pro-municipal ownership mayor Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne, who was elected in 1905. While affiliated with the Dunne wing of the Democratic Party as an alderman, Dever was on good terms with the Harrison and Sullivan wings. In 1906, Dever faced an atypically challenging race for reelection. In retaliation for his vote in support of raising saloon license fees, saloons in his ward raised beer prices and told patrons that the new \\"Dever tax\\" was to blame. Active campaigning on his part and strong support from Mayor Dunne secured Dever reelection with a comfortable margin. In 1906, Dever ran in the inaugural election of the Municipal Court of Chicago. To provide for staggered future elections, the race saw separate elections divided by the duration of terms, with separate elections being held for sets of two-year, four-year, and six-year seats. Dever ran in the race for the six-year seats. Low turnout in these judicial races coupled with the spoiler effect of William Randolph Hearst (who was engaged in a brief feud with Dunne Democrats) running his own Independence League slate hurt Democratic chances. Dever received 94,380 votes, the most of any Democratic candidate for the Municipal Court. However, he placed 20,000 votes behind the last Republican in the six-year field. He had received more votes than Ferdinand L. Barnett, a Republican candidate elected to a two-year seat who had received only 90,000 votes. This led some to contend that Dever should be seated to a two-seat seat in his place, arguing that holding separate elections for the different durations had been unconstitutional. Dever rejected the effort to seat him in place of Barnett, feeling that it was fueled by prejudice against Barnett (an African American), and therefore refused to challenge Barnett's appointment to the court. In 1907, Dever ran to fill the vacancy on the Superior Court of Cook County left after Judge Joseph E. Gary's death in office. This election was to a partial term of four years. With Dunne's support, he received the Democratic nomination. Dever tied his candidacy to Busse's reelection effort in the coinciding mayoral election and to the municipal ownership/traction issue. His Republican opponent was William H. McSurely. McSurely refused to take a stance on the traction issue, due to the fact that the court might soon review the Settlement Ordinances. Dever lost by a margin of roughly 13,000 of the nearly 340,000 votes cast, a result mirroring that of the coinciding mayoral race. In the spring of 1908, Dever ran a spirited race against seven candidates in the Democratic primary for Cook County State's Attorney. He was supported by the Dunne wing of the party. Dever's key opponents were Sullivan wing candidate J.J. Kern (former State's Attorney) and Harrison wing candidate Macklay Hoyne. Kern won the primary with 28% of the vote, defeating Dever (who came second) by several thousand votes. During Dever's 1910 aldermanic reelection campaign, Stanley H. Kunz, political boss of the neighboring Sixteenth Ward and Chicago's most prominent Polish American politician, slated prominent Polish American lawyer Stanley Walkowiak to primary Dever in an effort to expand Polish American political influence in the city. Dever narrowly won this primary. After this, Kunz initially attempted to get the Republicans to replace their nominee, C.J. Ryberg, with a Polish American colleague of his, before instead deciding to have Walkowiak run as an independent. Dever was backed by Carter Harrison, Edward F. Dunne, J. Hamilton Lewis, John Traeger, Joseph Le Buy (president of the Polish Businessmen's Democratic Club), the Chicago Commons caucus, and the Municipal Voters League. Dever won with 2,692 votes (44%) to Walkowiak's 1,886 (31%) and Ryberg's 1,483 (25%). Judicial career Dever had been considering running for mayor in the then-upcoming 1911 Chicago mayoral election before being slated by Roger Sullivan on the Democratic ticket for Superior Court of Cook County in the 1910 elections. It took some persuading for Sullivan to convince Dever to run for judge. Dever was successfully elected, resigning from City Council to assume his judgeship. Dever declined calls to run for mayor in 1915. In 1916, due to the duration of a trial of William Lorimer for misappropriation of funds and conspiracy to defraud, which lasted two months before reaching acquittal, Dever had only three weeks to run a reelection campaign. Nevertheless, he won handily. Several months into his second term on the Cook County Superior Court, Dever was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Appellate Court. He served two partial terms on the Appellate Court, eventually becoming its presiding judge. For his second term, he had been reelected with more than 98,000 votes.The Chicago Daily News Almanac and Yearbook 1923. Mayoralty =1923 mayoral election= In 1923, Democratic party boss George E. Brennan selected Dever as having the best chance of defeating the incumbent, Mayor William \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson. Dever ran on a reform platform and Thompson withdrew from the race, with Republicans instead nominating Arthur C. Lueder, who was easily defeated by Dever. =Mayoral term= Dever was sworn-in on April 16, 1923. Early into his mayoralty, Dever had begun making plans to improve the city's public transit, which he had previously made a central issue in his mayoral election campaign. A longtime advocate for municipal ownership (an issue which had been a hot-button topic in Chicago, particularly during the Chicago Traction Wars), Dever initiated negotiations to purchase Chicago Surface Lines and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, making them city owned-and-operated services.The Mayors: The Chicago Political Tradition, fourth edition by Paul M. Green, Melvin G. Holli SIU Press, Jan 10, 2013 Dever began also formulating plans for transit expansions and the construction of a subway. In the autumn of 1923, the focus of Dever's administration shifted. On September 7, 1923, a shootout occurred took place at a South Side cafe between two rival groups of rum runners, killing one man. A week later the same two groups had another shootout, killing two people. He saw these shootings as an alarm that the city's bootlegging situation had become an epidemic. Dever himself opposed Prohibition, he was a \\"wet\\" Democrat. However, he observed that bootleggers had been making under-the-table payments to public officials and law enforcement, thereby corrupting the government. Also, while he disagreed with the policy of Prohibition, it was his personal philosophy the disregard for one law could foster an erosion in the regard of other laws. Because of his resolution to uphold the law, Dever became nicknamed \\"Decent Dever\\" by the press.. Dever launched a major law-enforcement campaign to crack-down on bootlegging. The media labeled his war on bootleggers as the \\"Great Beer War\\". By the end of the year, within only one hundred days of the inauguration of this effort, Chicago was being hailed as the \\"driest\\" city in the nation. Dever's \\"Great Beer War\\" had earned him immense national recognition. Some national media sources speculated he might be a potential dark horse candidate for President of the United States. At the 1924 Democratic National Convention he received serious discussion as a potential vice-presidential nominee. By the end of 1924, media sources discussed him as a serious contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 1928. As Chicago began to dry up, gangs of bootleggers had come into greater competition with one another. By early 1925, this led to the eruption of a massive gangland war. While the vast majority of Chicagoans opposed Prohibition, they had initially supported his tactics to enforce the law. However, subsequent to the onslaught of severe gang violence, the public quickly soured on it. His tactics had also only been partially successful. While he had succeeded in organizing a city government which was largely committed to enforcing the law, other governments and their agencies, such as the county government, were still permissive towards bootlegging. Additionally, certain ward politicians and police captains were still making under-the-table deals with gangs. Dever's term in office saw many improvements to the city's infrastructure, including the completion of Wacker Drive, the extension of Ogden Avenue, the straightening of the Chicago River and the construction of the city's first airport, Municipal Airport. = 1927 mayoral election = Dever ran for re-election in 1927 against \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson, who defeated him by 83,000 votes.

Corr (January 12, 1877 - June 3, 1934) was an American politician. Corr served as the 45th mayor of Chicago, Illinois. Corr's term was as acting mayor from March 15, 1933, following the assassination of Anton Cermak until April 8, 1933. Corr was a member of the Democratic Party. Biography Corr was born in Brooklyn, New York, and his family moved to Chicago in 1890 when he was thirteen years old. Corr attended De La Salle Institute, graduating in 1895Chicago's Mayors: A Collection of Biographies Of All Chicago's Mayors - Frank J. Corr - By Elaine C. Shigley and then Chicago-Kent College of Law, from which he graduated in 1899. Corr was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Chicago. In 1902, Corr was appointed assistant corporation counsel for Chicago. Although he briefly left that position to become a law partner to Judge Walter T. Stanton, he returned to the counsel's office during the administration of Mayor William Dever. During this time, he became active in ward politics and, in 1931, was elected alderman of Chicago's 17th Ward. Corr was in his second term as alderman when Cermak was assassinated in March 1933. Though he was not interested in the position, probably because of ill health and the limits placed on the interim mayor's powers, Corr yielded to the entreaties of Democratic Party leader Patrick Nash, who wanted an interim appointee to serve until a permanent replacement could be selected. Nash promised Corr that he would not have to serve an extended term and the city council then elected Corr to serve as acting mayor until the Illinois General Assembly authorized the council to appoint a permanent replacement. The city council vote was won by Edward Kelly. During Corr's brief administration, his bodyguards killed a nineteen-year-old burglar when they heard a commotion at a hotel near Corr's house. As Acting Mayor, Corr lacked the ability to sign tax warrants, limiting salary payments for city and school employees. When five aldermen traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, Corr followed them to bring them back to Chicago to ensure that his replacement could be elected quickly. At the time of his death, Corr was serving as alderman and running uncontested for election as judge of the circuit court. With his death the night before the election, he was replaced on the ballot by Cornelius J. Harrington. He was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery. Corr's father, Frank V.

Prior to being mayor of Chicago, Kelly served as chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District during the 1920s. Early life and career Born to Stephen, a police officer and Helen (n√©e Lang) Kelly, he was the first of five Chicago mayors from Bridgeport of Chicago's South Side. He did not complete grammar school but entered the labor force at age ten.Life Magazine, 17 July 1944, page 73 Kelly was the chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s. He was sponsored by Patrick Nash, the owner of a sewer-contracting company that did millions of dollars of business with the city. Political career =President of the South Park Commission= In March 1924, Kelly became president of the South Park Commission. Upon his election he declared the end to an era of \\"Deenen Republicans\\", a faction of South Side Republicans allied with Robert R. McCormick which had lost control of the South Park Commission in the March 1924 municipal elections. He presided over the completion and opening of Soldier Field, which was built and operated by the South Park Commission. Kelly organized many public ceremonies and events hosted by the venue. He made the venue the site of fundraisers and other events for charities and organizations which were supported by the Democratic Party. =Mayor of Chicago (1933‚Äì1947)= Kelly with Harry S. Truman after he was nominated for Vice President at the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago Following the assassination of Mayor Anton Cermak, Kelly was hand- picked by his friend, Patrick Nash, Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, to be the Democratic-backed candidate in the City Council's vote on a successor for Cermak. Together, Kelly and Nash built one of the most powerful, and most corrupt, big city political organizations, called the \\"Kelly-Nash Machine\\". Kelly was Mayor of Chicago during the 1933‚Äì34 Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) which took place during the Great Depression which included the successful playing of the first official Major League Baseball All-Star Game; Kelly initiated for holding a major sport event for the fair to the Chicago Tribune. Kelly was famous for banning Nelson Algren's 1942 book Never Come Morning, a novel, from the Chicago Public Library; the ban remained in force for decades due to the outcry by Chicago Polonia upon its release. In 1937, the city received a grant and loan from the Works Progress Administration to begin construction on subways, with a groundbreaking being held December 17, 1938 for the city's first subway. The WPA funding would only partially cover the total cost of the subway (ultimately working out to 3/4 of the total cost). Kelly was also able to obtain WPA financing for projects such as a refurbishment of Midway Airport and roadway improvements. During Kelly's tenure, the city was finally able to unify public transit with the establishment of the Chicago Transit Authority. =End of Tenure= In 1947, Kelly acquiesced to the Cook County Democratic Party's decision to slate a candidate with reform credentials for mayor of Chicago, and was succeeded by Martin H.

In particular, bromine, chlorine, iodine and fluorine may each combine with silver to produce silver bromide (AgBr), silver chloride (AgCl), silver iodide (AgI), and three forms of silver fluoride, respectively. As a group, they are often referred to as the silver halides, and are often given the pseudo-chemical notation AgX. Although most silver halides involve silver atoms with oxidation states of +1 (Ag+), silver halides in which the silver atoms have oxidation states of +2 (Ag2+) are known, of which silver(II) fluoride is the only known stable one. Silver halides are light-sensitive chemicals, and are commonly used in photographic film and paper. Applications =Light sensitivity= Silver halides are used in photographic film and photographic paper, including graphic art film and paper, where silver halide crystals in gelatin are coated on to a film base, glass or paper substrate. The gelatin is a vital part of the emulsion as the protective colloid of appropriate physical and chemical properties. The gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components. When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow electron trap, which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form a silver metal speck. When a silver halide crystal is exposed to light, a sensitivity speck on the surface of the crystal is turned into a small speck of metallic silver (these comprise the invisible or latent image). If the speck of silver contains approximately four or more atoms, it is rendered developable - meaning that it can undergo development which turns the entire crystal into metallic silver. Areas of the emulsion receiving larger amounts of light (reflected from a subject being photographed, for example) undergo the greatest development and therefore results in the highest optical density. Silver bromide and silver chloride may be used separately or combined, depending on the sensitivity and tonal qualities desired in the product. Silver iodide is always combined with silver bromide or silver chloride, except in the case of some historical processes such as the collodion wet plate and daguerreotype, in which the iodide is sometimes used alone (generally regarded as necessary if a daguerreotype is to be developed by the Becquerel method, in which exposure to strong red light, which affects only the crystals bearing latent image specks, is substituted for exposure to mercury fumes). Silver fluoride is not used in photography. Silver halides are also used to make corrective lenses darken when exposed to ultraviolet light (see photochromism). =Chemistry= AgI, AgBr & AgCl (left to right) Silver halides, except for silver fluoride, are very insoluble in water. Silver nitrate can be used to precipitate halides; this application is useful in quantitative analysis of halides. The three main silver halide compounds have distinctive colours that can be used to quickly identify halide ions in a solution. The silver chloride compound forms a white precipitate, silver bromide a creamy coloured precipitate and silver iodide a yellow coloured precipitate. However, close attention is necessary for other compounds in the test solution. Some compounds can considerably increase or decrease the solubility of AgX. Examples of compounds that increase the solubility include: cyanide, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, thiourea, amines, ammonia, sulfite, thioether, crown ether. Examples of compounds that reduces the solubility include many organic thiols and nitrogen compounds that do not possess solubilizing group other than mercapto group or the nitrogen site, such as mercaptooxazoles, mercaptotetrazoles, especially 1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole, benzimidazoles, especially 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, benzotriazole, and these compounds further substituted by hydrophobic groups. Compounds such as thiocyanate and thiosulfate enhance solubility when they are present in a sufficiently large quantity, due to formation of highly soluble complex ions, but they also significantly depress solubility when present in a very small quantity, due to formation of sparingly soluble complex ions. =Medical technology and use= Scientists from Tel Aviv University are experimenting with silver halide optical fibers for transmitting mid-infrared light from carbon dioxide lasers. The fibers allow laser welding of human tissue, as an alternative to traditional sutures.

He served as the 47th Mayor of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois from April 15, 1947 until April 20, 1955. Kennelly was a member of the Democratic Party. According to biographer Peter O'Malley, he was chosen as mayor by a scandal-burdened Democratic machine that needed a reformer on top of the ticket. Kennelly was a wealthy businessman and civic leader, active in Irish and Catholic circles. As a long-time opponent of machine politics he accepted the nomination on condition the machine would not pressure him for patronage and that he did not have to play a leadership role in the party. This gave him a non-partisan image that satisfied the reform element.O'Malley, (1980). As mayor he avoided partisanship and concentrated on building infrastructure and upgrading the city bureaucracy. He worked to extend civil service; he reorganized inefficient departments. The city took ownership of the mass transit system. He obtained federal aid for slum clearance and public housing projects and for new expressways construction.O'Malley, (1980). At his death, Mayor Richard J. Daley, the party leader who defeated Kennelly in a bitter primary battle in 1955, called him, \\"a great Chicagoan who loved his city\\" and ordered City hall flags placed at half staff.\\"Hold Rites Saturday for Martin Kennelly\\" obituary November 30, 1961 in the Chicago Tribune.

It was a development of the twin-engine de Havilland Dove, with a stretched fuselage and two more engines. It was designed as a rugged, conventional low-wing monoplane with tricycle undercarriage that could be used on regional and commuter routes. A total of 149 were built,https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/de-havilland-dh114-heron and it was also exported to about 30 countries. Herons later formed the basis for various conversions, such as the Riley Turbo Skyliner and the Saunders ST-27 and ST-28. Design and development Immediately after the Second World War, the aircraft manufacturer de Havilland developed the DH.104 Dove, a small twin-engined passenger aircraft intended as a replacement for the earlier Dragon Rapide, which soon proved to be successful. As a further development, the company basically enlarged the Dove; the fuselage was lengthened to make room for more passengers or freight, and the wingspan was increased to make room for two more engines. The Heron was of all-metal construction, and was laid out as a conventional design; the resulting aircraft could use many of the parts originally designed for the Dove, thus simplifying logistics for airlines using both types. The emphasis was on rugged simplicity to produce an economical aircraft for short- to medium-stage routes in isolated and remote areas which did not possess modern airports. The Heron was designed with a fixed undercarriage and reliable ungeared unsupercharged Gipsy Queen 30 engines. The Heron prototype registered to the de Havilland Aircraft Company, Hatfield, UK as G-ALZL undertook its first flight with Geoffrey Pike at the controls on 10 May 1950.Jackson, A.J. British Civil Aircraft Since 1919, Volume 2. London: Putnam & Company, 1973. . The aircraft was unpainted at the time, and after 100 hours of testing was introduced to the public on 8 September 1950 at the Farnborough Airshow, still glistening in its polished metal state. By November, the prototype had received its formal British Certificate of Airworthiness and had flown to Khartoum and Nairobi for tropical trials. The prototype was then painted and fitted out as a company demonstrator, and was tried by British European Airways in 1951 on its Scottish routes. Following the successful completion of the prototype trials as a regional airliner, series production of the Heron began. The first deliveries were to NAC, the New Zealand National Airways Corporation (later part of Air New Zealand). Basic price for a new Heron in 1960 was around ¬£60,000, minus radio.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%202684.html Operational service The first Heron, Series 1A suffered deficiencies, as NAC soon discovered. First, the aircraft was generally underpowered. Its quite heavy engines (weighing about each), had an output of only each. By comparison, later modifications or rebuilt aircraft had as much as 50% more power (in the case of the Saunders ST-27). Unlike the Dove, the Heron came with a fixed undercarriage and no nosewheel steering, which simplified maintenance, but reduced top speed. Secondly the lightweight aluminium alloy wingspars were prone to constant cracking due to the heavy loading on the wing caused by the overweight engines and rough landings on unpaved runways at the time. NAC resolved this by replacing the aluminium spars with heavier steel spars, reducing the performance of the Heron Series 1A (re-classified 1B) to uneconomic levels for the services required of them in New Zealand. NAC disposed of them in 1957. Heron 2 VH-NJI on display at Australia's Museum of Flight in 2006 has had a long and varied career. Serving initially with Turkey's national carrier, THY, from 1955 to 1966, it subsequently served with Royal Air Canada (1966‚Äì1969) and the North American operators Fleet Air (1969‚Äì1971), Swift Air (1971‚Äì1978) and Susquehanna Airlines (1978‚Äì1985) who then sold it to Fiji Air (1985‚Äì1991) After 51 Series 1 aircraft had been built, production switched to the Series 2, featuring retractable landing gear, which reduced drag and fuel consumption, and increased the top speed marginally. The 2A was the equivalent of the 1A, the basic passenger aircraft while the 1B and its successor the 2B had higher maximum takeoff weight, the 2C featured fully feathering propellers, the Heron 2D had an even higher maximum takeoff weight, while the Heron 2E was a VIP version. In service, the Heron was generally well received by flight crews and passengers who appreciated the additional safety factor of the four engines. At a time when smaller airliners were still rare in isolated and remote regions, the DH.114 could provide reliable and comfortable service with seating for 17 passengers, in individual seats on either side of the aisle. With its larger fuselage, passengers could stand up whilst moving down the aisle and large windows were also provided. Baggage was stored in an aft compartment with an additional smaller area in the nose. A few peculiarities appeared; passengers who filled the aft rows first would find that the Heron gently \\"sat down\\" on its rear skid. Pilots and ground crews soon added a tail brace to prevent the aircraft from sitting awkwardly on its tail. Performance throughout the Heron range was relatively \\"leisurely\\", and after production at de Havilland's Chester factory ceased in 1963, several companies, most notably Riley Aircraft Corporation, offered various Heron modification \\"kits,\\" mainly related to replacing the engines, which greatly enhanced takeoff and top speed capabilities.

Retrieved: 13 August 2008. Prinair also considerably stretched Heron 2 N574PR to allow extra passengers to be carried. Connellan Airways also converted its Herons, using Riley kits. When available aircraft reached the end of their service lives, the engine conversions gave the elderly airliner a new lease of life as a number of examples were converted in the 1970s and 1980s including N415SA, a Riley Heron still flying in Sweden as of 20 May 2012 and a Riley Turbo Skyliner, tail number N600PR currently registered in the United States (this example appeared in the 1986 movie Club ParadiseEbert, Roger. \\" 'Club Paradise' Review\\".

He has been a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin Bay South constituency since 2016, and previously from 2002 to 2011 for the Dublin South constituency. He previously served as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2007 to 2011. Early and personal life Ryan was born in Dublin in 1963 and raised in Dundrum, where he continues to live with his family. He was educated at Gonzaga College, a fee-paying school and University College Dublin, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was manager of the UCD Marketing Development Programme from 1985 to 1986, and following three years of emigration and unemployment in 1989, he founded Cycling Safaris, a company which organises cycling holidays in Ireland and Europe. He married the author and journalist Victoria White in 1998 and they have four children. Political career He first became involved in politics in 1998, when he was co-opted to Dublin City Council, taking up the seat previously held by John Gormley. He topped the poll at the 1999 local elections in the Rathmines local electoral area. From 1995 to 2002, he served on the advisory committee of the Dublin Transport Office. At the 2002 general election, he was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Green Party TD for the Dublin South constituency. He served as Green Party Spokesperson for Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources during the 29th D√°il. He announced on 13 September 2004, that he intended to seek his party's nomination to be a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. However, when it was announced that the incumbent, Mary McAleese, was seeking a second term he withdrew. His campaign was also hit by his admission of cannabis use, an illegal drug.\\"David Norris in Irish presidential campaign row\\". BBC News. Retrieved 1 June 2011. =Government: 2007‚Äì2011= Ryan in 2007 He was re-elected to the D√°il at the 2007 general election held on 24 May. On 13 June, the Green Party voted in favour of entering into a coalition government with Fianna F√°il and the Progressive Democrats at a special party convention. Ryan was appointed to the cabinet by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources when the 30th D√°il sat the following day. As Minister, he stated his priorities would be to improve upon the changes underway in the Irish energy sector, with strong emphasis on aiding the adaptation of renewables and building retrofitting. He also aimed to enhance communications infrastructure where Ireland had fallen behind other countries. During his period in office, installed wind capacity in Ireland doubled, and by 2010 the average daily energy derived from renewable sources (as a percentage of total demand) had increased to 17%, peaking at 42%. He also committed Ireland to the European Super Grid programme in 2009 and announced major government investment in marine energy research projects. Government schemes were expanded for home energy retrofitting as uptake increased, the National Broadband Scheme was completed, a Broadband for Schools Scheme launched, and a national electric vehicle and chargepoint initiative was announced in conjunction with the ESB Electric Ireland and Peugeot Citro√´n, which was subsequently implemented by the new government. In response to the Corrib gas controversy, the environmental activist organisation Shell to Sea and its spokesperson Maura Harrington, criticised Ryan for joining Fianna F√°il in coalition as the terms of the programme for government did not include a reversal or renegotiation of the proposed gas pipeline and refinery at Broadhaven Bay, County Mayo. Before entering into government, Ryan supported the aims of the Shell to Sea campaign and attended their protests. Ryan was also criticised by Shell to Sea for failing to launch an independent review of the decision, as stipulated by the Green Party in a motion passed at their annual convention in 2007. Ryan resigned as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 23 January 2011, when the Green Party withdrew from government. The following day he helped broker an agreement with Fine Gael and the Labour Party which ensured the passing of the 2011 Finance bill, prior to the holding of the general election on the 25 February 2011. He lost his seat at election, receiving 6.8% of the vote. As part of his pension Ryan will receive a lump sum of ‚Ç¨110,000 and an annual pension of ‚Ç¨51,000 when he is 65, in 2028. =Green Party leader in opposition: 2011‚Äì2020= He was one of three candidates to contest the subsequent Green Party leadership election of May 2011. He was elected leader on 27 May 2011, succeeding John Gormley. The party had no representation in the Oireachtas when he became leader. In 2012, he became an associate with E3G working on an assessment of the development potential of the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative in a project which was supported by the European Climate Foundation and the Children‚Äôs Investment Fund Foundation. In 2013, he organised two climate gatherings which brought international climate experts to Ireland to examine what new narratives are needed to increase public support for action on the climate issue. He was the Green Party candidate in the Dublin constituency at the 2014 European Parliament election, but was not elected. He was elected a TD for the Dublin Bay South constituency in the 2016 general election, alongside deputy leader Catherine Martin who secured a seat in Dublin Rathdown. The Greens' return to the D√°il following their wipeout in 2011 was the first time in Irish election history that a political party had been able to survive losing all their TDs. In 2019, Ryan called for wolves to be reintroduced to Ireland. Fine Gael rejected this suggestion, with Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan responding that her department had no plans to reintroduce wolves into the country, saying that the \\"large predator\\" doing so would do damage to farming. He reiterated the following January that he would like to see them introduced in his lifetime. Also in 2019, comments he made on car use in rural Ireland which were published in an article by The Irish Times was criticised online. The newspaper also stated that Ryan suggested that a village of 300 people needs just 30 cars to operate. In the article, Ryan stated people could walk to a pick-up point or cycle. Responding to the article, the party took issue with the headline, and in a statement said the original headline ('\\"You don't need to own a car to live in rural Ireland\\" - Green Party T.D') had caused ‚Äúa flood of online fury ‚Äì and rightly so, because a suggestion like that would be ridiculous and impractical‚Äù. In 2020, the Green Party had its best election result in the general election of that year, with the party increasing its representation in the D√°il to 12 TDs. In March 2020, in a speech in a debate on responses to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, he made comments on growing food in the event of a supply crisis that went viral online, saying, \\"we'll have our salads ready to go!\\" In June 2020, he was criticised online, particularly by Green Party councillors, for his use of the phrase \\"you nigger\\" when quoting director Sean Gallen on his experiences of racism. Gallen himself said that Ryan's intentions were \\"really good\\" as he tried \\"to bring up this big issue of racism within an Irish context\\". Ryan publicly apologised the same day as the speech. =Government: 2020‚Äìpresent= On 27 June 2020, following 139 days of negotiations, the members of Fianna F√°il, Fine Gael and the Green Party all voted in favour of entering government together as a coalition. There had been concern that the proposal would not be accepted by the Green members, as the proposal required that it pass with 66% of the members in favour it. However, in the end 76% of the Green Party membership voted in favour of the deal. Irish Times writer Pat Leahy described the vote to enter government as \\"vindication\\" for Eamon Ryan's leadership of the party and suggested it would strengthen his hand in the subsequent Green Party leadership contest. Green Party rules require a leadership election within 6 months of a general election in Ireland. Ryan sought re-election, and Deputy Leader Catherine Martin also contested the position, leading to the 2020 Green Party leadership election. Ryan was considered to represent the moderate \\"Old Guard\\" who were in favour of entering government while Martin was considered to represent younger, more radical Green party members apprehensive about working with Fianna F√°il or Fine Gael. On entering the government, Ryan was appointed as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport. Ryan fell asleep in the D√°il during a vote on a motion on workers' rights, in which fellow TDs had to wake him up so he could vote. On 23 July 2020, Ryan was re-elected as Green Party leader, defeating deputy leader Catherine Martin by 994 votes (51.24%) to 946 (48.76%).

Daley, from December 20, 1976, until April 16, 1979. Bilandic was a Democrat and a Croatian-American who also served as Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court some years after his tenure as Chicago mayor. Bilandic practiced law in Chicago for several years, having graduated from the DePaul University College of Law. Bilandic served as an alderman in the Chicago City Council, representing the eleventh ward on the south-west side (Bridgeport neighborhood) from June 1969 until he began his tenure as mayor in December 1976. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Chicago to Croatian immigrant parents, Bilandic studied at De La Salle Institute (then known as De La Salle High School); graduating in 1940.ILLINOIS SENATE RESOLUTION - Michael A. Bilandic - (Mayor of Chicago; 1976-79) Bilandic joined the United States Marine Corps during World War II in 1943, serving as first lieutenant until 1945. After his time in the Marine Corps, Bilandic returned to school; receiving his bachelor's degree from St. Mary's University of Minnesota in 1947. After college, Bilandic returned to Chicago and became involved in political work. Bilandic began working in the city's eleventh ward was asked by then‚Äìcommitteeman Richard J. Daley to aid the Democratic party in 1948. In 1951, Bilandic later received his law degree from DePaul University College of Law. Bilandic officially began his political career after being elected alderman of the city's eleventh ward in the 1969 election, succeeding Matthew J. Danaher and taking office on March 11, 1969. =Mayor of Chicago (1976; 1977‚Äì79)= When Mayor Richard J. Daley died on December 20, 1976, the President Pro Tempore of the City Council, Wilson Frost, announced that he was now acting mayor. However, much of the city council disputed Frost's claim. After nearly a week of closed-door negotiations, the city council announced that Bilandic had been selected to serve as acting mayor for approximately six months until a special election could be held to choose a mayor to fill out the remaining two years in the late Mayor Daley's term. Bilandic was selected with the proviso that he would not contend in the election. Nonetheless, Bilandic chose to run in the spring election in 1977 and, still in his honeymoon period, received a popular mandate to assume Daley's mantle. Bilandic defeated Democratic candidates Edward Hanrahan, Anthony Martin- Trigona, Roman Pucinski, Ellis Reid and Harold Washington in the April 1977 primary election. On June 7, 1977, Bilandic was elected the mayor of Chicago in the general election, defeating Dennis Block (Republican), Dennis Brasky (Socialist Labor) and Gerald Rose (U.S. Labor). Bilandic delivered his inaugural address and took office on June 22, 1977. However, popular though he was at this time, his term as mayor would prove to be short and difficult. Bilandic had to face several labor disputes while in the mayor's office, including a gravediggers and cemetery owners' strike and a threatened strike by members of Lyric Opera of Chicago.Drell, Adrienne (ed.), 2000, 20th Century Chicago: 100 years 100 voices, Sports Publishing Inc., p. 167. The Chicago Butcher's Union worked to stop stores from selling fresh meat after 6 p.m., but Bilandic managed to work out a settlement. Bilandic also had to face social unrest in June 1977 when an FALN bomb exploded in City Hall and started a two-day riot among the Puerto Rican community. Bilandic oversaw the creation of ChicagoFest, a food and music festival held on Navy Pier. The Chicago Marathon had its first running in 1977 and Bilandic participated, finishing with a time of 4 hours.Drell, Adrienne (ed.), 2000, 20th Century Chicago: 100 years 100 voices, Sports Publishing Inc., pp. 166‚Äì167. A runner himself, Bilandic arranged to have five miles of unused equestrian paths along the lakefront converted to running paths. During January 1979, a blizzard struck Chicago and effectively closed down the city; dropping a total of thirty-five inches of snow over a two-day period. The city's slow response to the debilitating storm was publicly blamed on Bilandic. Additionally, as part of attempts to deal with the storm, Bilandic ordered Chicago 'L' trains to bypass many intermediate stops, particularly affecting black neighborhoods on the South Side of the city,Eyes on the Prize: PBS 1990 at 28:43 and angering that large voter base. = 1979 Democratic primary= The former longtime head of Chicago's consumer affairs department, Jane Byrne (who was fired by Bilandic in 1977), ran against the mayor in the 1979 Democratic mayoral primary. Besides dissatisfaction with the city's handling of the snowstorm, other issues hindered the mayor's reelection campaign. Republicans voted in the Democratic primary against the mayor in order to defeat the Democratic machine that had dominated Chicago politics for decades. Reverend Jesse Jackson endorsed Byrne for mayor. And North Side and Northwest Side voters voted for Byrne because they were angered by the Democratic leadership's slating of only South Side and Southwest Side candidates for mayor, clerk, and treasurer. Bilandic very narrowly lost the primary, with 49% to Byrne's 51%; Byrne then won the general election with a record-setting 82% of the vote and became Chicago's first female mayor.Jane Byrne elected mayor of Chicago, February 27, 1979, Chicago Tribune  Personal life  Chicago's Archbishop John Cardinal Cody married Bilandic to Chicago socialite Heather Morgan on June 1, 1977. Bilandic and Morgan had a son, Michael Bilandic Jr., born in 1978.Drell, Adrienne (ed.), 2000, 20th Century Chicago: 100 years 100 voices, Sports Publishing Inc., p. 166. Later career and death Following his term as mayor, Bilandic was elected to the Illinois Appellate Court in 1984, and then the Illinois Supreme Court in 1990, where Bilandic served until 2000. From 1994 until 1996, Bilandic served as the Illinois Chief Justice.Michael A.

He is regarded in Buddhism as an enlightened disciple, being foremost in ascetic practice. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa assumed leadership of the monastic community following the paranirvƒÅ·πáa (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the First Buddhist Council. He was considered to be the first patriarch in a number of early Buddhist schools and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the Chan and Zen traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \\"guarantor of future justice\\" in the time of Maitreya, the future Buddhahe has been described as \\"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\\". In canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was born as Pippali in a brahmin caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named Bhadra-KapilƒÅnƒ´. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was ordained as a monk, named KƒÅ≈õyapa, but later called MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa to distinguish him from other disciples. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his robe with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the Buddhist teaching. He became foremost in ascetic practices and attained enlightenment shortly after. He often had disputes with ƒÄnanda, the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing ƒÄnanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward ƒÄnanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa stood for, emphasizing monastic discipline, brahmin and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of ƒÄnanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa, to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a lineage of patriarchs of Buddhism. In many post-canonical texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of meditation and suspended animation, which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called Kukku·π≠apƒÅda, until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several cults and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.  In early Buddhist texts  In the Early Buddhist Texts of several textual traditions, a dozen discourses attributed to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the PƒÅli tradition, this is part of the collection called the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya, and in Chinese Buddhist texts, the collection is called the Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, numbered Taish≈ç 2:99 and 2:100. The Chinese Ekottara ƒÄgama also contains a passage that runs parallel to the PƒÅli Sa·πÉyutta, T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, and another passage about him and the monk Bakkula. Finally, there are also Vinaya texts from the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition about MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa in the Tibetan language. = Early life = Pippala Cave in Rajgir, where MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is recorded to have stayed. PƒÅli accounts relate that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was born Pippali in a brahmin family in a village called MahƒÅtittha, in the kingdom of Magadha, present-day India. His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was SumanƒÅdevƒ´. His body had some of the thirty-two characteristics of a Great Man (; ), which in Buddhism are seen as the characteristics of a future Buddha. From his youth onward, he was inclined toward living a spiritual life rather than marrying, but his father wanted him to wed. To send his father on a wild goose chase, he agreed to marry but then produced a perfect golden statue of a woman, and asked his father to find him a woman that matched the statue. Four copies of the image were taken throughout the country to find the right woman. A brahmin from Kapila had a daughter called Bhadra-KapilƒÅnƒ´ (), who had no interest in a family life either. However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali. Next, in the PƒÅli version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway. In the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures. She replied she also did not care for such matters, whereupon he revealed that he was her future husband. Both versions relate that the two agreed to marry and to live celibately, to the chagrin of Pippali's parents. Pippali is depicted in the PƒÅli version as very wealthy, using much perfume and possessing much land and chariots. Later, in the PƒÅli version, Pippali and Bhadra saw animals eating each other on the fertile fields as they were plowed by their workers. The sight brought pity and fear to them, and they determined to live a mendicant live instead, and leave the agricultural business behind. In the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda version, it was the pitiful sight of the workers instead which brought Pippali to leave his lay life. The two went their separate ways, as not to grow any attachment to each other, and to prevent gossip and disrepute. = Meeting the Buddha = Shortly after that, Pippali met the Buddha, was struck with devotion when seeing him, and asked to be ordained under him. Thenceforth, he was called KƒÅ≈õyapa. As he ordained him, the Buddha gave three directives to practice: KƒÅ≈õyapa should develop a \\"lively sense of fear and regard\\" towards his fellow monastics, regardless of their status; KƒÅ≈õyapa should attentively listen and practice the teachings of the Buddha (; ); and he should live in mindfulness. alt=Monk in Chinese-style robes, bowing in respect with hands clasped and smiling When the two met, (or in some versions, some time later) MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa exchanged his fine and expensive robe with that of the Buddha, a robe made of rags. The exchange came to be seen as a gesture of great respect the Buddha had made. It was unprecedented, and a sign that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa would preside over the First Council after the Buddha's demise. Texts from different traditions suggest that only a person with the great merit as MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa would be able to wear the robe. The only reason the robe was highly valuable was that it had been worn by the Buddha. In itself is was not valuable, because it came from the lowest source, that is, a female slave's corpse discarded in a charnel ground. This also echoed an earlier exchange that took place after the Buddha's Great Renunciation, when he swapped his lay robes with a hunter in the forest. Finally, the fact that it was a rag-robe contributed to the ascetic identity of the figure of MahƒÅka≈õyapa. Throughout cultures, \\"inalienable possessions\\", often textiles, were symbols of authority and continuity in a family. Gautama Buddha giving his robe to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa in the latter's early monastic years demonstrated a deep sense of respect for this disciple. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was seen to safeguard this robe to pass on to the future Buddha. Thus, the robe came to represent a passing on of the transmission of Buddhist teachings, and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa became a symbol of the continuity of the Buddha's dispensation. In this context, the rag-robe was also associated in several Asian cultures with gestation, birth, rebirth, impermanence and death. = Monastic life = The Buddha exhorted MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa that he should practice himself \\"for the welfare and happiness of the multitude\\" and impressed upon him that he should take upon himself ascetic practices (, ). Accordingly, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa took upon him the thirteen ascetic practices (including living in the wilderness, living only from alms and wearing rag-robes) and became an enlightened disciple (arahat) in nine days. He was then called 'KƒÅ≈õyapa the Great' (), because of his good qualities, and to distinguish him from other monks with the same name. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was one of the most revered of the Buddha's disciples, the renunciant par excellence. He was praised by the Buddha as foremost in ascetic practices () and a foremost forest dweller. He excelled in supernatural accomplishments (; ) and was equal to the Buddha in meditative absorption (; ). He is depicted as a monk with great capacity to tolerate discomfort and contentment with the bare necessities of life. In one discourse found in the PƒÅli and Chinese collections, the Buddha advised MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa that having grown old, he should give up ascetic practices and live close to the Buddha. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa declined, however. When the Buddha asked him to explain, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa said he found the practices of benefit to himself. He also argued he could be an example for incoming generations of practitioners. The Buddha agreed with him, and affirmed the benefits of ascetic practices, which he had himself praised for a long time. A second discourse found in the PƒÅli and two Chinese collections has MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa meet the Buddha as he was wearing simple rag-robes and, according to the Chinese versions, his hair and beard long. Other monks criticized MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa for not looking appropriate when meeting his master. The Buddha responded by praising MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, however. In the Chinese versions, the Buddha even went so far as to allow MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa to share his seat, but MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa politely declined. When MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa fell ill once, the Buddha went to visit him and reminded him of his efforts in practicing the Buddhist teaching. = Relation with ƒÄnanda = MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda were fellow disciples of the Buddha. ƒÄnanda was the Buddha's close attendant. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is often depicted in the early texts as acting critically toward ƒÄnanda. For example, one time MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa chastised ƒÄnanda in strong words, criticizing the fact that ƒÄnanda was travelling with a large following of young monks who appeared untrained and who had built up a bad reputation. According to the early texts, ƒÄnanda's role in founding the bhik·π£unƒ´ (nun) order made him popular with the bhik·π£unƒ´s. ƒÄnanda often taught them, often encouraged women to ordain, and when he was criticized by MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, several bhik·π£unƒ´s tried to defend him. Another time, shortly after the passing away of the Buddha, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa gave a teaching to bhik·π£unƒ´s in the presence of ƒÄnanda, to which one bhik·π£unƒ´ called Sth≈´lanandƒÅ () responded by criticizing MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. She felt it inappropriate that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa should teach in ƒÄnanda's presence, whom she thought of as the superior monk. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa asked whether ƒÄnanda agreed with her, but he dismissed her as a foolish woman. Then MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa proceeded to have ƒÄnanda admit that the Buddha publicly had acknowledged MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa for numerous attainments. Sri Lankan scholar Karaluvinna hypothesizes that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa did this to dispel doubts about his role as leader of the sa·πÉgha (; monastic community). In a similar event, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa reprimanded ƒÄnanda for not taking responsibility for his pupils. In this case, Sth≈´lanandƒÅ heavily criticized MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa for doing so, and accused him in a hateful rush for having been an adherent of a non-Buddhist religious sect. In some accounts, she even undressed herself in front of him to insult him. He tried to convince her that he was a legitimate disciple of the Buddha, but to no avail. Shortly after, she left the nun's life, and in some accounts, died and was reborn in hell. According to Indologist Oskar von Hin√ºber, ƒÄnanda's pro-bhik·π£unƒ´ attitude may well be the reason why there was frequent dispute between ƒÄnanda and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Disputes that eventually led MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa to charge ƒÄnanda with several offenses during the First Buddhist Council, and possibly caused two factions in the sa·πÉgha to emerge, connected with these two disciples. In general, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was known for his aloofness and love of solitude. But as a teacher, he was a stern mentor who held himself and his fellow renunciates against high standards. He was considered worthy of reverence, but also a sharp critic who impressed upon others that respect to him was due. Compared to ƒÄnanda, he was much colder and stricter, but also more impartial and detached, and religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma argues that these broad differences in character explain the events between MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda better than the more specific idea of pro- and anti-bhik·π£unƒ´ stances. PƒÅli scholar Rune Johansson (1918‚Äì1981) argued that the events surrounding MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, ƒÄnanda and the bhik·π£unƒ´s prove that in Buddhism, enlightened disciples can still be seen to make mistakes. Going against this, however, Buddhist studies scholar Bhikkhu Analayo hypothesizes that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa chose to teach ƒÄnanda to abandon favoritism, and left the bhik·π£unƒ´s for ƒÄnanda himself to deal with. = Teacher and mentor = alt=Elderly man smiling, with shaved hair and long earlobes PƒÅli texts state that the Buddha regarded MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as his equal in exhorting monks to lead active and zealous lives, and the Buddha praised him for his capacity to instill faith in lay people by teaching. Karaluvinna believes that the Buddha may have been grooming MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa for his later role as leader of the sa·πÉgha. In the Sa·πÉyutta discourses featuring MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa in the PƒÅli and its Chinese parallels, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is raised as an example of teaching doctrine from a pure and compassionate intention. Religion scholar Shayne Clarke argues that the aloof and austere ascetic as he is presented in most texts does not provide a complete picture. AnƒÅlayo notes that he did take an active concern in community matters, spent time teaching doctrine and persuaded fellow monastics to practice asceticism. This is also shown in his role as leader of the First Council. The Sanskrit MahƒÅkarmavibha·πÖga states that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa carried out important teaching work, and was able to bring Buddhism to the people in the northwest, starting with Avanti. However, because of his stern tone of teaching and his being selective in people to teach, his teaching style came under criticism by other monks and bhik·π£unƒ´s: he was not popular, especially among bhik·π£unƒ´s. This caused him to gradually withdraw from teaching, AnƒÅlayo argues. Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists. Clarke argues that the image of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \\"branded\\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general. Studying M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda texts of monastic discipline, Clarke points out that there is also an \\"in-house\\" perspective on MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, which shows that he interacted with his former wife turned bhik·π£unƒ´ frequently to mentor her. Shortly after MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa became ordained under the Buddha, he met his former wife Bhadra, who had joined an order of naked ascetics led by Nirgrantha P≈´ra·πáa (). She was regularly targeted for rape by her fellow ascetics, however. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa pitied her and persuaded her to become ordained as a Buddhist bhik·π£unƒ´ instead. Nevertheless, she was still harassed often, but now only when going outside. Since this happened when Bhadra went out in villages to obtain alms, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa requested the Buddha's permission to daily give half of the alms food he had gained to her, so she did not need to go out anymore. His actions came under criticism, however, from a group of monks called the Group of Six, as well as Sth≈´lanandƒÅ. Although these monastics were known for their misbehavior, Clarke thinks their criticism was probably indicative of \\"the general monastic ambivalence toward those of an ascetic bent\\". Writing about Sth≈´lanandƒÅ, Ohnuma says that Sth≈´lanandƒÅ went against the idea of detachment and renunciation as generally advocated in early Buddhist monasticism, which is why she hated MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and Bhadra. She expressed criticism of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa often, even when he did not act with typical ascetic detachment. Regardless, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa continued to guide his former wife and she attained arhat () afterwards. In a poem attributed to her, she praises her ex-husband's gifts, shared vision of the truth and spiritual friendship. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa did not mention her in his poems, though. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Seventh-eighth century, left MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was sometimes consulted by other leading monks on points of doctrine. After some teachers from non-Buddhist sects asked the elder ≈öƒÅriputra about the unanswered questions, he consulted with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as to why the Buddha had never given an answer to these questions. At another occasion, ≈öƒÅriputra consulted him about developing efforts in the practice of Buddhist teachings. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was also ≈öro·πáa- Ko·π≠ikar·πáa's () teacher and friend of the family, and later his upƒÅdhyƒÅya (). He taught the A·π≠·π≠hakavagga to him, and later ≈öro·πáa became well known for the recitation of it. Another aspect of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's role as teacher was his compassion for the poor. Numerous accounts describe how he went out of his way to give impoverished donors the chance to give to him and support him in his livelihood. Such donors would typically provide him with secondhand food, which in the culture of Brahminism at the time was considered impure. By receiving food from these donors, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was considered a field of merit for them, or, in other words, an opportunity for them to make merit and \\"vanquish their bad karma\\". In one case, he sought out a very poor woman who was at the end of her life, just to give her an opportunity to give a little. At first she did not dare to because she felt the food's quality was too low, but when MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa kept waiting, she eventually realized he had just come for her, and gave. Religion scholar Liz Wilson argues that these accounts of generosity have been influenced by pre-Buddhist beliefs of Vedic sacrifice, in which the sacrificer and the sacrificed are connected, and the offering contains something of the person offering. By giving something of themselves, the donors acquire a new self, and purify themselves by means of the monastic recipient. In one account, a leprose person accidentally lets her finger fall off in a bowl of food she is offering. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa accepts and consumes the offering anyway. Further, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's choice for poor people to make merit is further amplified by having supernatural or extraordinary donors like deities or a wealthy merchant compete with the poor, and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa accepting only the poor as donor. In one discourse, he even advises other monastics against visiting \\"high-born families\\". The poor donors making an offering to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa thus become empowered with a high status and power through their merit-making. Wilson surmises, \\"[t]he perfect donor, in Mahakassapa's eyes, is the donor who has the least to give...\\". MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's insistence on accepting offerings from the poor and refusing those from high-standing or supernatural donors was part of the anti-establishment character with which MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is depicted. This also includes his long hair and beard. In one text, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's refusal of high-profile donors led to the Buddha issuing a rule that donations must not be refused. = Final respects to the Buddha = alt=Monk holding hands in the air, standing next to nearly naked man holding flower (above). Funeral pyre with feet sticking out, two monks holding hands clasped facing the feet (below) According to the early PƒÅli discourse about the Buddha's last days and passing into NirvƒÅ·πáa (), MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa learnt about the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa (; death and attainment of final NirvƒÅ·πáa) after seven days. He was resting from a journey with a following of monks when he met an ƒÅjƒ´vika ascetic who was carrying a flower from a coral tree which originated from heaven. He asked him about the flower, and it turned out it the entire area of Ku≈õinagara (), where the Buddha had passed away, was covered in it. According to some Tibetan sources, however, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa knew of the Buddha's passing because of an earthquake. In the PƒÅli texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa then rushed back from the PƒÅva Mountain to arrive in Ku≈õinagara seven days later. But in the Tibetan texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was concerned that King AjƒÅta≈õatru might die of shock when he heard of the Buddha's passing. He therefore warned a brahmin who worked at the court, who was able to prevent the king from dying. Only then did he proceed to Ku≈õinagara. It turned out the Malla people from Ku≈õinagara had attempted to light the funeral pyre of the Buddha, but were unable to. PƒÅli accounts state that the monk Anuruddha explained to them that deities prevented the funeral pyre from being lit until the arrival of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, although sixth-century Chinese Buddhist texts say it was the spiritual power of the Buddha instead which caused the delay. The accounts continue that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa paid \\"deep and tender homage\\" at the Buddha's feet. The Buddha's feet miraculously emerged from the coffin, in which the Buddha's body was enshrouded with many layers of cloth. As soon as he had finished, the pyre lit spontaneously, although in some versions, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa lit the pyre himself in the traditional Indian role of the eldest son. Buddhologist Andr√© Bareau (1921‚Äì1993) regarded the episode of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa learning of the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa and his lighting of the pyre as an embellishment that was inserted by authors of monastic discipline over the fifth, fourth and third centuries BCE, to emphasize the person of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Bareau reasoned that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa did not attend the Buddha's cremation in the original version, and that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa could have taken a route of just a few hours via PƒÅva to Ku≈õinagara. Regardless, the story of the delay and of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa eventually lighting the funeral pyre indicates how much MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was respected, as he was regarded as the most important heir to the Buddha's dispensation. = First Buddhist Council =  Narratives  MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, Tham Khao Rup Chang Temple, alt=Monk in robes, stern face, bushy eyebrows, holding staff and prayer beads When the Buddha had attained parinirvƒÅ·πáa (death), and when MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was reportedly 120 years old, the number of disciples that had once met the Buddha or had attained enlightenment was shrinking. Some monks, among them a monk called Subhadra (), expressed satisfaction that they could now do as they pleased, because their teacher the Buddha was no longer there to prohibit them from anything. Some Chinese and Tibetan texts state that there was \\"doubt and consternation\\" among many disciples. The Sanskrit A≈õokavadƒÅna and the Chinese MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ≈õƒÅstra say that many enlightened disciples wished to stop teaching, leave the world behind and attain paranirvƒÅ·πáa. This alarmed MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, and he successfully attempted to stop his fellow disciples from leaving the world. To record the Buddha's discourses and preserve monastic discipline, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa set up the First Buddhist Council. According to the texts, the First Buddhist Council was held in a cave called Saptapar·πáaguhƒÅ in RƒÅjag·πõha (, present-day Rajgir), which was the site of many Buddhist discourses. In the first rains retreat (, ) after the Buddha had died, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa called upon ƒÄnanda to recite the discourses he had heard, as a representative on this council. There was a rule issued, however, that only arhats were allowed to attend the council, to prevent bias like favoritism or sectarianism from clouding the disciples' memories. ƒÄnanda had not attained enlightenment yet. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa therefore did not yet allow ƒÄnanda to attend. Although he knew that ƒÄnanda's presence in the council was required, he did not want to be biased by allowing an exception to the rule. The M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition adds that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa initially allowed ƒÄnanda to join as a sort of servant assisting during the council, but then was forced to remove him when the disciple Anuruddha saw that ƒÄnanda was not yet enlightened. Nevertheless, that night, ƒÄnanda was able to attain enlightenment. When the Council began the next morning, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa questioned UpƒÅli, to establish the texts on monastic discipline for monks and bhik·π£u·πáis. ƒÄnanda was consulted to recite the discourses and to determine which were authentic and which were not. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa asked of each discourse that ƒÄnanda listed where, when, and to whom it was given. Then the assembly agreed that ƒÄnanda's memories and recitations were correct, after which the discourse collection (, ) was considered finalized and closed. In some versions of the account, the Abhidharma () was also standardized during this council, or rather its precursor the MƒÅt·πõka. Some texts say it was MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa who reviewed it, and other texts say it was ƒÄnanda or ≈öƒÅriputra. During the recitations, one problem was raised. Before the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa, he had mentioned to ƒÄnanda that, if required, minor rules could be abolished after his passing. Now the question remained what the Buddha had meant when he said minor rules. The monks present at the council discussed several possibilities, but it was not resolved. To prevent disrepute of the sa·πÉgha and criticism from non-Buddhists, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa opposed to abolish any rules of discipline. After the council, Mah√°k√°yapa attempted to have the monks GavƒÅmpati and PurƒÅ·πáa approve the results of the council, but both preferred not to give their opinion about the matter. During the same council, ƒÄnanda was charged for an offense by MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and other members of the sa·πÖgha for having enabled women to join the monastic order. Besides this, he was charged for having forgotten to request the Buddha to specify which offenses of monastic discipline could be disregarded; for having stepped on the Buddha's robe; for having allowed women to honor the Buddha's body after his death, which was not properly covered, and during which his body was sullied by their tears; and for having failed to ask the Buddha to continue to live on. ƒÄnanda did not acknowledge these as offenses, but he conceded to do a formal confession anyway, \\"... in faith of the opinion of the venerable elder monks\\".  Historicity  alt=Monk with stern face and slight protrusion in skull, sitting and holding his hand as though he is holding a staff The most well- known version of the First Council is that of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa being the head. However, texts of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda, and Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka traditions relate that this was ƒÄj√±ƒÅta Kau·πá·∏çinya () instead, as Kau·πá·∏çinya was the most senior disciple. Buddhologist Jean Przyluski (1885‚Äì1944) argued that the earliest accounts placed Kau·πá·∏çinya at the head of the sa·πÉgha, and that originally, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was a conventional figure, with no administrative or leading role. However, because of his unquestioned ascetic saint-like reputation, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa came to replace Kau·πá·∏çinya's role as leader during the cremation and the First Council. Przyluski's theory has been criticized, however, on the grounds that it is difficult to maintain that the three textual traditions he mentioned are the oldest. Still, Bareau argued that the incident with Subhadra leading to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa summoning the council is a later insertion, though early enough to be found in all traditions of early Buddhist texts. He believed it was the authors of texts of monastic discipline that inserted it shortly after the Buddha's passing away, at the end of the fifth century BCE, to glorify MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Tradition states that the First Council lasted for seven months. However, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as Orientalist Ivan Minayev (1840‚Äì1890), thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical, and not the council itself. Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist Hermann Oldenberg (1854‚Äì1920), considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the Second Council, and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council. On the other hand, archaeologist Louis Finot (1864‚Äì1935) and Indologist (1901‚Äì1935) thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the PƒÅli texts and the Sanskrit traditions. Orientalist Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin (1869‚Äì1938) and Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt (1893‚Äì1973) thought it was historical, but in the form of a simple recitation of discipline (, ; according to Dutt, in order settle the \\"minor rules\\") not a complete council with a full review of the discourses. Indologist Richard Gombrich, following Bhikkhus Sujato and Brahmali's arguments, considers that the Council \\"makes good sense\\". They argue that the Council was historical, because all the known versions of monastic discipline relate it. Some of those, such as the TheravƒÅda discipline, do not include the recitation of the Abhidharma in their account, even though it was an important part of their identitythis shows the historical nature of the accounts. Indologist Erich Frauwallner (1898‚Äì1974) noted that in the earliest Buddhist discourses little mention is made of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, especially when compared to ƒÄnanda. However, in the accounts about the First Council, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa appears very prominent, whereas ƒÄnanda is humbled and given far less credit. Frauwallner argued this points at \\"a deep reaching modification and revaluation of the tradition\\" concerning the position of these two figures. On a similar note, Buddhist studies scholar Jonathan Silk remarks that the earliest Chinese translations hardly mention MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Ray argues there is a difference in this between PƒÅli texts and texts from other early schools: the PƒÅli version of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is a much more ordinary person, depicted with far less supernatural powers and moral authority than in texts such as those from the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda discipline and in the MahƒÅvastu. Although there are some PƒÅli texts that do emphasize forest renunciation, these are fragmented elements that stand in stark contrast with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's general role in the PƒÅli history of the monastic establishment. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa (left) and ƒÄnanda (right), China, alt=Two monks, one holding hands in front of chest, the other hands folded in front of belly Von Hin√ºber, Przyluski and Bareau have argued that the account of ƒÄnanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing early Buddhist schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the discourses and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition: e.g. the PƒÅli and Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka textual traditions portray a MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa that is more critical of ƒÄnanda than that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition depicts him, reflecting a preference for discipline on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter. Analyzing six recensions of different textual traditions of the MahƒÅparinibbƒÅna Sutta extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former, fifth century BCE, belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter, mostly fourth and third century BCE, to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of ƒÄnanda, the latter MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Buddhologist Andr√© Migot (1892‚Äì1967) argued, too, that the oldest texts (fifth century BCE) mostly glorify ƒÄnanda as being the most well-learned (, ); a second series of newer texts (fourth century-early third century BCE) glorify MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as being eminent in discipline (, ); and the newest texts (mid third century BCE) glorify ≈öƒÅriputra as being the wisest (, ). MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist I. B. Horner (1896‚Äì1981) therefore argued that the offenses ƒÄnanda were charged with were a later interpolation. Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the MahƒÅparinibbƒÅna Sutta and with ƒÄnanda's character as generally depicted in the texts. Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang (602‚Äì664) reported a st≈´pa (; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event, and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period. Expanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of ƒÄnanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas MahƒÅka≈õyapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. ƒÄnanda represents a \\"religion of love\\", whereas MahƒÅka≈õyapa represents \\"a rough ascetic spirit\\". Migot interpreted ƒÄnanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion. Although the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the sa·πÉgha during the first twenty years after the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa. After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples ≈öƒÅriputra and MaudgalyƒÅyana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order. In the Early Buddhist Texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's death is not discussed. This is discussed in post-canonical texts, however.  In post-canonical texts  = Patriarch = Thai statue of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, In many Indian Sanskrit and East Asian texts, from as early as the second century CE, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is considered the first patriarch of the lineage which transmitted the teaching of the Buddha, with ƒÄnanda being the second. One of the earliest motifs of a tradition of patriarchs is that of the Five Masters of the Dharma (), found in Sanskrit texts from the second century CE, including the A≈õokƒÅvadƒÅna and the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, and many archaeological findings. This tradition may in itself be based on early Buddhist accounts about the First Council, but further expanded on the idea of the preservation of the teachings. The accounts about the Five Masters seems to derive not so much from a concern about the transmission of the teaching though, but rather a concern regarding the absence of the Buddha himself. The texts gave the Masters of the Dharma each a similar role and charisma as the Buddha, or, as Buddhist studies scholar John S. Strong puts it, \\"all, in a sense, Buddhas in their own time\\". This fit in with the concept of inheritance in ancient India, in which a son would not only inherit his father's possessions, but also his position and identity. Several early Buddhist schools would expand on the idea of the Five Masters of the Dharma, including the SarvƒÅstivadins, the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdins and the SthƒÅviras, each of which extended the list to include their own masters as patriarchs. There is an account dating back from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda and M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda textual traditions which states that before MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa died, he bestowed the Buddha's teaching on ƒÄnanda as a formal passing on of authority, telling ƒÄnanda to pass the teaching on to his pupil ≈öƒÅ·πáakavƒÅsƒ´ (; ≈öƒÅ·πáakavƒÅsin or ≈öƒÅ·πáƒÅvasika). MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa made a prediction that later would come true that a lay person called ≈öƒÅ·πáakavƒÅsƒ´ would make many gifts to the sa·πÖgha during a feast. After this event, ƒÄnanda would successfully persuade him to become ordained and be his pupil. Later, just before ƒÄnanda died, he passed the teaching on to his pupil as MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa had told him to. Ray notes that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is depicted here as choosing not only his successor, but also the successor of his successor, which emphasizes the preeminent position that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was seen to have. Buddhist studies scholars Akira Hirakawa (1915‚Äì2002) and Bibhuti Baruah have expressed skepticism about the teacherstudent relationship between MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda. They have argued that there was discord between the two, as indicated in the early texts. Hirakawa has further hypothesized that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda were co-disciples, with the same teacher being Gautama Buddha, so there would be no need for a transmission between the two. East Asian religion scholar Elizabeth Morrison cites a tract by the Zen scholar Qisong (1007‚Äì1072) about the tradition of patriarchs in Buddhism. He noted the problem of a transmission between co-disciples who are not master and student. He resolved the problem by comparing MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda to siblings who inherit according to birth order. Responding to Hirakawa's arguments, Silk further argues that the unilinear nature of the transmission made it impossible for both MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda to receive the transmission from the Buddha, so ƒÄnanda had to receive the transmission from MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa instead. = Preserving the Buddha's relics = MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa holding a reliquary, sixth century, thumb The fifth-century commentary to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya relates that after the Buddha's paranirvƒÅ·πáa, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was concerned that the Buddha's remains or relics would become too dispersed, since they were now divided in eight portions. He gathered the portions of the Buddha's relics, by requesting them from the families who had preserved them, though he left a token amount of relics with the families. With the help of King AjƒÅta≈õatru, he then preserved them in an underground chamber called the \\"shrine for the eighty disciples\\" to the east of RƒÅjag·πõha. Because of the name, Southeast Asia scholar Fran√ßois Lagirarde raises the question whether this chamber may also have been intended for the burial of relics of foremost disciples, but Strong interprets that it was a ruse: the whole operation was done in secrecy because MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa feared for the safety of the Buddha's relics. Later, according to post-canonical Buddhist texts such as the TheravƒÅda Pa·π≠hamasambodhi, the remains thus enshrined in one place were taken out and divided by emperor A≈õoka (268‚Äì232 BCE) throughout India in 84,000 portions. Instead of the relics being hid away somewhere, they were now accessible to the population at large. The earliest accounts have MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa merely visit and pay his respects to each of the eight portions of the relics; later accounts have him gather the relics as well. There is a parallel here with the First Council, in which MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa gathered the entire body of the Buddha's teachings (; ) in one place, as he is depicted gathering the Buddha's remains (Sanskrit and ) in one place. Still, there may be a historical basis to the motif of the single place with the Buddha's relics. Przyluski and Bareau have argued on textual and other grounds that the Buddha's relics were originally kept in one single place, in a sepulcher (Przyluski) or a st≈´pa (Bareau). = Awaiting Maitreya =  Accounts  Post-canonical Sanskrit texts such as AvadƒÅnas, as well as the travelogues of medieval Chinese pilgrims, numerous Chinese translations, and Southeast Asian vernacular texts, relate MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's death. Some of the earliest of these are a Chinese translation from the fourth century CE and the A≈õokavadƒÅna, which is dated to the second century CE. They state that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's body was enshrined underneath the mountain Kukku·π≠apƒÅda ( GurupƒÅdaka, in Magadha) where it remains until the arising of the next Buddha, Maitreya (). Painting of an image with Maitreya and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa offering him Gautama Buddha's robe. alt=Painting with temple tower, a huge image on a cliff and two people looking at it. A Thai text relates that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa knew through his meditation that he was about to die and attain paranirvƒÅ·πáa on the next day. The day after, he informed his pupils of his death and taught them, then went for alms, wearing the robe he had received from the Buddha. In the texts on discipline from the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition, it says he also went to pay his respects to the Buddha's relics. In several texts, he attempted to visit King AjƒÅta≈õatru, but the king was asleep. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa then cleaned the monastery, and proceeded to Kukku·π≠apƒÅda, the place of burial he had selected. He gave a final teaching to the lay people, and performed supernatural accomplishments. Having settled in a cave there in the middle of three peaks, he covered himself in the robe he had received from the Buddha. The texts then state he took a vow that his body would stay there until the arriving of Maitreya Buddha, which is an uncountable number of years. His body would not decay in that time, but become visible and disintegrate in the time of Maitreya Buddha. Though MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa died after the vow, his body remained intact according to his resolution. The three mountain peaks then closed in on the body. Later, King AjƒÅta≈õatru heard about the news of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's passing, and fainted of grief. He wanted to visit MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa once more. ƒÄnanda and King AjƒÅta≈õatru went to the mountain, which slightly opened, just enough for the two to see MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's body. In the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda discipline and the A≈õokƒÅvadƒÅna, the king wanted to cremate the body, but ƒÄnanda told him it would remain until the time of Maitreya Buddha. When they left, the mountain closed up again. Later, emperor A≈õoka would also visit the mountain with the monk Upagupta, after the latter took him to see the st≈´pa of the Buddha's disciples. The accounts then continue that in the future, in the time of Maitreya Buddha, the mountain opens upon his visit, in \\"the way a cakravartin opens a city gate\\". However, people in Maitreya Buddha's time are much taller than during the time of Gautama Buddha. In one text, Maitreya Buddha's disciples are therefore contemptuous of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Gautama Buddha's robe barely covers two of their fingers, making them marvel how small Gautama Buddha was. Eventually, in several accounts, Maitreya Buddha takes MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's body in his hands, explains to his pupils what great person he was, and sees the body miraculously burn in his hands, according to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's vow. But in the well-known account of Xuanzang, as well as the Tocharian MaitreyasamitinƒÅ·π≠aka and other accounts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is alive and waiting in his \\"cavern of meditation\\", until the time of Maitreya: he hands over the robe to Maitreya Buddha explaining who it is from, and expresses his joy at having met two Buddhas. He then hovers in the air, displays supernatural accomplishments that are reminiscent of Gautama Buddha, and bursts miraculously into flames. In the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda discipline and the A≈õokƒÅvadƒÅna, the account ends with Maitreya Buddha's disciples attaining arhat, as the encounter has caused their pride to be humbled.  Cults and practices  Image of Maitreya, Tibet, 10th century. identifies the image at the right with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. The Kukku·π≠apƒÅda Mountain was identified by traditional authors with several places in North India, and some of these places had become famous place of pilgrimage and cult by the time the Chinese pilgrim Faxian (337‚Äì422 CE) and later Xuanzang visited. These pilgrimage places, featuring depictions of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, have been connected by Buddhist studies scholar Vincent Tournier with an aspiration to be born in Maitreya's following. In sixth-century Chinese steles, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is often depicted waiting for Maitreya Buddha in the cave, cloaked in the robe and a hood. He is given a role as successor of the Gautama Buddha. Buddhist studies scholar Miyaji Akira proposes that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa waiting in the cave became the basis of a theme in Korean Buddhist art featuring monks meditating in caves. Korean studies scholar Sunkyung Kim does point out, however, that similar motifs can already be found in earlier Buddhist art, showing Buddha Gautama sitting. The story of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa awaiting Maitreya Buddha had an important impact in Japan, up until early modern times. Jikigy≈ç (1671‚Äì1724), the leader of a chiliastic religious movement, locked himself in his monastic cell to starve to death, and have his mummified corpse meet with Maitreya Buddha in the future. With regard to South- and Southeast Asia, the interest in the relationship between Maitreya and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa spread to Ceylon during the reign of Kassapa II (652‚Äì661) and Kassapa V (929‚Äì939). They most likely honored MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa for his role in the Abhidharma recitations at the First Council. Kassapa V identified with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa () and aspired to be reborn with Maitreya as well. Presently, the account of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's parinirvƒÅ·πáa is not widely recognized in dominant Buddhist traditions in Thailand, but Lagirarde raises the question whether this is only a recent development. It is still a common belief among the Thai that the body of a very pure and venerated monk will not decompose.  Scholarly analysis  MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, woodblock print by alt=Abstract woodblock print in black ink with monk, holding his arms crossed in front of his chest In the early texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is depicted as the keeper of the Buddhist teaching during the First Council; in the story of him awaiting Maitreya Buddha this role is extended. In some early Chinese texts, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is seen stating to ƒÄnanda that all devotees present at the parinirvƒÅ·πáa of the Buddha Gautama will be reborn in Tusita heaven and meet Maitreya; in the story of the cave this association with Maitreya is further extended. Since the end of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's life after the First Council was not discussed in the early texts, it was easy for legends to be developed around his demise, or the postponement thereof. Tournier speculates that the story of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa resolving that his body endure until the next Buddha is a \\"conscious attempt to dress the arhat in a bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) garb\\". On a similar note, Strong argues the story shows sentiments that are at the root of the bodhisattva ideal, and may have led to the idea of the Eighteen Arhats () that \\"postpone\\" their death to protect the Buddhist teaching till the arrival of Maitreya. Indologist Padmanabh Jaini argues that the story was created by the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdins to connect Maitreya Buddha to Gautama Buddha, through a line of transmission. In this, they may have been influenced by the Indo-Greeks and Persians, who ruled the area where the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdins lived. Historian Max Deeg raises the question, however, that if Jaini is correct, why no traces of an early development of the legend can be found. Silk also hypothesizes that the story was developed by MahƒÅyƒÅna authors to create a narrative to connect the two Buddhas physically through MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's paranirvƒÅ·πáa and the passing on of the robe. Lagirarde notes, however, that not all ƒÄgama sources insist on connecting the two Buddhas. Furthermore, PƒÅli, Thai and Laotian sources do not mention the passing on of the robe, yet the meeting is still narrated as significant. Silk also notes that the Sanskrit texts the Abhini·π£krama·πáa S≈´tra, the MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramit≈çpade≈õa and the DivyƒÅvadƒÅna contain the story of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa under the mountain, and do not mention the robe of the Buddha at all. But in every version of the account there is a physical connection between Gautama Buddha, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and Maitreya Buddha. He concludes that MahƒÅyƒÅna authors used MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as a way to legitimize the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings, by affirming that there were more authentic teachings which had not yet come. Translator Saddhatissa, and with him Silk, argue that there is no equivalent account about MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa waiting in the cave that can be found in the PƒÅli tradition apart from a single reference in a post-canonical text. But Lagirarde points out that the reference found by Saddhatissa and Silk (called the MahƒÅsampi·πá·∏çanidƒÅna, which Saddhatissa dates to the twelfth century) does indicate the story was known in the PƒÅli tradition. Lagirarde also lists several later vernacular texts from TheravƒÅda countries that mention the account, in the Siamese, Northern Thai and Laotian languages. Indeed, Silk himself points at a PƒÅli sub-commentary to the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya which mentions that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa retreated at age hundred twenty in a cave close to where the First Council was held. He would dwell there and \\"make the Buddha's teaching last for 5000 years\\". The First Council itself was held in a cave too, and it may have led to the motif of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa waiting in a cave. Furthermore, in some canonical PƒÅli texts MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa talks about the decay and disappearance of the Buddhist dispensation, which may also have been a foundation for the story. = In MahƒÅyƒÅna discourses = In general, Sanskrit texts often mention MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. Silk argues that MahƒÅyƒÅna polemicists used MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as an interlocutor in their discourses, because of his stern conservative stance in the early texts and opposition of innovation, and his close association with Gautama Buddha. This fit with the conservative ideas on Buddhist practice among the early MahƒÅyƒÅna authors, and the need to legitimize MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrine, surrounding them with an aura of authenticity.  In Chan Buddhism  MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa smiling at the lotus flower, by upright=1.2 MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa has a significant role in texts from the Chan tradition. In East Asia, there is a Chan and Zen tradition, first recounted in The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp (), which is a 1036 genealogical record about Chan Buddhism. According to this tradition, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa once received a direct \\"transmission\\" from Gautama Buddha. Chan and Zen purport to lead their adherents to insights akin to that mentioned by the Buddha in the Flower Sermon () given on the Vulture Peak, in which he held up a white flower and just admired it in his hand, without speaking. All the disciples just looked on without knowing how to react, but only MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa smiled faintly, and the Buddha picked him as one who truly understood him and was worthy to be the one receiving a special \\"mind-to-mind transmission\\" (). Thus, a way within Buddhism developed which concentrated on direct experience rather than on rational creeds or revealed scriptures. Chan therefore became a method of meditative religion which seek to enlighten people in the manner that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa experienced: \\"A special transmission outside the scriptures, directly pointing at the heart of man, looking into one's own nature.\\" This transmission was then purportedly passed on by the Buddha to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, who then passed it on to a long list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs, eventually reaching Bodhidharma (5th or 6th century CE), who brought Chan Buddhism to China, and passed it on to Huike (487‚Äì593 CE). The Jingde Record took the passing on of the robe from Buddha Gautama to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa to refer to a secret transmission of Chan teachings, within the specific Chan lineage.alt=Monk meditating and holding a flowerThe story of the Flower Sermon was also recorded in later texts, between the 11th and 14th centuries. At least one of these texts was probably written to defend the authenticity of the Flower Sermon, which was even questioned in Chan circles. Eventually, the story became well known among both Buddhist monks and Chan-oriented literati. It was incorporated as a meditative topic in the 1228 Chan text The Gateless Barrier (), in which the Buddha confirmed that the mind-to-mind transmission was complete. Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \\"outside the teaching\\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture. The Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism. Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition. Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch ƒÄnanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs. Some Chan masters, such as D≈çgen (1200‚Äì1253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and eventually Maitreya. As Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation. Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.  Legacy  = Values = MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa depicted with hair and beard. Mural painting, alt=Bearded man with stern face, long earlobes and one shoulder uncovered Being one of the most well-known disciples of the Buddha, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa embodies the highest ideals of early Buddhist monasticism. Buddhist studies scholar Asanga Tilakaratne points out that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's ascetic and austere values and dislike for women on the one hand, and ƒÄnanda's active, city-dwelling values and support for women on the other hand, are two sides of the spectrum than can be seen throughout the history of Buddhist monasticism. Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum, with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand. This can be traced back to these two disciples. Specifically, the TheravƒÅda tradition has been influenced much by the model of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa. In some early TheravƒÅda texts about MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism. Renunciation in the forest is considered superior, and settled monasticism is considered a deterioration of the holy life. Przyluski and several other scholars have argued that in the early texts, MahƒÅka≈õyapa represents ascetic and brahmin values. The ascetic values are seen in the account in which MahƒÅka≈õyapa refuses to give up ascetic practices, going against the advice of the Buddha. Such refusal was highly unusual for a disciple of the Buddha. The brahmin values can be observed from the account of the accusations leveled against ƒÄnanda, which appear to be based more on brahmin values than violations of monastic discipline. Both these brahmin and ascetic values, as represented by the figure of MahƒÅka≈õyapa, would lead to strong opposition to the founding of the bhik·π£unƒ´ order in early Buddhism. The ascetic values MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa represented, however, were a reaction to less austere tendencies that appeared in early Buddhism at the time. Ray concludes that the texts present MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa in different ways. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa assumes many roles and identities in the texts, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \\"guarantor of future justice\\" in the time of Maitreya. Indologist C.A.F. Rhys Davids (1857‚Äì1942) stated he was \\"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\\". His figure unites the opposites of established monasticism and forest renunciation, and \\"transcends any particular Buddhist group or set of interests\\". Drawing from Przyluski's textual criticism, Ray argues that when MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa replaced Kau·πá·∏çinya as the head of the sa·πÉgha after the Buddha's passing away, his ascetic saint-like role was appropriated into the monastic establishment to serve the need for a charismatic leader. This led him to possess both the character of the anti- establishment ascetic, as well as that of the settled monastic governor. = Eldest son of the Buddha = Funeral pyre of the Buddha being lit at the arrival of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, from Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism, alt=Illustration in book, 3 monks sitting at fire In Abhidharma texts of several Buddhist schools, the fulfilment of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's vow in the mountain Kuku·π≠apada is connected to a vow Gautama Buddha took to prevent his body from being cremated before MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's arrival at his teacher's cremation grounds. Buddhist studies scholar Gregory Schopen analyzes several post- canonical Buddhist texts and concludes that in both instances, a vow is taken based on psychic powers, which is then shown to be effective after the death of the person with those psychic powers. MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's psychic powers are needed for his role in the texts as the one who preserves the Buddha's dispensation. Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council. Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers. This conceptualization is found within several Buddhist schools, including the TheravƒÅdins and the MahƒÅsa·πÖghikas. Indeed, TheravƒÅda sees him as a sort of \\"Father of the Church\\". = Historical lineages = Furthermore, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is described in the PƒÅli commentary to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya as the person responsible for the preservation of collection that was the precursor to the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya and the Sa·πÉyuktaka ƒÄgama. In both the NikƒÅya and ƒÄgama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the SthƒÅviras, also conceived themselves as preservers of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's legacy. This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk MahƒÅnƒÅman (5th‚Äì6th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect MahƒÅnƒÅman's lineage with that of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya. However, some PƒÅli sources indicate that MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa was part of the lineage of the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya reciters instead. One of the early Buddhist schools, the KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´yas (), was founded by MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, according to scholars ParamƒÅrtha (499‚Äì569) and Kuiji (632‚Äì682). Other traditional scholars have argued instead it was another KƒÅ≈õyapa, who lived three centuries after the Buddha. When the differences between the early Buddhist schools grew more prominent, the MahƒÅsa·πÖghikas affiliated themselves with the figure of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, and claimed him as their founder and patron-saint. They presented themselves as more orthodox than other schools, such as TheravƒÅda. = In art and culture = In MahƒÅyƒÅna iconography, ƒÄnanda is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the right side, together with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa at the left. in Shantou, China. In Buddhist art, depictions of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa have \\"left an indelible mark\\". He was depicted in paranirvƒÅ·πáa scenes as a reassurance that Gautama Buddha's dispensation would not be lost; he was depicted next to Maitreya Buddha as an anticipatory vision of the future. The scene in which he paid his final respects to the Buddha became a well-known depiction in Buddhist art, and Strong has argued that it may have led to the cult of the Buddha's footprints. In Chinese art, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is usually depicted with long beard and hair. Buddhist studies scholar Mun-Keat Choong hypothesizes that these depictions found their way back in at least one Chinese Buddhist discourse, the discourse in which MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is criticized for looking inappropriate. This may have been the work of the translators. In MahƒÅyƒÅna iconography, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with ƒÄnanda at the right. The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of Greco-Buddhism, and Migot argued that the tradition of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and ƒÄnanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of ≈öƒÅriputra and MaudgalyƒÅyana, because in the MahƒÅparinibbƒÅna Sutta only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that ≈öƒÅriputra and MaudgalyƒÅyana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing. In Chan temples, the image of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition. In the history of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the MahƒÅyƒÅna creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism. The Buddha's disciples and founders of East Asian Buddhism were often depicted in them. When fukudenkai sewing groups were founded in Japan in the early twentieth century, to introduce sewing robes for monastics as a spiritual practice, they often referred to the early Buddhist account of MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa receiving the rag-robes from the Buddha. Fukudenkai practitioners usually use second-hand clothes to sew the rag-robes, just like in the time of the Buddha.

He entered St John's College, Cambridge, but left the university in 1833. He entered at the Middle Temple, 7 November 1835, and was called to the bar on 19 November 1841. Poetry Domett published one or two volumes of poetry from 1833, and contributed several poems to Blackwood's Magazine, one of which, A Christmas Hymn, attracted attention. He was called to the bar, but for ten years he lived a life of ease in London, where he became the intimate friend of Robert Browning, of whose poem Waring he was the subject. 'How much I loved him, I find out now I've lost him'. In the poem Browning asks what has become of his friend, but is sure he will gain some fame in far-off lands: ...so I saw the last Of Waring! ... Oh, never star Was lost here but it rose afar! An account of the friendship between the two men appeared in The Contemporary Review for January 1905, by W. H. Griffin.

He continued to write poetry all his life, in the style of rhyming panegyrics such as An Invitation, with its allusions to the sub-tropical flora and threatened inhabitants of countries such as New Zealand: And if weary of mists you will roam undisdaining To a land where the fanciful fountains are raining Swift brilliants of boiling and beautiful spray In the violet splendour of skies that illume Such a wealth of green ferns and rare crimson tree-bloom; Where a people primeval is vanishing fast, With its faiths and its fables and ways of the past: O with reason and fancy unfettered and fearless, Come plunge with us deep into regions of Day‚ÄîCome away‚Äîand away! -- Decadent poet Ernest Dowson was his great-nephew. New Zealand politics In 1842 Domett emigrated to New Zealand, where he filled many important administrative posts, being Colonial Secretary for New Munster Province in 1848, secretary for the colony in 1851, and the fourth Premier of New Zealand from 1862 to 1863. He represented the electorate of Nelson, first as the Town of Nelson 1855‚Äì1860 and then City of Nelson 1860‚Äì1866 (retired). Unusually, as electorates at this time returned multiple members, Domett shared representation of Nelson with Edward Stafford, who had also served as Premier. The most noteworthy change Domett brought about during his tenure in office was the moving of New Zealand's capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865. In November 1863 he moved a resolution before Parliament that \\"it has become necessary that the seat of government... should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait.\\"Phillip Temple: Wellington Yesterday He returned to England in 1871 and became a CMG in 1880.

He was with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ross, in Palestine during the Arab revolt. Among Lloyd Owen's fellow officers in the battalion was Michael Forrester, another future major general. He later served in the Western Desert from 1939 to July 1941, during World War II, when he joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). World War II He took part in a number of operations, including the SAS raid on Tobruk in August/September 1942, which earned him the Military Cross. He was wounded in an air raid on the LRDG base at Kufra in October 1942 and nearly lost an arm. He rejoined the LRDG in February 1943, when they underwent training in Lebanon before being sent to the Aegean. He took command of the LRDG at the end of 1943 after the death of his predecessor Jake Easonsmith during the Battle of Leros. He based himself at Bari in southern Italy from which he mounted a successful raid on Corfu and staged operations in the Dalmatian islands and Yugoslavia. In September 1944, he was parachuted into Albania at night. Shortly after landing he fell 30 ft into a ravine and severely damaged his spine.Daily Telegraph \\"Obituary of Michael Parsons\\", 1 November 2010. Retrieved 6 November 2010. Despite being in continual pain, Lloyd Owen directed special forces operations in the mountains for the next three months. Eventually he was evacuated to Italy, was successfully operated on, and told not to return to his former activities. He managed to bluff his way past a medical board and returned to Albania, although this time by boat. The LRDG was eventually disbanded in June 1945. For his leadership in the Balkans, Lloyd Owen was awarded the Distinguished Service Order that year. Post-War After the war, he had various appointments in Britain, including a period on the staff at Sandhurst. In 1952, he was appointed Military Assistant to the High Commissioner in Malaya. He then commanded the 1st Battalion of the Queen's Royal Regiment from 1957 to 1959. In the early 1960s he led 24 Infantry Brigade Group in Kenya and was then, from 1966 to 1968, GOC, Cyprus District. From 1968 to 1969 he was GOC, Near East Land Forces and, from 1969 to 1972, president of the Regular Commissions Board. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1954 and Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1971. He wrote two books about his experiences ‚Äì The Desert My Dwelling Place published by Cassell in 1957 and again by Panther Books the following year, and more recently Long Range Desert Group 1940‚Äì1945: Providence Their Guide, republished by Leo Cooper/Pen & Sword Books in 2001. Personal life He married his wife Ursula Barclay (known as Ursie) and had three sons; Michael, Piers and Christopher.

Description  The New Zealand grebe has dark brown plumage, a small black head with fine silver feathers, a black pointed bill and characteristic yellow eyes. It grows to about 29 cm, and weigh about 250 g. Non-breeding individuals have a paler plumage and females tend to be a bit lighter, smaller and have a slightly shorter bill than males. Adult photographed at Western Springs in Auckland  Distribution and habitat  This grebe species inhabits mainly shallow freshwater lakes, ponds and sheltered inlets. Currently it is found mainly in the North Island, where it is well distributed on the coastal lakes of the West coast from North Cape to Pukekohe and from Southern Taranaki to Paraparaumu, as well as on ponds of the Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne, Hawkes bay and the Wairarapa. Formerly this species was also present in the lowland lakes of the South Island,Andrew Crowe, \\"Which New Zealand Bird?\\", Penguin, 2001 but underwent a rapid decline, for unknown reasons, in the 19th century - the last regular breeding record in the South Island was in 1941.Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, \\"The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand (revised edition)\\", Viking, 2005 In 2012 a pair bred near Takaka for the first time in recent history.  Behaviour  These freshwater diving birds usually fly only at night, whilst during the day, they are always found in the water, swimming on the surface and frequently diving to feed. Thus, if they are in danger or get disturbed at daytime they do not flee by flying, but swimming or diving away. During autumn and winter, they are found forming flocks, while during the breeding season they are mostly seen in monogamous pairs. They show aggressive territorial behaviour towards intruders and the otherwise silent species give short calls throughout the breeding season and when in danger.  Diet  Their diet consists mostly of aquatic insects and their larvae, as well as small molluscs such as freshwater snails. Bigger prey such as fish and freshwater crayfish are sometimes eaten too. Thus, their bill, being short and pointed, is adapted to their mainly invertebrate diet. They catch their prey during dives and feeding underwater or pick it from the water surface.  Breeding  The breeding season is from June to March. On average 2-3 eggs are laid and incubated 22‚Äì23 days by both female and male, in a nest. The nest is mostly made out of surrounding vegetation, including floating plant material. Hatched chicks are precocial, although being flightless for the first few weeks they can swim and dive. Both parents assist in rearing and feeding their young for up to 70 days after hatching. Until the adult plumage develops, the chick has irregular striped markings on head and neck and the bill is black.  Conservation  This species is endemic to New Zealand and is nowadays only found in the North Island. In 1994, the IUCN classified the New Zealand grebe as Endangered, but due to conservation actions including habitat management, its population has recently increased to around 1,900-2,000 birds and was reclassified as Near Threatened in 2016. Human activity currently has a net benefit as artificial habitat, including farm dams and ponds formed for stock water supplies, increases the area of occupation for the grebes. So, although the population is still quite small it is thought not to be in decline anymore.

Early life Berra grew up in both Nebraska and Missouri and he explained in 2007 that his family was poor: \\"I was considered poor when I was growing up. I didn't have a phone.\\" Berra was bullied at school for skateboarding and struggled as a student, with Berra stating that he \\"was the kid who everybody assumed was a complete lost cause.\\" It was at the age of 14 years that the isolated Berra, who had a small number of friends at the time, decided that a professional skateboarding career was his aspiration. Skateboarding career In pursuit of his skateboarding career, Berra relocated to southern California, US when he was 18 years old and lived with skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Hawk provided guidance to Berra regarding the skateboarding industry and advised,\\"You have to look at skating as fun. But it's not a career,\\" due to the subculture's marginal status at the time. Berra's first sponsor was Blockhead, which led to his experience with the \\"Blockhead House\\", where he met fellow skateboarder Jason Dill. He then moved onto the 101 skateboard brand, owned by Natas Kaupas, and he has since stated that \\"I didn't have a good time on 101\\". Before Kaupas could assign Berra the status of a \\"professional\\" team rider, Berra quit 101 and joined Tony Hawk's Birdhouse company. While with Birdhouse, the 23-year-old Hawk was a mentor figure to Berra, leading to Berra's initial forays into acting. In 1992, Berra left Birdhouse and since admitted that his departure was due to being \\"young, misunderstood, and silly.\\" Several months later, Berra joined the Foundation team, skating in the company's 1993 video, Super Conductor Super Collider. In 1998 Berra returned to Birdhouse to create the skateboarding video The End. In one of the notable scenes in the movie, Berra's death is simulated in a decapitation scene (filmed with the aid of a dummy). Shortly after the release of The End Berra once again left Birdhouse and joined Alien Workshop, alongside Dill and professionals such as Josh Kalis and Rob Dyrdek. In 2003 Berra struggled with severe ankle pain that prevented him from skating for most of the year and he underwent reconstructive surgery in January 2004. Footage of Berra entering ankle surgery is featured in the DVS Shoes (formerly DVS Shoe Co.) video, Skate More, a production that he managed to film a full part for. Berra has been featured in MTV shows Rob & Big and Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory. Season 2, Episode 6 of Rob & Big revolves around the Tampa Pro professional skateboarding contest, whereby Berra and Dyrdek engage in a US$5,000 bet to \\"up the ante\\" of the competition. In Season 2, Episode 8 of Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory, entitled \\"The Berrics vs. Fantasy Factory\\", Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory skate park crew competes against The Berrics crew. As of 2013, Berra regularly appears on the website venture The Berrics that is co-owned with professional skateboarder Eric Koston. As of March 2013, Berra is no longer a member of the Alien Workshop team and his sponsors are DC Shoes, Grizzly Griptape, Skullcandy, and The Berrics. The Berrics The Berrics concept was primarily conceived by Berra, who enlisted close friend, Koston, to invest in the premises that contains the training facility. Located in Los Angeles, U.S., the facility's name is an amalgamation of the pair's individual names: Berra + Eric = Berrics. In 2009, skateboarding journalist, Chris Nieratko, gained entrance to the skate park and its cardinal rule: \\"You have to film while you're skating The Berrics.\\" The footage is later posted on The Berrics website, TheBerrics.com. TheBerrics.com grew to become one of skateboarding's most popular websites in only several months: \\"In January, the site had more unique visitors than sites for all of the major skateboarding magazines, and ESPN.com's action sports page, according to comScore, a market research firm.\\" The website features a range of weekly, regular, and special features, including \\"Weekendtage\\", \\"Bangin'\\", \\"Battle at the Berrics\\", \\"Field Ops\\", and \\"Off the Grid\\". Berra has also used the website to feature colleagues and friends from the fields of film, advertising, and music. Perspectives on skateboarding Berra is well known for his public opinions on skateboarding, and in a February 2013 interview with Jenkem magazine he explained his view on the status of the skateboarding industry at the commencement of the second decade of the 21st century: > The economy is a huge challenge. There is only so much money in our industry > and it is a very, very, very small industry. Skateboarding may mean > everything to you and I and whoever is reading this but we are a small > industry with a few examples of companies that have breached into the \\"real\\" > world and sometimes give us the impression that we are bigger than what we > are. There is a vast difference between the sales of Element and the sales > of Expedition. The Berrics obstacles have been trying to get people to > understand that things have changed, the world has changed, the skater and > the consumer have changed. So‚Ä¶ it was either we start it, Eric and I, or > Google does. Berra also explained the manner in which the industry is often misperceived and how the economic conditions in the U.S.‚Äîat the time of the Jenkem interview‚Äîhave affected the culture of skateboarding: > We're all squirrels fighting for the same nuts in the worst economy in 100 > years and everyone has it tough right now. I don't think people outside the > industry understand that. I think a lot of these people who criticize the > industry definitely don't understand that. They see these pillars of the > skateboarding world and they equate them to the pillars of other worlds that > are much bigger than ours not knowing that some are one bad month from > closing their doors. Skateboarding companies are skin and bones operations. > Popularity does not mean wealth in this industry. Directing In the winter of 2006, Berra began his role as director of The Good Life, a film that he also wrote the screenplay for. Starring Mark Webber, Zooey Deschanel, Bill Paxton, Harry Dean Stanton, Chris Klein, Patrick Fugit, Drea de Matteo and Donal Logue, The Good Life was described by Berra in the following manner: \\"... it had been my \\"other woman\\" for many years, but because of my commitments as a professional skateboarder I couldn't pursue it 100%.\\" The film, described as \\"a coming-of-age tale set in Lincoln, Nebraska, portrayed as a grim town of vacant lots, shuttered buildings, sidewalk drug dealers and deep poverty, all accented by overcast skies\\", premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and garnered a positive reception. Following the commencement of a new chapter of the Berrics project in early 2013, whereby a new premises was officially opened and the website was reconstructed, Berra has collaborated with professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez on numerous projects, such as the Network A series \\"LIFE\\" and a Mountain Dew commercial entitled \\"Progression\\". Acting Berra has maintained an interest in acting since the age of 18. He was a series regular on the short-lived Fox drama 413 Hope St., portraying Quentin Jefferson, a young man infected with HIV. Berra has also held brief roles in the television shows Felicity and Nash Bridges, as well as a minor role in the 1999 film Anywhere but Here. Since the age of 18, Berra has juggled his interests in skateboarding and acting, although he maintains that skateboarding has always been his primary passion. Personal life Prior to the launch of the Berrics website, Berra explained the impact of Scientology upon his life: > Well, it's just helped me as an individual. I understand life much better > and when you understand life, you have an easier time understanding other > aspects of it, skateboarding included. I don't claim to be perfect, far from > it in fact, but I at least have the self awareness to know that and see upon > where I can improve, see where I've been the architect of my doom. > Scientology has enabled me to really look at who I am, what I am doing and > put myself in check if it I get too crazed. The best way I can further help > people understand it is by telling them to actually go and buy a book. It's > what I did. As of August 15, 2013, Berra has not been filmed with his two children on the Berrics, or any other media, but he responded to a fatherhood question in 2009 in the following manner: > It's tough [being a father] sometimes because you go through a lot of > heartbreak as a kid and then when you think you've grown out of it, you have > a child of your own and you go through it all over again. You also have > expectations that are sometimes unrealistic, you have heartache with them > not liking you, you have heartache as a result of their heartache, but on > the flipside you have this indescribable joy and connection with another > person that you just don't have with anyone else and you have a real sense > of achievement and pride when they turn out to be an extraordinary > individual. Steve Berra claims to have never drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes or taken other recreational drugs.

Overview  He was born at Greenwich Hospital. His father, who was Civil Commissioner of the Hospital, was Edward Hawke Locker, youngest son of the Captain William Locker who gave Nelson the memorable advice \\"to lay a Frenchman close, and beat him.\\" His mother, Eleanor Mary Elizabeth Boucher, was a daughter of the Revd. Jonathan Boucher, vicar of Epsom and friend of George Washington. After a desultory education, Frederick Locker began life in a colonial broker's office. Soon he obtained a clerkship in Somerset House, whence he was transferred to Lord Haddington's private office at the Admiralty. Here he became deputy-reader and precis writer. In 1850 he married Lady Charlotte Bruce, daughter of the Lord Elgin who brought the famous marbles to England, and sister of Lady Augusta Stanley. After his marriage he left the Civil Service, in consequence of ill-health. In 1857 he published London Lyrics, a slender volume of 90 pages, which, with subsequent extensions, constitutes his poetical legacy. Lyra Elegantiarum (1867), an anthology of light and familiar verse, and Patchwork (1879), a book of extracts, were his only other publications in his lifetime. In 1872 Lady Charlotte Locker died. Two years later Locker married Miss Hannah Jane Lampson, the only daughter of Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson, Bart., of Rowfant House, Sussex, and in 1885 he added his wife's surname to his own to form a new family surname, Locker-Lampson. He died at Rowfant on 30 May 1895 and is buried in Worth churchyard near Crawley, Sussex. He had five children: Eleanor by his first wife, and Godfrey, Dorothy, Oliver and Maud by his second. Eleanor married first Lionel Tennyson, younger son of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, and after his death married the writer and Liberal politician Augustine Birrell.  Literary and bibliophilic legacy  Chronic ill-health debarred Locker from any active part in life, but it did not prevent his delighting a wide circle of friends by his gifts as a host and raconteur, and from accumulating many treasures as a connoisseur. He was acquainted with practically all the major literary figures of the age, including Matthew Arnold, the Brownings, Carlyle, Dickens, George Eliot, Leigh Hunt, Ruskin, Tennyson, Thackeray and Trollope. He was also a mentor to the illustrator artists Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway. He was a noted bibliophile and one of the foremost exponents of the \\"Cabinet\\" style of book collecting. He catalogued his own collection of rare books, first editions, prints and manuscripts in a volume named after his family home in Sussex, the Rowfant Library (1886). An Appendix compiled by his elder son, Godfrey, was published in 1900. The Rowfant Club, a Cleveland-based society of book collectors, is named after his home. As a poet, Locker belongs to the choir who deal with the gay rather than the grave in verse, with the polished and witty rather than the lofty or emotional. His good taste kept him as far from the broadly comic on the one side as his kind heart saved him from the purely cynical on the other. To something of Prior, of Praed and of Hood he added qualities of his own which lent his work distinction in no wise diminished by his unwearied endeavour after directness and simplicity.  Biographies  A posthumous volume of his memoirs, entitled My Confidences, appeared in 1896.My confidences. An autobiographical sketch addressed to my descendants. Edited by Augustine Birrell. 2nd edition. Publisher: Smith, Elder, & Co. London, Year 1896 In The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) William James wrote of the 'amiable' personality shown in this book: \\"This is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and graceful state of mind. For myself, I should have no objection to calling it on the whole a religious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may seem too listless and half-hearted to merit so good a name.\\" Frederick Locker-Lampson: A Character Sketch, which includes a selection of his letters, was composed and edited by his son-in-law, Augustine Birrell in 1920. This gives an interesting idea of his personality and literary connections as well as notes on his book collection.

Popski's Private Army was one of several raiding units formed in the Western Desert during the Second World War. The squadron also served in Italy, and was disbanded in September 1945. No. 1 Demolition Squadron was formed specifically to attack Field-Marshal Rommel's fuel supplies, in support of General Montgomery‚Äôs offensive at El Alamein,Peniakoff, 1950. p. 204. at the suggestion of Lieutenant-Colonel John Hackett. The unit became operational on 10 December 1942 as an 8th Army Special Forces unit. After the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and the Special Air Service (SAS), PPA was the last and smallest of the three main irregular raiding, reconnaissance and intelligence units formed during the North African Campaign. Actor Christopher Lee stated he was attached as liaison officer to this unit during the Second World War.\\"Christopher Lee talks Special Forces and receives an incredible gift\\"  Background  When the Second World War broke out, the 42-year-old Peniakoff applied to serve in the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy, but was rejected. He was accepted by the British Army, and assigned to garrison duties as an Arabic-speaking junior officer in the Libyan Arab Force (LAF). Not satisfied, Popski left his post and formed the Libyan Arab Force Commando (LAFC), a small group of British and Libyan soldiers who operated behind the lines in the Jebel Akhdar area of Cyrenaica.Peniakoff, 1950. p. 46. On his return to Cairo in the middle of 1942, Peniakoff was invited to join a Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) raid in the area he had just left. In doing so, he learned much about their procedures, but also lost his left little finger to an Italian bullet. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his previous intelligence reporting and petrol dump raiding while leading the LAFC for three months behind enemy lines, and for the operation with the LRDG. While he was away, the LAFC was disbanded. He was given the nickname Popski, from a Daily Mirror cartoon character,Peniakoff, 1950. p. 94. by Captain Bill Kennedy Shaw (the LRDG's Intelligence Officer) because his signallers had problems with \\"Peniakoff\\". Formation, and initial actions Shortly after this No. 1 Demolition Squadron was formed, the smallest independent unit of the British Army at 23 men all-ranks. The original officers of the unit were three friends who had served together in the Libyan Arab Force: Popski, Robert Park Yunnie and Jean Caneri. Vladimir Peniakoff with his jeep during the raid on Barce. Lieutenant Colonel John Hackett, who co-ordinated British raiding operations, asked Peniakoff to give the new unit a cover name, but vacillated. The unit's name ultimately came from Hackett's exasperation at Popski's delay: \\"You had better find a name quick or we shall call you Popski's Private Army\\"‚Äî\\"I'll take it\\". PPA was unusual in that all officer recruits reverted to lieutenant on joining, and other ranks reverted to private. The unit was run quite informally: there was no saluting and no drill, officers and men messed together, every man was expected to know what to do and get on with it, and there was only one punishment for failure of any kind: to be immediately returned to unit. It was also efficient, having an unusually small headquarters. Events proceeded rapidly; the Germans and Italians were expelled from Egypt and Libya shortly after PPA became active. A joint LRDG-PPA patrol discovered the gap in the mountains that let Bernard Montgomery launch an outflanking move around Erwin Rommel's defense at the Mareth Line. The PPA was also among the first elements of Eighth Army (moving west) to linkup with the British First Army and American II Corps (advancing east) in Tunisia in early 1943. Many PPA raiding and reconnaissance operations were carried out around the time of the Battle of Kasserine Pass, including taking the surrender of 600 Italians. The summer of 1943 was spent in Algeria and Tunisia recruiting and training new volunteers from the LRDG, SAS, Commandos and Royal Armoured Corps for the fight in Italy, bringing the unit's size up to about 35 all ranks, with two fighting patrols and a small HQ. For a short while PPA experimented with using 1st Airborne Division's gliders to deliver them and their jeeps behind the Axis lines in Sicily, but their part in that operation was cancelled at the last minute. Italy In September 1943 an advance patrol of PPA sailed to Taranto on board the and headed inland, where they discovered the hitherto unknown weakness of the German 1st Parachute Division opposing 1st Airborne. As a result of this success Popski was allowed to increase the size of PPA to 80 all ranks; throughout the Italian Campaign about 100 men were actually deployed at any one time. Three fighting patrols, each of 18 men in six jeeps, and one Tactical HQ patrol of four jeeps were formed and given great autonomy. Each jeep was armed with .50in and .30in machine guns, giving the patrols immense firepower for their size. The men trained hard for amphibious, mountain and parachute operations, demolition and counter-demolition, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. They were deployed in many roles, often clandestine, and for several months even operated as regular front line troops, holding a sector of the Allied front line, badly depleted after the withdrawal of forces for the D-Day landings in Normandy, nipping around in their jeeps to fool the Germans into believing that they were opposed by much larger units. Several operations used DUKWs or small landing craft called RCLs (manned by 7 Royal Engineers who became known as \\"Popski‚Äôs Private Navy\\") to sail up the Adriatic and get behind the German front line, escorted by the Royal Navy‚Äôs Coastal Forces. Throughout the bitter winter weather and fighting of 1944 and 1945 PPA undertook their operations ahead of regular forces, in support of British, Canadian, Indian and Polish armoured, infantry and commando units. They located targets for the Allied Air Force, chased Germans out of rear-areas, saved bridges, captured many prisoners and guns, and accepted the surrender of the entire German garrison at Chioggia. At various times PPA worked alongside other secret units such as the LRDG, SAS, No. 1 Special Force (SOE), Phantom, ‚ÄòA‚Äô Force and Office of Strategic Services. Along the way they adopted many strays, including Russian, Italian and German POWs, Italian regulars and partisans, both royalist and communist. Popski was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1944, during joint operations (such as ‚ÄúPorterforce‚Äù) with the 27th Lancers and Italian partisans of the 28th Garibaldi Brigade, to liberate Ravenna. Shortly afterwards he lost his left hand to a German rifle-grenade. At the end of the war Popski‚Äôs Private Army sailed some of their jeeps on RCLs to Venice, where they drove around St. Mark's Square, the only wheeled vehicles ever to have been there. The unit was disbanded four months later on 14 September 1945, after hunting for Himmler, disarming Italian partisans and discouraging Josip Broz Tito‚Äôs partisans from encroaching on Austrian and Italian territory. By this time PPA personnel had gained between them a DSO, a Distinguished Conduct Medal, 6 MCs, 10 MMs, and 14 Mentions in Despatches; King George VI had personally requested an account of the unit‚Äôs exploits.

It is based on the Old Testament passage 1 Chronicles 4:9-10: Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, \\"I gave birth to him in pain.\\" Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, saying, \\"Oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from the evil one.\\" And God granted his request. (NIV) In the book, Wilkinson encourages Christians to invoke this prayer for themselves on a daily basis: :I challenge you to make the Jabez prayer for blessing part of the daily fabric of your life. To do that, I encourage you to follow unwaveringly the plan outlined here for the next thirty days. By the end of that time, you'll be noticing significant changes in your life, and the prayer will be on its way to becoming a treasured, lifelong habit. The book became an international bestseller, topping the New York Times bestseller list and selling nine million copies. It received the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association Gold Medallion Book of the Year award in 2001. Derivative works and merchandise The popularity of the original book has led its publisher, Multnomah Press, to extend the line to a number of derivative works targeted at niche audiences, as well as to offer the books in audio and video formats.

Publisher's preface from Rudnitskaya, El L., ed. (1997). Revolyutsionnyy radikalizm v Rossii: vek devyatnadtsatyy. Dokumental'naya publikatsiya. Moscow: Arkheohrafycheskyy tsentr. He was the author of the radical Catechism of a Revolutionary. Nechayev fled Russia in 1869 after having been involved in the murder of a former comrade. Complicated relationships with fellow revolutionaries caused him to be expelled from the International Workingmen's Association. Arrested in Switzerland in 1872, he was extradited back to Russia where he received a twenty-year sentence and died in prison. The character Pyotr Verkhovensky in Fyodor Dostoevsky's anti-nihilistic novel Demons is based on Nechayev. Nechayev is often called a \\"Bolshevik before the Bolsheviks\\" and many other Russian revolutionaries were accused of Nechayevshchina by their opponents. The term was associated with authoritarianism, radicalism and sectarianism in the time that preceded the Russian Revolution of 1917.  Early life in Russia  The house in which Nechaev was born and lived until 1862 Nechayev was born in Ivanovo, then a small textile town, to poor parents‚Äîhis father was a waiter and sign painter. His mother died when he was eight. His father remarried and had two more sons. They lived in a three-room house with his two sisters and grandparents. They were ex-serfs who had moved to Ivanovo. He had already developed an awareness of social inequality and a resentment of the local nobility in his youth. At the age of 10, he had learned his father's trades‚Äîwaiting at banquets and painting signs. His father got him a job as an errand boy in a factory, but he refused the servant's job. His family paid for good tutors who taught him Latin, German, French, history, maths and rhetoric.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 90. Nechayev in 1865 Aged 18, Nechayev moved to Moscow, where he worked for the historian Mikhael Pogodin. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg, passed a teacher's exam and began teaching at a parish school. From September 1868, Nechayev attended lectures at the Saint Petersburg University as an auditor (he was never enrolled) and became acquainted with the subversive Russian literature of the Decembrists, the Petrashevsky Circle and Mikhail Bakunin among others as well as the growing student unrest at the university. Nechaev was even said to have slept on bare wood and lived on black bread in imitation of Rakhmetov, the ascetic revolutionary in Nikolay Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?.Drozd, Andrew Michael (2012). Chernyshevskii's What is to be Done?: A Reevaluation. p. 115. Inspired by the failed attempt on the Tsar's life by Dmitry Karakozov, Nechayev participated in student activism in 1868‚Äì1869, leading a radical minority with Pyotr Tkachev and others. Nechayev took part in devising this student movement's \\"Program of revolutionary activities\\" which stated later a social revolution as its ultimate goal. The program also suggested ways for creating a revolutionary organization and conducting subversive activities. In particular, the program envisioned composition of the Catechism of a Revolutionary, for which Nechayev would become famous. In December 1868, Nechayev met Vera Zasulich (who would make an assassination attempt on General Fyodor Trepov, governor of Saint Petersburg in 1878) at a teachers' meeting. He asked her to come to his school where he held candlelit readings of revolutionary tracts. He would place pictures of Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just on the table while reading.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 93. At these meetings, he plotted to assassinate Tsar Alexander II on the 9th anniversary of serfdom's abolition. The last of these student meetings occurred on 28 January 1869, where Nechayev presented a petition calling for freedom of assembly for students.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 97. Two days later, he handed it to the police, intending to radicalize the students through prison and exile.  Geneva exiles  In January 1869, Nechayev spread false rumors of his arrest in Saint Petersburg, then left for Moscow before heading abroad. He tried to get Vera Zasulich to emigrate with him by declaring love for her, but she refused.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 98. He sent her a letter claiming to have been arrested. In Geneva, Switzerland, he pretended to be a representative of a revolutionary committee who had fled from the Peter and Paul Fortress and won the confidence of revolutionary-in-exile Mikhail Bakunin (who called him \\"my boy\\")Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 101. and his friend and collaborator Nikolai Ogarev. Bakunin saw in Nechayev the authentic voice of Russian youth which he regarded as \\"the most revolutionary in the world\\". He would hold onto this idealised vision long after his association with Nechayev became damaging to him. On Bakunin's suggestion, Ogarev dedicated a poem to Nechayev titled The Student: Nechayev, Bakunin and Ogarev organized a propaganda campaign of subversive material to be sent to Russia, financed by Ogarev from the so-called Bakhmetiev Fund which had been intended for subsidizing their own revolutionary activities. Alexander Herzen disliked Nechayev's fanaticism and strongly opposed the campaign, believing Nechayev was influencing Bakunin toward more extreme rhetoric. However, Herzen relented to hand over much of the fund to Nechayev which he was to take to Russia to mobilise support for the revolution. Nechayev had a list of 387 people who were sent 560 parcels of leaflets for distribution April‚ÄìAugust 1869.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 111. The idea was that the activists would be caught, punished and radicalized. Amongst these people was Zasulich, who got five years exile because of a crudely coded letter sent by Nechayev.  Catechism of a Revolutionary  In late spring 1869, Nechayev wrote the Catechism of a Revolutionary, a program for the \\"merciless destruction\\" of society and the state. The main principle of the revolutionary catechism‚Äîthe ends justify the means‚Äîbecame Nechayev's slogan throughout his revolutionary career. He saw ruthless immorality in the pursuit of total control by church and the state and believed that the struggle against them must therefore be carried out by any means necessary, with an unwavering focus on their destruction. The individual self is to be subsumed by a greater purpose in a kind of spiritual asceticism which for Nechayev was far more than just a theory, but the guiding principle by which he lived his life, claiming: The book was to influence generations of radicals and was re-published by the Black Panther Party in 1969, one hundred years after its original publication. It also influenced the formation of the militant Red Brigades in Italy the same year.  Return to Russia  Having left Russia illegally, Nechayev had to sneak back to Moscow via Romania in August 1869 with help from Bakunin's underground contacts. On the way, he met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary.Siljak, Ana (2009). Angel of Vengeance. p. 120. In Moscow, he lived an austere life, spending the fund only on political activities. He pretended to be a proxy of the Russian department of the Worldwide Revolutionary Union which did not exist and created an affiliate of a secret society called People's Reprisal Society () which it issued the magazine People's Reprisal (). He claimed that the society had existed for quite some time in every corner of Russia. He spoke passionately to student dissidents about the need to organise. Marxist writer Vera Zasulich (whose sister Alexandra sheltered him in Moscow) recalls that when she first met Nechayev, he immediately tried to recruit her: :Nechayev began to tell me his plans for carrying out a revolution in Russia in the near future. I felt terrible: it was really painful for me to say \\"That's unlikely,\\" \\"I don't know about that\\". I could see that he was very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act ‚Äì wasn't he the ringleader of the students? [...] I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me. [...] And what did I know of \\"the people\\"? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth. Many were impressed by the young proletarian and joined the group. However, the already fanatical Nechayev appeared to be becoming more distrustful of the people around him, even denouncing Bakunin as doctrinaire, \\"idly running off at the mouth and on paper\\". One Narodnaya Rasprava member, I. I. Ivanov, disagreed with Nechayev about the distribution of propaganda and left the group. On 21 November 1869, Nechayev and several comrades beat, strangled and shot Ivanov, hiding the body in a lake through a hole in the ice. The body was soon found and some of his colleagues arrested, but Nechayev eluded capture and in late November left for Saint Petersburg, where he tried to continue his activities to create a clandestine society. On 15 December 1869, he fled the country, heading back to Geneva. This incident was fictionalised by writer Fyodor Dostoevsky in his anti-nihilistic novel Demons (published three years later) in which the character Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky is based on Nechayev.Bloom, Harold (1989). Fydoro Dostoevsky. p. 60  Downfall  Bakunin and Ogarev embraced Nechayev on his return to Switzerland in January 1870, with Bakunin writing: \\"I so jumped for joy that I nearly smashed the ceiling with my old head!\\". Soon after their reunion, Herzen died (21 January 1870) and a large fund from his personal wealth became available to Nechayev to continue his political activities. Nechayev issued a number of proclamations aimed at different strata of the Russian population. Together with Ogarev, he published the Kolokol magazine (April‚ÄìMay, 1870, issues 1 to 6). In his article \\"The Fundamentals of the Future Social System\\" (Glavnyye osnovy budushchego obshchestvennogo stroya), published in the People's Reprisal (1870, no. 2), Nechayev shared his vision of a socialist system which Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels would later term barracks communism. Nechayev's suspicion of his comrades had grown even greater and began stealing letters and private papers with which to blackmail Bakunin and his fellow exiles should the need arise. He enlisted the help of Herzen's daughter Natalie. While not clearly breaking with Nechayev, Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity, saying: \\"Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though certainly not a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends\\". Bakunin then threatened Nechayev with breaking relations with him, writing:Bakunin, Mikhail. \\"M. Bakunin to Sergey Nechayev\\". In Confino, Michael (1974). Daughter of a Revolutionary: Natalie Herzen and the Bakunin-Nechayev Circle. London: Alcove Press. The General Council of the foremost left-wing organisation, the International Workingmen's Association of 1864‚Äì1876, officially dissociated themselves from Nechayev, claiming he had abused the name of the organisation. After writing a letter to a publisher on Bakunin's behalf, threatening to kill the publisher if he did not release Bakunin from a contract, Nechayev became even more isolated from his comrades. International member German Lopatin accused him of theoretical unscrupulousness and pernicious behaviour, prompting Ogarev and Bakunin to publicly claim to have severed their relations with him in 1870. However, Bakunin continued to write privately to Nechayev, proposing that they continue to work together. Wheen, Francis (1999). Karl Marx pp. 346‚Äì347. In September 1870, Nechayev published an issue of the Commune magazine in London as the Second French Empire of Napoleon III collapsed. Hiding from the Tsarist police. he later went underground in Paris and then in Z√ºrich. He also kept in touch with the Polish Blanquists such as Caspar Turski and others. In September 1872, Karl Marx produced the threatening letter (which Nechayev had written to the publisher) at the Hague Congress of the International at which Bakunin was also expelled from the organisation.Fernbach, David, ed. (1974). Marx: The First International and After p. 49 On 14 August 1872, Nechayev was arrested in Z√ºrich and handed over to the Russian police. He was found guilty on 8 January 1873 and sentenced to twenty years of katorga (hard labor) for killing Ivanov. While locked up in a ravelin of the Peter and Paul Fortress, Nechayev managed to win over his guards with the strength of his convictions and by the late 1870s was using them to pass on correspondence with revolutionaries on the outside. In December 1880, Nechayev established contact with the Executive Committee of the People's Will (Narodnaya Volya) and proposed a plan for his own escape. However, he abandoned the plan due to his unwillingness to distract the efforts of the members of Narodnaya Volya from attempting to assassinate Tsar Alexander II, which they achieved only in March 1881. Vera Zasulich, who ten years earlier had been among those investigated for Ivanov's murder, heard in 1877 that the head of the Saint Petersburg police, General Trepov, had ordered the flogging of Aleksei Bogolyubov, a young political prisoner. Though not a follower of Nechayev, Zasulich felt outraged at Bogolyubov's mistreatment and at the plight of other political prisoners. On 5 February, she walked into Trepov's office and shot and wounded him. In an indication of the popular political feeling of the time, a jury found her not guilty on the grounds that she had acted out of noble intent. In 1882, Nechayev died in his cell. Despite his personal courage and fanatical dedication to the revolutionary cause, Nechayev's methods (later called Nechayevshchina) were viewed to have caused harm to the Russian revolutionary movement by endangering clandestine organizations. Historian Edvard Radzinsky suggests that many revolutionaries have successfully implemented Nechayev's methods and ideas, including Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.  Influence  Nechayev's theories had a major influence on other Russian revolutionaries, like Pyotr Tkachev and Vladimir Lenin. He was the first to bring the theme of the professional revolutionary in Russia. Lenin's brother Aleksandr Ulyanov was part of an organization which based its program on Nechayev's. His other theories on how a socialist state would function, outlined in the \\"Fundamental Thesis\\" and \\"The Fundamentals of the Future Social System\\" among others, were identical to that of the Soviet Union and other Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states. For instance, Lenin stated many times that Nechayev was a \\"Titan of the revolution\\" and that all of the communist revolutionaries must \\"read Nechayev\\". Many critics inside and out of the Soviet Union labelled his version of revolutionary socialism the one that was taking place in the Soviet Union itself, with Soviet politicians after the Stalin era admitting this themselves many times. He also influenced later generations of Russian revolutionary nihilists. He was rehabilitated during Stalin's time.  Notes   References  * Robynski (1994).

It provides illumination only from parts of the visible spectrum to which the photographic material in use is nearly, or completely insensitive. Design A safelight usually consists of an ordinary light bulb in a housing closed off by a coloured filter, but sometimes a special light bulb or fluorescent tube with suitable filter material coated directly on the glass is used in an ordinary fixture. Differently sensitised materials require different safelights. In traditional black-and-white photographic printing, photographic papers normally are handled under an amber or red safelight, as such papers typically are sensitive only to blue and green light. Orthochromatic papers and films are also sensitive to yellow light and must be used only with a deep red safelight, not with an amber one. Panchromatic films and papers, nominally sensitive to the entire spectrum, sometimes have a region of minimum in their range of sensitivity that allows the careful use of safelight confined to that part of the spectrum. For example, Kodak Panalure panchromatic paper is tolerant of limited exposure to light filtered through a Kodak 13 Safelight Filter. Other panchromatic materials must be handled only in total darkness. Many photosensitive materials used in technical and industrial applications, such as photoresist, are sensitive only to blue, violet, and ultraviolet light and may be handled under a brighter yellow safelight.

The film is regarded by fans and film critics as one of Presley's best films, and it is noted for the on-screen chemistry between Presley and Ann-Margret. It also presents a strong set of ten musical song-and-dance scenes choreographed by David Winters and features his dancers. Viva Las Vegas was a hit at film theaters, as it was #14 on the Variety year end box office list of the top-grossing films of 1964. Plot Lucky Jackson (Elvis) goes to Las Vegas, Nevada to participate in the city's first annual Grand Prix Race. However, his race car, an Elva Mk.6 Maserati, is in need of a new engine in order to compete in the event. Lucky raises the necessary money in Las Vegas, but he loses it when he is shoved into the pool by the hotel's nubile swimming instructor, Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret). Lucky then has to work as a waiter at the hotel to replace the lost money to pay his hotel bill, as well as enter the hotel's talent contest in hopes of winning a cash prize sizable enough to pay for his car's engine. During all this time, Lucky attempts to win the affections of Rusty. His main competition arrives in the form of Count Elmo Mancini (Cesare Danova) and his Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta. Mancini attempts to win both the Grand Prix and the affections of Rusty. Rusty soon falls in love with Lucky, and immediately tries to change him into what she wants.

Viva Las Vegas was filmed during the summer of 1963, before production of Presley's film Kissin' Cousins, but was released after Kissin' Cousins in the summer of 1964. In Great Britain, both the film and its soundtrack were sold as Love In Las Vegas, since there was another, different film called Viva Las Vegas that was being shown in British cinemas at the same time that Presley's was released. The chemistry between the two stars was genuine during filming. Presley and Ann-Margret began an affair, and this received considerable attention from film and music gossip columnists. This reportedly led to a showdown with Presley's worried girlfriend Priscilla Beaulieu. (Elvis and Priscilla married in 1967.) In her 1985 book Elvis and Me, Priscilla Presley describes the difficulties that she experienced when the gossip columnists erroneously \\"announced\\" that Ann-Margret and Presley had become engaged to be married. In her memoirs, Ann-Margret refers to Elvis Presley as her \\"soulmate\\" and stated: \\"We felt there was a need in 'The Industry' for a female Elvis Presley.\\" In addition, the filming of Viva Las Vegas reportedly produced unusually heated exchanges between the director, film veteran George Sidney, and Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who was not credited as a \\"Technical Advisor\\" in the film's credits. The arguments reportedly concerned the amount of time and effort allotted by the cinematographer, Joseph Biroc, to the song and dance numbers that featured Ann-Margret, ostensibly on the orders of the director. These scenes include views of Ann-Margret's dancing taken from many different camera angles, the use of multiple cameras for each scene, and several retakes of each of her song-and-dance scenes. David Winters from the original cast of West Side Story was the film's choreographer and was recommended by Ann-Margret for the job. This was Winters' first job as a choreographer on a feature film and Ann-Margret was his dance student at the time. Because the film went over budget, Parker would slash budgets for all remaining films in Presley's career. Little Church of the West, the oldest wedding chapel in Las Vegas, is the location used in the closing scene. The scene where Presley sings \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" is performed in one single unedited shot‚Äîthe only known example of such a technique in Presley's film career. Reception The film grossed $9,442,967 at the box office, earning $5 million in U.S. theatrical rentals. For his role in Viva Las Vegas, Elvis Presley received a third place prize 1965 Laurel Award for best male performance in a musical film. Viva Las Vegas also received the 1965 Laurel Award for runner-up in the category of the best musical of 1964. Ann-Margret was praised for her on screen chemistry with Elvis, as she nearly stole the film from him. Some critics in 1964 were lukewarm about Viva Las Vegas, such as one for The New York Times, who wrote: \\"Viva Las Vegas, the new Elvis Presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split.\\" However, many others deduced the reasons why many members of the North American public liked the movie so much. Variety stated in its review: \\"Beyond several flashy musical numbers, a glamorous locale, and one electrifying auto race sequence, the production is a pretty trite and 'heavyhanded' affair\\". Critical reaction notwithstanding, Viva Las Vegas has become one of Elvis Presley's most popular and iconic films.

A. Folger & Company coffee Folger's Golden Gate Coffee advertisement, early 20th century Folgers Coffee is a brand of coffee produced in the United States, and sold there, in Canada and in Mexico. It forms part of the food and beverage division of The J.M. Smucker Company. Since the early 1990s, it has been the largest-selling ground coffee in the United States. Company history The precursor of the Folger Coffee Company was founded in 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The founding owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island at the age of 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco.Nathaniel Philbrick, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, Viking, 2000. After working at Bovee‚Äôs mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co. In 1861, James married. He and his wife had four children, and two of the children worked for the family business. In 1889, James died, and his oldest son, James A. Folger II, stepped into the role of president of J.A. Folger & Co at the age of 26. In the 1900s, the company began to grow dramatically due primarily to a salesman named Frank P. Atha. Atha sold coffee in the California area, but proposed to James Folger II that he open and manage a Folgers Coffee plant in Texas. The company grew exponentially after Atha opened the Texas plant. Under the mid-20th century leadership of Peter Folger, the brand became one of the principal coffee concerns in North America, the world's largest coffee market. Procter & Gamble acquired Folger's in 1963 and removed the apostrophe from its name. During P&G;'s ownership, Folgers became the number one coffee brand in America. P&G; announced in January 2008 that Folgers would be spun off into a separate Cincinnati-based company but reversed itself that June and announced Folgers would be acquired by the end of 2008 by The J.M. Smucker Company.\\"The Marketing Doctor Says: Smuckers Buys Folgers\\" Marketing Doctor Blog. June 6, 2008. Utilizing a rare financial technique called a Reverse Morris Trust, Smucker purchased Folgers in November 2008 and made it a subsidiary. Brands Twelve brands of Folgers are available in the United States *Classic Roast, including Classic \\"Red Can\\" and half-caffeine medium roasts *Classic Complements, including Gourmet Supreme (Dark Roast), 100% Colombian (Medium-Dark Roast), French Roast (Medium-Dark Roast), Black Silk (Dark Roast) and Breakfast Blend (Light Roast) *Simply Smooth, a medium roast coffee *Flavored Coffee, including Hazelnut, French Vanilla, Chocolate Silk, and Cinnamon *Folgers Gourmet Selections, a line of varietal and flavored coffees *Instant Coffee, Folgers Crystals available in Regular and Decaf *Singles, single serve packets *Home Cafe Pods, for use with one cup brewing systems such as HomeCafe. *Cappuccino, instant French Vanilla and Mocha Chocolate cappuccino powder *Folgers Flavors Coffee Enhancers, including Caramel, Vanilla, Mocha, and Hazelnut *Folgers Iced Caf√© Coffee Drink Concentrates, including Original Latte, Caramel Macchiato, Vanilla Latte, and Hazelnut Latte *1850 a premium brand launched in 2018 available in Whole-bean, Ground, K-Cup¬Æ pods, & Iced Coffee In Canada, Folgers is primarily available as Classic Roast and Mountain Roast. In the United Kingdom, Folgers Instant Crystals are available. Advertising Folgers coffee ad from the 1960s Folgers is promoted with the slogan \\"The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup!\\" It is well associated with a jingle featured in almost every advertisement since 1984, with lyrics by Susan Spiegel Solovay and Bill Vernick, and music by Leslie Pearl. Over the years it has been rearranged and performed by many famous musicians, such as Ritchie Havens, Randy Travis, Bonnie Tyler, Paul Stanley, Aretha Franklin, and Rockapella. From 1965 to 1986, Folgers was known for television ads involving \\"Mrs. Olson\\", a Swedish neighbor played by Virginia Christine who invariably recommended a cup of Folgers coffee for the characters in the commercial. Folgers promoted their instant coffee in the 1970s and early 1980s ads which took the viewer inside various 'high-end' restaurants while a voice-over (by Bryan Clark) whispered to the viewer that they've secretly switched the coffee used at the restaurant with Folgers, and watched the restaurants' patrons to see if they could tell whether or not they noticed the difference. One Folgers television ad from 1985, \\"Peter Comes Home,\\" became particularly associated with the Christmas holidays. A college student returns home, apparently on Christmas Day. His kid sister is the first one to greet Peter, helping him make the Folgers. The smell of freshly brewed coffee awakening his parents and alerting them to their son's arrival. The Cunningham & Walsh spot aired yearly until 1998, then in edited form in 2004 and 2005. In the mid-1980s Folgers became a NASCAR sponsor. After a trial season with the Joe Ruttman driven, Larry McClure owned Chevrolet in 1985, Folgers expanded its sponsorships. In 2006, the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi created a viral advertisement, popularly known as \\"Happy Mornings\\", in which a large group of cheerful singers and dancers appear at sunrise as the sun itself to wake people up. In 2009, Saatchi & Saatchi created a holiday ad, \\"Coming Home,\\" where brother Peter is met by his sister at their parents home on returning from volunteering in West Africa. The ad quickly went viral and has been criticized for perceived sexual tensions between Peter and his sister. In 2014, the brand celebrated the 30th anniversary of the famous jingle. The Folger Building The Folger Coffee Company Building at 101 Howard Street, San Francisco The brick, five-story Folger Coffee Company Building at 101 Howard in San Francisco, California is the former headquarters of Folgers. It is listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. The building still has a sign saying \\"The Folgers Coffee Company\\" on one corner. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has its California campus on the top floor. On August 2, 2011, the Folger Building was purchased by the University of San Francisco, marking a return to the university's roots in downtown San Francisco.

District courts are a category of courts which exists in several nations, some call them \\"small case court\\" usually as the lowest level of the hierarchy. These include: Americas =United States= In the United States federal courts, the United States district courts are the general trial courts. The federal district courts have jurisdiction over federal questions (trials and cases interpreting the Constitution, Federal law, or which involve federal statutes or crimes) and diversity (cases otherwise subject to jurisdiction in a state trial court but which are between litigants of different states and/or countries). There are 89 federal districts in the 50 states. United States district courts also exist in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. So, in total, there are 94 U.S. district courts. Decisions from these courts are subject to review by one of the 13 United States court of appeals, which are, in turn, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States. Some states maintain state courts called \\"district courts.\\" In Florida, the Florida District Courts of Appeal are intermediate appellate courts. In Texas, the Texas District Courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction, hearing all felony and divorce cases, election controversies, and many civil matters. The Hawaii State District Courts, and those in Alaska, New York, and Kentucky, to name a few, are courts of limited jurisdiction. Asia and Oceania =Australia= District court is the name given to the intermediate court in most Australian states. They hear indictable (serious) criminal offences excluding treason, murder and, in some States, manslaughter. Their civil jurisdiction is also intermediate, typically being for civil disputes where the amount claimed is greater than a $75 000 but less than $750 000. The limits vary between Australian states. In Victoria, the equivalent court is called the County Court. Below them is the Magistrates' Courts, known as the Local Court in New South Wales. Above them are the State Supreme Courts. =China= Hong Kong The District Court in Hong Kong, established in 1953, has limited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. With effect from 1 December 2003, it has civil jurisdiction to hear monetary claims up to HK$1 million or, where the claims are for recovery of land, the annual rent or rateable value does not exceed HK$240,000. In its criminal jurisdiction, the court may try the more serious cases, with the main exceptions of murder, manslaughter and rape. The maximum term of imprisonment it may impose is seven years. There are one Chief District Judge and 30 District Judges, among which three district judges sit in the Family Court and two district judges sit in the Lands Tribunal as Presiding Officers. =India= The district courts of India are presided over by a judge. They administer justice in India at a district level. These courts are under administrative and judicial control of the high court of the state to which the district concerned belongs. =Indonesia= The district courts of Indonesia are part of public courts for all cases non- related to religion, constitutions or military matters. The decisions of guilt or innocence are made by a panel of three judges led by a chair judge. =Israel= The district courts in Israel serve both as the appellate courts and also as the court of first instance for some cases (e.g. real estate or IP). In criminal matters, they try cases where the accused faces a penalty of at least seven years imprisonment. As of 2007, there are six district courts: *Jerusalem *Tel Aviv *Haifa *Nazareth *Central Region (Lod) *Beersheba =Japan= Japan has 50 district courts, one in each of the 47 prefectures and one in the three cities of Hakodate, Asahikawa and Kushiro. They are the first court level for most civil and criminal cases. Most cases are held with one judge. =New Zealand= The District Court of New Zealand deals with all criminal matters other than murder, manslaughter and specified offences such as treason.Criminal Procedure Act 1947 (NZ) ss 73-74 The court can also hear civil claims up to $350,000.General civil jurisdiction District Court Act 2016 Retrieved on September 27, 2012 District courts were called magistrates' courts until 1980. =Pakistan= The district courts of Pakistan are presided over by a senior judge. They administer justice in Pakistan at a district level. These courts are under administrative and judicial control of the high court of the province to which the district concerned belongs. Europe =Austria= Austria has some 200 district, or local, courts, which decide minor civil and criminal cases. =Denmark= Denmark consists of 24 judicial districts, each being served by a district court (Danish: byret, literally meaning \\"town court\\"). Each district court serves one or more of the country's 98 municipalities, except that Copenhagen Municipality is divided between two district because of its size. Before 2007, when the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98, there were 82 district courts. The two high courts (the Eastern and Western) serve as courts of appeal. =Finland= : See also Judicial system of Finland Finland has 27 district courts, which deal with criminal cases, civil cases and petitionary matters. Since December 1, 1993 these have been called k√§r√§j√§oikeus in Finnish and tingsr√§tt in Swedish. Each court is headed by the Chief Judge and other District Judges. In certain cases, the district court may also have lay judges. The cases are handled and resolved either in a session or in chambers. In simple cases decisions can be made by notaries. =Germany= Germany has 115 regional courts (Landesgerichte), which are superior to the Amtsgerichte and below the Oberlandesgerichte. =Iceland= The district courts are the lowest judicial level in Iceland. There are eight courts operating in separate districts, the District Court of Reykjav√≠k, the District Court of Reykjanes, the District Court of Western Iceland, the District Court of the Westfjords, the District Court of Northwest Iceland, the District Court of Northeast Iceland, the District Court of East Iceland and the District Court of South Iceland. The courts handle all cases in their first instance. Subject to conditions, cases can be appealed to a higher court, ultimately the Supreme Court of Iceland whose conclusions are final. =Ireland= The District Court in Ireland was established in 1924. The court handles civil claims of up to ‚Ç¨15,000 and summary criminal trials (minor offences tried by a judge alone where the maximum penalty is 12 months on indictment in the Circuit Court and the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol. =Norway= The Norwegian tingrett deals with criminal and civil cases. The term tingrett was introduced in 2002, and replaced the previous terms byrett and herredsrett as designations for district courts. =Poland= =Sweden= √ñrebro tingsr√§tt in √ñrebro, Sweden In Sweden, there are 48 district courts (); Tingsr√§tt is also used to describe such courts in Finland and Norway. While relatively recent creations in their current form, the term tingsr√§tt refers to the ting (\\"thing\\"), the ancient term for governing assemblies in these and other Nordic and Germanic countries, where disputes would be brought up to be settled. The specific term tingsr√§tt was used for courts already in 17th century Sweden, but was later discontinued. It's the court of first instance; dealing with criminal cases, some civil law disputes and a number of non-contentious matters. Private cases against decisions by the public authorities are generally handled by the tingsr√§tt or the f√∂rvaltningsr√§tt (administrative court), depending on the authority in question. In 1971, the tingsr√§tts became the district courts of Sweden, replacing the previous distinction between r√•dhusr√§tt in larger cities and h√§radsr√§tt for other parts of the country. Later reforms have substantially reduced the number of these courts from around 100 to currently (2014) 48. Appeals against a district court are made to the appellate court (). =United Kingdom= Scotland District courts were introduced in 1975 as replacement for the burgh police courts; they dealt with the most minor crimes. They were run by the local authorities. Each court comprised one or more justices of the peace (lay magistrates) who sat alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court. They handled many cases of breach of the peace, drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. District courts operated under summary procedure and could not impose a fine in excess of ¬£2,500 or sentence an offender to more than 60 days in prison. In practice, most offences were dealt with by a fine. In Glasgow where the volume of business requires the employment of three solicitors as \\"stipendiary magistrates\\" who sit in place of the lay justices. A stipendiary magistrates' court has the same sentencing power as a summary sheriff court. District Courts in Scotland were abolished and replaced with justice of the peace courts under the provisions of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007. The justice of the peace courts are managed by the Scottish Court Service. Responsibility for the courts was transferred from the local authorities in a rolling programme of court unification which concluded in February 2010. District courts were replaced by JP courts in sheriffdoms as follows: *Sheriffdom of Lothian and Borders, 10 March 2008 *Sheriffdom of Grampian, Highlands and Islands, 2 June 2008 *Sheriffdom of Glasgow and Strathkelvin, 8 December 2008 *Sheriffdom of Tayside, Central and Fife, 23 February 2009 *Sheriffdom of North Strathclyde, 14 December 2009The Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of North Strathclyde) etc. Order 2009 SSI 2009/331 *Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries & Galloway, 22 February 2010The Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway) etc. Order 2009 SSI 2009/332  References   External links  * Finnish district courts * United States district courts * United States District Courts in each state Courts by type ","title":"District court"},{"id":"985076","text":"Penny Farthing Records was a British independent record label, established by the British record producer Larry Page as a progression from his mildly successful 1960s record label, Page One Records. It did not repeat the top 20 hits of his earlier venture, but signed some artists of note. Artists under contract The Dutch group, Shocking Blue, had their big hit \\"Venus\\" (1969) with Penny Farthing Records. In 1970, Penny Farthing Records released the single, \\"Sister Simon (Funny Man)\\" PEN 738, by the UK group Heatwave (later known as The Sensations). While the a-side received airplay, the funky b-side, \\"Rastus Ravel\\", was well received in the clubs. Both songs were written and produced by John Edward for Instant Sound Productions. The single featured Maggie Stredder and Jean Ryder of The Ladybirds with Doris Troy as back-up singers. The group was a regular on the BBC Radio Terry Wogan, Dave Cash, Jimmy Young and Radio 1 Club shows. In 1970, Killing Floor's second album, Out of Uranus, was released on Penny Farthing Records. The former Honeybus bassist, Colin Hare, released an album March Hare on Penny Farthing in 1971, which was not a commercial success. It was re-released through Hare's own Runfast label in 2004. Daniel Boone's \\"Beautiful Sunday\\" (written by the singer) and released in 1972, was a staple of early 1970s disc jockeys. Picked up by the Japanese TV show Beautiful Sunday some ten years later, this song was re-popularized in Japan. Page also recorded Daniel's wife (Lesley) Lelly Boone, but with no success despite an appearance on BBC TV's Top of the Pops. In 1971, Larry Page also signed up Johnny Pearson and released a stream of easy listening albums, the last of these being released in 1982. Pearson is notable as being the pianist and arranger behind British studio outfit Sounds Orchestral. The Johnny Pearson Orchestra's track, \\"Sleepy Shores\\", was a No. 8 hit in the UK Singles Chart for Penny Farthing in 1971, and an album of the same name was released the following year. Page also recorded The Barron Knights, whose comedy records had some UK chart success. However, Page's attempts to turn them into a mainstream pop group failed. He eventually resorted to the flop \\"The Ballad of Frank Spencer\\". Even his attempt to record them under another name ‚Äì Philly Dog ‚Äì did not produce the desired hits. Paul Da Vinci, the voice on The Rubettes hit \\"Sugar Baby Love\\", turned to Penny Farthing immediately after this song made the UK no. 1 slot. The resulting \\"Your Baby Ain't Your Baby Anymore\\" sold modestly. Page One Records stalwarts The Troggs were persuaded to join Penny Farthing but their label debut, Page's attempt at the Beach Boys hit \\"Good Vibrations\\" with Reg Presley's vocals, did not produce sizeable sales. Penny Farthing also recorded an early album by Raymond Froggatt. However, most of the company's revenue was gained from Germany, where their solo artist signing Kincade had a number of minor hits, including \\"Dreams Are 10 A Penny\\", \\"Big Hand For Annie\\" written by John Carter. Carter, writing under a number of different names, also had hits with Penny Farthing in the early 1970s.

The genus is named after Robert Knud Friedrich Pilger. P. uviferum is a dioecious, slow-growing, narrowly conical evergreen tree that grows from 2‚Äì20 m in height, with a trunk up to 1.5 m in diameter. Taller specimens and wider trunks (reportedly up to 3 m in diameter) are known to have existed in the past. The leaves are scale-like and arranged in decussate pairs, with each leaf equal in size, giving the shoots a square cross-section (unlike the Libocedrus species, where pairs of larger leaves alternate with pairs of smaller leaves, giving a somewhat flattened shoot). The seed cones are 5‚Äì12 mm long and 4‚Äì6 mm broad, with four scales, two sterile basal scales and two fertile scales; each scale has a slender spine-like bract, and each fertile scale has two winged seeds 3‚Äì4 mm long. The pollen cones are 5‚Äì10 mm long and 2 mm broad, with 12‚Äì20 scales. It is found in the evergreen coastal lowland forests along the Pacific coast of southern Patagonia, in association with the broadleaf evergreens Nothofagus betuloides and Drimys winteri. It is also found in open stands in sheltered bogs farther inland, where it is often locally dominant, and ranges as far as the eastern slopes of the Andes in southwestern Argentina. At the northern end of its range it is found in association with Fitzroya cupressoides. It has also been planted along the northern part of the Pacific Coast of the United States. At present much Pilgerodendron uviferum grow in the Andes and in the Chilean Coast Range. However, during the interstadials of the region's last glacial period, P. uviferum grew in lowland areas such as the Central Valley, where it is now absent. Remaining lowland populations are thought to be relicts that have survived the warmer climate of the Holocene. The wood of P. uviferum is yellow-reddish and has a distinct spicy-resinous smell, and is highly resistant to decay, which has made it very valuable as a source of timber for building construction in its native range. Much of its original lowland habitat has been cleared for this and other reasons. Listed as Vulnerable (VU A2cd v2.3) Due to over-exploitation, the species is now much scarcer than formerly, and is accordingly listed under CITES Appendix I, by which export of the wood is prohibited. P. uviferum is considered threatened by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre and vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. History Indigenous sea-faring nomads of the Chono and Kaw√©sqars groups used Pilgerodendron uviferum as firewood as well as wood for rows, boats and houses. During the Antonio de Vea expedition (1675‚Äì1676) Spanish explorers visited the Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes where the tree grew noticing the similarity to the \\"cypresses of Spain\\". Historically the wood was used to make railway sleepers, but eventually became popular for use as timber in all types of construction. In the 1860s, Felipe Westhoff was one of various businessmen who exported Pilgerodendron uviferum north to Chilean and Peruvian ports. Westhoff, who was based in Ancud, came initially as an agent of Ferrocarril Central Andino in Peru to purchase sleepers but soon became an independent businessman. The town of Melinka was established in 1860 during the Pilgerodendron boom. This was the first permanent settlement in the Guaitecas Archipelago. After Westhoff's retirement in the 1870s, Ciriaco √Ålvarez, a native of Chonchi, rose as the most prominent P. uviferum businessman in the area, and was dubbed \\"The King of Pilgerodendron\\" (). Many of the wooden structures in settlements of the southern Chilean archipelagos are built largely from P. uviferum wood.

The father is Edmund Passmore, his wife Lydia Jutsum, heiress of Grilstone. Bertha Passmore, front row far right, was Widgery's mother. John Passmore Widgery, Baron Widgery, (24 July 1911 ‚Äì 26 July 1981) was an English judge who served as Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales from 1971 to 1980. He is principally noted for presiding over the Widgery Tribunal on the events of Bloody Sunday. Early career and war service Widgery came from a North Devon family which had been living in South Molton for many generations. An ancestor had been a gaoler and his mother served as a magistrate. He attended Queen's College, Taunton, where he became head prefect. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1933 after serving as an articled clerk, but instead of going into practice, he joined Gibson and Welldon, a well-known firm of law tutors. He was an effective lecturer in the years leading up to World War II while he was also commissioned into the Royal Engineers (Territorial Army) in 1938, having joined as a sapper. As a searchlight officer, in 1940 he transferred to the Royal Artillery. Widgery participated in the Normandy landings. By the end of the war he had an OBE, the Croix de Guerre (France), and the Order of Leopold (Belgium), and had reached the rank of brigadier. Widgery was an active freemason. Barrister After demobilization Widgery changed to another branch of the legal profession as he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1946. He gathered a reputation for being a fast talker, and eventually came to specialise in disputes over rating and town planning, where his methodical approach and self-control were useful attributes. In 1958 he was made a Queen's Counsel, the first such award given to a post-war barrister. Widgery became a High Court judge in 1961, receiving the customary knighthood. As a judge he did not draw attention to himself and his judgments tended not to include any comments which were pithy, memorable or quotable. However, his calmness produced judgments which were generally regarded as fair and humane. One example cited in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography was his justification for limiting damages for economic loss in Weller v Foot and Mouth Disease Research Institute, a judgment handed down in 1966.R. F. V. Heuston, Widgery, John Passmore, Baron Widgery (1911‚Äì1981), rev. M.C. Curthoys, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005. Retrieved 19 June 2010. (Subscription site) Widgery headed several inquiries during his term. Appellate courts He received promotion to the Court of Appeal in 1968, but had barely got used to his new position when Lord Parker of Waddington (who had been Lord Chief Justice since 1958) announced his retirement. There was no obvious successor and Widgery was the most junior of the possible appointees. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, chose Widgery largely on the basis of his administrative abilities. On 20 April 1971 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Widgery, of South Molton in the County of Devon. Widgery Tribunal Shortly after taking over, Widgery was handed the politically sensitive job of conducting an inquiry into the events of 30 January 1972 in Derry, where troops from 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment had murdered 13 civil rights marchers, commonly referred to as Bloody Sunday (a 14th person died shortly after Widgery's appointment). Widgery heard testimony from the paratroopers, who claimed they had been shot at, while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed. Widgery produced a report, published in April 1972 that took the British Army's side. Widgery put the main blame for the deaths on the march organisers for creating a dangerous situation where a confrontation was inevitable. His strongest criticism of the Army was that the \\"firing bordered on the reckless\\". The Widgery Report was accepted by the British government and Northern Ireland's unionists but was immediately denounced by Irish nationalist politicians, and people in the Bogside and Creggan areas were disgusted by his findings. The British Government had acquired some goodwill because of its suspension of the Stormont Parliament, but that was said to have disappeared when Widgery's conclusions were published. The grievance with Widgery's findings lingered and the issue remained live as the Northern Ireland peace process advanced in the 1990s. In January 1998, on the eve of the 26th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, Tony Blair announced a new inquiry, criticising the rushed process in which Widgery failed to take evidence from those wounded and did not personally read eyewitness accounts. The resulting Bloody Sunday Inquiry lasted 12 years before the Saville Report was published on 15 June 2010. It demolished the Widgery report, finding that soldiers lied about their actions and falsely claimed to have been attacked. Prime Minister David Cameron, on behalf of the United Kingdom, formally apologised for the \\"unjustified and unjustifiable\\" events of Bloody Sunday. As a result of the Saville report, even observers who are natural supporters of the British Army now regard Widgery as discredited. Lord Chief Justice Widgery ruled in the case R v Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, ex parte Blackburn on the duty of the Crown to prosecute. The case was described as follows:University of Western Australia Law Review Editors: \\"R v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, ex parte Blackburn (failure to prosecute)\\" (1972) v10 n4 p.411 \\"A and B are alleged to have committed a crime. A is charged with the crime, convicted and sentenced. B is not charged. At the trial of A there is evidence which suggests that B may have committed or been a participant to the crime. Can the prosecution be compelled to prosecute B?\\" In 1968, the Court of Queen's Bench of Widgery, Melford Stevenson and Daniel Brabin issued judgment that \\"to prosecute must indisputably be a matter of discretion\\", which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Widgery also ruled on the Crossman diaries case when the government attempted to suppress the publication on the grounds of confidentiality. He made it clear during the case that he felt Crossman had \\"broken the rules,\\" but ultimately refused to grant an injunction preventing publication. In criminal cases, Widgery became concerned by an increasing number of cases resting on weak identification evidence. He declared in 1974 that misidentification was \\"the most serious chink in our armour when we say British justice is the best in the world.\\" In March 1976 Widgery dismissed the first appeal by the Birmingham Six in respect of the Birmingham pub bombings.Miscarriages of Justice; Bob Woffinden (1987). His later years in office were marred by persistent ill health and mental decline. In Private EyeIssue No. 436 (1 September 1978). it was claimed that \\"he sits hunched and scowling, squinting into his books from a range of three inches, his wig awry. He keeps up a muttered commentary of bad-tempered and irrelevant questions ‚Äì 'What d'you say?', 'Speak up', 'Don't shout', 'Whipper-snapper', etc.\\". He resisted attempts to get him to resign until the last moment, in 1980. For at least 18 months previously he had not been in control of either his administrative work or his legal pronouncements, he would fall asleep in court, and it soon became apparent that he was suffering from dementia. He died two days after his 70th birthday, in 1981.

It was founded on October 12, 1975, by Dave Holmbo and Bill Hybels, who was its longtime senior pastor. As of February 2020, the church averaged 18,000 attendees each weekend at seven locations, down from a high of 25,000 in 2015. Willow Creek has seven locations in the Chicago area, and their Spanish-speaking congregation, Casa de Luz, meets at the South Barrington campus. In 2018, the church's entire senior leadership and elder board resigned, admitting to having mishandled abuse allegations against Hybels. Steve Gillen, the longtime pastor of the church's North Shore campus, was named interim senior pastor in August 2018. In January 2020, it was announced that Gillen would step down in March and that the two candidates who were being considered for the role of senior pastor had been \\"released\\" from the search process. History Entrance Willow Creek Community Church started when Bill Hybels and Dave Holmbo were inspired by the success of the South Park Church's youth ministry, Son City, of which they were both leaders (Holmbo had invited Hybels to work with him a few years earlier), and aspired to start a church that used relevant biblical teaching, music, and drama. On October 12, 1975, the church met for the first time, renting Willow Creek Theater in Palatine, Illinois. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 540 Gilbert Bilezikian was Hybels' theological mentor. In 1977, the church purchased in South Barrington to build its own building. The first service was held in the new building in February 1981. Since then, the building has been doubled in size and the property expanded to . The changes included a new worship center with more than 7,000 seats, which replaces the 4,500-seat Lakeside Auditorium. There are now ministries designed to serve a variety of needs for different age and people groups. On April 10, 2018, following allegations of sexual abuses, Bill Hybels announced his immediate retirement as senior pastor for the church, initially slated for October. This marked Hybels' first absence from the church since its inception. Hybels received a standing ovation from the church upon making this announcement. In August 2018, Steve Gillen--the longtime pastor of the church's North Shore campus--was chosen as interim senior pastor. J. LEE GRADY, Did new Willow Creek interim pastor want the job? 'Not really', dailyherald.com, USA, August 12, 2018 In January 2020, it was announced that Gillen would step down in March and that the two candidates who were being considered for the role of senior pastor had been \\"released\\" from the search process.. Following the announcement that Steve Gillen would step down, Ray Johnston would step in as Interim Senior Pastor. Steve Gillen continued on in advisement due to the 2020 coronavirus Pandemic. In April of 2020, the Elder Board of Willow Creek named Dave Dummitt as the new Senior Pastor.https://www.willowcreek.org/en/about/elders-and-leadership/pastoral- search Misconduct allegations and resignations On March 23, 2018, the Chicago Tribune published an article detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by former Senior Pastor Bill Hybels spanning decades, including a prolonged affair with a married woman, though this was retracted by the woman herself. The Tribune wrote that elders of Willow Creek had conducted an internal review of Hybels' behavior which led to no findings of misconduct, leading to the resignations of at least three leaders of the Willow Creek Association‚Äôs board over what they believed to be an insufficient inquiry. All accusations have been denied by Hybels. Hybels had planned to retire in October 2018, to focus his energy on the Willow Creek Association. On April 10, 2018, Hybels announced that he was resigning effective immediately, stating he didn't want to be a distraction to the church's ministry. He also announced he would leave the board of the Willow Creek Association and would no longer lead Willow Creek‚Äôs Global Leadership Summit.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/10/bill- hybels-prominent-megachurch-pastor-resigns-from-willow-creek-following- allegations/ On April 21, 2018, the Chicago Tribune and Christianity Today reported more misconduct allegations not included in the initial investigation. Church elders received reports of other unwanted sexual comments and advances by Hybels that not been previously investigated by the elder board. The elders indicated they would seek wise counsel and work with experts to investigate the allegations, developing a collaborative process.https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2018/april/bill-hybels-willow- creek-promises-investigation-allegations.html On August 5, 2018, The New York Times reported extensively documented allegations of sexual misconduct against a tenth reported victim that were not included in any previous investigations or reports. Co-lead pastor Steve Carter resigned the same day. The entire elder board and co-lead pastor Heather Larson resigned on August 8, 2018 following a joint apology for mishandling the investigation. Includes video of the announcement. On August 13, 2018, the Chicago Tribune reported the church had paid $3.25 million to settle two lawsuits over child sexual abuse by a church volunteer. Despite the settlements, the church denied any negligence in the two cases. In September 2018, Willow Creek Community Church and Willow Creek Association announced the formation of what they called an \\"Independent Advisory Group\\" to investigate the numerous allegations against their founder. Religion News Service reported in December 2018 that the alleged misconduct and admitted mishandling of the allegations had led to a $3 million budget shortfall for 2018, the elimination of 50 full-time positions, a 9% reduction in attendance across all the church's campuses, and a reduction in attendance of at least 15% at its main South Barrington Campus. A six month long independent review of the allegations against Hybels, conducted by 4 evangelical leaders engaged for that purpose and completed in February 2019, found Hybels' accusers credible. In January 2020, the church announced that co-founder Gilbert Bilezikian had \\"engaged in inappropriate behavior\\" after a long time church member alleged he had sexually assaulted her a number of times between 1984 and 1988. Bilezikian denied the accusations and said the church had \\"violated the Bible's teaching on dealing with accusations against fellow Christians.\\" The church Elder Board said they had restricted Bilezikian from serving within the church when allegations were brought to them in 2010, however in 2015 at the church's 40th anniversary he was honored as a \\"living legend\\" of the church. In January 2020, the Elder Response Team said they \\"did restrict him from serving, but the restriction was not adequately communicated, resulting in Dr. Bilezikian serving and teaching in various capacities over the years.\\" In May 2020, Bilezikian filed a defamation lawsuit against the church. Willow Creek Association In 1992, the Willow Creek Association was founded. Timothy J. Demy Ph.D., Paul R. Shockley Ph.D., Evangelical America: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary American Religious Culture, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2017, p. 418 The WCA develops training and leadership conferences and resources for its member churches. The Willow Creek Association is often confused with Willow Creek Community Church, or mistaken for a denomination. However, it is a distinctly separate organization which has close affiliations with Willow Creek Community Church. Since 1995, Willow Creek Association has held an annual leadership summit. Speakers at the summit have included President Bill Clinton. The scandal involving Bill Hybels led to a 36% reduction in revenue for the Willow Creek Association between 2017 and 2018.. Following the end of the 2018 Global Leadership Summit, the name of the Willow Creek Association was changed to the Global Leadership Network.

Since 1932, it has been owned by the Stern family in Switzerland. Patek Philippe is one of the oldest watch manufacturers in the world with an uninterrupted watchmaking history since its founding. It designs and manufactures timepieces as well as movements, including some of the most complicated mechanical watches. The company maintains over 400 retail locations globally and over a dozen distribution centers across Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. In 2001, it opened the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva. Patek Philippe is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious watch manufacturers in the world. Over the years, notable Patek Philippe patrons and timepieces owners include Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II, Pope Pius IX, Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Pablo Picasso, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Leo Tolstoy. As of December 2019, among the world's top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, seven are Patek Philippe watches. In particular, Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 currently holds the title of the most expensive watch (and wristwatch) ever sold at auction (31.19 million US dollars or 31 million CHF), while Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, currently holds the title of the most expensive pocket watch ever sold at auction (24 million US dollars or 23,237,000 CHF). History = Early history = 212x212px Adrien PhilippeAlong with his fellow Czech-born Polish partner Franciszek Czapek, Polish watchmaker Antoni Patek formed Patek, Czapek & Cie in Geneva on May 1, 1839 and started making pocket watches. But eventually they separated due to disagreements and the company was liquidated on April 18, 1845. On May 1, 1845, Czapek founded Czapek & Cie with a new partner, Juliusz Gruzewski. On the other hand, Patek was soon joined by French watchmaker Adrien Philippe, the inventor of the keyless winding mechanism, and continued the watchmaking business with a new company, Patek & Cie, beginning May 15, 1845. On January 1, 1851, the company's name was officially changed to Patek, Philippe & Cie. In the same year, Queen Victoria of Britain acquired a keyless pendant watch at the Great Exhibition in London. The watch was embellished with rose-cut diamonds set in the pattern of a bouquet of flowers. The Queen had another exclusive Patek Philippe timepiece, to be worn pinned to clothing. This watch was suspended from a diamond and enamel brooch.Cf. Patek Philippe website official history timelineTimepieces for Royalty ‚Äì 1850-1910 by Patek Philippe, Geneva : Patek Philippe Museum, 2005. In 1868, Patek Philippe created the first Swiss wristwatch for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary. In March 1877, Antoni Patek passed away at the age of 65, but his only son, L√©on Mecyslas Vincent, did not join the business. As a result, Joseph Antoine B√©nassy-Philippe, one of Adrien Philippe's sons-in-law, succeeded Antoni Patek's position. In 1887, Calatrava Cross became the registered company logo of Patek Philippe. In 1891, the 76-year-old Adrien Philippe handed over his position in the business to his youngest son Joseph Emile Philippe, together with Francois Antoine Conty. Adrien Philippe died in January 1894. = Company restructuring = 1901 saw the transformation of Patek Philippe into a joint- stock company, Ancienne Manufacture d'horlogerie Patek, Philippe & Cie, Soci√©t√© Anonyme, initiated by J. A. B√©nassy-Philippe and Joseph E. Philippe. Still being run a family business, Patek Philippe then had seven shareholders, five of whom formed the board of directors with J. A. B√©nassy-Philippe being the chairman. Joseph E. Philippe's son later joined the company, and he was the last offspring of the founders in the business. In 1915, Albert Einstein ordered a gold pocket watch from Patek Philippe; in that year, he completed his Theory of General Relativity. Patek Philippe has been owned by the Swiss Stern family since 1932, when Charles Stern and Jean Stern acquired the company during the Great Depression. The Stern brothers' company, Fabrique de Cadrans Sterns Fr√®res, had been a business partner of Patek Philippe as its supplier of watch dials. In 1935, Patek Philippe was brought to American markets by New York-based Henri Stern Watch Agency, where it was sold as a sister brand alongside Universal Gen√®ve. In 1958, Henri Stern, the son of Charles Stern, became the president of Patek Philippe. Alan Banbery, who previously designed Universal's \\"Compax\\" movements and worked as a horologist for London's Garrard & Co, would take on the position of Director of Sales in 1965 and later authored official reference books on vintage Patek Philippe pocket watches and chronographs. = Recent development = In 1993, Philippe Stern, the son of Henry Stern, became the president of the company. He initiated the publication of the twice-a-year Patek Philippe Magazine in 1996, which is reserved for the watch owners and has received contributions from various prominent writers including Nobel Laureates Gao Xingjian and Jos√© Saramago. And in 2009, Philippe Stern's son, Thierry Stern, took over the reins from his father in 2010.KPMG, \\"Standing the Test of Time\\", pp.16-18, in Consumer Currents, Issue 5, 2008, KPMG International In 2010, the company produced 40,000 timepieces and, according to Thierry Stern, it produced 58,000 pieces in 2017. In 2018, the number went up to 62,000, and in order to maintain quality and exclusivity, Patek Philippe would only slowly increase the number of timepieces produced each year (by 1-3 percent per year) but with a ceiling. Currently, the company is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH. Since 2000s, Patek Philippe timepieces have repeatedly fetched high prices in auctions worldwide. As of 2018, among the world's top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, seven are Patek Philippe watches, and among the top 58 most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars), 46 are Patek Philippe watches. A small part of the demand for auction pieces is driven by Patek Philippe themselves, as they are purchasing in the auction market to add to the collection of the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.Clerizo, Michael, \\"Watch Auctions: Time Honored: With their mystique, brands like Patek Philippe can command hundreds of thousands of dollars at watch auctions\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 29, 2010Frank, Robert, \\"All That Glitters May Not Be Gold\\", The Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2007  Motto and slogan  One of Patek Philippe's company slogans is \\"You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.\\" The slogan was introduced when the company launched its \\"Generations\\" campaign in 1996.  Watch manufacturing  A pocket watch in the Patek Philippe collection of alt=Patek Philippe manufactures its own watch components. Like other Swiss manufacturers, the company produces mostly mechanical movements with automatic or manual winding mechanism, but has also been producing quartz watches. In fact, Patek Philippe was one of the twenty Swiss watch companies that founded the Centre Electronique Horloger and collaboratively developed the first Swiss quartz movements, such as the Beta 21 movement (1969) which was used by several manufacturers in their watches. In 1950s, the company even produced a prototype for a mechanical digital wristwatch, Ref. 3414. Patek Philippe popularized complications such as perpetual calendar, split-seconds hand, chronograph, and minute repeater in mechanical watches. In 2009, the company announced that all of its future mechanical timepieces would be imprinted with the Patek Philippe Seal which requires a precision of -3/+2 seconds per day for diameters no less than 20 mm and -5/+4 seconds per day for diameters less than 20 mm, surpassing the highest industry standard of watch manufacturing and thus abandoning the Geneva Seal. = Notable inventions and patents = Patek Philippe has invented over 20 basic calibres and has received over 100 patents. The following are some of the important contributions from Patek Philippe to the watchmaking industry. *In 1845, patented keyless winding and hand-setting system, which received a bronze medal at the 1844 Industrial Exposition in Paris. * In 1868, created the first Swiss wristwatch. * In 1881, patented its precision regulator. * In 1889, patented perpetual calendar mechanism for pocket watches. *In 1902, patented double chronograph. *In 1916, produced the world's first lady‚Äôs wristwatch with complication (No. 174 603, a five-minute repeater). *In 1923, launched the world's first split-second chronograph wristwatch (No. 124 8244). *In 1925, created the world's first perpetual calendar wristwatch (No. 97 975), with a compact movement for pendant watches created in 1898. *In 1933, created the Henry Graves Supercomplication, the most complicated mechanical watch in the world (24 complications) until 1989. *In 1949, patented the Gyromax balance. *In 1956, created the world's first all-electronic clock which, in 1958, received the \\"Award for Miniaturization‚Äù in New York. *In 1962, a tourbillon movement achieves the world's still-unbeaten timekeeping precision record for mechanical watches at Geneva Observatory. *In 1986, patented the secular perpetual calendar with retrograde date indication. *In 1989, created the Calibre 89, the most complicated mechanical watch in the world (33 complications) until 2015. * In 1996, patented annual calendar mechanism and introduced the first annual calendar model Ref. 5035. * In 2003/05, launched the annual calendar Ref. 5250, being the world's first watch with silicon- based (the Silinvar alloy) escapement wheel. *In 2006, introduced the silicon- based Spiromax balance spring. *In 2008, introduced the Pulsomax silicon-based escapement. *In 2011, introduced the Oscillomax ensemble, combining the Spiromax balance spring, the Pulsomax escapement, and the GyromaxSi balance. *In 2014, created the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175, one of the world's most complicated wristwatches (20 complications). = Environmental rating = Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Patek Philippe, along with 7 other manufacturers including Audemars Piguet, Breguet and Rolex, was given the lowest environmental rating as \\"Latecomers/Non-transparent\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has taken very few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change. There are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies. Notable models =Most expensive pieces= 285x285px * On November 28, 2012, the Patek Philippe Star Calibre 2000 Ref. 990/1 was sold at Christie's in Hong Kong for a final price of 3.28 million US dollars (HKD 25,300,000), becoming the most expensive timepiece ever auctioned in Asia. The timepiece boasts 21 complications, including Westminster Chimes, minute repeating, lunar orbit and so on, and was made in 2008. * On November 11, 2014, the Henry Graves Supercomplication was sold at Sotheby's Geneva Auction for a record- breaking US$23.98 million (CHF 23,237,000), becoming the most expensive watch ever sold at auction and held the title until November 9, 2019. The Supercomplication was made in 1933 for the prominent banker Henry Graves Jr.. The ultra-complicated pocket watch (having 24 complications) was the result of Graves' friendly horological competition with James Ward Packard. After Graves' death, the watch was held by his daughter, and then by his grandson until 1969, when it was sold to Seth G. Atwood who kept the watch in his renowned \\"Time Museum\\" in Rockford, Illinois until 1999. The watch was auctioned for the first time at Sotheby's in December 1999 for a record- breaking US$11 million to Sheikh Saud Bin Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Thani of the Qatari royal family. * On November 12, 2016, a Patek Philippe Ref. 1518 in steel took the title as the most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction (until October 2017). Sold through Phillips' Geneva auction house, the watch fetched a final price of US$11.14 million (CHF 11,002,000).\\"Most Expensive Wrist Watch Ever Sold? Patek Philippe Ref. 1518\\", Twentytwoten.com, News, 12 Nov 2016 This was the first time that a steel-case Ref. 1518 (only four were made in steel) went for auction; in fact, this piece was the first of the four steel Ref.1518 manufactured, which features a chronograph and perpetual calendar.This $11 Million Patek Philippe Timepiece Is the World's Most Expensive Wristwatch *On November 9, 2019, Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 became the most expensive watch ever sold at auction, fetching US$31 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Christie's Geneva auction. = Calatrava wristwatch = In 1932, Patek Philippe launched the first Calatrava model Ref. 96, which was designed by English horologist David Penney who was influenced by the Bauhaus art movement in Germany. Originally, the Stern brothers, soon after they acquired Patek Philippe in 1932, introduced the Calatrava to help the company pass through the Great Depression smoothly. The original Calatrava Ref. 96 was in production for more than 40 years, and its successor models include Ref. 2526, Ref. 3520, Ref. 5196 and so on. Known for its simple and elegant design, the Calatrava wristwatch has been a flagship model of Patek Philippe since its introduction. Notably, the Calatrava Cross has been company's logo since 1887. = World Time wristwatch = alt= Patek Philippe World Time (Heures Universelles) collection was introduced in 1939, with Ref.1415 being the first model. The \\"World Time\\" complication is able to show the time for all 24 time zones on the same watch and was invented by Swiss watchmaker Louis Cottier in 1930s. Cottier's invention attracted several watchmaking companies, while Patek Philippe was the first company to introduce a series of World Time wristwatches after forging a partnership with Mr. Cottier. The successors to Ref. 1415 include Ref. 2523, Ref. 5230, Ref. 5531 (with minute repeater), and so on. As of 2018, Patek Philippe World Time collection (Ref. 1415, Ref. 2523) holds 6 spots among the 58 world's most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars), with the world record being 4.027 million US dollars (6,603,500 CHF) made at Antiquorum's Geneva auction on April 13, 2002. =Nautilus wristwatch = In 1976, Patek Philippe introduced the Nautilus collection after deciding it was time to produce an exclusive sport watch with finishes of the highest quality. The first model was Ref. 3700 and was made of steel. It was designed by Swiss watchmaker G√©rald Genta, who previously designed the Royal Oak collection for Audemars Piguet, and was released by Patek Philippe during the quartz crisis in the hope that it would help re-attract people's attention to high-end Swiss mechanical watches. The Nautilus collection played a key role in Patek Philippe's overall marketing strategy as it had to refresh the brand image while perpetuating tradition. The target was represented by dynamic business managers of the new generations. The Nautilus wristwatch has become one of the most popular collections from Patek Philippe, and the Ref. 5711 & 5712 models, which the company introduced in 2006 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the collection, are among the most popular models. = Perpetual calendar chronograph = Patek Philippe perpetual calendar chronograph was introduced in 1941, with Ref. 1518 being the first model. On November 12, 2016, a Ref. 1518 in steel became the most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction (until October 2017), fetching a record-breaking US$11.14 million (11,002,000 CHF) in Geneva (through Phillips' auction house). As the successor, Ref. 2499 is widely considered to be one of the greatest watch models in the world. Historically, only 349 pieces of Ref. 2499 were made from 1950 to 1985 - around 9 pieces each year. Over the course of 35 years, four series of Ref. 2499 were introduced, exerting a strong influence on the watch designs of many other renowned watchmakers. As of June 2019, Ref. 2499 holds eleven spots among the 59 world's most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars) and at least 18 pieces of Ref. 2499 have been auctioned for more than 1.5 million US dollars, with the world record being 3.880 million US dollars (3,915,000 CHF) made at Sotheby's Geneva auction on November 13, 2018. The successors to Ref. 2499 include, in chronological order, Ref. 3970, Ref. 5970 and Ref. 5270. = Sky Moon Tourbillon = Patek Philippe Ref. 5002 Sky Moon TourbillonPatek Philippe Sky Moon Tourbillon wristwatch was introduced in 2001, with Ref. 5002 being the first model. The wristwatch has two dials and contains 12 complications including tourbillon, minute repeater, sky chart, and moon phase & orbit. In 2013, the company introduced the second model of Sky Moon Tourbillon, Ref. 6002, also with 12 complications. The new model took 7 years of research and development, while the engraving on each piece alone took more than 100 hours. Sky Moon Tourbillon was the most complicated wristwatch from Patek Philippe until 2014. It is estimated that only 3 - 5 pieces are made each year, and the price for each piece is over US$1.2 million. However, every purchase of the piece requires an application from the buyer and has to be approved by Patek Philippe President Thierry Stern. On October 2, 2018, a Sky Moon Tourbillon 6002G was auctioned by Poly Auction in Hong Kong, fetching US$2.707 million (HKD 21,240,000), making it one of the most expensive watches ever sold in auction. =150th anniversary edition= In 1989, Patek Philippe created Calibre 89, then the most complicated mechanical watch ever made, for its 150th anniversary. Calibre 89 holds 33 complications, including the date of Easter, time of sunrise, equation of time, sidereal time, and many other indicators. 1,728 unique parts allow sidereal time, a 2,800 star chart, and more. In addition, Calibre 89 is able to add a day to February for leap years while leaving out the extra day for every 100 year interval. Only four pieces of Calibre 89 were ever manufactured by Patek Philippe, with one in white gold, one in yellow gold, one in rose gold, and one in platinum. The yellow-gold and the white-gold Calibre 89 were sold at auctions by Antiquorum in 2009 and 2004, respectively, and both watches currently rank among the top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auction, with final prices over 5 million US dollars. = 175th anniversary edition = In 2014, Patek Philippe introduced the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175, the most complicated wristwatch ever built by the manufacturer (with 20 complications, but no tourbillon), to celebrate its 175th anniversary. Only seven pieces of Ref. 5175 were created, with one permanently residing in the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva. The sale price for each of the other six pieces was 2.5 million CHF (2.6 million US dollars). In 2016, Patek Philippe introduced the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300, succeeding the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175. Ref. 6300 also has 20 complications, including grande sonnerie, minute repeater, and alarm with time strike (but without tourbillon), with the sale price over 2.2 million US dollars. The purchase of each piece requires an application from the buyer and has to be approved by Patek Philippe President Thierry Stern.

This watch is now kept in the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva. Before that, Einstein had a possibly German-made, unknown-brand pocket watch (circa 1900), which was auctioned by Christie's for GBP 266,500 in London on July 13, 2016. In addition, Einstein also owned two timepieces from Longines, one 1943 silver pocket watch and one 1929 gold wristwatch. His Longines wristwatch, which was presented to him by Rabbi Edgar Magnin in 1931, was auctioned by Antiquorum for US$596,000 in New York on October 16, 2008, making it the most expensive Longines' timepiece ever sold at auction. His Longines pocket watch is now kept in the Bern Historical Museum in Switzerland.

He is the founding and former senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, one of the most attended churches in North America, with an average attendance of nearly 24,000 as of late 2018. He is the founder of the Willow Creek Association and creator of the Global Leadership Summit. Hybels is also an author of a number of Christian books, especially on the subject of Christian leadership. Previously slated to step down in October 2018, Hybels retired early after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him, though he has denied all allegations. A six- month long independent review found the allegations to be credible. Early life and education Hybels was born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He is Dutch-American and was a regular participant in the Christian Reformed Church in North America which holds to Calvinist Theology. Hybel's father was an entrepreneur in wholesale produce whose work ethic was the model for his son. In a 2006 interview with the Chicago Tribune, he pointed to an experience at a Wisconsin summer camp as a teenager that crystallized his understanding and personal embrace of Christian belief. Hybels holds a bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies from Trinity International University, near Chicago, and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from TIU's college. Willow Creek Community Church In the early 1970s, Hybels was studying at Trinity International University (then called Trinity College) when Gilbert Bilezikian, a lecturer, challenged the class about an Acts 2-based church. Hybels was captivated with the vision and abandoned his business aspirations for ministry. In 1971, Hybels‚Äîthen serving as youth pastor at South Park Church in Park Ridge, Illinois‚Äîstarted a youth group with friend Dave Holmbo called 'Son City'.Journal/ASCG Vol.11, Spg 2000 - Reid News at Willow Creek Community Church Modern music, dramatic skits and multimedia were combined with Bible studies in relevant language, and the group grew from 25 to 1,200 in just three years. After 300 youth waited in line to be led to Christ in a service in May 1974, Hybels and other leaders began dreaming of forming a new church. They surveyed the community to find out why people weren't coming to church. Common answers included: \\"church is boring\\", \\"they're always asking for money\\", or \\"I don't like being preached down to.\\" These answers shaped the group's approach to the new church. On October 12, 1975, the group held its first service at Willow Creek Theater in Palatine, Illinois. One hundred and twenty-five people attended the service. The rent and other costs were paid for with 1,200 baskets of tomatoes, sold door-to-door by 100 teenagers. Hybels spoke on \\"New Beginnings.\\" Within two years, the church had grown to 2,000. Challenges in 1979 led to a recommissioning of the church's vision to be broader and deeper than before. Hybels apologized for the example of his relentless schedule and overemphasis on grace. \\"We've set up all our leadership structures and goals to grow a full functioning Acts 2 community, as opposed to just an evangelizing machine that doesn't drive the roots down deep and do all the other things it's supposed to do.\\"Rediscovering Church, Bill and Lynne Hybels (Zondervan, 1997) In 1981, the church moved to its current location in South Barrington. By 2000, six services were being held each weekend for 15,000 attendees in a building.Willow Creek Community Church In 2004, a new Worship Center was opened. With a capacity of more than 7,000, the state-of-the-art auditorium is one of the largest theaters in the United States. In 2017, the church averaged 25,000 attendees per week, making it the eighth largest church in America, according to Outreach 100. In September 2018, Religion News Service reported attendance was down 9% across all campuses, following scandal involving founder Bill Hybels and resignation of the entire senior leadership team. On July 1, 2010, Hybels introduced President Barack Obama for a speech on immigration reform. Hybels was not heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of the church between mid-2006 to 2008. Gene Appel served as lead pastor of the South Barrington Campus from mid-2006 until Easter 2008. Appel's role allowed Hybels the ability to serve a more direct role in the Willow Creek Association. The Global Leadership Summit Hybels started the Global Leadership Summit (hosted by the Global Leadership Network (GLN) (rebranded from Willow Creek Association in 2018)) in 1995 as an annual training event for leaders to sharpen their skills. The summit telecasts live from the campus of Willow Creek Community Church, with 118,000 people watching via livestream at host sites across the U.S. in 2018, and hundreds of thousands more later watching via video in countries around the world.Chu, Jeff How Willow Creek Is Leading Evangelicals by Learning from the Business World Fast Company December 6, 2010 The Summit lost more than 100 host sites and tens of thousands of viewers in 2018 following the Hybels' scandal. Misconduct allegations and resignation On March 23, 2018, the Chicago Tribune published an article detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by Hybels spanning decades. The article reported that Hybels had engaged in a prolonged affair with a married woman; however, this allegation was retracted by the woman herself. The Tribune wrote that the elders of Willow Creek had conducted an internal review of Hybels' behavior which led to no findings of misconduct; following this report, at least three leaders of the Willow Creek Association board reportedly resigned their posts because they believed the inquiry to have been insufficient. All accusations have been denied by Hybels. Hybels had planned to retire in October 2018 to focus his energy on the Willow Creek Association. On April 10, 2018, Hybels announced that he was resigning, effective immediately, stating he did not want to be a distraction to the church's ministry. He also announced that he would leave the board of the Willow Creek Association and would no longer lead Willow Creek's Global Leadership Summit. On April 21, 2018, the Chicago Tribune and Christianity Today reported further misconduct allegations which were not part of the initial investigation. In response, the Willow Creek elders stated their intent to examine reports regarding \\"allegations that have not been previously investigated by the Elder Board.\\" The elders said they would seek wise counsel and work with experts, developing a collaborative process. Despite its initial denial and defense of Hybels, the Willow Creek Board of Elders released a statement on May 9, 2018, as part of their second investigation into allegations against him; the statement indicated that the Board \\"[does] not believe the stories were all lies or that all the [accusers] were colluding against him.\\" On August 5, 2018, The New York Times published allegations from a former employee of Hybels, who alleges that he repeatedly sexually harassed and assaulted her in the 1980s, including fondling her breasts and obtaining oral sex. The complainant only came forward after hearing of the other allegations against Hybels, but crucially had contemporaneous evidence of her allegations from people that she confided in at the time. Hybels denied the allegations. On August 7, 2018, Steve Carter, one of the two lead pastors who would have taken over leadership at Willow Creek and who had publicly defended Hybels on two prior occasions, tendered his resignation, citing the untenable position he was in given the church's inadequate attention to the matter once Hybels' history of misconduct became known. The following day, on the eve of the Global Leadership Summit, Heather Larson, the other lead pastor, also resigned, and the members of the elder board all stated they would step down by the end of the year. Steve Gillen, lead pastor of Willow Creek's North Shore campus, assumed interim leadership. The church undertook a process to replace the elder board, and announced on January 19, 2019 that a new elder board had been installed. In March 2019, The Washington Post reported that a six-month independent review by four evangelical leaders found the misconduct allegations against Hybels to be credible. The reviewers asserted that were Hybels still pastor at Willow Creek, disciplinary action would be required.https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/03/01/independent- report-finds-allegations-against-willow-creek-founder-bill-hybels-are-credible In January 2020, the church announced that Hybels' mentor, Gilbert Bilezikian had also engaged in \\"inappropriate behavior\\" after a church member alleged he had sexually assaulted her over a number of years.

Critics responded very positively to the Armani/Casa label calling the style \\"simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements\\" to it.

Director Don Siegel shot tests with Presley wearing dark contact lenses but decided that they detracted from Presley's acting too much and discarded them. Fox insisted on the addition of four songs. \\"We aren't courageous enough to present him without any songs at all,\\" said Weisbart. \\"We've spotted them [the songs] where they'd come in naturally,\\" said Weisbart. \\" At a frontier party, at an encampment, and during a horseback ride over the plains.\\" Fox wanted a theme song, so Huffaker changed the title to Black Star, which he felt would be more fitting for a song than Flaming Lance would be.

He told Johnson that Presley was cast and wanted know if Johnson objected to Huffaker having credit on the script. \\"I'd always objected to that, but I couldn't say no to the guy,\\" said Johnson. \\"He didn't do anything, as he admitted.

Parts of the film were shot in Delle, Lonerock and Skull Valley in Utah. Filming also took place at Conejo Ranch in Thousand Oaks, California. Barbara Steele, originally signed to play the love interest, was replaced during filming by Barbara Eden after studio executives decided that Steele's British accent was too pronounced, though Steele claims that she had quit. Soundtrack Reception =Box office= The film was released only one month after G.I. Blues but did not achieve the same degree of box-office success, reaching number 12 on the Variety box- office survey for the year. =Critical receptions= The film received generally positive reviews, with a few critics lauding Presley's performance and noting his improvement as an actor. A. H. Weiler of The New York Times praised the film as \\"an unpretentious but sturdy Western that takes the time, the place and the people seriously.\\" Variety called the plot \\"disturbingly familiar and not altogether convincing, but the film, attractively mounted and consistently diverting, will entertain and absorb the audience it is tailored for.\\" Harrison's Reports graded it \\"Very good,\\" calling Presley \\"believable\\" and John McIntire \\"a powerful figure.\\" Charles Stinson of the Los Angeles Times appraised the film as \\"standard for its type ‚Äî the half-breed tragedy ‚Äî but done well enough to head a program double bill.\\" Stinson wrote of Presley that \\"he seems to be improving noticeably with every film. He has, of course, rather a distance yet to go to dramatic power and polish. But 'Flaming Star' and 'G.I. Blues' are a long way up from 'Jailhouse Rock.'\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post criticized the film for \\"flat, one-syllable dialogue\\" and \\"ruthless predictability,\\" though he found some of the outdoor shots \\"handsome.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that although the film \\"never really gets beyond the comic strip weepie stage,\\" director Siegel \\"has managed to communicate considerable excitement through flashes of imaginative cutting and handsome composition, notably in the first Indian attack, and in some realistically staged fight, chase and battle passages ... But Siegel's main achievement is his direction of Elvis Presley, still basically not an actor, but no longer a joke as a screen personality. Given the full, virile build-up, he plays the half-breed with a brooding presence that is surprisingly effective.\\" Johnson eventually saw the film and said he \\"liked it very much.\\" He thought Siegel \\"did a first-rate job and also Presley did.\\"Johnson p 129 Quentin Tarantino later called the film \\"a truly great fifties western, and maybe the most brutally violent American western of its era.\\" =Effect on some African countries and territories= According to an Associated Press report from Johannesburg dated May 31, 1961, South Africans were initially not permitted to see the film. The government, which had strict laws to keep the races separate, banned the picture that same day because Presley \\"played the son of an American Indian woman and a white man.\\" A day later, 20th Century Fox appealed, convincing the South Africa Board of Censors to lift the ban as long as it would not be shown to the country's indigenous population. The film then opened to segregated theaters, starting in Durban in early June. However, it was permanently banned in cinemas in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as colonial government officials in those British territories were concerned that the movie could reignite racial tensions in the aftermath of the recent Mau Mau uprising. =Artistic legacy/Andy Warhol silkscreens= A publicity still from the film was used by Andy Warhol to create several silkscreens, among them numerous versions of \\"Single Elvis\\", \\"Double Elvis\\" and \\"Elvis I and I\\" and \\"Eight Elvises\\", as well as at least four \\"Triple Elvis\\" paintings and \\"Elvis Times Eleven\\", which is currently housed at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Sales generated by at least ten of these silkscreens from the single publicity still through auction houses or in private sales are, as of June 2019, in excess of $345 million. Home media The film was released on videocassette by Key Video in February 1985 as part of the release of 11 videos to mark the 50th anniversary of Presley's birth.

A traffic ticket is a notice issued by a law enforcement official to a motorist or other road user, indicating that the user has violated traffic laws. Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a moving violation, such as exceeding the speed limit, or a non-moving violation, such as a parking violation, with the ticket also being referred to as a parking citation, or parking ticket. In some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a fine or deduction of points, has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to prosecution or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and summons to appear at traffic court, with a determination of guilt to be made only in court. Australia In Australia, traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the Australian Road Rules. =New South Wales= Traffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) in NSW. The Roads and Maritime Services (formerly Roads and Traffic Authority) of NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver's licence in NSW, including the driver's traffic history and registered motor vehicles. * Owner issued infringements The Roads and Maritime Services maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, speed cameras and red light cameras across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices. These tickets are deemed to be 'owner onus' tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration. * Driver issued infringements These are generally issued 'on the spot' by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringements such as Roads and Maritime Services heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Councils or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required. In NSW all Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN's) are part of the Self- Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through Australia Post, this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have plead guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver's licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court. If the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence. Upon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid. Under the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken. If the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees. Canada =Outline of traffic offences= A speeding warning sign on Highway QEW in Ontario warning of a $10,000 fine, a roadside suspension, and a roadside vehicle seizure if the speed exceeded 50 km/h over the speed limit. In Canada, most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal Criminal Code. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, drinking and driving may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers. Each province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so. If the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain. If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter. If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's point system. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving. = The Demerit Point System in Ontario = In the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually \\"lose\\" points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur. For a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù letter. At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended. If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended. At 15 or more points, a driver's licence will be suspended for 30 days. Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years. India Traffic violations in India are listed out in the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. The state government has the rights to decide on the officials who are to do traffic rule enforcement and how traffic citations are issued. Generally the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and Traffic Police (which is part of the general law and order police force) are allowed to book traffic violations. Officers of and above the rank of Asst. Motor Vehicle Inspector (A.MVI) and Sub-Inspector in charge of the Traffic Police wing have the right to levy on-the-spot fines from the violators. This is known as compounding an offence. Fines would be paid on the spot and a Challan (receipt) would be given to the driver. Off late officers on Highway Police duty are also authorised to levy spot fines... Other officers issue a Vehicle Check report which lists out the violations noticed on the driver or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a Postal Money order (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet would be in the court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a summary trial (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts). For drivers who drive under the influence of liquor or other narcotic substance, on-the-spot fine cannot be levied. The driver would be taken to a hospital and a medical report made out. The accused should appear in court. A driver can also insist that he/she would not be paying the fine at the spot and the case have to be heard in the magistrate's court. In such a case the Police officer should issue a notice for appearance in the court. In the city of Kolkata, certain traffic violations such as breaking a red light results in traffic police sending a ticket to the driver's home address. The ticket has to be paid to a state or central bank. Indian Police forces do not have mobile credit card readers, so the fine is generally paid in cash. Ireland In the Republic of Ireland, a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime ‚Äî traffic offences are all criminal offences ‚Äî has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the Garda S√≠och√°na within 28 days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56 days, the driver will not be prosecuted for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry penalty points as well as the fine. Scandinavia Most of Scandinavia determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland's system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a \\"reasonable\\" amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15 mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500. In 2002, a Nokia executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75 km/h (47 mph) in a 50 km/h (31 mph) zone on his motorcycle.Pinsker, Joe (March 2015). Finland, Home of the $103,000 Speeding Ticket. The AtlanticNokia boss gets record speeding fine (January 2002), BBC Estonia (across the Baltic from Scandinavia) is experimenting with a \\"time out\\" in lieu of fines: the motorist waits at the side of the road for 45 minutes or an hour. United States A parking ticket issued in Washington, D.C. in 2011. Checker giving a parking ticket, Seattle Washington, 1960. In the United States, most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as infractions, civil charges or criminal charges. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments. =Traffic violations= What constitutes a \\"minor violation\\" or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions. In contrast, for more \\"serious\\" violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a misdemeanor or even a felony. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property. A frequently used penalty is a fine, and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case. =Contesting a ticket= If the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request.See, e.g., The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court. At any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorists may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction. Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.See, e.g., The motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer's absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge. Although each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court. If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter. In some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a jury trial, in which case a jury will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a verdict. The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to \\"get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist\\", and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued. In Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer's live appearance in court. California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration. Some states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court. For example, California's Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance. =Driving records= Each state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged‚Äîa plea of guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket. If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state's point system. If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the Non-Resident Violator Compact. If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place. =Ticket fixing= The practice of ticket fixing by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a \\"professional courtesy\\" to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.Ticket-fixing probe rocks Georgia. Henderdson Times-News. September 17, 1986. Ticket superlatives There are many competing claims as to the first speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first paper ticket ever issued. Great Britain may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at in a zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs. A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In Dayton, Ohio, police issued a paper ticket to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904. Another early speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit. The fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of on a Honda Fireblade motorcycle in 2000. He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years. The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre Porsche 911 Turbo at on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10 weeks and banned from driving for 3 years. The most expensive speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in Helsinki, Finland, in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80 km/h in a 40 km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender's last known income. Salonoja's speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.BBC world, Finn's speed fine is a bit rich.

The show is a mixture of stand-up, sketches and songs hosted by Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. The show used to feature regular appearances by Jon Holmes, Laura Shavin (earlier series had Emma Kennedy, or occasionally Sue Perkins, for the female voices), a monologue by Marcus Brigstocke, and music by Mitch Benn, Pippa Evans or Adam Kay, but now features a much wider range of contributors. Most episodes will feature a special guest. Past guests include Robin Ince, Rory Bremner, Dave Gorman, Simon Munnery, Al Murray, Andy Zaltzman, Paul Sinha, Richard Stilgoe, Dr Phil Hammond, Barry Cryer, John Finnemore, Andy Parsons, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton, Grace Petrie, Sarah Kendall and Francesca Martinez. Jon Culshaw has featured on the 2004 and 2005 Christmas editions and also starred in the 2008 Christmas edition. Guests have also stood in for absent cast members. The series is a successor to the early 1990s topical comedy show The Mary Whitehouse Experience, in which Punt and Dennis were a key part, although its origins lie with the short-lived Live on Arrival from 1988. The programme first aired on 26 September 1998. Repeats of The Now Show can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Extra. In October 2016, long-running cast member Jon Holmes reported that he had been fired because 'the BBC want to recast with more women and diversity.' Broadcast and podcast The programme is recorded in front of a studio audience on the Thursday evening before the Friday broadcast. On Friday 22 July 2005, The Now Show was broadcast without a studio audience due to the attempted 21 July 2005 London Bombings. The show's then regular venue, The Drill Hall was close to the site of one of the failed bomb attacks and had been cordoned off by police; as such the show had to be recorded in the Radio 4 studios at Broadcasting House. Hugh Dennis opened the show with the words \\"with us are Laura Shavin, Jon Holmes, Marcus Brigstocke and Mitch Benn... and no audience\\". The 18th series, running from April to May 2006, was the first Radio 4 comedy series to be made available on podcast, as part of a trial, or to be downloaded directly from the BBC Radio 4 web page, both for seven days after broadcast. The podcast had some of the music (from outside sources) cut because of restrictions due to artist royalties (although a new joke was inserted in place of the music, such as \\"Don't worry, it'll be over in a minute\\", or rants about the BBC's lawyers), although the complete show could still be heard for seven days after the broadcast on the BBC's listen again feature. This podcast was the fourth most popular podcast in August 2006, according to Schott's Almanac. However, due to the end of the trial, the 22nd series, running from June to August 2007, was not available for download. The podcast has returned, as part of the \\"Friday Night Comedy\\" podcast, alternating with The News Quiz.  The Vote Now Show  A version of the show entitled The Vote Now Show has been broadcast in the run-up to the 2010, 2015 UK general elections and 2017 UK general elections. The format is broadly the same, incorporating many of the show's regular performers and an additional political guest interviewed by Punt and Dennis. The episodes are more frequent than usual and the programme is transmitted at 11pm on the day of recording, so it can incorporate that day's campaign news to make it more topical. The first series had three programmes a week on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, in 2015 it was twice weekly (Mondays and Fridays). Clips of politicians are more likely to feature, as the broadcasting restrictions for House of Commons footage do not apply to election events.  The Now Show 2012 Live  During the London 2012 Olympics a similar run of six live programmes based on the ongoing events entitled The Now Show 2012 Live was broadcast. Reception The Now Show was voted as the \\"Best British Radio Panel Show/Satire\\" for 2008 in The Comedy.co.uk Awards. In March 2009, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis were criticised for comparing the planned comeback of 1980s pop star Michael Jackson with that of the IRA. Books and merchandise Punt and Dennis, together with Holmes and other cast members, published two books, The Now Show Book and The Now Show Book of World Records. A collection of four episodes of the series from 2002 were released on CD and audio cassette on 29 July 2002. A further collection of highlights from the 2004‚Äì2005 series was released for download through Audible.com and iTunes.

For example, one Slashdot article describes time sinks as \\"gameplay traps intended to waste your time and keep you playing longer\\".Slashdot: \\"EverQuest: What You Really Get From an Online Game\\", 27 December 2002. In most games, boring and lengthy parts of gameplay are merely an annoyance, but when used in subscription-based MMORPGs, where players are paying recurring fees for access to the game, they become a much more inflammatory issue. Game designers must be prudent in balancing efforts to produce both involving gameplay and the length of content that players expect. Time sinks are often associated with hardcore games, though whether this is a positive or negative association depends on the context. =Trade-offs= Implementing time sinks in a video game is a delicate balancing act. Excessive use of time sinks may cause players to stop playing. However, if not enough time sinks are implemented, players may feel the game is too short or too easy, causing them to abandon the game much sooner out of boredom. A number of criteria can be used to evaluate use of time sinks, such as frequency, length, and variety (both of the nature of the time sink and the actions taken to overcome it). What is considered a good balance depends in part on the type of game in question. Casual games are often expected to have less in the way of time sinks, and hardcore games to have more, though this is not a hard and fast rule.

He was born, and died, in Carpentras in the south of France, and was the heir to an estate, which he used to finance the publication of his unusual memoirs. He is remembered chiefly for his lengthy autobiography, Les farfadets ou Tous les d√©mons ne sont pas de l'autre monde (\\"The Imps; or, All the demons are not from the other world\\"), originally published in three volumes between 1818 and 1820. The book was handsomely illustrated by a series of lithographs whose originals were sketched by Berbiguier himself. frontispiece to Berbiguier's book. He has surrounded himself with the tools of his exercises: sulphur in the shape of a cross, thyme, a bull's heart pierced with thorns, and pins and needles. Struggle with the farfadets This autobiography recounts Berbiguier's lifelong struggle with farfadets, \\"imps\\" or \\"goblins\\". He relates that these imps harassed him persistently ever since his unfortunate encounter with two \\"sibyls\\", or fortune tellers, whom he consulted in an idle moment in his youth. For this sin, he was delivered into the hands of impish tormentors. The imps continued to follow Berbiguier through several lengthy stays in Avignon and Paris. The chief imp among his tormentors was named Rhotomago; Rhotomago's immediate superior was Beelzebub himself. He alleged that he received, and answered, written correspondence from all of these Hellish dignitaries. By research and experiment Berbiguier determined a number of herbal and other remedies that had the power to keep the imps in check. He wrote his book, he relates, to reveal his struggles and his methods to the world. In an eloquent if presumptuous dedication, he addresses himself to: A TOUS LES EMPEREURS, ROIS, PRINCES, SOUVERAINS DES QUATRES PARTIES DU MONDE Sires, P√®res des peuples, qui repr√©sentez sur la terre de Dieu de Paix et de consolation, qui est dans le ciel, r√©unissez vos efforts aux miens pour d√©truire l'influence des D√©mons, Sorciers et Farfadets, qui d√©solent les malheureux habitants de vos Etats. Vous voyez √† vos pieds le plus infortun√© des hommes; les tourments auxquels je suis en lutte depuis plus de vingt-trois ans sont les plus beaux titres que je puisse avoir √† un de vos regards paternels. Ah ! Il y a d√©j√† longtemps que les pers√©cutions diaboliques des Farfadets auraient eu un terme sur la terre, si quelqu'un de vos sujets avait eu le courage de vous les d√©voiler. C'est pour les d√©masquer que je vous d√©die mon ouvrage; vous ne serez pas insensibles √† mes tourments, vous les ferez cesser d√®s qu'ils vous seront connus. ::TO ALL THE EMPERORS, KINGS, PRINCES, AND SOVEREIGNS OF THE FOUR PARTS OF THE WORLD ::Milords, ::Fathers of nations, you who represent the heavenly God of peace and consolation on earth, unite your efforts to my own to destroy the power of Demons, Witches, and Imps, that devastate the unhappy dwellers of your countries. You see at your feet the most unfortunate of men; the torments with which I have struggled for these twenty-five years are the best titles that I can bear before your paternal gaze. ::Ah! The diabolical persecutions of the Imps would have long since been ended on Earth, had one of your subjects had the courage to reveal them to you. It is in order to unmask them that I have dedicated my work to you, that you may not be heedless to my torments, and that you will work to end them now that they are known to you. The autobiography relates Berbiguier's struggles with the imps. He was able to capture some of them, and confine them in bottles. Sulphur and thyme were two odours he found were effective to repel them. The book tells of an adventure he had with firefighters during a sojourn in Paris, where he attracted the alarmed notice of neighbours by burning sulphur to keep the imps at bay. Notwithstanding his efforts, the imps continued to tempt and torment him. The title de Terre-Neuve du Thym was self-bestowed; it means \\"of the New World of Thyme,\\" and shows his hope that revealing his methods will renew the world and purge it of impish influences. He also bestowed upon himself the style Le Fl√©au des Farfadets, \\"the Scourge of the Imps.\\" Psychiatric interpretation Imps torment Berbiguier in his bed. As a result of these activities, he eventually was committed to the Hospice de la Salp√™tri√®re under the care of Dr Philippe Pinel, a pioneer of psychotherapy; he was eventually released. Pinel was unable to achieve much for him, and appears in the book as a servant of the imps. An ultimate improvement in Berbiguier's mental state may be indicated by a report that he attempted to round up and destroy the surviving copies of his book, which as a result are quite scarce. Literary interpretations Raymond Queneau and Andr√© Blavier considered Berbiguier to be a fou litt√©raire, a \\"literary madman,\\" or rather, the literary equivalent of outsider art in France.Raymond Queneau, Aux Confins des T√©n√®bres, les Fous litt√©raires, (Gallimard, Les Cahiers de la NRF, Paris, 2002); Andr√© Blavier, Les fous litt√©raires, (√âditions des Cendres, Paris, 2000) (reprint). Th√©ophile Gautier used Berbiguier as a model for his fantastic story, Onuphrius; ou les vexations fantastiques d'un admirateur d'Hoffmann, and Gustave Flaubert similarly consulted Berbiguier's work for his tale of Bouvard et P√©cuchet.

He lent his name to several structures, including the foramina of Luschka, Luschka's crypts, Luschka's joints, and Ducts of Luschka. His name is also associated with Luschka's law, an anatomical rule concerning location of the ureters.Retrograde Ureteroscopy: Handbook of Endourology edited by Petrisor Aurelian Geavlete Luschka began studying medicine, initially pharmacology, in 1841 at the University of Freiburg and the University of Heidelberg. In 1845 he became an assistant to Louis Stromeyer in Freiburg, then moved in 1849 to the University of T√ºbingen, where he was a lecturer and associate professor until being appointed a full professor of anatomy in 1855. A manuscript copy of lectures on surgical anatomy that he gave in T√ºbingen forms part of the Manchester Medical Manuscripts Collection held by special collections at the University of Manchester with the reference MMM/23/211. He gained a noble title and began using von in his name in 1865. His work particularly concerned the need for anatomy to be connected in a practical manner to medicine and surgery. His Anatomie des Menschen in R√ºcksicht auf das Bed√ºrfnis der praktischen Heilkunde (1862‚Äì69; \\"Human Anatomy in Consideration of the Needs of Practical Medicine\\") aimed to provide such a link. He promoted the use of anatomical information in surgery, for example to manipulate internal organs using long needles before cutting the body open, and was one of the first to conduct detailed research on normal corpses (rather than only diseased or anomalous ones), publishing a series of detailed books covering specific aspects of anatomy, such as the nerves of the hands and the blood vessels of the brain.

It is one of the oldest city festivals in England, having been held since 1824 and tracing its roots back further to 1772. It was initially conceived as a fundraiser for the Norfolk & Norwich Hospital. For most of its history was a purely classical musical festival which saw performances by many famous artistes, composers and conductors. In recent years the festival has moved away from this focus, and has diversified to include a variety of circus, performance, contemporary music, dance, visual arts and children's events.Norfolk & Norwich Festival Today Norfolk & Norwich Festival is an arts organisation based in Norwich, England which is primarily responsible for the eponymous international arts festival held annually each May, with events also held throughout the wider county of Norfolk. The Festival organisation works on creative learning schemes across Norfolk with support from Arts Council England and Norwich and Norfolk councils and has received funding to become a \\"bridge organisation\\" for Arts Council England from 2012. Origins The festival was established as a triennial event in 1824 to support the ongoing construction of the Norfolk & Norwich Hospital, and grew out of earlier musical fundraisers for the hospital dating back as far as 1772 including the annual performance of an oratorio at Norwich Cathedral.A. D. Bayne, A comprehensive history of Norwich, Jarrold and sons, 1869, chapter XXII In its early days, the festival was mainly held in St. Andrew's Hall and St Peter Mancroft. These events consisted primarily of oratorios and other large scale choral works performed by the Norwich Festival Chorus, then 300 strong. Noted premieres from this time included The Last Judgement by the German Romantic composer and conductor Louis Spohr. 20th century The triennial festival continued to develop a reputation throughout the Victorian and Edwardian period, and saw the premieres of significant classical works including Edward Elgar's Sea Pictures in 1899 (sung by Clara Butt), E. J. Moeran's Rhapsody No. 2 for the 1924 centenary concert (based on a Norfolk folksong), Frank Bridge's Enter Spring in 1927, Ralph Vaughan Williams's Job: A Masque for Dancing in 1930, Arthur Bliss's Morning Heroes also in 1930 and Benjamin Britten's Our Hunting Fathers in 1936. An oft-recounted story from the 1936 festival is of Vaughan Williams's intervention to stop the orchestra mocking the 22-year-old Britten's work. Vaughan Williams told them they were \\"in the presence of greatness\\" (referring to the young composer) and that if they did not want to play Britten's work they would not play his (Vaughan Williams was premiering his own Five Tudor Portraits at the same festival). As a musical festival, it also attracted prestigious musical directors including Sir Henry Wood, Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Norman Del Mar and Vernon Handley. The festival became an annual event in 1989 following an agreement with directors of Festival Norwich (FN). FN was started in 1986 as the first annual festival of arts and music in Norfolk devoted to organising a wide range of activities embracing art, music and industry in Norfolk. The directors of the Triennial were approached with the proposal that FN would run for two consecutive years with the Triennial continuing every third year. However, the Triennial decided that it should be an annual event itself and it was agreed that in this case FN would cease functioning after only three years. Under the direction of Marcus Davey, now director of The Roundhouse in London, the scope of the festival was changed from classical music to cater for a larger variety of music, theatre, dance and other visual arts. As part of the widening of the festival's scope, a new art initiative called \\"First Norfolk and Norwich Festival Visual Arts Week\\" was begun in 1994, which has now evolved into Norfolk & Norwich Open Studios, an open gallery event. 21st century A significant change in 2001 was the moving of the festival from October to May. From 2004 to 2010 it was under the direction of Jonathan Holloway, now Artistic Director of the Melbourne Festival in Australia. During the years Jonathan was Artistic Director and Chief Executive of the Norfolk & Norwich Festival, audiences increased by 1,000%, turnover more than quadrupled and the Festival took over delivery of Creative Partnerships in Norfolk, part of the UK flagship creativity in schools programme. Composers who visited the Festival during this period include Philip Glass, Ute Lemper, Michael Nyman, John Cale and Laurie Anderson, Terry Riley, Ray Davies and David Bedford have also performed at the festival. The 2010 programme featured the Michael Clark Company, 7 doigts de la main, Ontroerend Goed, Nofit State Circus, Circus Ronaldo and Forced Entertainment (amongst others) and 2011 featured Artichoke's Dining with Alice, Chouf Ouchouf, Mariano Pensotti, Mariza and Kronos Quartet among others. Recent musical commissions include Dan Jones's Music For Seven Ice Cream Vans. Holloway was succeeded by William Galinsky, formerly the organiser of the Cork Midsummer Festival in Ireland.New Festival Director & Chief Executive William Galinsky's appointment, BBC News In October 2017, it was announced that Daniel Brine would be taking over as Festival Director. Creative partnerships and bridge schemes The Festival was the main East Anglian participant in the creative learning schools' programme, working with 49 Norfolk schools. The Creative Partnerships scheme has been cut by the government, but from 2012/13 the Festival will receive a total of ¬£1.35 million annually from Arts Council England to enable it to become a bridge organisation for developing arts opportunities for children and young people, acting as a bridge between the arts and education sectors.Arts Council Bridge Organisations Briefing, Arts Council England 2011 Directors * Sir Henry Wood (1908‚Äì1930) * Sir Thomas Beecham (1936 ‚Äì * Norman Del Mar * Vernon Handley * Richard Philips * Heather Newell * Marcus Davey * Jonathan Holloway (2004‚Äì2010) * William Galinsky (2011 ‚Äì 2017) * Daniel Brine (2017-present) References  External links  *Norfolk and Norwich Festival Culture in Norwich Arts festivals in the United Kingdom Festivals in Norfolk Festivals established in 1824 ","title":"Norfolk and Norwich Festival"},{"id":"985142","text":" Fran√ßois Magendie (6 October 1783 - 7 October 1855) was a French physiologist, considered a pioneer of experimental physiology. He is known for describing the foramen of Magendie. There is also a Magendie sign, a downward and inward rotation of the eye due to a lesion in the cerebellum. Magendie was a faculty at the College of France, holding the Chair of Medicine from 1830 to 1855 (he was succeeded by Claude Bernard, who worked previously as his assistant). In 1816 he published Pr√©cis √©lementaire de Physiologie which described an experiment first illustrating the concept of empty calories:Ira Wolinsky (1997) Nutrition in Exercise and Sport, 3rd edition, page 22, CRC Press :I took a dog of three years old, fat, and in good health, and put it to feed upon sugar alone...It expired the 32nd day of the experiment. His most important contribution to science was also his most disputed. Contemporaneous to Sir Charles Bell, Magendie conducted a number of experiments on the nervous system, in particular verifying the differentiation between sensory and motor nerves in the spinal cord, the so-called Bell-Magendie law. This led to an intense rivalry, with the British claiming that Bell published his discoveries first and that Magendie stole his experiments. The intensity of this scientific rivalry perhaps can only be compared to that between Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Magendie was also a notorious vivisector, shocking even many of his contemporaries with the live dissections that he performed at public lectures in physiology. Richard Martin, an Irish MP, in introducing his famous bill banning animal cruelty in the United Kingdom, described Magendie's public dissection of a greyhound, in which the beast was nailed down ear and paw, half the nerves of its face dissected then left overnight for further dissection, calling Magendie a \\"disgrace to Society.\\" There was a belief among British physicians, even those who defended animal experimentation, that Magendie purposely subjected his experimental animals to needless torture. A Quaker once visited him, questioning him about vivisection; according to Anne Fagot-Largeau's inaugural lesson at the College of France, he responded with much patience, argumenting the reasons of animal experimentation.Anne Fagot- Largeau's inaugural lesson at the College of France Besides drawing sharp criticism from contemporaries in both Britain and France, later scientists critical of Magendie's methods included Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley.

He accompanied Leif on his voyage of discovery around the year 1000, and is portrayed as an older male servant. He is referred to as ‚Äúfoster father‚Äù by Leif Ericson, which may indicate he was a freed thrall, who once had the responsibility of looking after and rearing the young Leif. Leif and his company wintered in the New World after building Leifsbudir (Leif‚Äôs dwellings), perhaps somewhere in Newfoundland or the adjacent area. According to the saga, he divided his men into two parties, which took turns in exploring the surrounding area. He cautioned his followers to keep together and return to sleep at their quarters. One evening Tyrker did not return with his party. Greatly distraught, Leif, at the head of twelve men, went in search of him, and he had not gone far when he discovered the old thrall, greatly excited, gesticulating wildly, and evidently drunk. ‚ÄúWhy, my fosterer,‚Äù cried Leif, ‚Äúhave you come so late? What made you leave your companions!‚Äù Tyrker answered in his own language, but when remembering that the Norsemen could not understand him, he spoke, after some time, in their tongue: ‚ÄúI have not gone very far; still I have some news for you. I have discovered vines loaded with grapes.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you telling the truth, my foster-father?‚Äù exclaimed Leif. ‚ÄúI am sure of telling the truth,‚Äù Tyrker said, ‚Äúfor in my native land there are vines in plenty.‚Äù This caused Leif to give the country the name of Vinland. The story shares the element of wild grapes with the Irish tale of Mael Duin. However, the Norse word used in the saga is ‚Äòvinber‚Äô. While this sometimes refers to grapes, it also translates into \\"wine-berry\\", and there is a long- standing Nordic tradition to make wine out of berries available. We know from historical records that the Icelanders and Greenlanders even made wine from crowberry. In the Newfoundland/Labrador area, squashberry, gooseberry, and cranberry all grow wild, and may serve as an explanations for Leif‚Äôs discovery of \\"wine-berries\\".

The principals and presidents of the college have been James M. Houston (1970‚Äì1978), Carl Armerding (1978‚Äì1988), Walter Wright Jr. (1988‚Äì2000) and outgoing president Rod Wilson (2000‚Äì2015). Jeffrey P. Greenman began his term as the fifth president on February 1, 2015. Greenman is the first alumnus of Regent College to become president. Regent initially rented rooms in various buildings at UBC, including St. Andrews Hall and Vancouver School of Theology, and occupied two fraternity houses on Wesbrook Mall for a time. In 1989, Regent moved into its own new building in the current location at the corner of Wesbrook & University, with the distinctive green roof. A subsequent capital campaign finished in 2006, adding the John Richard Allison Library and the Windtower to Regent College's architectural distinctiveness.  Academic programs  The college offers four main graduate programs, all ATS- accredited: * Graduate Diploma in Christian Studies (DipCS) * Master of Arts in Christian Studies (MACS) * Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS) * Master of Divinity (MDiv) * Master of Theology (ThM) * Master of Arts in Leadership, Theology, and Society (MALTS)  Student life  On Tuesdays during fall and winter term, the college community gathers for chapel, followed by optional community group meetings and a lunch of homemade soup and bread. The Regent College Student Association oversees a variety of student life activities and services, including Taste of the World, book sales, an annual Christmas Party, an annual retreat, the Regent Spouse's Network, and more. Because Regent is a UBC affiliate school, Regent students qualify for the U-Pass and the AMS insurance plan, and may make use of other UBC services such as the library system, health centre, and the pool.  Alumni and faculty  More than 4,500 students have graduated from Regent College and, due to the summer programs, over 30,000 students have taken classes. After Vancouver, Hong Kong hosts the second greatest number of Regent graduates, with other major pockets in Seattle, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Singapore and London. At present, Regent College employs 17 full-time faculty. Notable faculty emeriti include Eugene Peterson, Maxine Hancock, Loren Wilkinson, Gordon T. Smith, Paul Stevens, Gordon Fee, J.I. Packer and Bruce Waltke. Summer school classes are often taught by some notable Christian thinkers, including N.T. Wright, Andrew Walls, Luci Shaw, Richard Mouw, Alister McGrath, Malcolm Guite, George Marsden and Mark Noll. For a complete list of current faculty, emeriti, and notable alumni, see List of Regent College alumni and faculty.  Buildings and features  Regent Building and True North Tower The John Richard Allison Library is one of the major theological libraries in Western Canada. It houses the resources of Regent and Carey Theological College. Its catalogue is shared with Carey Theological College, Vancouver School of Theology, and St. Mark's College. Regent College Bookstore is one of the premier theological bookstores in Western Canada. It frequently hosts public lectures and booksignings, and has its own publishing program. The Lookout Gallery showcases seven annual exhibitions, including shows by Regent students in the Christianity and the Arts concentration. The Chapel is the heart of worship and community building at Regent. The weekly Tuesday Chapel service at 11 am is widely attended by students, faculty, staff, and guests. The piano within is a Steinway grand. True North Windtower features photovoltaic art glass by artist Sarah Hall, and it has been documented by the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada. The Atrium & The Well, a coffee shop which grew out of one Regent student‚Äôs final Christianity & the Marketplace project. In 2011 the kitchen off the Atrium was re-dedicated as the Rita Houston Kitchen, to mark the powerful impact of Rita Houston on Regent‚Äôs community life over the years.  Media  Regent College produces a wide variety of print and electronic media, including: * Crux: A Quarterly Journal of Christian Thought and Opinion * Regent World, a thrice- yearly newsletter * Et Cetera, a student newspaper published weekly during the regular term * ReFrame, a 10-week film based small group curriculum * Regent Audio * Regent Bookstore In addition, Regent College PublishingRegent Publishing specializes in re-publishing out-of-print Christian literature and features an increasing number of original titles.

The arena is primarily used for basketball and volleyball athletic events and is also used for daily chapel services and occasional concerts.Allen Arena Facilities at lipscombsports.com, URL accessed November 6, 2009. 11/5/09 Facilities Other than hosting athletic events and on campus convocations, the arena hosts many events such as dinners, concerts, area-wide worship services, and graduations (the university and Nashville surrounding high schools). The facility has been host to events such as the annual Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation Concert, bringing entertainers such as former Vibe host Sinbad, Dana Carvey, and Jay Leno. Besides being the home of Lipscomb sports teams, it served as the home of the now-defunct Nashville franchise, the Nashville Rhythm, in the revived American Basketball Association. It was also the home of the Music City Stars, an American Basketball Association team during the 2009-10 season.

The Tribune is owned by The Salt Lake Tribune, Inc., a non-profit corporation. For almost 100 years, it was a family-owned newspaper held by the heirs of U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns. After Kearns died in 1918, the company was controlled by his widow, Jennie Judge Kearns, and then the newspaper's longtime publisher was John F. Fitzpatrick, who started his career as secretary to Senator Kearns in 1913 and remained publisher until his death in 1960. John W. Gallivan, nephew of Mrs. Kearns, joined the Tribune in 1937 and succeeded Fitzpatrick as publisher in 1960, remaining as Chairman until the merger with TCI, Inc. in 1997. On April 20, 2016, Huntsman Family Investments, a private equity firm headed by Paul Huntsman, son of industrialist Jon Huntsman, Sr., announced that it would be buying the Tribune. He soon announced plans to take the paper non-profit. In November 2019 the newspaper won approval from the Internal Revenue Service to become a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The newspaper's motto, at the top of its masthead, is \\"Utah's Independent Voice Since 1871\\". History A successor to Utah Magazine (1868),Leaders of the LDS Church had urged its members to eschew the Utah Magazine; its owners formed the Mormon Tribune in 1870 in retaliation. as the Mormon Tribune by a group of businessmen led by former members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) William Godbe, Elias L.T. Harrison and Edward Tullidge, who disagreed with the church's economic and political positions. After a year, the publishers changed the name to the Salt Lake Daily Tribune and Utah Mining Gazette, but soon after that, they shortened it to The Salt Lake Tribune. Three Kansas businessmen, Frederic Lockley, George F. Prescott and A.M. Hamilton, purchased the company in 1873 and turned it into an anti-Mormon newspaper which consistently backed the local Liberal Party. Sometimes vitriolic, the Tribune held particular antipathy for LDS Church president Brigham Young. In the edition announcing Young's death, the Tribune wrote, :He was illiterate and he has made frequent boast that he never saw the inside of a school house. His habit of mind was singularly illogical and his public addresses the greatest farrago of nonsense that ever was put in print. He prided himself on being a great financer, and yet all of his commercial speculations have been conspicuous failures. He was hierophant, and pretended to be in daily [communion] with the Almighty, and yet he was groveling in his ideas, and the system of religion he formulated was well nigh Satanic. ‚Äî The Salt Lake Tribune, August 30, 1877 In 1901, newly elected United States Senator Thomas Kearns, a Roman Catholic, and his business partner, David Keith, secretly bought the Tribune. Kearns made strides to eliminate the paper's anti-Mormon overtones, and succeeded in maintaining good relationships with the mostly-LDS state legislature which had elected him to the Senate. After Keith died in 1918 the Kearns family bought out Keith's share of the Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Company. Eventually, the parent company became Kearns-Tribune Corporation. The company started up an evening edition in 1902, known as The Salt Lake Telegram. The Telegram was sold in 1914 and reacquired by the Tribune in 1930. It was phased out when the joint operating agreement was formed with the afternoon Deseret News, Salt Lake's daily newspaper owned by the LDS Church, in 1952.Malmquist,The First 100 Years, pp. 323‚Äì324. Downtown Salt Lake City John F. Fitzpatrick became publisher in 1924, ushering in what became seven decades of peaceful coexistence with the dominant LDS Church. In 1952 theTribune entered into a joint operating agreement with the Deseret News and created the Newspaper Agency Corporation.Malmquist, The First 100 Years, p.? Fitzpatrick was the architect of NAC at the request of LDS Church President David O. McKay whose newspaper was near bankruptcy at the time. Fitzpatrick died of a heart attack in 1960, and was succeeded by John W. Gallivan, who had been trained as the next publisher from the time he joined the Tribune in 1937. Gallivan often joked with aspiring journalism students, telling them the best way to the publisher's desk was to get yourself left on the doorstep of the owner. (He had been orphaned at the age of five, then taken in by his mother's half-sister, Mrs. Thomas Kearns.) In the late 1950s, in spite of reluctance from John Fitzpatrick about the future of television, Gallivan joined a measured Tribune investment with The Standard Corporation in Ogden, Utah, to build one of the first microwave and cable TV systems across northern Nevada. On weekends, Gallivan traveled by bus to Elko, Nevada, to oversee the construction beginnings. Gallivan and Denver cable investor Bob Magness merged their companies into Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) which eventually became the largest cable television company in the world. The Tribunes ownership interest in TCI reached nearly 15%, which played a large role in later mergers between the two companies. Gallivan remained as Tribune publisher until 1984, and chairman of the board until 1997.Malmquist,The First 100 Years, pp. 373‚Äì376. The Kearns family owned a majority share of the newspaper until 1997, when the company merged with TCI in an effort to minimize inheritance tax liabilities borne by the two largest shareholders in the Kearns family. A buy-back agreement was put in place, providing for the Kearns family to reacquire The Tribune, after the IRS required a five-year holding period. However, in the interim TCI was merged with AT&T; Corporation. After intense pressure from the LDS Church, and intense counter-suits from the Kearns family, the Tribune was subsequently sold by AT&T; to Denver, Colorado- based MediaNews Group in 2000. In 2002, the Tribune was mired in controversy after employees sold information related to the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case to The National Enquirer. Tribune editor James \\"Jay\\" Shelledy resigned from his job at the paper amid the fallout of the scandal. Two staffers also were removed from their positions as Tribune reporters. In 2004 the paper decided to move from its historic location at the downtown Tribune building, to The Gateway development. Many people, including several Tribune employees, opposed the move, stating that it would harm the economy of Salt Lake's downtown. The move was completed in May 2005 and Tribune employees were told by Editor Nancy Conway, \\"It is just a building.\\" After emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, MediaNews Group lost control of its ownership to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. \\"The remainder of the Denver-based chain is owned by a consortium of lenders and by Singleton himself.\\"Beebe, Paul (January 29, 2011). The Salt Lake Tribune. In 2016, Huntsman Family Investments, LLC, a company controlled by Paul Huntsman, bought The Salt Lake Tribune. Paul Huntsman is the son of industrialist Jon Huntsman, Sr. who serves as chairman of the holding company, and brother of former Utah governor and ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, Jr.. In 2012, as it had in 2008, The Salt Lake Tribune endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency, despite opponent Mitt Romney's connections with both Mormonism and Salt Lake City, having had a hand in organizing the city's 2002 Olympic Games. In 2017, the Tribune was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for \\"a string of vivid reports revealing the perverse, punitive and cruel treatment given to sexual assault victims at Brigham Young University, one of Utah‚Äôs most powerful institutions.\\" The team included lead reporter Erin Alberty, managing editor Sheila R. McCann, reporters Jessica Miller and Alex Stuckey and editor/writer Rachel Piper. The package of winning stories also included an investigation into multiple reports that were not properly investigated by Utah State University. In a December 2017 editorial, the Tribune called for Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to retire in 2018. In May 2018, the Tribune laid off over one third of its staff of 90, bringing the number to 56. The reason put forward for this was lower revenue due to decreased circulation and lower profit from online advertisements. This was despite a paywall having been placed months earlier on the Tribune website. In November 2019, the newspaper won approval from the Internal Revenue Service to become a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

It can be used for training drivers on a variety of bus models and on different types of gear transmissions. * Physical simulator: Large scale simulators employ Stewart platforms and xy tables to physically move the driver around in 6-axis space, simulating acceleration, braking and centripetal forces, similar to physical flight simulators.  Entertainment  Advances in processing power have led to more realistic simulators in recent years, beginning with Papyrus Design Group's groundbreaking Grand Prix Legends for the PC, released in 1998. Occasionally, a racing game or driving simulator will also include an attachable steering wheel that can be used to play the game in place of a controller. The wheel, which is usually plastic, may also include pedals to add to the game's reality. These wheels are usually used only for computer games. In addition to the myriad commercial releases there is a bustling community of amateur coders working on closed and open source free simulators. Some of the major features popular with fans of the genre are online racing, realism and diversity of cars and tracks. Dutch simulator designer Cruden offers private use car simulators for personal entertainment. Cruden car simulator is not connected to a computer game, system uses the same software that is designed for Formula 1 teams and engineers to improve their skills and their vehicles. The simulator provides different types of settings. Such as; different cars, terrains or any other desired settings. Also, telemetry analyze is available as an optional feature.  Research  Driving simulators are used at research facilities for many purposes. The Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto and McGill University used the Virage Simulation VS500M driving simulator to study and measure the effects of cannabis on driving. Many vehicle manufacturers operate driving simulators, e.g. BMW, Ford, Renault. Many universities also operate simulators for research. In addition to studying driver training issues, driving simulators allow researchers to study driver behavior under conditions in which it would be illegal and/or unethical to place drivers. For instance, studies of driver distraction would be dangerous and unethical (because of the inability to obtain informed consent from other drivers) to do on the road. With the increasing use of various in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) such as satellite navigation systems, cell phones, DVD players and e-mail systems, simulators are playing an important rule in assessing the safety and utility of such devices. Simulators are also used in psychometric testing, driver behaviour mapping, analysis of driving patterns for driverless car development, etc. Central Road Research Institute and Faros Simulation System have jointly developed a car simulator for extensive research purposes. CRRI Faros Research Simulator. Companies like Real Time Technologies develop custom simulators, typically used by universities, for studying human interactions with self-driving vehicles in order to improve vehicle safety. = Fidelity = There exists a number of types research driving simulators, with a wide range of capabilities. The most complex, like the National Advanced Driving Simulator, have a full-sized vehicle body, with six-axis movement and 360-degree visual displays. On the other end of the range are simple desktop simulators such as the York Driving Simulator that are often implemented using a computer monitor for the visual display and a videogame-type steering wheel and pedal input devices. These low cost simulators are used readily in the evaluation of basic and clinically oriented scientific questions.Li, Z., & Milgram, P. (2005).

The issue is complicated by political and economic factors, as facilities with low-fidelity simulators claim their systems are \\"good enough\\" for the job, while the high-fidelity simulator groups insist that their (considerably more expensive) systems are necessary. Research into motion fidelity indicates that, while some motion is necessary in a research driving simulator, it does not need to have enough range to match real-world forces.Greenberg J., Artz B., Cathey L. The Effect of Lateral Motion Cues During Simulated Driving. Driving Simulator Conference North America 2003 Proceedings, Dearborn, Michigan, October 8‚Äì10, 2003, CD-ROM (ISSN 1546-5071) Recent research has also considered the use of the real-time photo- realistic video content that reacts dynamically to driver behaviour in the environment. = Validity = There is a question of validity‚Äîwhether results obtained in the simulator are applicable to real-world driving. One review of research studies found that driver behavior on a driving simulator approximates (relative validity) but does not exactly replicate (absolute validity) on-road driving behavior.Mullen, Nadia. Charlton, Judith, Devlin, Anna, and; B√©dard, Michel (2011). Chapter 13: Simulator Validity: Behaviors Observed on the Simulator and on the Road.

M. (2010). Simulator driving performance predicts accident reports five years later. Psychology and Aging, 25(3), 741-745 Some research teams are using automated vehicles to recreate simulator studies on a test track, enabling a more direct comparison between the simulator study and the real world.\\"Program develops new test track capability \\". ITS Sensor. Winter 2004. Retrieved on February 14, 2007 As computers have grown faster and simulation is more widespread in the automotive industry, commercial vehicle math models that have been validated by manufacturers are seeing use in simulators. = Simulator Adaptation Syndrome (\\"SAS\\") = Simulator Adaptation Syndrome (\\"SAS\\"), is an issue with all simulators, not just driving simulators. The main cause of Simulator Adaptation Syndrome are system delays between the driver's command and the response of the simulator. In effect the brain, referencing driving a real vehicle, expects the simulator's response to be the same as a car, the greater the deviation the greater the \\"adaption burden\\" on the brain. If the deviation is large, the driver may experience symptoms of headaches, motion sickness, disorientation, etc. due to SAS although this is very dependent on the individual. Likewise the simulator \\"cues\\" also have an effect, that is some individuals will experience discomfort due to a simulator not having motion cues, where others may not have a problem with such simulators. Some individuals will show high tolerance to visual system delays, where others may not. The \\"Adaptation\\" in SAS relates to the brain's accepting these simulator's disparities relative to a real vehicle and thus slowly changing its reference point to that of the simulation. Thus with gradual introduction to the simulator environment the brain will slowly adapt and the negative effects of SAS (headaches, motion sickness, disorientation, etc.) will be greatly reduced. Once a person spends several hours in a driving simulator a real vehicle can evoke SAS again however the adaption time is greatly reduced: the brain quickly \\"remembers\\" and \\"resets\\" the real vehicle reference point. As an example of SAS timing, when airline pilots go through regular simulator training they are not allowed to fly an airplane for 1 week in order to allow their brains to \\"forget\\" the SAS reference point induced by the simulator. To sum up, , there is however a physiological response to simulators called \\"SAS\\" which can result in headaches, motion sickness, and disorientation. By minimizing the simulator's system delays, rendering all the cues economically possible, and slowly introducing susceptible individuals, the effects of SAS can be mitigated. The primary reason for the $54 million price tag of the National Advanced Driving Simulator was to reduce SAS the maximum amount possible . The National Advanced Driving Simulator is capable of rendering, including full-motion cues, a driver passing a vehicle on a 2 lane highway from the beginning of the pass to the end (thus its enormous motion base).

The family includes 14 species in seven genera. The atherosperms are today mostly distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, with two species native to southern Chile and 12 species native to Australasia. Wood is commercially harvested from rainforest species of this family, and is used both in construction and in fine cabinet making. Ecology These trees and shrubs are characteristic of the lower strata of the tropical rainforest, except Dryadodaphne species, which belong to the rainforest high canopy. The glands at the base of the stamens secrete nectar in Laurelia novae-zelandiae, which accumulates at the base of the flower and attracts bees, coleopterans and Bombyliidae. The seed, in the form of a feathery achene, is dispersed by wind (anemochory). The wood of Laurelia has local interest for construction, particularly the Chilean Laurelia sempervirens, despite its lack of resistance to moisture. Essential oils extracted from the leaves and bark of species of Doryphora have application in perfumery and pharmaceuticals. Evolution The Atherospermataceae have in the past been treated as a subfamily (Atherospermatoideae) of the Monimiaceae. Recent reassessment of both morphological and molecular characters, however, show them to be more clearly related to the Gomortegaceae and Siparunaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website considers them to be a family of their own (as the Atherospermataceae), and together with the Gomortegaceae and Siparunaceae form a distinct branch of the Laurales. A clade made up of Doryphora and Daphnandra, from the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales, is considered sister to the rest of the family. The remaining genera (Atherosperma, Dryadodaphne, Laurelia, Laureliopsis, and Nemuaron) are considered by some to be more advanced evolutionarily. The atherosperm fossil record, which goes back to the Upper Cretaceous, includes pollen, wood, and leaf fossils from Europe, Africa, South America, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Tasmania. The family is recognized in Antarctic fossils from the Cretaceous to the lower Tertiary (about 88 Mya). Fossil pollen of Laurelia has been attributed to the middle Oligocene of New Zealand, as well as the Eocene- Oligocene and Early Miocene of Argentina and Seymour Island. Calibration of rbcL substitution rates within the fossils suggests an initial diversification of the family at 100-140 Mya, probably in West Gondwana, early entry into Antarctica, and long-distance dispersal to New Zealand and New Caledonia at 50-30 Mya by the ancestors of Laurelia novae-zelandiae and Nemuaron.

The village is located within of the A48. The population in 2005 was approximately 400 but with recent building development, the population is now estimated at over 600 people. The novelist Agatha Christie was a frequent visitor, and her descendants still live at the former manor house of Pwllywrach. History =Archaeological and early historical evidence= Bronze Age axe heads discovered on land at Highfield Farm and Iron Age kilns suggest that the area was settled during prehistoric times. The impetus for the development of an agrarian village may have been the local geography: a gentle valley going east to west towards the village, providing a water supply and creating a natural bowl, with a present-day exit leading down Church Lane. Steep slopes in the central part of the village make it unlike other Vale of Glamorgan villages in its topography. The watercourse is now underground but rises to the surface in prolonged wet weather. The older village houses are situated on the higher ground overlooking meadows, possibly built on the sites of older simple dwellings. It is thought the area between Garden and Penlan Cottages and Church Cottage provided protection and water for livestock. Title Deeds and old census records call this area \\"The Square\\". p. 7 A village well is present near Ty Draw Farm, and it is likely that watercress was harvested from the open water course there. There is evidence of Roman activity in the Vale of Glamorgan, and their link to West Wales was along what would become the route of the A48. Llantwit Major Roman Villa, for example, is thought to have been built on a site occupied since the British Iron Age.CAERMEAD ROMAN SITE;LLANTWIT MAJOR ROMAN VILLA, Coflein (There was another excavation in 1971.Llantwit Major Roman villa on Roman Britain ) Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the area was ruled by the medieval \\"princes\\" of Morgannwg; their kingdom included the area later known as Glamorgan. During this period the settlement came to be called \\"Colwinst≈´n\\", possibly from an old English name \\"Colwine\\" linked with \\"t≈´n\\", meaning farm or settlement. Morgan, R. Place-Names of Glamorgan. Welsh Academic Press, Cardiff 2018 p. 48. =Norman rule and new land ownership= Caradog ap Gruffudd and Iestyn ap Gwrgant from the north and west usurped the princes in about 1070,Smith, B.J.

University Of Wales Press Cardiff 1971. pp 6-7. and Robert Fitzhamon led the Norman invasion of the area from Bristol, probably by sea. Local folklore says that the nickname of \\"Golden Mile\\" (the area shown on old maps as being between Twmpath Farm and the main village, or the northern edge of the village's original common) arises either from Fitzhamon's forces lining up to receive their payment along a section of the A48 adjacent to Colwinston, or from Civil War troops gathering in the same location for payment; another theory is that the name originated because of yellow gorse plants growing along the old road at this point. p. 9. William de Londres was granted the lordship of Ogmore (which included Colwinston) by Fitzhamon, and also established Ewenny Priory in 1141 under the Benedictine Abbey in Gloucester. He gave 'the Church of St Michael of Ewenny, the Church of St Bridget with the Chapel of Ugemore de Lanfey, the Church of St. Michael of Colvestone with the lands, meadows and all other things belonging unto them‚Äôquoted in List of Donations in the Gloucester Chronicles, quoted in Morris, P. The Priory Church of St Michael Ewenny, Ewenny Priory Church, 2006 to the Abbey. The grant of a 66-acre farm (possibly Ty Maen Farm) was later added to this. p.10. There is evidence that St Michael and All Angels Church, Colwinston, was founded in 1111, predating the Priory by 30 years. =Middle Ages and after= By 1340, Sir Roger de Bavant had become the owner of the remainder of the Manor. In 1344 (for reasons unknown) he gave his property to the then King of England, Edward III, who (again for reasons unknown) endowed the property upon the Dominican Nuns at Dartford Priory in Kent. p. 16. Tithes and rents were paid to the two Priories, with the right to appoint the Vicar being with Ewenny Priory. Henry VIII famously seized all monastery lands in 1536, Sir Edward Carne, a commissioner during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was able to lease Ewenny Priory from the king, eventually purchasing it in 1545 for ¬£727-6s-4d. He also purchased the Dartford priory land at ColwinstonWilliams, G. The Ecclesiastical History of Glamorgan 1527-1642 in Williams, G. (ed) Glamorgan County History Vol IV, pub: University of Wales Press p. 197 creating a single 'Manor of Colwinston'. p.18. By 1539 English law had been extended to cover Wales and the County of Glamorgan was formally established as an administrative unit. Colwinston remained a pocket of recusancy, with priests continuing to administer the sacrament according to the Roman rite. Even into the 17th century, John Lloyd, a local priest under the protection of the Turbevilles at Penlline, was arrested and hanged, drawn and quartered on the Heath at Cardiff in 1679 at the height of the hysteria caused by the 'Popish Plot'. =16th to 19th century= The Norman tradition of primogeniture had taken over in Glamorgan, in contrast with traditional Welsh law. In the 1670s, With no sons to inherit, the Carne family lands were divided between two surviving Carne daughters upon their marriages. Colwinston thus became the property of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet, of Margam when he married Martha Carne. In 1747 Bussy Mansel, 4th Baron Mansel, succeeded to the title. Having no male heirs, he sold the ‚ÄòManor of Colwinston‚Äô to David Thomas ‚Äòof Bath‚Äô. Thomas had married into the family that owned Pwllywrach, where he built a new ‚ÄòManor house‚Äô. Four generations later the Manor was again without a male heir after the death of Hubert be Burgh Thomas. His sister, Mary Anna Thomas, married Charles John Prichard some time after 1878, placing the land at Colwinston in trust for their son, Hubert Cecil Prichard. Small farms were often then sold on to other farmers and landowners in this period. The Golden Mile Common, an area of approximately 70 acres lying alongside the A48, was ‚Äòenclosed‚Äô by an Act of Parliament called the ‚ÄòGolden Mile Award‚Äô in 1871. The village population in the 19th century thus became formed around the Pwllywrach House and Hilton Farm, a number of small farm units stretching west‚Äìeast from Ty Maen to the Yew Tree and Chapel Farms, north to Claypit and Highfield Farms and south to Stembridge and Parcau Farms, some labourers‚Äô cottages owned by the Pwllywrach estate and others, the Church and the Parsonage (and the then Vicarage) and three chapels. Some of the land on the northern side of village was owned by Jesus College, Oxford. Agriculture was supported by other trades including the Sycamore Tree Inn (recorded back to at least 1840, the building is post-medieval), a forge and blacksmith, baker, shoemaker, post office and horse breaker. Pp.27-34. However, there was a substantial turnover in the village population following the start of the Industrial Revolution. Census records show that of the 268 people living in the village in 1861, only 98 had been living in the village in 1851; 168 people who died or moved away during that decade were replaced by a high number of births and people moving in from West Wales and Ireland.James, B.Ll. The Vale of Glamorgan, 1840-1860: Profile of a Rural Community in Williams, S. Glamorgan Historian, Vol 5. Pub: D Brown and Sons. Cowbridge 1968 The 1861 census also reveals the existence of a private school within the village. A \\"National\\" school, supported by the (then) Church of England, was established in 1871, in the building now known as Ty Colwyn, with 27 children on the original register. From 1875 the school was funded through a voluntary Parish rate. The present village school (Church in Wales) was built in 1970. In addition to the Anglican church, several Nonconformist chapels existed in the village, and were popular with Welsh-language speakers. Seion Calvinistic Methodist (Presbyterian) Chapel was built in 1830, surviving until 1996. Ebenezer Baptist Chapel was founded in 1843 and a building established in 1852, using part of Chapel Farm House. It continued in use until 1944, and a baptismal pool was created by blocking off a stream in the field below and to the rear of the chapel. Pp 36-37. In 1865, a village branch of the Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites was established, based at the Sycamore Tree Inn, conducting its business in Welsh. This provided a vehicle for villagers with independent incomes to save, and then possibly to buy, their own properties. It finally closed in 1960, and the order as a whole disbanded in the early 1970s. p. 38. The 1811 A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales by Nicholas Carlisle said of the village: =20th century= The population of the village began to grow away from its agricultural origins, with some emigration to the South Wales coalfields by those seeking industrial employment, whilst the need for intensive labour on farms was reduced by machinery and the village population declined. Some of the original houses fell into disrepair as these population movements took place. Colonel Hubert Cecil Prichard came to live at Pwllywrach after the First World War. His son Hubert de Burgh Prichard famously married Rosalind Christie, the only daughter of Agatha Christie, their son Mathew Prichard being given the proceeds from the royalties of The Mousetrap. He subsequently used the substantial sums from the play to establish the Colwinston Charitable Trust in 1995. Gradually ‚Äòmodern‚Äô features eventually found their way to the village, including mains water in 1935, and electricity and telephone (in the form of a public kiosk) from 1946 onwards. A new water main was laid from the A48 in 1972 and a new sewage scheme laid in 1973. Beech Park was built in the 1960s with other small developments following. The smaller, mostly tenanted, farms became unviable in the latter part of the 20th century. The remaining farm buildings between Church Farm and Colwinston House (built originally as a Dower House for Pwllywrach) were gradually sold as residential houses, with the barns and rickyards between the farmhouses also being sold off for development. The Pwllyrwrach estate created a single large farm based at Pwllyrwrach Farm, concentrating on sheep and beef cattle farming (rather than the dairy farming which had previously been predominant. pp 42‚Äì43.) =21st century= The agricultural land in and around the village is now variously owned by the Pwllywrach Estate, a number of independent landowners (especially to the north and west of the village) as well as a small number of independent farmers who have bought and/or inherited land over the centuries. Other properties are owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council for the school, the Village Hall and the remaining social housing. Finally, most private housing is now owned by individual house owners, either as new-build properties or older houses mostly purchased from the Pwllywrach estate, the local authority, the chapel organisations and the Church in Wales or local farmers. The main fabric of the village was thus set until 2016 when the developer Redrow plc built 64 new homes on land now known as Heol Cae Pwll (completed in 2018), increasing the population to over 600. Protests against the extent of the development by local residents were overruled by the Vale of Glamorgan Council. Community representatives pointed to regular flooding and said that \\"adding 64 homes to a village with 130 at the moment can only increase that risk\\". Along with this came \\"fibre\\" broadband. The village has gained a local and national reputation in recent years for its community spirit and activities. Village on maps and its name A 16th-century map (probably of lands inherited by the Duchy of Lancaster) shows the village as Colwyns' Tone. The name was sometimes shortened to Coulston (e.g. Christopher Saxton's map of 1578). The village name was later usually spelled as one word, most commonly as Colwinstone or Colwinston. The Ordnance Survey has used ‚ÄòColwinston‚Äô since 1833 (reflecting the usual pronunciation) but some official sources (e.g. census records, official postal addresses) included an -e until the latter part of the 20th century. The Welsh name of the village, Tregolwyn, first appears in writing c. 1566 as \\"tref golwyn\\"; it was not often recorded in official documents because of restrictions on the use of Welsh, but appears to be derived from tun as tref (\\"town\\"), and the Welsh name Colwyn or Collwyn, which also has a literal meaning of \\"cub, whelp, puppy\\". Demographics Colwinston's population was 447, according to the 2011 census; a 10.1% increase since the 406 people noted in 2001. This has recently been increased through the addition of 64 family homes. The 2011 census showed 13.1% of the population could speak Welsh, a rise from 7.8% in 2001. Church of St Michael & All Angels St Michael's Church, Colwinston The original Norman St Michael's Church in Colwinston is reputed to have been built in 1111.Maclehose, H and Duxbury, J.(eds.) Colwinston - A Changing Village. Pub; H Maclehose in association with Tregolwyn. 2018 The church was restored in 1879 and again in the 1970s and 2000s. The medieval parish church is a Grade 1 listed building. The church underwent a substantial restoration in 1879, and again in 1971 following a fire which badly damaged the chancel, destroying the brass tablets either side of the altar displaying the Ten Commandments. It was at this time that the words ‚ÄúHoly, Holy, Holy‚Äù painted in scroll work above the chancel arch were painted over. Further restoration work at the church was carried out at the millennium with the benefit of a major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund together with grants from other bodies and funds raised by the villagers. A vestry, kitchen and toilet were built on the north side of the church, the interior and exterior walls were lime washed and the roof repaired at a cost of ¬£350,000. Other landmarks Of the ten Grade II listed buildings in the village, all date from the medieval or immediate post- medieval period. These include a thatched house, \\"The Old Parsonage\\", the former manor house of Pwllywrach, and several former farmhouses. The Old Parsonage, a thatched house dating to the 16th century at the crossroads and opposite the southeast corner of churchyard, has a Gothic or Tudor arch and the building is \\"one of only two in Glamorgan with a latrine in the form of a small closet at the side of the fireplace.\\" In 1835, the Seion Presbyterian Chapel was built but it closed in 1996; it later became a residential building. In 1843, the Ebenezer Baptist Chapel was established and the building was completed in 1852. The last minister was the Rev A.E. Powell of Balarat, who served at the church between 1905 and 1944 before the church became part of a house. The Sycamore Tree Inn, a public house run by Brains Brewery, can be dated to 1650 or earlier. In May 1865, The Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites Friendly Society was established and registered there. Community resources in the village include St David's Church in Wales Primary School, the village hall and the village Playing Field. A Thankful Village Colwinston is one of only three villages in Wales which suffered no fatalities in World War I, despite 23 residents of the village having been on active service. It is one of only 53 Thankful Villages in the UK. However, the village lost four men in World War II, one of whom was Agatha Christie's son- in-law, Colonel Hubert Prichard.BBC: The Thankful Villages of Wales. Accessed 4 August 2013 Welcome signs at the entrance to the village reflected its status as a thankful village from but the village had no war memorial until 2014, when one was erected on the village green. Governance Colwinston has its own community council with seven elected or co-opted members.Colwinston Community Council official website For elections to the Vale of Glamorgan Council, Colwinston is part of the Llandow/Ewenny county electoral ward. Culture The major social event of the year is the annual village fete, usually held during the first or second week in July. Other annual events include a pantomime and the New Year's Day sport of \\"collyball\\". A multi-use games area (MUGA) was constructed close to the village hall in 2013.Creative Rural Communities - \\"Colwinston Community Consultation\\" 2012.

An American Bradley armored fighting vehicle was mobilized to support US troops, but it was struck by a car bomb around 6:30 a.m., wounding four American soldiers. After the wounded Americans were evacuated, witnesses reported that a crowd had gathered around the burning Bradley, apparently celebrating. Media personnel also arrived on the scene, filming the burning wreckage. Reports said that the media and crowd had been gathered around the vehicle after the fighting ended. At around 8:00 a.m., an American helicopter fired two missiles and machine guns at the burning tank, killing 13 people and injuring about 60 others. Among the dead was Mazen al-Tumeizi, a Palestinian reporter for al-Arabiya TV who was filming a report at the time. Tumeizi's death and the incident itself were caught by his cameraman.

The station is in Zone 4, between Leytonstone and South Woodford stations. History The station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway on 22 August 1856 as part of their branch to Loughton which opened that day. Originally named Snaresbrook, the station was renamed several times: Snaresbrook for Wanstead in 1857; Snaresbrook and Wanstead in November 1898; Snaresbrook for Wanstead in 1929; and Snaresbrook on 14 December 1947. The station formed part of the Great Eastern Railway's system until that company amalgamated with other railways to create the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. The station was subsequently transferred to form part of London Underground's Central line from 14 December 1947. This formed a part of the long planned, and delayed, Eastern Extension of the Central line that was part of the London Passenger Transport Board's \\"New Works Programme\\" of 1935 - 1940. The station was partially reconstructed in 1893, the most notable feature being the provision of a bay platform that remained in use until transfer to the Underground. The station is a fine survivor of a Victorian suburban station, with later additions, and includes a brick built station building as well as extensive cast iron and timber canopies to the platforms. A small secondary ticket office, serving the westbound platforms, was constructed in c.1948 but this is now unused. Also of note, dating from the same date, are the examples of the concrete roundels (some combined with lamp posts) found on the platforms. In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step-free access by 2023/24, as part of a ¬£200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube. The station today In addition to the main building, an alternative exit open at morning peak hours is available directly on the south side of Wanstead High Street, with another open all day on the north side of the same road accessible via footbridge running parallel to the railway. Connections London Buses route W14 serves the station.

On 27 December 1991, a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 operating the flight, registration OY-KHO, piloted by Danish Captain Stefan G. Rasmussen (44) and Swedish first officer Ulf Cedermark (34), both experienced pilots with 8,000 and 3,000 flight hours, respectively, was forced to make an emergency landing in a field near Gottr√∂ra, Sweden. Ice had collected on the wings' inner roots (close to the fuselage) before takeoff, broke off, and was ingested into the engines as the aircraft became airborne on takeoff, ultimately resulting in the failure of both engines. All 129 passengers and crew aboard survived. The incident is known as the Gottr√∂ra crash () or the Miracle at Gottr√∂ra () in Sweden. Aircraft The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-81, registered OY-KHO with serial number 53003, line number 1844. It made its first flight on 16 March 1991, and was delivered soon after to SAS on 10 April 1991. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had been in service for only nine months. It was fitted with two Pratt & Whitney JT8D low- bypass turbofan engines. Accident The aircraft involved in June 1991. The aircraft had arrived at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport at 22:09 local time after a flight from Z√ºrich the previous evening and was parked overnight at temperatures of around 0 to 1 ¬∞C (32 to 34 ¬∞F). About of flight-chilled very cold fuel remained in the wing tanks. Due to this, clear ice had formed on the upper side of the wings, but was not detected. The aircraft was de-iced with of de-icing fluid, but not checked afterwards for remaining ice by the de- icing personnel or the Pilot-in-Charge, Captain Rasmussen, as he was required to do by the Scandinavian Airlines \\"Flight Deck Bulletin/Winterization\\" given pilots. The plane departed from Stockholm at 08:47. Shortly after liftoff, pieces of ice broke off and slammed into the fans of both engines, deforming the fan blades sufficiently to disturb the airflow to the compressors. The disturbed airflow caused the compressors to stall and this in turn caused the engines to surge. As the engines were not throttled down sufficiently, the surges continued. The high loads from repeated engine surges quickly led to the breakup of both engines. From the pilots' point of view, after 25 seconds of flight, noises and vibrations caused by the No. 2 engine surging were first noticed. The flight crew responded by throttling down a little, but an automatic system, ATR (automatic thrust restoration), that had not been described to the flight crew by SAS, simultaneously increased throttle as a response to the asymmetric engine power and reduced climb rate. As a consequence, the engine surges continued. SAS Flight Captain Per Holmberg, who was on board as a passenger, noticed the problems early and hurried to the cockpit to assist the crew. Engine No. 1 surged 39 seconds later and both engines failed at 76 and 78 seconds, respectively, into flight, at an altitude of 3,220 ft (980 m). The pilot responded to the loss of both engines by pitching the aircraft down in a dive before leveling it, to try to have it glide the longest possible distance without stalling. The pilots requested a return to Arlanda and attempted the restart procedure,Cockpit Voice Recorder transcript for SK 751 Hosted at aviation-safety.net but, with the aircraft emerging from cloud cover at 890 ft (270 m) altitude, they chose a field in the forest, near V√§ngsj√∂bergs s√§teri in Gottr√∂ra, Uppland, for an immediate emergency landing. During the final descent, the aircraft hit several trees, losing a large part of the right wing. It struck the ground tail-first, and the tail cone of the plane broke off. The plane slid across the field for , during which the main landing gear of the plane dug marks into the field and sheared off, the nose landing gear broke off, and the fuselage broke into three parts. As a result of the accident, 25 people were injured‚Äîtwo of them seriously‚Äîbut there were no fatalities. The flight attendants had instructed passengers to adopt the brace position, which is credited with the lack of fatalities. The flight crew, and especially Captain Rasmussen, were lauded for the skilled emergency landing in a fast-developing, potentially fatal situation. Rasmussen commented that \\"few civilian air pilots are ever put to a test of the skills they have acquired during training to this degree\\". He said he was proud of his crew and very relieved everyone had survived. He chose not to return to piloting commercial aircraft. Scandinavian Airlines continues to use flight number 751 for its Copenhagen-to-Warsaw route. Investigation and recommendations According to the official accident report by the Swedish Accident Investigation Board (SHK), the problem of clear ice formation on the wings in this type of aircraft was a well-known phenomenon at the time of the accident. From 1985 onward, McDonnell Douglas gave extensive information, including several \\"All Operators Letters\\" that dealt with the clear ice problem. In the \\"All Operators Letter\\" of 14 October 1986, operators were informed of how the Finnish airline Finnair had solved the problem of discovering clear ice. In 1988 and 1989, McDonnell Douglas arranged \\"Theme Conferences\\" dealing with clear ice formation. SAS took part in these conferences. On 26 October 1991, SAS distributed a \\"Flight Deck Bulletin/Winterization\\" to all pilots. It stated: \\"It is the Pilot-in-Charge's responsibility to check the aircraft for any ice or snow that may affect performance\\" and in the section \\"Clear Ice\\", it noted \\" [a]lthough the awareness within Line Maintenance is mostly good, the responsibility again rests with the Pilot-in-Charge that the aircraft is physically checked by means of a hands-on check on the upper side of the wing. A visual check from a ladder or when standing on the ground is not enough\\". Another contribution to the accident was insufficient training of the crew; they were not trained in restoring engine operation after they repeatedly surged. There was no simulator or other training on the engine surging problem. Secondly, they were not informed about a pre-installed automatic thrust system (automatic thrust restoration or ATR). The reason for this lapse of information was that there was no knowledge of ATR within SAS. However, ATR was described in manuals by the aircraft manufacturer which every operator is obliged to know. Even though the system was developed for use in procedures not applied by SAS, a sufficiently careful study of the manuals should have led to SAS noting the system and training its pilots in its function. The conclusion of the official accident report stated: > * \\"The accident was caused by SAS' instructions and routines being > inadequate to ensure that clear ice was removed from the wings of the > aircraft prior to takeoff. Hence the aircraft took off with clear ice on the > wings. In connection with liftoff, the clear ice loosened and was ingested > by the engines. The ice caused damage to the engine fan stages, which led to > engine surges. The surges destroyed the engines. Contributary causes were: * > The pilots were not trained to identify and eliminate engine surging. * ATR > ‚Äì which was unknown within SAS ‚Äì was activated and increased the engine > power without the pilots' knowledge.\\" In the section \\"Compressor Failures\\", the report stated: > * \\"With sufficiently reduced thrust in the right engine and maintained > thrust in the left, the engines would probably not have failed. The aircraft > would then have been able to return for landing.\\" However, the newly installed ATR prevented the pilots from successfully performing the normal remedial measure to halt compressor stall, i.e., throttling back the engines, as the ATR system ‚Äì designed to prevent pilots from using less than normal thrust when climbing out after take-off for noise abatement reasons ‚Äì restored engine take-off power throttle settings, contrary to the pilots' reduced throttle commands. This damaged the engines, until eventually, they failed completely. In popular culture The story of the accident was featured on the tenth season of the Canadian TV series Mayday. The episode is entitled \\"Pilot Betrayed\\".

The motion was never debated. Viability In the UK the most recent previous impeachment motion was made in 1848 (by Thomas Chisholm Anstey against the Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston, who was accused of concluding a secret treaty with Russia). The campaigners first needed to establish that impeachment was still viable in modern politics. On 17 November 2004 the speaker ruled their motion in order and it was tabled for the next session. Initial presentation In August 2004, Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price commissioned and published the report: A Case to Answer: a first report on the potential impeachment of the Prime Minister for High Crimes and Misdemeanours in relation to the invasion of Iraq.Wayback Machine The document was written by Dr Glen RangwalaFind an expert Communications (lecturer of politics at University of Cambridge) and Dan Plesch (Honorary Fellow of Birkbeck, University of London.) The report is 111 pages and divided into two sections. =Section I= The first part of the report details evidence for charges that an MP could use when moving for impeachment. The evidence detailed by the report suggests that Blair: * \\"made unsupported statements to the house and the public;\\" * \\"failed to report counter-evidence;\\" * \\"failed to verify claims in the evidence;\\" * \\"failed to remove errors found in the evidence; and\\" * \\"made a secret agreement with US President George W. Bush to overthrow Saddam Hussein.\\" =Section II= The second part examines the history of impeachment proceedings and looks at the possibility of bringing impeachment proceedings in modern government. It also gives the impeachable offences for which it claims Blair must offer a defence: * \\"failing to resign after misleading parliament and the country;\\" * \\"making a secret agreement with a foreign power;\\" * \\"undermining the constitution; and\\" * \\"negligence and incompetence.\\" Finally, it gave precedents for considering the conduct of a Prime Minister. Legal opinion The campaign hired solicitor Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers to represent their case. They have also asked Matrix Chambers to draw up a legal opinion. Matrix is known for its advocacy of human rights cases and for being the chambers of Blair's wife and Queen's Counsel, Cherie Booth. Booth was not involved in the case due to the obvious conflict of interest.

In earlier impeachment cases, this has usually been done after the motion, although it also occurred first in the case of Warren Hastings. The drafting team completed the text of the impeachment motion on 7 November 2004. Impeachment motion The legal advisers to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, approved the wording of the motion on 17 November 2004. The motion was tabled for the first day of the next session (the day after the Queen's Speech) on 24 November 2004. However, the main three parties forbade their MPs from signing the motion and it was never selected for debate. If the motion had been selected, it would have allowed MPs to debate matters that parliamentary language otherwise forbids. For example, on 17 March 2005, the anniversary of going to war, Price accused Tony Blair of misleading the house.Tomorrow is the second anniversary...: 17 Mar 2005: House of Commons debates - TheyWorkForYou Because this breached the rules of parliamentary language, he was required to leave the House for the remainder of the day.

He is sometimes described as \\"the father of the impossible figure\\", although there are much older examples, e.g. Hogarth's Satire on False Perspective, in addition to more recent well known example of the Penrose triangle and some others. Biography Born on 29 November 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, he reportedly suffered from dyslexia and had difficulty estimating the distance and size of objects. But his family was artistic, and encouraged his painting and sculpture efforts at home. Work Oscar Reutersv√§rd with two of his friends Reutersv√§rd's originality appeared early in his career - at the age of 18. In 1934, the school student created a figure, the \\"Impossible triangle\\", composed of a series of cubes in perspective. \\"the triangle at first seems like the simple geometrical shape with which all schoolchildren are familiar. However, as the eye tries to follow its outlines, the triangle abruptly becomes a dizzying experience as its bottom link plays havoc with the brain's intuitive knowledge of physical laws.\\" according to World of Mathematics, 2006, published by Thomson Gale. This very triangle was chosen in 1982 by the government of Sweden as the subject of a 25 √∂re postage stamp. In 1937, he created his first Impossible stairs, and the concept that would lead to the impossible fork. Subsequently, he focused on academics. In 1958, he read the now classic article by Lionel and Roger Penrose on impossible objects,British Journal of Psychology, Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion, by Lionel and Roger Penrose, Volume 49, Issue 1, pages 31‚Äì33, February 1958 which included the triangle and staircase that the British father and son team had developed independently. One artist inspired by the Penrose article was M.C. Escher - who produced two prints of impossible buildings in 1961 and 1962. The application of the concepts he originated over 20 years prior, by serious mathematicians and artists, rekindled Reutersv√§rd's interest. By 1963, he had created several new and original impossible figures, and was featured by a gallery in Stockholm. He would create his figures with India ink on Japanese rice paper, drawing freehand, without a ruler or any mechanical device. He generally used \\"Japanese perspective, where all parallel lines remain parallel and do not meet at points of visual convergence.\\" The shaky lines, often exacerbated by working on the ten hour train ride between Stockholm and Lund, is obvious in some of his pictures. Figures were frequently colored with Japanese colored chalk. In comparing his work to that of the much more famous artist of the impossible, M. C. Escher, it can be observed that Escher builds inhabited worlds around impossible objects, whereas Reutersv√§rd's designs generally consist of pure geometric forms. Reutersv√§rd produced more than 2500 figures. In the late 1960s, several books were published featuring his work, and he attracted a following, with many international gallery exhibitions. Through the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to develop impossible figures, filling many notebooks. Finally, in the mid 1990s, his work was prominently commissioned for several public buildings in Sweden, and the National Museum of Sweden and Museum of Modern Art of Stockholm both displayed his work. Tungt flytande flykt (), in Lund Sweden, 1962 Today both mathematicians and psychologists use his drawings as templates for studying visual perception. In addition to his development of impossible figures, he was a designer of many public works in Sweden, including large sculptures, mazes and architectural features. Oscar Reutersv√§rd gave at the Conference Incontri con la matematica (Mathematical Conference held annually, since 1986, in Castel San Pietro Terme - Bologna - Italy) the ability to use his figures for the publications annually made for the Conference. Swedish postage stamps Reutersv√§rd's achievements were honoured in 1982 by a series of three Swedish postage stamps. The stamps were engraved by Czes≈Çaw S≈Çania, based on watercolours by Reutersv√§rd. They remained in circulation for only about two years, after which they were withdrawn when the postage rate was changed. The Swedish government had the unused stamps destroyed; these scarce items are now eagerly sought collectibles.

Life  Walter Ritz's father Raphael Ritz was born in Valais and was a well-known painter. His mother, born N√∂rdlinger, was the daughter of an engineer from T√ºbingen. Ritz was a particularly gifted student and attended the municipal lyceum in Sion. In 1897 he entered the polytechnic school in Zurich, where he studied engineering. Soon he found out that he could not live with the approximations and compromises associated with engineering, and so he switched to the more mathematically accurate physical sciences.

The theme later led to the Ritz combination principle and in 1913 to the atomic model of Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. In the spring of 1903, he heard lectures by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz in Leiden on electrodynamic problems and his new electron theory. In June 1903 he was in Bonn at the Heinrich Kayser Institute, where he found in potash a spectral line that he had predicted in his dissertation. In November 1903, he was in Paris at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. There he worked on infrared photo plates. In July 1904 his illness worsened and he moved back to Zurich. The disease prevented him from publishing further scientific publications until 1906. In September 1907 he moved to T√ºbingen, the place of origin of his mother, and in 1908 again to G√∂ttingen, where he became a private lecturer at the university. There he published his work Recherches critiques sur l'Electrodynamique G√©n√©rale, see below. As a student, friend or colleague, Ritz had contacts with many contemporary scholars such as Hilbert, Andreas Heinrich Voigt, Hermann Minkowski, Lorentz, Aim√© Cotton, Friedrich Paschen, Henri Poincar√© and Albert Einstein. He was a fellow student of Einstein in Zurich, while he studied there. Ritz died in G√∂ttingen and was buried in the Nordheim cemetery in Zurich. The family tomb was lifted on 15 November 1999. His tombstone is in section 17 with the grave number 84457.  Works  = Criticism of Maxwell‚ÄìLorentz electromagnetic theory = Not so well known is the fact that in 1908 Ritz produced a lengthy criticismRitz, Walter (1908), \\"Recherches critiques sur l'√âlectrodynamique G√©n√©rale\\", Annales de Chimie et de Physique 13: 145‚Äì275, Page 172. of Maxwell‚ÄìLorentz electromagnetic theory, in which he contended that the theory's connection with the luminescent ether (see Lorentz ether theory) made it \\"essentially inappropriate to express the comprehensive laws for the propagation of electrodynamic actions.\\" Ritz pointed out seven problems with Maxwell‚ÄìLorentz electromagnetic field equations: * Electric and magnetic forces really express relations about space and time and should be replaced with non-instantaneous elementary actions. * Advanced potentials don't exist (and their erroneous use led to the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans ultraviolet catastrophe). * Localization of energy in the ether is vague. * It is impossible to reduce gravity to the same notions. * The unacceptable inequality of action and reaction is brought about by the concept of absolute motion with respect to the ether. * Apparent relativistic mass increase is amenable to different interpretations. * The use of absolute coordinates, if independent of all motions of matter, requires throwing away the time honored use of Galilean relativity and our notions of rigid ponderable bodies. Instead he indicated that light is not propagated (in a medium) but is projected. This theory, however, is considered to be refuted. =Ritz's Method= In 1909 Ritz developed a direct method to find an approximate solution for boundary value problems. It converts the often insoluble differential equation into solution of a matrix equation. It is a theoretical preparatory work for the finite element method (FEM). This method is also known Ritz's variation principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz principle. =Ritz's Combination Principle= In 1908, Ritz found empirically the Ritz combination principle named after him. After that, the sum or difference of the frequencies of two spectral lines is often the frequency of another line. Which of these calculated frequencies is actually observed was only explained later by selection rules, which follow from quantum mechanical calculations. The basis for this was the spectral line research (Balmer series) by Johann Jakob Balmer.  Honors  *The lunar crater Ritz is named after him. References * Jean-Claude Pont (ed.)

Biography Christmas was born to a British family in London. He was the son of film and television actor Eric Christmas. He emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with his family, and was there at the age of 2 years that hemophilia was diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children. The family returned to London in 1952 to visit their relatives, and during the trip Stephen was admitted to hospital. A sample of his blood was sent to the Oxford Haemophilia Centre in Oxford, where Rosemary Biggs and Robert Gwyn Macfarlane discovered that he was not deficient in Factor VIII, which is normally decreased in classic hemophilia, but a different protein, which received the name Christmas factor in his honour (and later Factor IX). Stephen enrolled in the Ryerson Institute of Technology (now Ryerson University) in Toronto studying photography. He worked as a taxicab driver after graduation and was employed for some years as a medical photographer at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Stephen was dependent on blood and plasma transfusions, and was infected with HIV in the period during which blood was not routinely screened for this virus. He became an active worker for the Canadian Hemophilia Society and campaigned for transfusion safety ever since getting infected, but developed AIDS, of which he died from in 1993.

The film tells the story of a strange figure committing murder in a contemporary community that is not far from another community that believes in ancient evil and curses. It stars Ernest Borgnine, Maren Jensen, Susan Buckner (both women making their last feature film screen appearances), and Sharon Stone in an early role. AllMovie comments that the film \\"finds director Wes Craven in a transitional phase between his hard-hitting early work and his later commercial successes.\\"  Plot  Martha (Maren Jensen) and Jim Schmidt (Douglas Barr) live on an isolated farm named 'Our Blessing', where most of its population are \\"Hittites\\", an austere religious community who, according to one of the characters, \\"make the Amish look like swingers\\". Jim was a Hittite, but left the community when he got married. Jim tells a neighbor, Louisa Stohler (Lois Nettleton), who is the mother of Faith (Lisa Hartman), that his wife, Martha, is pregnant and that Louisa's services as a midwife will soon be needed by them. Louisa and Faith are not part of the Hittite community, either. In fact, they do not like them due in part to the constant harassment of Faith by William Gluntz (Michael Berryman), who chases her and calls her, and all \\"outsides\\", \\"Incubus.\\" That night, Jim searches in the barn after hearing strange noises from inside, but is murdered when a mysterious figure runs him over with his tractor. This is alleged to be a mechanical accident. Friends Lana Marcus (Sharon Stone) and Vicky Anderson (Susan Buckner) visit Martha after Jim's funeral. When William goes to the house at night to search for his shoe he accidentally left earlier when sneaking around, he is stabbed through the back by an unseen figure. The following day, William's father and Jim's father and the leader of the Hittites, Isaiah Schmidt (Ernest Borgnine) come to the farm looking for William after he does not return home after being sent by his father to retrieve a \\"lost\\" shoe. Martha tells the men she has no idea where William is and they start to leave, Isaiah goes back to the door and offers to buy back the farm from Martha but Martha refuses, after Isaiah insults her and calls her the incubus, she asks him if he would like his answer immediately, and \\"answers\\" by slamming the door in his face. Martha is now being accused of being the incubus. Lana enters the barn the next day to look for something in the barn, inside a toolbox for the tractor but all the doors and windows suddenly close, trapping her inside. In a panic, she searches for a way out but encounters a figure dressed in black. When escaping out the now open barn door, William's corpse swoops down at her, hanging from a rope. The police clean up the mess as the sheriff (Kevin Cooney) advises the three friends to leave town, as someone may be after them. However, Martha decides to stay where she is and buys a gun for protection. Multiple events follow, such as a snake being put into Martha's bathroom while she's taking a bath by an unseen figure who creeps in her house. She manages to get out of the bath tub and kill the snake with a fireplace poker. John Schmidt (Jeff East), Martha's brother-in-law is unwillingly engaged to Melissa (Colleen Riley) his cousin. However John feels attracted to Vicky. John is eventually sent away from home and the community when he retaliates against his father who begins hitting him. John meets Vicky outside the cinema and she lets John drive her car, giving him a sense of freedom. They stop at the side of a road and begin to make out but they are attacked by an unseen figure who stabs John multiple times and sets fire to the car, which eventually blows up with Vicky still inside. Lana has a nightmare in which a pair of hands take hold of her head, forcing her to open her mouth as a spider falls in. When she wakes up she finds blood in a milk carton as Martha finds a scarecrow tied in her room with a flower that was buried with Jim. When Martha hurries to Jim's grave she finds him dug up. Martha also discovers it was Louisa and Faith who committed the murders as they attack Melissa. Martha is chased back to her home where she engages in a quick battle with Faith. During the struggle, Faith's shirt is ripped open, revealing her to be a man who has been in love with Martha. Lana and Martha have to fight Louisa and Faith. When Martha shoots Faith she is confronted by Louisa with a shotgun. Fortunately, she too is shot by Lana. However, Faith has survived her gunshot and tries to kill Martha once more, but she is killed when Melissa stabs her in the back. Isaiah turns up and tells them that the messenger of incubus is now dead. The day after, Lana leaves Martha to go back to LA. When Martha enters her home a ghost of Jim warns her about the incubus. The film ends immediately after the real incubus bursts through the floor and pulls Martha back into the floor.

A real spider was dropped into Stone's mouth; she initially rejected participating in the scene until the spider was defanged. Actor Michael Berryman had previously worked with Craven on The Hills Have Eyes playing a similar character. Universal, the primary distributor for PolyGram-produced films at the time, chose not to pick up the finished project; it was instead released in theatres by United Artists and was the final United Artists film released in the Transamerica era before being acquired by MGM in the same year.  Reception  Academy Award-winner Ernest Borgnine was nominated for a Razzie award for \\"Worst Supporting Actor\\" for this movie. Deadly Blessing has been poorly received by critics. It currently holds a 17% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 6 reviews with an average rating of 4.4/10. AllMovie called the film ultimately disappointing, but wrote that it has \\"enough eccentricities and stylish flourishes to make it worthwhile for fans of vintage horror.\\" Time Out wrote, \\"Deadly Blessing isn't a very good movie, but it holds out distinct promise that Craven will soon be in the front rank of horror filmmakers\\", calling it \\"an excellent example of a mundane project elevated into quite a palatable genre movie by its director.\\" Home media On January 22, 2013, Shout!

In 1909, financial difficulties, as well as physical and mental health problems, led to his suicide. Life and works =Scotland= He was born at Barrhead, East Renfrewshire as the son of Alexander Davidson, an Evangelical Union minister and Helen n√©e Crocket of Elgin.Victor Plarr (1895) Men and Women of the Time His family removed to Greenock in 1862 where he was educated at Highlanders' Academy there and entered the chemical laboratory of Walker's Sugarhouse refinery in his 13th year, returning after one year to school as a pupil teacher. In Public Analysts' Office, 1870‚Äì71. In these employments he developed an interest in science which became an important characteristic of his poetry. In 1872 he returned for four years to the Highlanders' Academy as a pupil-teacher, and, after a year at Edinburgh University (1876‚Äì77), received in 1877 his first scholastic employment at Alexander's Charity, Glasgow. During the next six years he held positions in the following schools : Perth Academy (1878‚Äì81), Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow (1881‚Äì82), and Hutchinson's Charity, Paisley (1883‚Äì84). He varied his career by spending a year as clerk in a Glasgow thread firm (1884‚Äì85), and subsequently taught in Morrison's Academy, Crieff (1885‚Äì88), and in a private school at Greenock (1888‚Äì89). =London= Having taken to literature, he went in 1889 to London where he frequented 'Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese' and joined the 'Rhymers' Club'.The Oxford Guide to Literary Britain & Ireland (2009) Oxford University PressRobert Farquharson Sharp (1904) A Dictionary of English Authors, Biographical and Bibliographical, K. Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Co., London Davidson's first published work was Bruce, a chronicle play in the Elizabethan manner, which appeared with a Glasgow imprint in 1886. Four other plays, Smith, a Tragic Farce (1888), An Unhistorical Pastoral (1889), Aromantic Farce (1889), and the brilliant pantomimic Scaramouch in Naxos (1889) were also published while he was in Scotland.Ian Hamilton (1996) The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English, Oxford University Press Besides writing for the Speaker, the Glasgow Herald, and other papers, he produced several novels and tales, of which the best was Perfervid (1890). But these prose works were written for a livelihood. =Verse= John Davidson Davidson's true medium was verse. In a Music Hall and other Poems (1891) suggested what Fleet Street Eclogues (1893) proved, that Davidson possessed a genuine and distinctive poetic gift. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read both these volumes in one day in 1893 at the British Museum Library.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.317 Yeats had words of praise for In a Music Hall. He called it, \\"An example of a new writer seeking out 'new subject matter, new emotions'\\". Yeats wrote of his emotional dispute with Davidson in Autobiographies (1955). The second collection established his reputation among the discerning few. His early plays were republished in one volume in 1894, and henceforward he turned his attention more and more completely to verse. A volume of vigorous Ballads and Songs (1894), his most popular work, which Davidson sent a copy of to George Gissing, who wrote that it \\"gave me thoughts\\",Coustillas, p.356. was followed in turn by a second series of Fleet Street Eclogues (1896) and by New Ballads (1897) and The Last Ballad (1899). =Dramatic works= For a time he abandoned lyric for the drama, writing several original plays. ='Testaments'= Finally Davidson engaged on a series of \\"Testaments\\", in which he gave definite expression to his philosophy. These volumes were entitled The Testament of a Vivisector (1901),The Testament of a Man Forbid (1901), The Testament of an Empire Builder (1902), and The Testament of John Davidson (1908). Though he disclaimed the title of philosopher, he expounded an original philosophy which was at once materialistic and aristocratic. The cosmic process, as interpreted by evolution, was for him a fruitful source of inspiration. His later verse, which is often fine rhetoric rather than poetry, expressed the belief which is summed up in the last words that he wrote, \\"Men are the universe become conscious; the simplest man should consider himself too great to be called after any name.\\" The corollary was that every man was to be himself to the utmost of his power, and the strongest was to rule. Davidson professed to reject all existing philosophies, including that of Nietzsche, as inadequate, but Nietzsche's influence is traceable in his argument. The poet planned ultimately to embody his revolutionary creed in a trilogy entitled God and Mammon. Only two plays, however, were written, The Triumph of Mammon (1907) and Mammon and his Message (1908). =Family= In 1885 Davidson married Margaret, daughter of John McArthur of Perth.Who's Who: An Annual Biographical Dictionary (1898) A. & C. Black She survived him with two sons, Alexander (b. 1887) and Menzies (b. 1889). =Other works= Portrait of John Davidson by William Rothenstein in The Yellow Book, Vol. 4 (1895) Davidson was a prolific writer. Besides the works cited, he wrote many other works including, The Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender (1895), a novel which included flagellation erotica and contributed an introduction to Shakespeare's Sonnets (Renaissance edition, 1908), which, like his various prefaces and essays, shows him a subtle literary critic. =Translations= He translated Montesquieu's Lettres Persanes (1892), Fran√ßois Copp√©e's Pour la Couronne in 1896 and Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas in 1904, the former being produced as, For the Crown, at the Lyceum Theatre in 1896, the latter as A Queen's Romance at the Imperial Theatre. =Portraits= Woodcut of John Davidson by Robert Bryden 1902 Davidson's portrait was drawn by Walter Sickert and by Robert Bryden.William Archer (1902) Poets of the Younger Generation, with thirty-three full page portraits from woodcuts by Robert Bryden, J. Lane, The Bodley Head, London A caricature by Max Beerbohm appeared in The Chapbook, (1907), and William Rothenstein did a portrait of him for The Yellow Book. In Men and Memories (1931), Rothenstein said that when Max Beerbohm looked at his pictures of Davidson, he had complimented him on the 'subtle way he had handled his toup√©e'. Rothenstein wrote that he had not noticed that he was wearing one.William Rothenstein (1931) Men and Memories, A History of the Arts 1872 to 1922 Frank Harris, a member of the Rhymers' Club described him in 1889 thus: > \\"... a little below middle height, but strongly built with square shoulders > and remarkably fine face and head; the features were almost classically > regular, the eyes dark brown and large, the forehead high, the hair and > moustache black. His manners were perfectly frank and natural; he met > everyone in the same unaffected kindly human way; I never saw a trace in him > of snobbishness or incivility. Possibly a great man, I said to myself, > certainly a man of genius, for simplicity of manner alone is in England > almost a proof of extraordinary endowment.\\"Frank Harris (1915) Contemporary > Portraits, Mitchell Kennerley, New York Norman Alford (1996) The Rhymers' > Club: Poets of the Tragic Generation , Palgrave Macmillan =Drowning= 'Missing' poster 1909 In 1906 he was awarded a civil list pension of ¬£100 per annum and George Bernard Shaw did what he could to help him financially, but poverty, ill-health, and his declining powers, exacerbated by the onset of cancer, caused profound hopelessness and clinical depression. Late in 1908, Davidson left London to reside at Penzance. On 23 March 1909, he disappeared from his house there, under circumstances which left little doubt that he had drowned himself. Among his papers was found the manuscript of a new work, Fleet Street Poems, with a letter containing the words, \\"This will be my last book.\\" His body, which was discovered by some fishermen in Mount's Bay on 18 September, was, in accordance with his known wishes, buried at sea. In his will he desired that no biography should be written, none of his unpublished works published, and \\"no word except of my writing is ever to appear in any book of mine as long as the copyright endures.\\" The assumption that he took his own life is consistent with what is known of his temperament and his ideas. In The Testament of John Davidson, published the year before his death, he anticipates this fate: :\\"None should outlive his power. . . . Who kills : Himself subdues the conqueror of kings; : Exempt from death is he who takes his life; : My time has come.\\"Holbrook Jackson (1914) The eighteen nineties, a review of art and ideas at the close of the nineteenth century =Influence on other poets= Davidson's poetry was a key early influence on important Modernist poets, in particular, his compatriot Hugh MacDiarmidThe Oxford Companion to English Literature (2010) Oxford University Press and Wallace Stevens. T.S. Eliot was especially fond of the poem 'Thirty Bob a Week' (In Ballads and Songs (1894)).

The boundary with the London Borough of Redbridge is immediately to the east of the station buildings. The station is between Hainault and Chigwell stations. The station has been in Travelcard Zone 4 since 2 January 2007. History The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 1 May 1903 on their Fairlop Loop line between Woodford and Ilford. As a consequence of the 1921 Railways Act, the GER was merged with other railway companies in 1923 to become part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). As part of the 1935 - 1940 New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board the majority of the Woodford to Ilford loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line. Although work commenced in 1938 it was suspended upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and work only recommenced in 1946. In connection with the alterations required for the electrification of the line, the station was closed from 29 November 1947. It reopened and was first served by the Central line from 21 November 1948. The station ticket office was reconstructed as part of this work following destruction of the original building by a German V1 'Doodlebug' in July 1944. The 1903 building was very similar to the next station to the north, Chigwell, which is still largely untouched to this day, and the original building further south at Newbury Park, demolished in 1956 to make way for a road improvement. View of platforms From the mid-1960s until the early 1990s the Woodford-Hainault section was largely separately operated from the rest of the Central line, using four car (later three car) trains of 1960 Stock. These trains were adapted for Automatic Train Operation (ATO); the Woodford-Hainault section became the testing ground for ATO on the Victoria line. The separate operation has now been abolished and through trains to Central London via Hainault now operate. At the beginning of the morning and evening peak periods, some trains starting from Hainault depot enter service at Grange Hill and work to central London via Woodford, although in the current timetable, only one train returns to Hainault depot via Grange Hill, the majority doing so instead via Newbury Park and Hainault. The tunnel between Grange Hill and Chigwell Since 5 February 2006 this has been one of the small number of stations on the network to have no staffed ticket office. However, staff are available 24 hours a day for customer information and the train service has been extended to midnight to take into account the rising passenger numbers. Services Typical off-peak services are: *3 trains per hour to Hainault *3 trains per hour to Woodford At morning rush hour, there are three trains that run to West Ruislip. Connections London Buses routes 362 and 462 and Local School route 43 Times serve the station.

Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the people the organization interacts with, it grounds the group so it can actualize some existential impact on the world. General Philosophy A vision statement provides direction, it sets a course toward a future that tells the people in that organization what the group believes, how to behave, and what kinds of decisions to make without explicitly doing so. As a result, a vision - to have vision - means to imagine a world that does not yet exist and intends to inspire people to make it a reality. For an individual, organization, company, etc., what that person or company does and how they do it have nothing to do with its vision statement. Products and services that one wants to provide are never mentioned in a vision. If it did, the company vision would be limited only to producing what was mentioned in the vision. (Not only that, it's boring and uninspiring to do so.) Rather, the actions an organization or individual take (i.e., making or providing something) rationalize the reason for existence spelled out in the vision - they make sense of it. A vision statement must be written in infinite terms and is not changeable, once decided it is locked. If the company changes the vision based on events like market conditions, current technology, or social media trends the company risks the very foundation for its creation. If it changes it's vision on whims, it will inevitably perform poorly financially, operationally, technologically, or all of these because it is making decisions based on near term results only. The vision is not a roadmap, strategy, or product/service specific execution plan, but it does guide all of these. Vision should also not to be confused with a mission. A mission is time bound, contains a specific goal and purpose for the task, and can be altered or changed based on near real-time conditions of the business, i.e., it is what the leader wants to accomplish right now, it is finite. The proper formula for realization of a vision must contain the intended emotion the founder will project plus the impact that emotion will have on anyone other than the group or individual (founder) that created it. If it is written in selfish terms, it will never have the intended impact. The statement must be crafted so as to give something to other people. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_with_Why https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game A consensus does not exist on the characteristics of a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" vision statement. Commonly cited traits include: * concise: able to be easily remembered and repeated * clear: defines a prime goal * Time horizon: defines a time horizon * future-oriented: describes where the company is going rather than the current state * stable: offers a long-term perspective and is unlikely to be impacted by market or technology changes * challenging: not something that can be easily met and discarded * abstract: general enough to encompass all of the organization's interests and strategic direction * inspiring: motivates employees and is something that employees view as desirable Purpose Vision statements may fill the following functions for a company: * Serve as foundations for a broader strategic plan * Motivate existing employees and attract potential employees by clearly categorizing the company's goals and attracting like- minded individuals * Focus company efforts and facilitate the creation of core competencies by directing the company to only focus on strategic opportunities that advance the company's vision * Help companies differentiate from competitors. E.g., profit is a common business goal, however this is an incorrect identification of the target. Profit is a merely a result of the activities a business performs and the company becomes profitable by performing activities that are in agreement with the vision statement. Take Apple for example: creating great products is a central tenet of their vision and as a result, they are a $1T company. =Relevance= While a consensus does not exist on the value of mission and vision statements, literature supporting the relevance of these documents to companies outweighs those opposed to them. This may be due to, among other reasons, the positive value of the tools in communicating to internal and external stakeholders or retrospective attempts to legitimize the use of these tools. Challenges Creating and implementing vision statements presents challenges to organizations. They can be challenging to write because they must balance being forward-looking and describing an ideal state without becoming so idealistic that the vision is unattainable. Vision statements can be an employee disaster when staff feel the company's vision is filled with business buzzwords unrelated to the company's origin and purpose. A vision statement may need to be paired with company initiatives to communicate and reinforce the vision, ensure processes align with the vision, and empower and incentivize employees to take actions that support the company vision.

The popular holiday song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", in its Finnish translation, Petteri Punakuono, has led to Rudolph's general acceptance in Finland as Joulupukki's lead reindeer. Joulupukki is often mentioned as having a wife, Joulumuori (\\"Old Lady Christmas\\"), but tradition says little of her. Joulupukki's other side Pagans used to have festivities to honour the return of the sun and some believe Joulupukki is the earliest form of present-day Santa. The Yule Goat was thought by some to be an ugly creature and frightened children while others believe it was an invisible creature that helped prepare for Yule. Most theorists believe when Christianity began incorporating Pagan ways into their festivals in order to justify the action, they merged the Pagan figure with an already existing Catholic legend known as Saint Nicholas to create Santa Claus. Popular radio programs from the year 1927 onwards probably had great influence in reformatting the concept with the Santa-like costume, reindeer and Korvatunturi as his dwelling place. Because there really are reindeer in Finland, and Finns live up North, the popular American story took root in Finland very quickly. Finland's Joulupukki receives over 500,000 letters from over 200 countries every year. Most letters come from China, Poland and Italy. Joulupukki is a prominent character in Rare Exports, a movie based on the award-winning shorts by Jalmari Helander.

Thus, the GCD is 22 √ó 3 = 12. The binary GCD algorithm, also known as Stein's algorithm, is an algorithm that computes the greatest common divisor of two nonnegative integers. Stein's algorithm uses simpler arithmetic operations than the conventional Euclidean algorithm; it replaces division with arithmetic shifts, comparisons, and subtraction. Although the algorithm was first published by the Israeli physicist and programmer Josef Stein in 1967, it may have been known in 1st-century China. Algorithm The algorithm reduces the problem of finding the GCD of two nonnegative numbers v and u by repeatedly applying these identities: * gcd(0, v) = v, because everything divides zero, and v is the largest number that divides v. Similarly, gcd(u, 0) = u. * gcd(2u, 2v) = 2¬∑gcd(u, v) * gcd(2u, v) = gcd(u, v), if v is odd (2 is not a common divisor). Similarly, gcd(u, 2v) = gcd(u, v) if u is odd. * gcd(u, v) = gcd(|u ‚àí v|, min(u, v)), if u and v are both odd. For word-sized integers, the algorithm requires a number of machine operations on the order of log(max(u, v)). Asymptotically, the algorithm requires O(n2) worst-case time, where n is the number of bits in the larger of the two numbers: although each step reduces at least one of the operands by at least a factor of 2, the subtract and shift operations take linear time (one machine operation per word of the representation). An extended binary GCD, analogous to the extended Euclidean algorithm, can provide the B√©zout coefficients in addition to the GCD, i.e. integers a and b such that a¬∑u + b¬∑v = gcd(u, v)., answer to exercise 39 of section 4.5.2 Implementation =Recursive version in C= Following is a recursive implementation of the algorithm in C. The implementation is similar to the description of the algorithm given above. It uses two arguments u and v. All but one of the recursive calls are tail recursive. unsigned int gcd(unsigned int u, unsigned int v) { // simple cases (termination) if (u  v) return u; if (u  0) return v; if (v  0) return u; // look for factors of 2 if (~u & 1) // u is even if (v & 1) // v is odd return gcd(u >> 1, v); else // both u and v are even return gcd(u >> 1, v >> 1) << 1; if (~v & 1) // u is odd, v is even return gcd(u, v >> 1); // reduce larger argument if (u > v) return gcd(u - v, v); return gcd(v - u, u); } =Iterative version in C= Following is an implementation of the algorithm in C, taking two (non-negative) integer arguments u and v. It first removes all common factors of 2 using identity 2, then computes the GCD of the remaining numbers using identities 3 and 4, and combines these to form the final answer. unsigned int gcd(unsigned int u, unsigned int v) { unsigned int shift = 0; /* GCD(0,v)  v; GCD(u,0)  u, GCD(0,0)  0 */ if (u  0) return v; if (v  0) return u; /* Let shift := lg K, where K is the greatest power of 2 dividing both u and v. */ while (((u v) & 1)  0) { shift++; u >>= 1; v >>= 1; } while ((u & 1)  0) u >>= 1; /* From here on, u is always odd. */ do { /* remove all factors of 2 in v -- they are not common */ /* note: v is not zero, so while will terminate */ while ((v & 1)  0) v >>= 1; /* Now u and v are both odd. Swap if necessary so u <= v, then set v = v - u (which is even). For bignums, the swapping is just pointer movement, and the subtraction can be done in-place. */ if (u > v) { unsigned int t = v; v = u; u = t; // Swap u and v. } v -= u; // Here v >= u. } while (v != 0); /* restore common factors of 2 */ return u << shift; } =Iterative version in Rust= Following is an implementation of the algorithm in Rust, adapted from uutils. It removes all common factors of 2, using identity 2 and a fast bitwise primitive (u64::trailing_zeros), then computes the GCD of the remaining numbers using identities 3 and 4, combining these to form the final answer. pub fn gcd(mut u: u64, mut v: u64) -> u64 { use std::cmp::min; use std::mem::swap; // Base cases: gcd(n, 0) = gcd(0, n) = n if u  0 { return v; } else if v  0 { return u; } // Using identities 2 and 3: // gcd(2‚Å± u, 2 ≤ v) = 2·µè gcd(u, v) with u, v odd and k = min(i, j) // 2·µè is the greatest power of two that divides both u and v let i = u.trailing_zeros(); u >>= i; let j = v.trailing_zeros(); v >>= j; let k = min(i, j); loop { // u and v are odd at the start of the loop debug_assert!(u % 2  1, \\"u = {} is even\\", u); debug_assert!(v % 2  1, \\"v = {} is even\\", v); // Swap if necessary so u <= v if u > v { swap(&mut; u, &mut; v); } // Using identity 4 (gcd(u, v) = gcd(|v-u|, min(u, v)) v -= u; if v  0 { return u << k; } // Identity 3: gcd(u, 2 ≤ v) = gcd(u, v) (u is known to be odd) v >>= v.trailing_zeros(); } } Efficiency Akhavi and Vall√©e proved that binary GCD is about 60% more efficient on average, in terms of the number of bit operations, than the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm achieves the same asymptotic complexity as the Euclidean algorithm, though neither is the fastest for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, as they both take quadratic time (with regards to the input's size, i.e. the number of digits). Instead, recursive methods that combine ideas from the binary GCD algorithm with the Sch√∂nhage‚ÄìStrassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can find GCDs in near-linear time.. Historical description An algorithm for computing the GCD of two numbers was described in the ancient Chinese mathematics book The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. The original algorithm was used to reduce a fraction. The description reads: \\"If possible halve it; otherwise, take the denominator and the numerator, subtract the lesser from the greater, and do that alternately to make them the same. Reduce by the same number.\\" This description looks like a normal Euclidean algorithm, but there is ambiguity in the phrase \\"if possible halve it\\". The traditional interpretation is that this only applies when 'both' numbers are even, implying the algorithm is just slightly inferior to the Euclidean algorithm (for using subtraction instead of division). But the phrase may mean dividing by 2 should 'either' of the numbers become even, in which case it is the binary GCD algorithm.

Early life  He was born in 1917 in Hyderabad Hunza, to a Burushaski speaking religious family. In his early childhood, he was inclined towards the esoteric meanings of Islam. He was inspired by the preachings and teachings of Pir Nasir Khusraw. Allamah Nasir was also a Sufi poet and writer. He has written numerous books on the topics of the Quran, Islam, Sufism, Isma'ilism and spirituality in general. His books have been translated into English, French, Swedish, Persian, Turkish and Gujarati. He is the first person to have a Diwan of poetry in Burushaski, his mother tongue, and is known as \\"Baba-i Burushaski\\" (Father of Burushaski) for his services to that language. He also composed poetry in three other languages: Urdu, Persian and Turkish. His contribution to spiritual science is widely recognised. The former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf conferred upon Nasir al-Din Hunzai the award of Sitara-i-Imtiaz on 23 March 2001 in recognition of his outstanding services in the fields of literature and scholarship. He developed the first Burushaski-German dictionary in association with Heidelberg University, Germany. He had worked with a group of volunteers from Gilgit-Baltistan in the development of the first Burushaski- English dictionary in association with Heidelberg University, Germany.  Lifetime Achievements  In his 100 years life, overcoming a lack of secular education in the isolated mountain fastness of Hunza, Northern Areas of Pakistan, he left a legacy of over a hundred books related to the esoteric interpretation of the Quran. He has written both prose as well as poetry. He is the first person to have a Diwan of poetry in Burushaski, his mother tongue, which is a language isolated and is known as \\"Baba-yi Burushaski\\" (Father of Burushaski) for his services to it. He has composed poetry in three other languages: Persian, Urdu and Turkish. He coined the term \\"Spiritual Science\\" and his contribution to it is widely recognized. His work includes \\"The Wise Quran and the World of Humanity\\", \\"Book of Healing\\" \\"Practical Sufism and Spiritual Science\\", \\"Balance of Realities\\" and \\"What is Soul?\\". He co-authored a German-Burushaski Dictionary with Professor Berger of Heidelberg University and \\"\\"Hunza Proverbs\\" with Professor Tiffou of University of Montreal, Canada. He collected and provided the material for a Burushaski-Urdu dictionary, prepared by the Burushaski Research Academy (BRA) and published by Karachi University.

The English word ghetto is derived from the Jewish ghetto in Venice. The Venetian Ghetto was instituted on 29 March 1516. It was not the first time that Jews in Venice were compelled to live in a segregated area of the city. In 1552 Venice had 160,000 inhabitants, including 900 Jews, who were mainly merchants. In 1797 the French Army of Italy, commanded by the 28-year-old General Napoleon Bonaparte, occupied Venice, forced the Venetian Republic to dissolve itself on 12 May 1797, and ended the ghetto's separation from the city on 11 July 1797. In the 19th century, the ghetto was renamed the Contrada dell'unione. Etymology Location of Cannaregio district in Venice The origins of the name ghetto (gh√®to in the Venetian tongue) are disputed. The following theories have been proposed: *ghetto comes from \\"giotto\\" or \\"geto\\", meaning \\"foundry\\", since the first Jewish quarter was near a foundry that once made canons. *ghetto formerly meant \\"street\\" (like German Gasse, Swedish gata, and Gothic gatwo) *ghetto, from Italian getto, which is the act of, or the resulting object from, pouring molted metal into a mold, as old state foundries existed in this city quarter *ghetto comes from borghetto, diminutive of borgo, meaning \\"little town\\" *ghetto is related to the Hebrew word get, meaning a divorce document. The Oxford University Press etymologist Anatoly Liberman suggested in 2009 that all four theories are speculative, but the first is by far the likeliest to be true. Donatella Calabi, faculty member of IUAV University Venice, Architecture, Construction and Conservation, argued in the documentary Venice and the Ghetto (2017, Klaus T. Steindl) that ghetto comes from the Italian word gettare [d íet¬∑Ààta:¬∑re] which means \\"throw away\\", because the area was before then a waste dump for foundries. The first Jewish arrivals were German and they pronounced the word [Àà…°…õto] - the spelling followed (\\"h\\" after \\"g\\" changes [d í] to [Àà…°]). The same opinion was published in her book Venezia e il ghetto. Cinquecento anni del \\"recinto deli ebrei\\". Likewise, the author of Ghetto: The History of a Word, Daniel B. Schwartz, argues that the term ghetto did not emerge as a result of Jewish resident segregation, but rather, that the word is a relic of a history that preceded the arrival of the Jewish residents. Schwartz states that the strongest argument in support of this is how the original area to which Jews were restricted was called the Ghetto Nuovo, and not the Ghetto Vecchio. \\"Were it otherwise, one would expect that the first site of the Jewish enclosure would have been known as the 'Old Ghetto' and the subsequent addition as the 'New Ghetto.'\\" Location and geography Ponte de Gheto Novo The Ghetto is an area of the Cannaregio sestiere of Venice, divided into the Ghetto Nuovo (\\"New Ghetto\\"), and the adjacent Ghetto Vecchio (\\"Old Ghetto\\"). These names of the ghetto sections are misleading, as they refer to an older and newer site at the time of their use by the foundries: in terms of Jewish residence, the Ghetto Nuovo is actually older than the Ghetto Vecchio. The ghetto was connected to the rest of the city by two bridges that were only open during the day. Gates were opened in the morning at the ringing of the marangona, the largest bell in St. Mark's Campanile, and locked in the evening. Permanent, round-the-clock surveillance of the gates occurred at the Jewish residents' expense. Strict penalties were to be imposed on any Jewish resident caught outside after curfew. Areas of Ghetto Nuovo that were open to the canal were to be sealed off with walls, while outward facing quays were to be bricked over in order to make it impossible for unauthorized entry or exit. Culture The Levantine Synagogue Though it was home to a large number of Jews, the population living in the Venetian Ghetto never assimilated to form a distinct, \\"Venetian Jewish\\" ethnicity. Four of the five synagogues were clearly divided according to ethnic identity: separate synagogues existed for the German (the Scuola Grande Tedesca), Italian (the Scuola Italiana), Spanish and Portuguese (the Scuola Spagnola), and Levantine Sephardi communities (the Scuola Levantina). The fifth, the Scuola Canton, was possibly built as a private synagogue and also served the Venetian Ashkenazi community. Today, there are also other populations of Ashkenazic Jews in Venice, mainly Lubavitchers who operate a kosher food store, a yeshiva, and a Chabad synagogue. Languages historically spoken in the confines of the Ghetto include Venetian, Italian, Judeo-Spanish, French, and German. In addition, Hebrew was traditionally (and still is) used on signage, inscriptions, and for official purposes such as wedding contracts (as well as, of course, in religious services). Today, English is widely used in the shops and the Museum because of the large number of English-speaking tourists. Ghetto today The Info Point of the Jewish Community of Venice in the Old Ghetto A Lubavitch Yeshivah in the former Ghetto of Venice A memorial plaque to Venice's Holocaust victims in Campo del Ghetto Nuovo, Venice Today, the Ghetto is still a center of Jewish life in the city. The Jewish community of Venice,Jewish Community of Venice that counts about 450 people, is culturally active, although only a few members live in the Ghetto because the area has become expensive. Every year, there is an international conference on Hebrew Studies, with particular reference to the history and culture of the Veneto. Other conferences, exhibitions and seminars are held throughout the course of the year. The temples not only serve as places of worship but also provide lessons on the sacred texts and the Talmud for both children and adults, along with courses in Modern Hebrew, while other social facilities include a kindergarten, an old people's home, the kosher guest house Giardino dei Melograni, the kosher restaurant Hostaria del Ghetto, and a bakery. Along with its architectural and artistic monuments, the community also boasts a Museum of Jewish Art, the Renato Maestro Library and Archive and the new Info Point inside the Midrash Leon da Modena. In the Ghetto area there is also a yeshiva, several Judaica shops, and a Chabad synagogue run by Chabad of Venice.Chabad of Venice Although only few of the roughly 500 Venetian Jews still live in the Ghetto,Jewish Venice many return there during the day for religious services in the two synagogues which are still used (the other three are only used for guided tours, offered by the Jewish Community Museum). Chabad of Venice also runs a pastry shop and a restaurant named \\"Gam Gam\\" in the Ghetto. Sabbath meals are served at the restaurant's outdoor tables along the Cannaregio Canal with views of the Guglie Bridge near the Grand Canal.Rick Steves' Venice, Rick Steves, Avalon Travel, 2007, p. 40.Friends Find Real Flavor of Europe, Jewish Journal of Greater L.A., 15 July 2004. In the novel Much Ado About Jesse Kaplan the restaurant is the site of a historical mystery. Every year for the festival of Sukkot a sukkah is built on a canal boat that tours the city, a large menorah tours the city on a canal boat during Hanukkah. Notable residents Notable residents of the Ghetto have included Leon of Modena, whose family originated in France, as well as his disciple Sara Copia Sullam. She was an accomplished writer, debater (through letters), and even hosted her own salon.

He is also known for directing Night of the Demon, which was released by Columbia Pictures. While in Hollywood, he was usually addressed by his anglicized name \\"Jack Turner\\", a literal and phonetic translation of his name in English. Life Born in Paris, France, Tourneur was the son of Fernande Petit and film director Maurice Tourneur.Earnshaw 2004, p. 102 At age 10, Jacques moved to the United States with his father. He started a career in cinema while still attending high school as an extra and later as a script clerk in various silent films. Both Maurice and Jacques returned to France after his father worked on the film The Mysterious Island in 1925. Tourneur died in 1977 in Bergerac, Dordogne, France. Career Tourneur began work as an editor and assistant director. He made his debut as a director on the French film ' in 1931. Tourneur went back to Hollywood in 1934 where he had a contract with MGM Studios. While working as the second unit director on the film A Tale of Two Cities he met film producer Val Lewton. Tourneur made his feature debut as director in the 1939 film They All Come Out. After Tourneur was dropped by MGM in 1941, he was picked up by Lewton to film several acclaimed low-budget horror films for RKO Studios including Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie. Cat People was considered to be a B movie and didn't have a very big budget, yet the style of lighting and cinematography gave it an edge that has been imitated countless times. Tourneur was promoted to the A-list at RKO, directing films including Out of the Past and Berlin Express. In the 1950s, Tourneur became a freelance director, filming excellent various genre films including Wichita, Anne of the Indies, Way of a Gaucho, Nightfall, The Flame and the Arrow, Stars In My Crown and Night of the Demon. His last films both starred Vincent Price, with The Comedy of Terrors (1963) and War-Gods of the Deep (1965) for American International Pictures. After his final days working for film, Tourneur began directing television episodes. Tourneur filmed episodes of The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, and The Alaskans. Tourneur's final director credit was for an episode of T.H.E. Cat in 1966. Tourneur then retired and returned to France.

Especially associated with the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. The term derives from a word used by the low-land Yucatec Maya‚Äî‚Äîto refer to any location with accessible groundwater. Cenotes are common geological forms in low altitude regions, particularly on islands, coastlines, and platforms with young post-Paleozoic limestones that have little soil development. Definition and description The Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, Mexico Cenotes are surface connections to subterranean water bodies. While the best- known cenotes are large open water pools measuring tens of meters in diameter, such as those at Chichen Itza in Mexico, the greatest number of cenotes are smaller sheltered sites and do not necessarily have any surface exposed water. Some cenotes are completely underground, and only accessed via narrow staircases dug through the rock, such as the cenotes Cenote Choo-Ha, Tamcach- Ha, and Multum-Ha near Tulum. There are over 6,000 different cenotes in the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico alone. The term cenote has also been used to describe similar karst features in other countries such as Cuba and Australia, in addition to the more generic term of sinkholes. Cenote water is often very clear, as the water comes from rain water filtering slowly through the ground, and therefore contains very little suspended particulate matter. The groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow. In many cases, cenotes are areas where sections of cave roof have collapsed revealing an underlying cave system, and the water flow rates may be much faster: up to per day. Cenotes around the world attract cavern and cave divers who have documented extensive flooded cave systems through them, some of which have been explored for lengths of or more.https://caves.org/project/qrss/qrlong.htm Geology and hydrology The Samul√° Cenote in Valladolid, Yucat√°n, Mexico Cenotes are formed by dissolution of rock and the resulting subsurface void, which may or may not be linked to an active cave system, and the subsequent structural collapse. Rock that falls into the water below is slowly removed by further dissolution, creating space for more collapse blocks. The rate of collapse increases during periods when the water table is below the ceiling of the void, since the rock ceiling is no longer buoyantly supported by the water in the void. Cenotes may be fully collapsed creating an open water pool, or partially collapsed with some portion of a rock overhanging above the water. The stereotypical cenotes often resemble small circular ponds, measuring some tens of meters in diameter with sheer drops at the edges. Most cenotes, however, require some degree of stooping or crawling to access the water. =Penetration and extent= Bolonch√©n, Mexico, used as source of water, 1842 In the north and northwest of the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico, the cenotes generally overlie vertically extensive voids penetrating below the modern water table. However, very few of these cenotes appear to be connected with horizontally extensive underground river systems, with water flow through them being more likely dominated by aquifer matrix and fracture flows. In contrast, the cenotes along the Caribbean coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula (within the state of Quintana Roo) often provide access to extensive underwater cave systems, such as Sistema Ox Bel Ha, Sistema Sac Actun/Sistema Nohoch Nah Chich and Sistema Dos Ojos. =Freshwater/seawater interface= The Yucat√°n Peninsula contains a vast coastal aquifer system, which is typically density-stratified. The infiltrating meteoric water (i.e., rainwater) floats on top of higher-density saline water intruding from the coastal margins. The whole aquifer is therefore an anchialine system (one that is land-locked but connected to an ocean). Where a cenote, or the flooded cave to which it is an opening, provides deep enough access into the aquifer, the interface between the fresh and saline water may be reached. The density interface between the fresh and saline waters is a halocline, which means a sharp change in salt concentration over a small change in depth. Mixing of the fresh and saline water results in a blurry swirling effect caused by refraction between the different densities of fresh and saline waters. The depth of the halocline is a function of several factors: climate and specifically how much meteoric water recharges the aquifer, hydraulic conductivity of the host rock, distribution and connectivity of existing cave systems and how effective these are at draining water to the coast, and the distance from the coast. In general, the halocline is deeper further from the coast, and in the Yucat√°n Peninsula this depth is below the water table at the coast, and below the water table in the middle of the peninsula, with saline water underlying the whole of the peninsula. Geological cutaway of Cenote Ik Kil =Types= In 1936, a simple morphometry-based classification system for cenotes was presented. * Cenotes-c√°ntaro (Jug or pit cenotes) are those with a surface connection narrower than the diameter of the water body; * Cenotes-cil√≠ndricos (Cylinder cenotes) are those with strictly vertical walls; * Cenotes-aguadas (Basin cenotes) are those with shallow water basins; and * Grutas (Cave cenotes) are those having a horizontal entrance with dry sections. The classification scheme was based on morphometric observations above the water table, and therefore incompletely reflects the processes by which the cenotes formed and the inherent hydrogeochemical relationship with the underlying flooded cave networks, which were only discovered in the 1980s and later with the initiation of cave diving exploration.  Flora and fauna  Flora and fauna are generally scarcer than in the open ocean; however, marine animals do thrive in caves. In caverns, one can spot mojarras, mollis, guppies, cat-fish, small eels and frogs. In the most secluded and darker cenotes, the fauna has evolved special features to live in an environment deprived of natural light. For example, many animals don't have pigmentation and they are often blind, so they are equipped with long feelers so that they can find food and make their way around in the dark. Chicxulub Crater Radar topography reveals the ring of the crater; clustered around the crater's trough are numerous sinkholes, suggesting a prehistoric oceanic basin in the depression left by the impact (Image courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech). Although cenotes are found widely throughout much of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, a higher-density circular alignment of cenotes overlies the measured rim of the Chicxulub crater. This crater structure, identified from the alignment of cenotes, but also subsequently mapped using geophysical methods (including gravity mapping) and also drilled into with core recovery, has been dated to the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene geologic periods, 66 million years ago. This meteorite impact at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary is therefore associated with the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and is also known as the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. Archaeology and anthropology In 2001‚Äì2002 expeditions led by Arturo H. Gonz√°lez and Carmen Rojas Sandoval in the Yucat√°n discovered three human skeletons; one of them, Eve of Naharon, was carbon-dated to be 13,600 years old. In March 2008, three members of the Proyecto Espeleol√≥gico de Tulum and Global Underwater Explorers dive team, Alex Alvarez, Franco Attolini, and Alberto Nava, explored a section of Sistema Aktun Hu (part of Sistema Sac Actun) known as the pit Hoyo Negro. At a depth of the divers located the remains of a mastodon and a human skull (at ) that might be the oldest evidence of human habitation in the region. The Yucat√°n Peninsula has almost no rivers and only a few lakes, and those are often marshy. The widely distributed cenotes are the only perennial source of potable water and have long been the principal sources of water in much of the region. Major Maya settlements required access to adequate water supplies, and therefore cities, including the famous Chichen Itza, were built around these natural wells. Some cenotes like the Sacred Cenote in Chichen Itza played an important role in Maya rites. Believing that these pools were gateways to the afterlife, the Maya sometimes threw valuable items into them. The discovery of golden sacrificial artifacts in some cenotes led to the archaeological exploration of most cenotes in the first part of the 20th century. Edward Herbert Thompson (1857‚Äì1935), an American diplomat who had bought the Chichen Itza site, began dredging the Sacred Cenote there in 1904. He discovered human skeletons and sacrificial objects confirming a local legend, the Cult of the Cenote, involving human sacrifice to the rain god Chaac by ritual casting of victims and objects into the cenote. The remains of this cultural heritage are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.  Scuba diving  Scuba diving in a cenote Cenotes have attracted cavern and cave divers, and there are organized efforts to explore and map these underwater systems. They are public or private and sometimes considered as \\"National Natural Parks\\". Great care should be taken to avoid spoiling this fragile ecosystem when diving. In Mexico, the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey maintains a list of the longest and deepest water-filled and dry caves within the state boundaries. When cavern diving, one must be able to see natural light the entire time that one is exploring the cavern (e.g. Kukulkan cenote near Tulum, Mexico). During a cave dive, one passes the point where daylight can penetrate and one follows a safety guideline to exit the cave. Things change quite dramatically once moving from a cavern dive into a cave dive. Too many divers, even experienced ones, have died for ignoring safety recommendations. Contrary to cenote cavern diving, cenote cave diving requires special equipment and training (certification for cave diving). However, both cavern and cave diving require detailed briefings, diving experience and weight adjustment to freshwater buoyancy. The cenotes are usually filled with rather cool fresh water. Cenote divers must be wary of possible halocline, this produces a blurred vision until they reach a more homogeneous area.

Plot introduction At the start of World War II a train departs from Salonika and heads for the Italian Alps, carrying a mysterious cargo. Over the next four decades, various members of the wealthy Italian Fontini-Cristi family, and a small brotherhood of priests with the name Xenope, struggle to locate and control the deadly secret cargo. Plot summary =The Train from Salonika= In 1939, Savarone Fontini-Cristi is the padrone of an immensely wealthy and powerful Italian family. At this time, the Order of Xenope, a remote Greek monastic brotherhood, possesses ancient religious manuscripts, some of which, if authentic, are considered to be of enough significance to shatter the Christian religion. The Order of Xenope knows that the Nazis and Italian Fascists are seeking these long-rumored documents so must hide them. Because of his stature as a man of unsurpassed integrity, the Order entrusts the custody of these holiest of relics to Fontini-Cristi. Savarone schedules the circuitous shipment by train from Salonika, through Yugoslavia and Italy, and finally into the Alps. If the contents of the shipment are discovered at any time, the consequences are explosive. =The Executions= Though extremely wealthy, Savarone Fontini-Cristi has grown to abhor the Fascist regime of Il Duce, Benito Mussolini. He actively supports the partigiani, the disorganized Communist opposition to Il Duce. Savarone's involvement with the train from Salonika becomes known to the powerful Roman Catholic Cardinal, Donatti, who must have the hidden documents at any cost. Incorrectly believing that Savarone has shared the secret location of the vault containing the documents with his first-born son, 36-year-old playboy Vittorio, Cardinal Donatti orders the execution of the entire Fontini-Cristi family at the family compound Campo di Fiori, just outside Milan. The family's massacre by an execution squad, consisting of German soldiers overseen by Donatti, is secretly witnessed by Vittorio, who can hardly believe the horror - father, mother, brothers, wives, children - all murdered in front of his eyes. =World War II= To Vittorio Fontini-Cristi's surprise, the British take extraordinary steps to evacuate Vittorio from Italy, expecting that he will tell them of the vault's location. Unfortunately for them, he doesn't know anything about the train from Salonika or its contents. The British take advantage of Vittorio's business skills during World War II, establishing a covert network of displaced European professionals, whose purpose is to discreetly sabotage the business processes of the German war machine: Shipping fiascos and printing mistakes, resulting in mild chaos in the back office of the war effort. The British decided to anglicize his name to Victor Fontine. Throughout the war, periodic incidents arise related to the hidden documents that put Victor's life, and the life of Jane, his new-found bride, in danger. In June 1942, in the midst of a German bombing related to the vault, Jane gives birth to twins, whom she calls her Geminis. Victor vows that, immediately after the war, he will put the mystery of Salonika behind him, and convince his pursuers that he knows nothing about it. At the war's end, he returns to Campo di Fiori, site of the execution grounds, where he hopes to end his involvement with the documents. After barely escaping with his life, he is met at the gates by five zealous priests, including the despised Cardinal Donatti. Proclaiming for the hundredth time that his father never told him about the train, Donatti orders Victor to be tortured until he confesses. Since Victor knows nothing, the priests torture him by breaking every single bone in his body, finally administering the last rites, and leaving him to die. =1973= Having barely survived the torture, Victor sells all of his holdings in Italy and establishes an extremely successful post-war consulting business in America. His twin sons, Adrian and Andrew, have grown up with privilege, with Adrian attending Princeton and Harvard Law, while Andrew, a West Point graduate, is a Major in the Vietnam War. The sons are on opposite sides of the Vietnam war, but Andrew has grown into a sociopathic man, for whom the end justifies the means. Adrian is on the verge of exposing some of the crimes that his brother, and his cabal of elite officers, have committed. At the same time, Victor is alarmed to learn that the train from Salonika has leaped through the past 30 years in the form of one of the zealous priests, who vows that Victor knows where the documents are and that he will force Victor to tell him. Remembering comments and gestures by his murdered father, the 70-year-old Victor travels back to Campo de' Fiori, and discovers key clues to the vault's location. The priest observes Victor's discovery, and attempts to pick up the torture where it was left off back in 1945. Badly injured, Victor returns to America to charge his Geminis with the responsibility of locating the hidden documents, realizing only that the sons have grown apart, but not that Andrew should not have such crucial information to be used for ill purposes. Killing anyone who gets in his way, Andrew pursues the Salonika documents, leaving Adrian far behind. Adrian knows his brother's nature, and that he cannot be allowed to have the documents that could cause the collapse of Christianity, and the worldwide chaos that would ensue. =Brother vs. brother= In Champoluc a little town in the Aosta Valley, Adrian catches up with the murderous Andrew just as Andrew discovers the vault. In a monumental struggle, Adrian righteously triumphs over his evil twin brother, leaving Adrian to have the documents interpreted and to decide what to do with them. =The Documents= A parchment was taken from a Roman prison cell in the year 65 A.D. It is a letter written by a prisoner named Simon Bethsaida, renamed 'Peter' by Jesus Christ. In the letter, Peter admits that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but instead another prisoner was substituted. Jesus committed suicide three days after the incident. The rising is a myth.

Olympia was modelled by Victorine Meurent and Olympia's servant by the art model Laure. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by Claude Monet. The painting is on display at the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris.  Content  What shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a demi-mondaine or prostitute. These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. \\"Olympia\\" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.Clark, T.J. (1999) The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and His Followers. Revised edition. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.86. The painting is modelled after Titian's Venus of Urbino (c. 1534). Whereas the left hand of Titian's Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia's left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her role as a prostitute, granting or restricting access to her body in return for payment.Dolan, Therese. \\"Fringe Benefits: Manet's Olympia and Her Shawl\\". The Art Bulletin, vol. 97, no. 4, 2015, pp. 409‚Äì429. Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, a creature associated with nocturnal promiscuity. The aroused posture of the cat was provocative; in French, chatte (cat) is slang for female genitalia. Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, probably a gift from a client.Moffitt, John F. \\"Provocative Felinity in Manet's Olympia\\". Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 14, no. 1, 1994, pp. 21‚Äì31. Some have suggested that she is looking in the direction of the door, as her client barges in unannounced. The painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, studio lighting that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of Alexandre Cabanel's La naissance de V√©nus, also painted in 1863, Olympia is a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting. The canvas alone is 51.4 x 74.8 inches, which is rather large for this genre-style painting. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time and her relatively undeveloped body is more girlish than womanly. Charles Baudelaire thought thinness was more indecent than fatness.Reff, Theodore. (1976) Manet: Olympia. London: Allen Lane, p. 57. The model for Olympia, Victorine Meurent, would have been recognized by viewers of the painting because she was well known in Paris circles. She started modeling when she was sixteen years old and she also was an accomplished painter in her own right.\\"The naked truth\\" The Guardian, 3 October 2008. Retrieved 18 December 2014. Some of her paintings were exhibited in the Paris Salon. The familiarity with the identity of the model was a major reason this painting was considered shocking to viewers. A well known woman currently living in modern-day Paris could not simultaneously represent a historical or mythological woman.  Critical reaction  Paul C√©zanne A Modern Olympia (c. 1873/74) Though Manet's The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe) sparked controversy in 1863, his Olympia stirred an even bigger uproar when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Conservatives condemned the work as \\"immoral\\" and \\"vulgar.\\" Journalist Antonin Proust later recalled, \\"If the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration.\\" The critics and the public condemned the work alike. Even √âmile Zola was reduced to disingenuously commenting on the work's formal qualities rather than acknowledging the subject matter, \\"You wanted a nude, and you chose Olympia, the first that came along\\".Quoted in Honour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 708. He paid tribute to Manet's honesty, however, \\"When our artists give us Venuses, they correct nature, they lie. √âdouard Manet asked himself why lie, why not tell the truth; he introduced us to Olympia, this fille of our time, whom you meet on the sidewalks.\\" = Olympia's maid = Although originally overlooked, the figure of the maid in the painting, modelled by a woman named Laure, has become a topic of discussion among contemporary scholars. As T. J. Clark recounts of a friend's disbelief in the revised 1990 version of The Painting of Modern Life: ‚Äúyou‚Äôve written about the white woman on the bed for fifty pages and more, and hardly mentioned the black woman alongside her.‚Äù Olympia was created 15 years after slavery had been abolished in France and her empire, but negative stereotypes of black people persisted among some elements of French society. In some cases, the white prostitute in the painting was described using racially charged language. According to Maria Rutledge, \\"references to Blackness thus invaded the image of white Olympia, turning her into the caricatural and grotesque animal that Black people are frequently made to represent in the nineteenth century.\\" Many critics have applauded Manet in his use of white and black in the painting, an alternative to the tradition of chiaroscuro. Charles Bernheimer has responded, According to Timothy Paul, some black feminists, including Lorraine O' Grady, have argued that it is not for artistic convention that Manet included Laure but to create an ideological binary between black and white, good and bad, clean and dirty and as such \\"inevitably reformulates the Cartesian perspectival logic that allows whiteness to function as the only subject of consideration\\". When paired with a lighter skin tone, the Black female model stands in as signifier to all of the racial stereotypes of the West. = Confrontational gaze and oppositional gaze = In Lorraine O' Grady's essay titled \\"Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity\\", she asserts, \\"Olympia's maid, like all other 'peripheral Negroes'\\", is a robot conveniently made to disappear into the background drapery. While the confrontational gaze of Olympia is often referenced as the pinnacle of defiance toward patriarchy, the oppositional gaze of Olympia's maid is ignored; she is part of the background with little to no attention given to the critical role of her presence. O'Grady points out that we know she represents 'Jezebel and Mammy' \\"and best of all, she is not a real person...\\", rather she is object to the objectified and excluded from sexual difference according to Freudian theory. While Olympia looks directly at the viewer, her maid, too, is looking back. In her essay \\"Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and Their Homegirls: Developing an Oppositional Gaze toward the Images of Black Women\\", Catherine West concludes that by claiming an oppositional gaze we can identify, criticize, resist and transform these and other oppressive images of Black women. = Events = In January 2016, a Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis, lay on the floor in front of the painting nude and mimicked the pose of the subject. She was arrested for indecent exposure.  Precedents  In part, the painting was inspired by Titian's Venus of Urbino (c. 1534), which in turn derives from Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510). The Titian has two fully clothed women, presumably servants, in the background. L√©once B√©n√©dite was the first art historian to explicitly acknowledge the similarity to the Venus of Urbino in 1897.Reff, p. 48. There is also some similarity to Francisco Goya's La maja desnuda (c. 1800).Meyers, Jeffrey. (2004). Impressionist Quartet: The Intimate Genius of Manet and Morisot, Degas and Cassatt, p. 35; Beruete y Moret, Aureliano. (1922). Goya as portrait painter, p. 190. There were also pictorial precedents for a nude white female, often pictured with a black female servant, such as L√©on Benouville's Esther with Odalisque (1844), Ingres' Odalisque with a Slave (1842), and Charles Jalabert's Odalisque (1842).The Puzzle of Olympia. Phylis A. Floyd, 19th Century Art Worldwide, 2012. Retrieved 5 December 2012. Comparison is also made to Ingres' Grande Odalisque (1814). Manet did not depict a goddess or an odalisque but a high-class prostitute waiting for a client; it has often been argued that Titian did the same.

It is loosely based on the 1887 novel Allan Quatermain by H. Rider Haggard. It is the sequel to Haggard's 1885 novel King Solomon's Mines. The role of Allan Quatermain is reprised by Richard Chamberlain as is that of Jesse Huston by Sharon Stone, who was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for this role, for which she lost to Madonna for Who's That Girl. The movie also starred James Earl Jones as Umslopogaas, Henry Silva as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, Cassandra Peterson as Queen Sorais and Chamberlain's then real-life partner Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain. Plot After surviving their expedition to King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quatermain and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless. A man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain's friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him. Before he dies, he tells Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary 'Lost City of Gold'. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan. Allan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior and old friend of Allan's, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five Askari warriors, accompany them. The group crosses the Sahara desert; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a trap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Esbowe warriors attack the group. Many spears are thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them with his giant axe. Quatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city boasts two queens‚Äîthe noble and beloved, Nyleptha and her power-hungry sister, Sorais. But the real leader is the evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all. Allan raises the population against Agon and Sorais, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realizes that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, Allan uses Umslopogaas' axe to channel the lightning and melt the gold (into liquid form) causing it to flow off the side of the structure and pour over the attacking horde, turning Agon and his army into gold statues.

Despite the tremendous liberties both films took with the source material, being more similar in tone to the Indiana Jones film series, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, entitled simply Allan Quatermain. In that book, which depicts Quatermain's last adventure (although it's just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom. An opulent set was constructed for the film just outside Victoria Falls. =Music= The film features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by Jerry Goldsmith for the first film (although Linn's score does use Goldsmith's main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from Cannon Films. The score was initially released by Silva Screen in 1988 on a CD with cues from Manifesto (scored by Nicola Piovani), Making the Grade (Basil Poledouris), Doin' Time on Planet Earth (Dana Kaproff) and The Seven Magnificent Gladiators (Dov Seltzer); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records. Cues in italics contain material composed by Jerry Goldsmith. # Train Delivery/Don‚Äôt Fool With Quatermain (1:48) # Quatermain Shows Off (1:53) # Quatermain Meets Swarmi/Dumont Dies (3:20) # The Ruse (2:53) # Jessie Fingered (2:07) # Umslopogaas (3:27) # Earthquake (2:57) # Quatermain Leaves Akawi (1:40) # Worms (1:12) # Love Scene (3:02) # Agon Wants Revenge (5:04) # Dumont's Gold City/Coda (3:11) Release The film debuted at number seven at the box office during its first week, earning $2 million. It was a box office disappointment, one of several that led to Cannon Films reporting a loss in early 1987. The other box office disappointments for the company included Assassination, The Hanoi Hilton, Over the Top and Street Smart. \\"I know it went through town pretty fast\\", said Richard Chamberlain. \\"I know my family didn't like it much. My father was too ill to see it, but my mother said, 'Richard, the advertising was all wrong. They should have told people it was funny.' But I don't think it hurt my chances for other movies. I know a lot of people who do a lot of movies, and some of them are good and some of them aren't. Michael Caine's one example. He's wonderful in some movies and forgettable in others. I think as long as you're doing generally good work that you enjoy, things will be okay.\\" Reception According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received two positive and one negative review. The Boston Globe film critic wrote \\" there's nothing new under the broiling afternoon sun. It's the same: washed-out scenery, stale dialogue and lackluster performances... Except for the presence of James Earl Jones doing a depressing turn as a native chieftain, \\"Allan Quatermain\\" is just for folks who don't mind mining for fool's gold.\\" The New York Times said the film was \\"of minor academic interest. Those who take the Spielberg special effects for granted are sure to learn a lot by watching these same tricks done badly... Fortunately, Richard Chamberlain is professional and then some, since the film would otherwise be virtually unwatchable.\\" The Los Angeles Times said the \\"movie seems largely aimed at fans who can't wait for the next installment of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" Unfortunately, most of the battle scenes were... ineptly staged... Chamberlain has none of the breezy, irreverence that made Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones such a delightful hero. In his Banana Republic khaki duds and a bullet-proof undershirt, he exudes the dashing spirit of a game-show host. The rest of the cast is good largely for unintentional laughs.\\" =Criticism of racism= Based on a 19th-century novel that, though progressive for its time, reflected some racist attitudes, the film itself has been criticized for conveying some of these same racist themes. The book Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture provides a harsh critique saying it reached \\"levels of racism unachieved since the 1930s.\\" Though the film has been portrayed as a comedy and a satire not all critics have been satisfied that the racist themes are excused under this pretense. Abandoned Sequels The Cannon Group originally planned a trilogy of films, the third film to be an adaptation of She and Allan but this was ultimately abandoned after the extreme negative reception of Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, coupled with the financial difficulties of the company at that time. In 2011, a new sequel was proposed by Menahem Golan called Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East. The script was written by Golan and Richard Albiston and was to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary Golan: A Farewell to Mr Cinema, Richard Chamberlain had agreed to return as the title character but Golan died before the film began shooting.

It is widely known for the United States Army military installation and training area, called Grafenwoehr Training Area (Tower Barracks), located directly south and west of the town. History = Early history= The town of Grafenw√∂hr (Island of the Count), was founded in the 9th century on an island (w√∂hr), located between the river Creussen and the Thum stream. In its early history, the inhabitants and the town of Grafenw√∂hr proper belonged to nobles from Schweinfurt, Bamberg, and Leuchtenberg. =20th century= In 1907, Prince Luitpold, regent of the Kingdom of Bavaria, selected the area near the town of Grafenw√∂hr as the place best suited for training of the Bavarian Army (1806‚Äì1919). Construction began in 1908, and, by 1915, the training reservation was in area. The first artillery round was fired in the training area at 08:00 on 30 June 1910. Throughout World War I (1914‚Äì1918) the Grafenw√∂hr training area was used for equipping and training army units for combat. After the War, the High Command, Berlin, used Grafenw√∂hr to train the 100,000‚Äìman German army, allowed by the Treaty of Versailles (1919). In 1936, the Nazi Government expanded the training area to the present size of . On 5 and 8 April 1945, the training camp and the town of Grafenw√∂hr proper were bombed during Allied air raids. The last German Army Commander of the Grafenw√∂hr training area surrendered to the U.S. Army on 20 April 1945. Afterwards, during the Cold War (1945‚Äì1991), the Grafenw√∂hr training area was an important, combined arms training site for the U.S. Army and allied forces. =Post Cold War= The military installation is also home to one of the largest Army construction projects in Europe, called Efficient Basing-Grafenw√∂hr. The Grafenw√∂hr Training Area (Tower Barracks) houses the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command (JMTC). The 7th Army JMTC owns almost all of the U.S. Army training facilities and assets in Europe. The Grafenw√∂hr Training Area is one of its largest training areas and includes ranges that can accommodate nearly every weapons system currently used. Though operated by the U.S. Army, the area is the largest multinational training area in Europe. Grafenw√∂hr (Tower Barracks), also known as the East Camp, is the main post and is located on the north east edge of the training area. The Vilseck military community, also known as Rose Barracks, or the South Camp, is on the southern boundary. The Grafenw√∂hr Army Airfield provides air flow to all air traffic requesting services including but not limited C-130's from the 37th Airlift Squadron at Ramstein AB, Germany. The airfield is manned 24 hours a day by advisory services and at a minimum from 08:00 to 17:00 by air traffic controllers both in a control tower and an approach control. Due to its length and relative proximity to the JMTC training area, it makes for a realistic simulation of short field operations encountered around the world. Bunker dropzone is also located within the Grafenw√∂hr Training Area. It is used to practice airdrop of troops, equipment, and supplies. =Tenant units= * 7th U.S. Army Joint Multinational Training Command * 7th Intermediate Level Education (ILE) * HHC/B/D/457th Civil Affairs Battalion * 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion * 25px 7th Weather Squadron * 535th Engineer Company * 25px 902d Engineer Company * 12th Chemical Company * 44th Expeditionary Signal Battalion * 102nd Signal Battalion * 25px 709th Military Police Battalion * 615th Military Police Company ** 512th Military Police Platoon (Augmentation) ** 514th Military Police Platoon (Augmentation) * 57th Signal Company * 504th Military Intelligence Company * A/106th Financial Management Support Unit * C CO USA NATO, AFNORTH BN * 4-319 AFAR, 173rd IBCT (A) * 1-91 CAV, 173rd IBCT (A) =Former units= * 25px 172d Infantry Brigade Combat Team (inactivated on 31 May 2013) ** 25px 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment (inactivated 31 May 2013) ** 25px 3d Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment (inactivated 31 May 2013). ** 25px Troop E, 5th Cavalry Regiment (inactivated 31 May 2013) ** 25px 1st Battalion, 2d Infantry Regiment (inactivated 31 May 2013) * Battery B (Target Acquisition), 25th Field Artillery * 15th Medical Detachment (Air Ambulance) (1970 - 1989) * 498th Support Battalion, 2d Armored Division (1975-1979) * Detachment 6 (Forward Air Control Post), 601st Tactical Control Squadron, USAFE (1965-1969) ** Became Detachment 26 (Forward Air Control Post), 601st Tactical Control Squadron, USAFE (1969-1973) ** Became the 632nd Tactical Control Flight, 601st Tactical Control Wing, USAFE (in 1973, inactivated 1 August 1986) **1944th Communications Squadron (1964-1966) 3/60th ADA - HHB & A Co 536th MP Co Geography The civilian town of Grafenw√∂hr rests nestled between low hills.

Thus a link between output and military expenditure can be made. The scope of this effect depend on : threat faced, productivity of factors, degree of the military utilisation, finance method of military spending, its externalities and effectiveness of this military spending in countering the treaty. As a consequence, a same amount of military spending in different countries can have wide-ranging effects. Brief history of the term The first important use dates from 1939 with Germany Rampant: A Study in Economic Militarism by Ernest Hambloch, a long-serving British diplomat. Germany Rampant \\"traces the philosophy of Nazism to the German mythological figures of ancient times.\\" Since this book the term has been used in connection with the ancient Aztecs, and with militaristic movements in a variety of cultures, and applies to the ideological and cultural aspects of a state, society or group that sustain the drive for hegemony or empire. For example, Joseph Kenney applies the term to the Almoravids. In 2003 Clyde Prestowitz, of the Economic Strategy Institute published a book containing his analysis of what he called economic militarism in American foreign policy, that was reviewed in The Economist magazine. Demand effect Military expenditure can impact the economy of a country and its growth through the demand effect. An increase of military spending, will increase the prosperity of the country and its employment rate, thanks to a rise of demand. It is link to the Keynesian multiplier effect, introduced by Richard Kahn in the 1930s, that states that every exogenous rise in government expenditure will decrease unemployment and increase growth, no matter the form of expenditure. However, the extent of this effect, and some potential others, will depend on the way this expenditure will be financed (see War finance). Changes in the industrial output will also appeared when military expenditure is increased. This effect can be explain thanks to the Input-output model. Supply effect As previously said, an increase of military expenditure can change the industrial output thanks to the input-output effect, but it as a consequence, also modifies the input. Factors of production such as labor force, natural resources or capital can be heavily changed when the government has the desire to increase its military capacity. Some resources previously used by civilians or by other branches of production are transferred to the military field. This could destroy profoundly resources of a country (especially during war times). Research and development(R&D;) investments can also be made to improve the military capacity of production. It could then have positive impacts on other production fields. Moreover, more workers will be employed, which might reduce the unemployment rate, but this might also reduce their productive when they will return to a non-military sector of employment, or the unemployment rate could rise again dramatically when the military use will decrease. As a consequence, an increase of military expenditure can create a large variety of economic impacts and externalities, positives and/or negatives (see also: Externality). Security effect In order to invest and innovate, agents should be confident in the economic, its well-being and as a consequence, in the security of persons. During war times or in cases of foreign threats, military expenditure could enable to increase security, maintain the market operations and thus increase output. Indeed, if you look at the world dynamic of military spendings over time, you can clearly identify a positive relation between war or war threat and spendings ; for example during the First World War, The Second World War and the Cold War. However, in some situations military expenditure is rather use to increase exponentially the military industrial complex and to threaten other nations (as it was the case during the Cold War), and can lead to dangerous arms races.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, multiple wrestlers held the European and WWF Intercontinental Championships within short spans of each other,WWE.com: \\"History of the Intercontinental Championship\\" and three held both simultaneously, becoming \\"Eurocontinental champions\\". Established in 1997 as the \\"WWF European Championship\\", the title incurred a brief hiatus in 1999 due to then-champion Shane McMahon's desire to retire as an \\"undefeated champion\\". It was renamed in May 2002 when the WWF became the WWE before finally being unified with the WWE Intercontinental Championship in July that year by Rob Van Dam, making him the final European Champion. Despite its name, only two holders were actually from Europe: the British Bulldog, who was the inaugural and longest-reigning champion, and William Regal. It became a prominent singles title of the Attitude Era, held by then-former world champions Shawn Michaels and Diamond Dallas Page, along with Triple H, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, and Eddie Guerrero, among others. It was contested in the main event of the One Night Only pay-per-view in September 1997. History In 1997, the British Bulldog was crowned the first WWF European Champion by winning a tournament that was held over several shows in Germany, culminating in a finals victory over Owen Hart. Upon winning the title, Shawn Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion in WWE. Michaels is the only wrestler to have held both the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and the European title at the same time. After winning the European title, both D'Lo Brown and Al Snow were billed from different parts of Europe each week while champion. During Snow's reign, he and \\"Head\\" dressed up as various ethnic stereotypes corresponding to the European location they were billed from, though not always in a politically or geographically correct manner. The title was retired briefly in April 1999 by then-champion Shane McMahon, who wanted to retire as an \\"undefeated champion\\". McMahon reintroduced the championship two months later and gave it to Mideon, who saw the title belt in Shane's travel bag and asked if he could have it. =Inaugural tournament= =Eurocontinental Champions and unification= Kurt Angle as \\"Eurocontinental\\" Champion The term \\"Eurocontinental Champion\\" is a portmanteau of European and Intercontinental, used to describe wrestlers who held both titles simultaneously. Three wrestlers accomplished this feat. The first was D'Lo Brown, who defeated Mideon for the European title at Fully Loaded in 1999 and two nights later at a Monday Night Raw taping, defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the Intercontinental Championship. A month later at SummerSlam Jarrett defeated Brown to win both titles but awarded the European Championship to Mark Henry the following day. On the February 10, 2000 edition of SmackDown Kurt Angle defeated Val Venis for the European Championship. Seventeen days later, at No Way Out, Angle defeated Chris Jericho for the Intercontinental Championship and became the third Eurocontinental Champion. Angle held the titles until WrestleMania 2000, when he faced Jericho and Chris Benoit in a three-way dance for both titles. In a rarity, Angle lost both of his championships without being pinned or forced to submit; Benoit defeated Jericho in the first fall for the Intercontinental Championship and Jericho returned the favor in the second fall to take the European Championship. In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to WWE and the title was renamed accordingly, though the physical belt was not updated to reflect the name change. The title was then unified with the WWE Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match on the July 22, 2002 episode of Raw, when Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated European Champion Jeff Hardy. Reigns The British Bulldog was the inaugural champion and had the longest title reign with 206 days. William Regal and D'Lo Brown both had the most title reigns, each holding it four times. The shortest reigns as European Champion were those of Jeff Jarrett and Chris Jericho, who each held the championship for roughly one day. Jeff Jarrett defeated D'Lo Brown for the European Championship (along with the Intercontinental Championship) at Summerslam 1999 and gave it to Mark Henry the following night on Raw. Chris Jericho defeated Kurt Angle in a triple threat match at Wrestlemania 2000 and lost the title to Eddie Guerrero on Raw the night after. Jeff Hardy was the youngest champion at 24, while Diamond Dallas Page was the oldest champion at 46. Rob Van Dam was the final champion.

The Winter Triangle is formed from the three brightest stars in the northern winter sky: Sirius, Betelgeuse (top right), and Procyon (top left). constellation Canis Major as observed from the Earth (lines added for clarity). The Sothic cycle or Canicular period is a period of 1,461 Egyptian civil years of 365 days each or 1,460 Julian years averaging 365¬º days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the heliacal rising of the star Sirius ( or , 'Triangle'; , ) on 19 July in the Julian calendar. It is an important aspect of Egyptology, particularly with regard to reconstructions of the Egyptian calendar and its history. Astronomical records of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate Julian and Alexandrian calendars. Mechanics The ancient Egyptian civil year, its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the return of the bright star Sirius to the night sky was considered to herald the annual flooding of the Nile. However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate leap years until 22BC, its months \\"wandered\\" backwards through the solar year at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a Julian year.). The sidereal year of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun across the sky), whereas Sirius's displacement ~40¬∞ below the ecliptic, its proper motion, and the wobbling of the celestial equator cause the period between its heliacal risings to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the \\"wandering\\" day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 civil or 1460 Julian years. Discovery This cycle was first noticed by Eduard Meyer in 1904, who then carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of the conventional Egyptian chronology are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by Censorinus as having happened on the Egyptian New Year's Day between AD139 and 142.Kitchen, K. A. The Chronology of Ancient Egypt. p.205. World Archaeology, Vol. 23, No. 2 (October 1991). The record actually refers to 21July AD140 but is astronomically calculated as a definite 20July AD139. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. Leap day occurs in AD140, and so the new year on 1Thoth is 20July in AD139 but it is 19July for AD140‚Äì142. Thus he was able to compare the day on which Sirius rose in the Egyptian calendar to the day on which Sirius ought to have risen in the Julian calendar, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation. One also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs, and mislocating an observation can potentially change the resulting chronology by several decades. (Official observations were made at Heliopolis or Memphis near Cairo, Thebes, and Elephantine near Aswan, with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.). Meyer concluded from an ivory tablet from the reign of Djer that the Egyptian civil calendar was created in 4241BC, a date that appears in a number of old books. But research and discoveries have since shown that the First Dynasty of Egypt did not begin before , and the claim that 19July 4241BC is the \\"earliest fixed date\\" has since been discredited. Most scholars either move the observation upon which he based this forward by one cycle of Sirius to 19July 2781BC or reject the assumption that the document in question indicates a rise of Sirius at all.Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.52. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988. Chronological interpretation Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of Djer which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773BC.Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.51. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988. However, this date is too late for Djer's reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian lunar calendar, instead of the solar civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value. In 2017 it was claimed that a newly discovered Sothis date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model. http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18741665-12340035 Gautschy et al. 2017 A New Astronomically Based Chronological Model for the Egyptian Old Kingdom The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of Senusret III. This observation was almost certainly made at Itj-Tawy, the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786BC. The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991‚Äì1778BC), Parker reduces it to 206 years (1991‚Äì1785BC), based on 17July 1872BC as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker's investigation of lunar dates the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007‚Äì1794BC perceiving the date as 21 July 1888BC as the 120th year, and then as 2003‚Äì1790BC perceiving the date as 20 July 1884BC as the 120th year. The third observation was in the reign of Amenhotep I, and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504BC. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be expanded by some 20 years.Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.202. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988. Observational mechanics and precession The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{1}{b} = \\\\frac{1}{t} or half the harmonic mean. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to axial precession,Ingham, M. F. \\"The Length of the Sothic Cycle\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 55 (1969), p. 36‚Äì40. the movement of the Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility. Throughout the year the star will rise approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to its same relative location at sunrise. This length of time can be called an observational year. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will on average exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed. The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration was exactly 365.25 days in the early before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The 1461 value could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation. It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the precession of the equinox. Professor Jed Buchwald wrote \\"Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes‚Äîand so from the solstices‚Äîthroughout these many centuries, despite precession.\\" Buchwald, Jed Z. (2003), \\"Egyptian Stars under Paris Skies\\", Engineering and Science (Caltech), 66 (4) (2003) 20‚Äì31. For the same reason, the heliacal rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do but much slower.One day per 120 years, see Winlock H., Origin of the Ancient Egyptian Calendar, Proc. of the Am. Philosophical Soc., 83 (1940): 447-64. This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about the 20th of July, that is a month later after the summer solstice. Problems and criticisms Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation. Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise. A number of criticisms have been leveled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic. Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation. Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless. Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn't merit mention or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery. One recent popular history of the Ancient Near East by Marc Van de Mieroop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and believes that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE. Marc Van de Mieroop A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000‚Äì323 BC (2015) Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. Some have recently claimed that the Theran eruption marks the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty due to Theran ash and pumice discoveries in the ruins of Avaris in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era. Because the evidence of dendrochronologists indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BC, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50‚Äì80 years at the outset of the 18th Dynasty. Claims that the Thera eruption is the subject of the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I have been disputed by writers such as Peter James.James, Centuries of Darkness (London, 1991: ).

He is remembered for his fierce opposition to his father's Saxon allies. In Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, he overthrows his father and reigns as King of Britain for a brief period before his death restores Vortigern to power. Accounts Vortimer first appears in the 9th-century work known as the Historia Brittonum. According to the Historia, Vortigern allows Saxons under Hengest and Horsa to settle on the Isle of Thanet, and offers them provisions in exchange for their service as mercenaries.Historia Brittonum, ch. 31; 36. Vortigern soon proves to be an \\"ignorant king\\", and the wily Hengest manipulates him into ceding over more land and allowing more settlers to come from Germania.Historia Brittonum, ch. 36‚Äì38. After a dire period of Saxon encroachment, exacerbated by even more disgraceful behavior on Vortigern's part, Vortimer finally rises up against the Saxons. He pushes them back to Thanet, and meets them in four battles. At the third battle Horsa and Vortimer's brother Catigern are slain; at the fourth the Saxons are pushed back to the sea.Historia Brittonum, ch. 43‚Äì44. Shortly thereafter, however, Vortimer dies. He asks his followers to bury him at the place where the Saxons first landed in Britain as a totem against further invasion. However, his followers fail to heed his warning and the Saxons return.Historia Brittonum, ch. 44. According to the Welsh Triads his bones were buried \\"in the Chief Ports of this Island\\".Rachel Bromwich Trioedd Ynys Prydein, 2nd edition (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1978) pp. 88-89. Three of Vortimer's battle sites are named, and appear to have some correspondence with battles in Kent appearing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The Chronicle does not name Vortimer, and in fact credit Vortigern as the British leader in one of the battles. The legendary material in the Historia Brittonum was slightly expanded upon in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae, a fictional account of the rulers of Britain. There the Britons abandon Vortigern and elevate Vortimer to be king of Britain. After he has driven out the Saxons, Vortimer is poisoned by his stepmother Rowena (a Saxon) and Vortigern regains the crown.

This orange-red, water-soluble cerium salt is a specialised oxidizing agent in organic synthesis and a standard oxidant in quantitative analysis. Preparation, properties, and structure The anion is generated by dissolving in hot concentrated HNO3. The salt consists of the anion and a pair of NH4+ counter ions. The ammonium ions are not involved in the oxidising reactions of this salt. In the anion each nitrate group is chelated to the cerium atom in a bidentate manner as shown below: :Hexanitratocerate anion The anion has Th (idealized Oh) molecular symmetry. The CeO12 core defines an icosahedron. Ce4+ is a strong one-electron oxidizing agent. In terms of its redox potential (E¬∞ ~ 1.61 V vs. N.H.E.) it is even stronger oxidizing agent than Cl2 (E¬∞ ~ 1.36 V). Few shelf-stable reagents are stronger oxidants. In the redox process Ce(IV) is converted to Ce(III), a one-electron change, signaled by the fading of the solution color from orange to a pale yellow (providing that the substrate and product are not strongly colored). Applications in organic chemistry In organic synthesis, CAN is useful as an oxidant for many functional groups (alcohols, phenols, and ethers) as well as C‚ÄìH bonds, especially those that are benzylic. Alkenes undergo dinitroxylation, although the outcome is solvent-dependent. Quinones are produced from catechols and hydroquinones and even nitroalkanes are oxidized. CAN provides an alternative to the Nef reaction; for example, for ketomacrolide synthesis where complicating side reactions usually encountered using other reagents. Oxidative halogenation can be promoted by CAN as an in situ oxidant for benzylic bromination, and the iodination of ketones and uracil derivatives. =For the synthesis of heterocycles= Catalytic amounts of aqueous CAN allow the efficient synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives. Quinoxalines are known for their applications as dyes, organic semiconductors, and DNA cleaving agents. These derivatives are also components in antibiotics such as echinomycin and actinomycin.

It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming. Monte Carlo methods are used to introduce randomness. Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called individual-based models (IBMs), and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual- based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including biology, ecology and social science. Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of multi-agent systems or multi-agent simulation in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems. Agent- based models are a kind of microscale model that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of emergence, which some express as \\"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\\". In other words, higher-level system properties emerge from the interactions of lower-level subsystems. Or, macro-scale state changes emerge from micro-scale agent behaviors. Or, simple behaviors (meaning rules followed by agents) generate complex behaviors (meaning state changes at the whole system level). Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status, using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience \\"learning\\", adaptation, and reproduction. Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as computer simulations, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior. History The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s. =Early developments= The history of the agent- based model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine, a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device von Neumann proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up‚Äîcreating the first of the devices later termed cellular automata. Another advance was introduced by the mathematician John Conway. He constructed the well-known Game of Life. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard. The Simula programming language, developed in the mid 1960s and widely implemented by the early 1970s, was the first framework for automating step-by-step agent simulations. =1970s and 1980s: the first models= One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was Thomas Schelling's segregation model, which was discussed in his paper \\"Dynamic Models of Segregation\\" in 1971. Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome. In the early 1980s, Robert Axelrod hosted a tournament of Prisoner's Dilemma strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner. Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from ethnocentrism to the dissemination of culture. By the late 1980s, Craig Reynolds' work on flocking models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent- based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton. The first use of the word \\"agent\\" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down. One candidate appears to be John Holland and John H. Miller's 1991 paper \\"Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory\\", based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs. At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT). This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA). =1990s: expansion= The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, Sugarscape, developed by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture. Other notable 1990s developments included Carnegie Mellon University's Kathleen Carley ABM, to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture. During this 1990s timeframe Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent- based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling (CASM).Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM) Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks. CMOT‚Äîlater renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)‚Äîincorporated more and more agent-based modeling. Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history, and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments. In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form INFORMS, and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS). Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining National Science Foundation funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS. She was succeeded by David Sallach of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, and then by Michael Prietula of Emory University. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized. As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally. The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006. The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with George Mason University taking the lead role in local arrangements. =2000s and later= More recently, Ron Sun developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as cognitive social simulation. Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at UCLA have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making. Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field. Theory Most computational modeling research describes systems in equilibrium or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior. The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, emergence, and complexity. Agent- based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity. Typically agents are situated in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice- like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in algorithmic form in computer programs. In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful. In ecological ABM (often referred to as \\"individual-based models\\" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be \\"purposeful\\" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water). The modeling process is best described as inductive. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle. In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns‚Äînetwork structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, power-law distributions in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency. Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness‚Äîthe ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves‚Äîtheir diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions. =Framework= Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models. (PhD Thesis)Niazi, M.A. and Hussain, A (2012), Cognitive Agent-based Computing-I: A Unified Framework for Modeling Complex Adaptive Systems using Agent-based & Complex Network-based Methods Cognitive Agent-based Computing describe a framework consisting of four levels of developing models of complex adaptive systems described using several example multidisciplinary case studies: # Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components. # Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers. # Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines. # Validated agent-based modeling using Virtual Overlay Multiagent system (VOMAS) for the development of verified and validated models in a formal manner. Other methods of describing agent-based models include code templates and text-based methods such as the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Design Details) protocol.

Agent- based models have also been used for developing decision support systems such as for breast cancer. (Breast Cancer DSS) Agent-based models are increasingly being used to model pharmacological systems in early stage and pre-clinical research to aid in drug development and gain insights into biological systems that would not be possible a priori. Military applications have also been evaluated. Moreover, agent-based models have been recently employed to study molecular-level biological systems. = In epidemiology = Agent-based models have replaced compartmental models, the usual type of epidemiological models. ABMs have been shown to be superior to compartmental models in regard to the accuracy of predictions. Recently, ABMs have been used to inform public health (nonpharmaceutical) interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiological ABMs have been criticized for simplifying and unrealistic assumptions. Still, they can be useful in informing decisions regarding mitigation and suppression measures in cases when ABMs are accurately calibrated. =In business, technology and network theory= Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include marketing, organizational behaviour and cognition, team working, supply chain optimization and logistics, modeling of consumer behavior, including word of mouth, social network effects, distributed computing, workforce management, and portfolio management. They have also been used to analyze traffic congestion. Recently, agent based modelling and simulation has been applied to various domains such as studying the impact of publication venues by researchers in the computer science domain (journals versus conferences). In addition, ABMs have been used to simulate information delivery in ambient assisted environments. A November 2016 article in arXiv analyzed an agent based simulation of posts spread in the Facebook online social network. In the domain of peer-to-peer, ad-hoc and other self-organizing and complex networks, the usefulness of agent based modeling and simulation has been shown. The use of a computer science-based formal specification framework coupled with wireless sensor networks and an agent-based simulation has recently been demonstrated. Agent based evolutionary search or algorithm is a new research topic for solving complex optimization problems. =In economics and social sciences= Prior to, and in the wake of the financial crisis, interest has grown in ABMs as possible tools for economic analysis. (Chapter preview) ABMs do not assume the economy can achieve equilibrium and \\"representative agents\\" are replaced by agents with diverse, dynamic, and interdependent behavior including herding. ABMs take a \\"bottom-up\\" approach and can generate extremely complex and volatile simulated economies. ABMs can represent unstable systems with crashes and booms that develop out of non-linear (disproportionate) responses to proportionally small changes. A July 2010 article in The Economist looked at ABMs as alternatives to DSGE models. The journal Nature also encouraged agent-based modeling with an editorial that suggested ABMs can do a better job of representing financial markets and other economic complexities than standard models along with an essay by J. Doyne Farmer and Duncan Foley that argued ABMs could fulfill both the desires of Keynes to represent a complex economy and of Robert Lucas to construct models based on microfoundations. Farmer and Foley pointed to progress that has been made using ABMs to model parts of an economy, but argued for the creation of a very large model that incorporates low level models. By modeling a complex system of analysts based on three distinct behavioral profiles ‚Äì imitating, anti- imitating, and indifferent ‚Äì financial markets were simulated to high accuracy. Results showed a correlation between network morphology and the stock market index.Stefan, F., & Atman, A. (2015). Is there any connection between the network morphology and the fluctuations of the stock market index? Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, (419), 630-641. ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment and the examination of public policy applications to land-use. There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM's ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network. =Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation= The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely \\"Systems for Agents\\" and \\"Agents for Systems.\\" Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses). =Self-driving cars= Waymo has created a multi-agent simulation environment Carcraft to test algorithms for self-driving cars. It simulates traffic interactions between human drivers, pedestrians and automated vehicles. People's behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior. Implementation Many ABM frameworks are designed for serial von-Neumann computer architectures, limiting the speed and scalability of implemented models. Since emergent behavior in large-scale ABMs is dependent of population size, scalability restrictions may hinder model validation. Such limitations have mainly been addressed using distributed computing, with frameworks such as Repast HPC specifically dedicated to these type of implementations. While such approaches map well to cluster and supercomputer architectures, issues related to communication and synchronization, as well as deployment complexity, remain potential obstacles for their widespread adoption. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units GPUs for ABM simulation. The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second. =Integration with other modeling forms= Since Agent-Based Modeling is more of a modeling framework than a particular piece of software or platform, it has often been used in conjunction with other modeling forms. For instance, agent-based models have also been combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This provides a useful combination where the ABM serves as a process model and the GIS system can provide a model of pattern. Similarly, Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools and agent-based models are sometimes integrated, where the ABM is used to simulate the dynamics on the network while the SNA tool models and analyzes the network of interactions. Verification and validation Verification and validation (V&V;) of simulation models is extremely important. Verification involves making sure the implemented model matches the conceptual model, whereas validation ensures that the implemented model has some relationship to the real-world. Face validation, sensitivity analysis, calibration, and statistical validation are different aspects of validation. A discrete-event simulation framework approach for the validation of agent-based systems has been proposed. A comprehensive resource on empirical validation of agent-based models can be found here. As an example of V&V; technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system), a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent- based model. Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.

The company argued that such a line could significantly cut road congestion by carrying lorries on flatbed rail trucks. The company was formed in the late 1980s, and its proposals were controversial and faced opposition. The plans were rejected by the government in 1996 and again in 2003, largely because of doubts over financing its ¬£8 billion cost, even though it was a private-sector project. Route The line would have run from the Liverpool Docks to Sheffield using the disused Woodhead Tunnel and then turned south via the Erewash Valley, joining the former Great Central Main Line (much of whose trackbed was still intact) south of Leicester. At a rebuilt Ashendon Junction it would have joined the Chiltern Main Line, running alongside it on new tracks, then paralleling the M25 motorway, entering a new tunnel between Leatherhead and Merstham and then running alongside existing railways via to the Channel Tunnel terminal at Folkestone. An alternative route would have seen the line joining High Speed 1 to the tunnel, if the latter railway were to allow non-passenger trains. Purpose The line would carry goods lorries between the continent and the Midlands and north of England. It could also have helped facilitate railfreight connections between the north of England and the ports of Felixstowe and Southampton. Trains long would carry up to 80 lorry trailers each, in the manner of American piggyback services. It would be operated by diesel locomotives, at least in the first instance, in order to save on electrification costs. The promoters stated that lorries already made a modal interchange to go through the Channel Tunnel. The Central Railway scheme would simply make the interchange between points or more apart, rather than at present, saving haulage companies fuel and drastically reducing carbon emissions. Financial backing In early 2006, the company said that 11 banks were backing the project. Personnel The Chairman of Central Railway was Andrew Gritten and Chief Executive of Central Railway was Alan Stevens who was a UKIP county councillor in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire between 2013-17.

They were created by Douglas McGregor while he was working at the MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1950s, and developed further in the 1960s. McGregor's work was rooted in motivation theory alongside the works of Abraham Maslow, who created the hierarchy of needs. The two theories proposed by McGregor describe contrasting models of workforce motivation applied by managers in human resource management, organizational behavior, organizational communication and organizational development. Theory X explains the importance of heightened supervision, external rewards, and penalties, while Theory Y highlights the motivating role of job satisfaction and encourages workers to approach tasks without direct supervision. Management use of Theory X and Theory Y can affect employee motivation and productivity in different ways, and managers may choose to implement strategies from both theories into their practices.  McGregor and Maslow  McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y and Maslow's hierarchy of needs are both rooted in motivation theory. Maslow's hierarchy of needs consists of physiological needs (lowest level), safety needs, love needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization (highest level). According to Maslow, a human is motivated by the level they have not yet reached, and self- actualization cannot be met until each of the lower levels has been fulfilled. Assumptions of Theory Y, in relation to Maslow's hierarchy put an emphasis on employee higher level needs, such as esteem needs and self-actualization. McGregor also believed that self-actualization was the highest level of reward for employees. He theorized that the motivation employees use to reach self- actualization allows them to reach their full potential. This led companies to focus on how their employees were motivated, managed, and led, creating a Theory Y management style which focuses on the drive for individual self- fulfillment. McGregor's perspective places the responsibility for performance on managers as well as subordinates. Theory X Theory X is based on assumptions regarding the typical worker. This management style assumes that the typical worker has little ambition, avoids responsibility, and is individual-goal oriented. In general, Theory X style managers believe their employees are less intelligent, lazier, and work solely for a sustainable income. Management believes employees' work is based on their own self- interest. Managers who believe employees operate in this manner are more likely to use rewards or punishments as motivation. Due to these assumptions, Theory X concludes the typical workforce operates more efficiently under a hands-on approach to management. Theory X managers believe all actions should be traceable to the individual responsible. This allows the individual to receive either a direct reward or a reprimand, depending on the outcome's positive or negative nature. This managerial style is more effective when used in a workforce that is not essentially motivated to perform. According to McGregor, there are two opposing approaches to implementing Theory X: the hard approach and the soft approach. The hard approach depends on close supervision, intimidation, and immediate punishment. This approach can potentially yield a hostile, minimally cooperative workforce that may cause resentment towards management. Managers are always looking for mistakes from employees, because they do not trust their work. Theory X is a \\"we versus they\\" approach, meaning it is the management versus the employees. The soft approach is characterized by leniency and less strict rules in hopes for creating high workplace morale and cooperative employees. Implementing a system that is too soft could result in an entitled, low-output workforce. McGregor believes both ends of the spectrum are too extreme for efficient real-world application. Instead, McGregor feels that an approach located in the middle would be the most effective implementation of Theory X. Because managers and supervisors are in almost complete control of the work, this produces a more systematic and uniform product or work flow. Theory X can benefit a work place that utilizes an assembly line or manual labor. Using this theory in these types of work conditions allows employees to specialize in particular work areas which in turn allows the company to mass-produce a higher quantity and quality of work. Theory Y Theory Y managers assume employees are internally motivated, enjoy their job, and work to better themselves without a direct reward in return. These managers view their employees as one of the most valuable assets to the company, driving the internal workings of the corporation. Employees additionally tend to take full responsibility for their work and do not need close supervision to create a quality product. It is important to note, however, that before an employee carries out their task, they must first obtain the manager's approval. This ensures work stays efficient, productive, and in-line with company standards. Theory Y managers gravitate towards relating to the worker on a more personal level, as opposed to a more conductive and teaching-based relationship. As a result, Theory Y followers may have a better relationship with their boss, creating a healthier atmosphere in the workplace. In comparison to Theory X, Theory Y incorporates a pseudo-democratic environment to the workforce. This allows the employee to design, construct, and publish their work in a timely manner in co-ordinance to their workload and projects. Although Theory Y encompasses creativity and discussion, it does have limitations. While there is a more personal and individualistic feel, this leaves room for error in terms of consistency and uniformity. The workplace lacks unvarying rules and practices, which could potentially be detrimental to the quality standards of the product and strict guidelines of a given company. Theory Z Humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, upon whose work McGregor drew for Theories X and Y, went on to propose his own model of workplace motivation, Theory Z. Unlike Theories X and Y, Theory Z recognizes a transcendent dimension to work and worker motivation. An optimal managerial style would help cultivate worker creativity, insight, meaning and moral excellence. Another innovative management style developed by William Ouchi is also called Theory Z. Choosing a management style For McGregor, Theory X and Theory Y are not opposite ends of the same continuum, but rather two different continua in themselves. In order to achieve the most efficient production, a combination of both theories may be appropriate. This approach is derived from Fred Fiedler's research over various leadership styles known as the contingency theory. This theory states that managers evaluate the workplace and choose their leadership style based upon both internal and external conditions presented. Managers who choose the Theory X approach have an authoritarian style of management. An organization with this style of management is made up of several levels of supervisors and managers who actively intervene and micromanage the employees. On the contrary, managers who choose the Theory Y approach have a hands-off style of management. An organization with this style of management encourages participation and values individuals' thoughts and goals. However, because there is no optimal way for a manager to choose between adopting either Theory X or Theory Y, it is likely that a manager will need to adopt both approaches depending on the evolving circumstances and levels of internal and external locus of control throughout the workplace. Military command and control Theory X and Theory Y also have implications in military command and control (C2). Older, strictly hierarchical conceptions of C2, with narrow centralization of decision rights, highly constrained patterns of interaction, and limited information distribution tend to arise from cultural and organizational assumptions compatible with Theory X. On the other hand, more modern, network-centric, and decentralized concepts of C2, that rely on individual initiative and self-synchronization, tend to arise more from a \\"Theory Y\\" philosophy.Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). \\"C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise.\\" CRC Press; New York; pp. 98-99. Mission Command, for example, is a command philosophy to which many modern military establishments aspire, and which involves individual judgment and action within the overall framework of the commander's intent. Its assumptions about the value of individual initiative make it more a Theory-Y than a Theory X philosophy.Vassiliou, Marius, and David S. Alberts (2017). \\"Mission Command and Agile C2.\\" Proc. 22nd International Command and Control Research and technology Symposium (ICCRTS).

It is mostly connected to the themes of complex systems, emergence, the Monte Carlo method, computational sociology, multi- agent systems, and evolutionary programming. While the concept was simple, actually realizing this conceptual point took a while. Complex mathematical models have been, and are, common; deceivingly simple models only have their roots in the late forties, and took the advent of the microcomputer to really get up to speed.  Overview  The aim is to construct parallel simulations consisting of computational devices, referred to as agents, with given properties, in order to model the target phenomena. The subject is the process of emergence from the lower (micro) level of a social system to the higher (or macro) level. The history of agent-based modeling can be traced back to Von Neumann machines, the concept of a machine capable of reproduction. The device he proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then extended by von Neumann's friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician, who suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up, thus creating the first of the devices later termed cellular automata. A further advance was achieved by mathematician John Conway. He constructed the well-known game of life. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated according to tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard. The application of the agent-based model as a social model was primarily initiated by computer scientist Craig Reynolds. He attempted to model living biological agents, a method known as artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton. The computational methods of artificial life were applied to the analysis of social systems, christened \\"the artificial society\\" by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell. Eventually, the artificial society provided a new method for sociological analysis in the form of computational sociology. The principal problem is that of classical sociology, the issue of macro-micro linkage: as first articulated by French Sociologist √âmile Durkheim, the question of how individuals within a social system influence and are influenced by the macrosocial level. The artificial society has been widely accepted by recent sociology as a promising method characterized by the extensive use of computer programs and computer simulations which include evolutionary algorithms (EA), genetic algorithms (GA), genetic programming (GP), memetic programming (MP), agent based models, and cellular automata (CA). For many, artificial society is a meeting point for people from many other more traditional fields in interdisciplinary research, such as linguistics, social physics, mathematics, philosophy, law, computer science, biology, and sociology in which unusual computational and theoretical approaches that would be controversial within their native discipline can be discussed. As a field, it has had a controversial history; some have characterized it as \\"practical theology\\" or a \\"fact-free science\\". However, the recent publication of artificial society articles in the scientific journals e.g.: Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation and Journal of Social Complexity shows that artificial life techniques are becoming somewhat more accepted within the sociological mainstream.

The group is sometimes collectively known as the Rapana class. MV Gadila was built at the Howaldtswerke, Kiel, Germany and completed 11 April 1935 as an oil tanker for the Royal Dutch/Shell line. She was converted at Smith's Dock, North Shields between April 1943 and 1 February 1944. She entered service as a MAC ship in March 1944, and operated under the Netherlands Mercantile Marine flag. As a MAC ship, she had no aircraft hangar, and continued to carry normal cargoes with a mercantile ship's crew, although operating under British Royal Navy control. Only her air crew and the aviation support staff were Naval personnel. In the case of the Gadila, these were provided by the Royal Netherlands Navy and served as elements of Fleet Air Arm 860 (Dutch) Naval Air Squadron. The Gadila and her sister MV Macoma were the first aircraft carrying vessels with a flight deck to be operated under the flag of the Netherlands. At the end of the war, Gadila was reconverted to an entirely mercantile oil tanker and served in this capacity until broken up for scrap in Hong Kong in 1958.

One of the leading scientists behind the Soviet animals in space programmes, he selected and trained Laika, the dog who flew on the Sputnik 2 mission. Early life and Second World War Gazenko was born on December 12, 1918 in the village of Mykolaivka, Stavropol Territory to George and Larissa Gazenko, n√©e Nikitin. In 1941, Gazenko graduated from the Military Department of the 2nd Moscow Medical Institute as a medic 3rd rank (captain in the medical service). He and his whole class were immediately sent to the front. During the war, he served as the chief of an army hospital, 197th Battalion airfield services of the 15th Air Army in the West, South-Western, Bryansk, Baltic and Belorussian fronts, receiving several decorations for his service. Research for the Soviet Air Force In 1946-1947, Gazenko received special training at the Military Medical Academy (Leningrad) in the department of physiology in the laboratory of Aviation Medicine, where, under the direct supervision of renowned physiologists - Academician Colonel-General Leon Orbeli and Professor Major General M. P. Brestkin - studied the problem and the state of high-altitude physiology of higher nervous activity in hypoxic conditions. During this time he married Olga Alexeevna Tolmachevskaya. Together they had two children - a son, Alexei, and daughter, Larissa. In 1947, Gazenko was appointed to the Institute of Aviation Medicine of the Ministry of Defence. He was involved in studies of pilots in unfavourable climates‚Äîbeyond the Arctic Circle and in deserts. Between 1948-1950 as the head of a medical research team, Gazenko took part in high-latitude Arctic air force tests \\"North Pole-2\\", \\"North Pole-3\\" and \\"North Pole-4\\". During this time he repeatedly worked on stations situated on drifting ice, as well as on the islands and the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Later he went on to conduct research on airmen working in difficult arid conditions of the Karakum desert. Between 1951-1952 he served alongside Soviet airmen in the Korean War.http://persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f//20678/gazenko- oleg-g Space research career From 1955 Gazenko worked in the Soviet space program, focusing his efforts on research in the field of space biology and medicine relevant to weightlessness and orbital flight. Gazenko took a prominent part in a number of biological tests regarding space flight projects. He trained and supervised the animals used in the Sputnik 2 project. Spuntik 2 was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, on November 3, 1957, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika. Gazenko continued his work as part of the team behind the Vostok program. He supervised and trained the animals used in the 1960 vostok prototype flight. In the aftermath of its failure, he adopted a survivor of this flight - a small dog named Krasavka (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–∞–≤–∫–∞, \\"Little Beauty\\") also known as Kometka (–ö–æ–º–µ—Ç–∫–∞, \\"Little Comet\\"). Krasavka went on to have puppies and continued living with Gazenko and his family until her death 14 years later.http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/the-remarkable-and-censored- siberian-adventure-of-stray-dog-cosmonauts-comet-and-shutka/ Gazenko was also directly involved in training the first human cosmonauts of the Vostok 1 project, including Yuri Gagarin. Gagarin himself jokingly referred to it by saying: \\"I don't know whether I'm the first man in space, or the last dog in space.\\" In 1969, by the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers Gazenko was assigned to the 3rd General Directorate of the Ministry of Health as Director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. His research of that period was focused on basic problems of space biomedicine. The study of the impact of zero gravity on living organisms allowed justification of the principles and methods of protecting humans from the unfavourable effects of space flight and creation of a system of supporting the health and productivity of space crews before, during, and after the flight. From 1978 Gazenko was involved in developing the system of physiological, health, and psychological measures for crews in prolonged space flights and after return to earth. He initiated the Cosmos biosatellite nonhuman primate program, which has been highly successful since its genesis in 1979. He recalls how difficult it was to decide to fly a primate for the first time. \\"It was obvious to us that we had to fly monkeys if we wanted to resolve the big questions about manned space flight. But our expertise was with other animals, like mice and dogs, so we didn't dare to fly monkeys for a long time.\\" Close contacts with American primate researchers were valuable, Gazenko says. \\"They helped us to overcome the, well, let's say the mental barrier.\\" Later life Gazenko was elected president of the All-Union (now Russia) Physiological Society named Pavlov in 1987, and retired the following year with the rank of lieutenant-general in the medical services of the Soviet Air Force. A deputy of the USSR from 1989-1991, - was a member of the Committee on Science and Education of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and was a member of the Commission which investigated the 1989 April 9 tragedy in Tbilisi. Gazenko was an adviser to the Russian Academy of Sciences at the State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation \\"Institute of Biomedical Problems.\\" In 1998 Gazenko expressed regret for the manner of Laika's death: :\\"Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We shouldn't have done it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.\\" Until his death, he acted as an advisor to Anatoly Grigoriev, the current Director of the Institute. He had been appointed to the position of Academician in the Russian Academy of Science. Gazenko died on November 17, 2007; he is buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

Tintin (; ) is the titular protagonist of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©. He is a reporter and adventurer who travels around the world with his dog Snowy. The character was created in 1929 and introduced in , a weekly youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper . He appears as a young man, around 14 to 19 years old with a round face and quiff hairstyle. Tintin has a sharp intellect, can defend himself, and is honest, decent, compassionate, and kind. Through his investigative reporting, quick- thinking, and all-around good nature, Tintin is always able to solve the mystery and complete the adventure. Unlike more colourful characters that he encounters, Tintin's personality is neutral, which allows the reader not merely to follow the adventures but assume Tintin's position within the story. Combined with Herg√©'s signature (\\"clear line\\") style, this helps the reader \\"safely enter a sensually stimulating world\\". Tintin's creator died in 1983, yet his creation remains a popular literary figure, even featured in a 2011 Hollywood film, directed by Steven Spielberg. Tintin has been criticised for his controversial attitudes to race and other factors, been honoured by others for his \\"tremendous spirit\\", and has prompted a few to devote their careers to his study. General Charles de Gaulle \\"considered Tintin his only international rival\\". History =Origins= Palle Huld, during his trip around the world in 1928, almost certainly influenced Herg√© to create TinTin. Herg√© biographer Pierre Assouline noted that \\"Tintin had a prehistory\\", being influenced by a variety of sources that Herg√© had encountered throughout his life. Herg√© noted that during his early schooling in the midst of World War I, when German armies occupied Belgium, he had drawn pictures in the margins of his school workbooks of an unnamed young man battling (a slang term for the Germans). He later commented that these drawings depicted a brave and adventurous character using his intelligence and ingenuity against opponents, but none of these early drawings survive. Herg√© was also influenced by the physical appearance and mannerisms of his younger brother Paul, who had a round face and a quiff hairstyle. In search of adventure, Paul later joined the army, receiving jeers from fellow officers when the source of Herg√©'s visual inspiration became obvious. Herg√© later stated that in his youth, \\"I watched him a lot; he entertained me and fascinated me... It makes sense that Tintin took on his character, gestures, poses. He had a way of moving and a physical presence that must have inspired me without my knowing it. His gestures stayed in my mind. I copied them clumsily, without meaning to or even knowing I was doing it; it was him I was drawing. This is especially striking in the first drawings of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.\\" In 1898, Benjamin Rabier and Fred Isly published an illustrated story titled Tintin-Lutin (\\"Tintin the Goblin\\"), in which they featured a small goblin boy named Tintin, who had a rounded face and quiff. Herg√© claimed that Rabier's manner of drawing animals had influenced him, although he swore that he was unaware of the existence of Tintin-Lutin until one of his readers informed him of the similarity in 1970. Herg√© would also have been aware of the activities of a number of popular journalists who were well known in Belgium, most notably Joseph Kessel and Albert Londres, who may have been an influence on the development of Tintin. Another potential influence was Palle Huld, a 15-year-old Danish Boy Scout travelling the world. Robert Sex√©, a French motorcycle photojournalist, is also considered to have inspired the first few of Tintin's adventures in the Soviet Union, the Belgian Congo, and the United States. Sex√© has been noted to have a similar appearance to Tintin, and the Herg√© Foundation in Belgium has admitted that it is not too hard to imagine how Herg√© could have been influenced by the exploits of Sex√©. A few years after Herg√© discovered the joys of Scouting, he became the unofficial artist for his Scout troop and drew a Boy Scout character for the national magazine . This young man, whom he named Totor, travelled the globe and righted wrongs, all without ruffling his Scout honour. As was the format for European comics at the time, the early drawings of Totor merely illustrated the story; the text that appeared below the drawings is what propelled the action. Totor had been very much in Herg√©'s mind; its new comics character would be, Herg√© himself later said, \\"the little brother of Totor ... keeping the spirit of a Boy Scout.\\" Assouline would describe Totor as \\"a sort of trial run\\" for Tintin, while Harry Thompson noted that in several years he would \\"metamorphose\\" into Tintin. Herg√© had seen the new style of American comics and was ready to try it. Tintin's new comic would be a strip cartoon with dialogue in speech bubbles and drawings that carried the story. Young reporter Tintin would have the investigative acumen of Londres, the travelling abilities of Huld, and the high moral standing of Totor; the Boy Scout traveling reporter that Herg√© would have liked to have been. =Early development= Tintin appeared after Herg√© got his first job working at the Catholic newspaper (\\"The Twentieth Century\\"), where his director challenged him to create a new serialised comic for its Thursday supplement for young readers, (\\"The Little Twentieth\\"). In the edition of 30 December 1928 of the satirical weekly newspaper , Herg√© had included two cartoon gags with word balloons, in which he depicted a boy and a little white dog. Abbe Wallez thought that these characters could be developed further, and asked Herg√© to use characters like these for an adventure that could be serialised in . Herg√© agreed, creating The Adventures of Tintin as a result. Images of Tintin and Snowy first appeared in the youth supplement on 4 January 1929, in an advert for the upcoming series. However, Herg√© would later insist that Tintin would only be \\"born\\" on 10 January 1929, when Tintin in the Land of the Soviets began to be serialised in . Tintin was given plus fours for trousers because Herg√© sometimes wore them. Tintin did not have his quiff from the first installment, instead this only developed somewhat later, in what became page 8 of the printed volume, as Tintin is depicted getting into a car that drives off at high speeds, forcing the formation of his quiff. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets would also feature Tintin writing a report on his activities in the Soviet Union to send back to Belgium; the only time in the entire series that he is actually seen reporting. Herg√© later admitted that he did not take Tintin seriously in the early Adventures, explaining simply that he \\"put the character to the test\\" and that Tintin was simply created \\"as a joke between friends, forgotten the next day.\\" Herg√© biographer Beno√Æt Peeters noted that throughout the early Adventures, Tintin was \\"supremely Belgian\\" in his characteristics, a view echoed by biographer Pierre Assouline, who deemed all of the protagonists of the early Adventures \\"very Belgian\\". Herg√© himself commented: \\"my early works are books by a young Belgian filled with the prejudices and ideas of a Catholic, they are books that could have been written by any Belgian in my situation. They are not very intelligent, I know, and do me no honour: they are 'Belgian' books.\\" Peeters deemed the early Tintin to be \\"a Sartre-esque character\\", an \\"existentialist before the term had been coined\\", having \\"no surname, no family, hardly anything of a face, and the mere semblance of a career.\\" Ultimately, he deemed him nothing but a \\"narrative vehicle\\" for the story, being an otherwise incoherent character. =Later development=  Characterisation  = Description = The image of Tintin‚Äîa round-faced young man running with a white fox terrier by his side‚Äîis easily one of the most recognisable visual icons of the twentieth century. Herg√© created Tintin as an ethnically white Belgian who was a native of Brussels, aged 14‚Äì15 years old with blonde hair. Assouline deemed Tintin to be middle-class, which he considered one of the few traits that the character had in common with Herg√©. In his first appearance, Tintin is dressed in a long travelling coat and hat, a few pages later adopting his familiar plus fours, check suit, black socks, and Eton collar. (Herg√© remembers a Canadian student at his college who was teased for wearing plus fours and Argyll socks; certainly an inspiration.) At first, the famous quiff is plastered to Tintin's forehead, but during a particularly vigorous car chase, his quiff is out and remains so. By the time he arrives in Chicago for his third adventure, both Herg√© and his readers feel they know Tintin well, and he was to change little in either appearance or dress. Herg√© was once asked by interviewer Numa Sadoul how the character Tintin developed; he replied, \\"He practically did not evolve. Graphically, he remained an outline. Look at his features: his face is a sketch, a formula.\\" This view was echoed by Assouline, who commented that graphically, Tintin was \\"as uncomplicated as the story line\\". Herg√© never explained why he chose Tintin as the character's name. He had previously made use of alliteration with the name of his previous character, Totor. Michael Farr speculated that Herg√© had adopted it from Rabier's Tintin le lutin, although Herg√© insisted that he did not learn of this book until 1970. Farr incorrectly believed that \\"Tintin\\" was probably the character's surname because other characters, such as his landlady, occasionally refer to him as Mr. Tintin (as printed on his doorbell), but \\"monsieur\\" is sometimes used with only a first name in French even today, especially in certain situations, and was common in the past. More specifically, use of only a person's first name is usually impolite even today and was so especially in the past. Assouline asserted that it could not be his surname because he lacked a family. He thought that Herg√© had adopted it because \\"it sounded heroic, clear, and cheerful\\" as well as being \\"easy to remember\\". Tintin's age is never specified. Throughout the Adventures, published over 50 years, he remained youthful. In 1970, Herg√© commented that \\"For me, Tintin hasn't aged. What age do I give him? I don't know ... 17? In my judgement, he was 14 or 15 when I created him, Boy Scout, and he has practically not moved on. Suppose he put on 3 or 4 years in 40 years ... Good, work out an average, 15 and 4 equals 19.\\" = Occupation = From Tintin's first adventure, he lives the life of a campaigning reporter. He is sent to the Soviet Union, where he writes his editor a dispatch. He travels to the Belgian Congo, where he engages in photojournalism. When he travels to China in The Blue Lotus, the Shanghai News features the front-page headline, \\"Tintin's Own Story\\". In The Broken Ear, with notebook in hand, Tintin questions the director of the Museum of Ethnography over a recent theft. Sometimes Tintin is the one being interviewed, such as when a radio reporter presses him for details, \\"In your own words.\\" But aside from a few examples, Tintin is never actually seen consulting with his editor or delivering a story. As his adventures continue, Tintin is less often seen reporting and is more often seen as a detective, pursuing his investigative journalism from his flat at No. 26 Labrador Road. Other characters refer to him as Sherlock Holmes, as he has a sharp intellect, an eye for detail, and powers of deduction. Like Holmes, he is occasionally a master of disguise, and in Rastapopoulos even has an archenemy. Tintin's occupation drifts further in later adventures, abandoning all pretence of reporting news and instead making it in his role of explorer. Clearly unencumbered with financial preoccupations, after Red Rackham's Treasure he is ensconced as a permanent house guest in the stately Marlinspike Hall with retired mariner Captain Haddock and the scientist Professor Calculus. Tintin occupies all of his time with his friends, exploring the bottom of the sea, the tops of the mountains, and the surface of the Moon (sixteen years before astronaut Neil Armstrong). Through it all, Tintin finds himself cast in the role of international social crusader, sticking up for the underdog and looking after those less fortunate than himself. = Skills and abilities = From the first volume onward, Herg√© depicted Tintin as being adept at driving or fixing any mechanical vehicle that he comes across, including cars, motorcycles, aeroplanes, and tanks. Given the opportunity, Tintin is at ease driving any automobile, has driven a moon tank, and is comfortable with every aspect of aviation. He is also a skilled radio operator with knowledge of Morse code. He packs a solid punch to a villain's jaw when necessary, demonstrates impressive swimming skills, and is a crack shot. He proves himself a capable engineer and scientist during his adventure to the Moon. He is also an excellent athlete, in outstanding condition, able to walk, run, and swim long distances. Herg√© summarized Tintin's abilities thusly: \\"a hero without fear or reproach.\\" More than anything else, Tintin is a quick thinker and an effective diplomat. He is simply an all-rounder, good at almost everything, which is what Herg√© himself would have liked to be. = Personality = Tintin's personality evolved as Herg√© wrote the series. Peeters related that in the early Adventures, Tintin's personality was \\"incoherent\\", in that he was \\"[s]ometimes foolish and sometimes omniscient, pious to the point of mockery and then unacceptably aggressive\\", ultimately just serving as a \\"narrative vehicle\\" for Herg√©'s plots. Herg√© biographer Pierre Assouline noted that in the early Adventures, Tintin showed \\"little sympathy for humanity\\". Assouline described the character as \\"obviously celibate, excessively virtuous, chivalrous, brave, a defender of the weak and oppressed, never looks for trouble but always finds it; he is resourceful, takes chances, is discreet, and is a nonsmoker.\\" Michael Farr deemed Tintin to be an intrepid young man of high moral standing, with whom his audience can identify. His rather neutral personality permits a balanced reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness that surrounds him, allowing the reader to assume Tintin's position within the story rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with comics expert Scott McCloud noting that the combination of Tintin's iconic, neutral personality and Herg√©'s \\"unusually realistic\\", signature (\\"clear line\\") style \\"allows the reader to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world.\\" To the other characters, Tintin is honest, decent, compassionate, and kind. He is also modest and self-effacing, which Herg√© also was, and is the most loyal of friends, which Herg√© strove to be. The reporter does have vices, becoming too tipsy before facing the firing squad (in The Broken Ear) or too angry when informing Captain Haddock that he nearly cost them their lives (in Explorers on the Moon). However, as Michael Farr observed, Tintin has \\"tremendous spirit\\" and, in Tintin in Tibet, was appropriately given the name Great Heart. By turns, Tintin is innocent, politically crusading, escapist, and finally cynical. If he had perhaps too much of the goody-goody about him, at least he was not priggish; Herg√© admitting as much, saying, \\"If Tintin is a moralist, he's a moralist who doesn't take things too seriously, so humour is never far away from his stories.\\" It is this sense of humour that makes the appeal of Tintin truly international.  Reception  The Adventures of Tintin was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, and it remains popular today. By the time of the centenary of Herg√©'s birth in 2007, Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies. = Literary criticism = The study of Tintin has become the life work of many literary critics, observers sometimes referring to this study as \\"Tintinology\\". A prominent literary critic of Tintin is Philippe Goddin, \\"Belgium's leading authority on Herg√©\\", author of numerous books on the subject, including Herg√© and Tintin, Reporters and the biography . In 1983, Beno√Æt Peeters published , subsequently published in English as Tintin and the World of Herg√© in 1988. The reporter Michael Farr brought Tintin literary criticism to the English language with works such as Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure (1989), Tintin: The Complete Companion (2001), Tintin & Co. (2007) and The Adventures of Herg√© (2007), as had English screenwriter Harry Thompson, the author of Tintin: Herg√© and his Creation (1991). = Controversy = Tintin's earliest stories naively depicted controversial images, with Tintin engaging in racial stereotypes, animal cruelty, violence, colonialism, including ethnocentric caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans, most notably in Tintin in the Congo. Later, Herg√© made corrections to Tintin's actions, for example, replacing Tintin's dynamiting of a rhinoceros with an incident in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle, and called his earlier actions \\"a transgression of my youth.\\" = Legacy = As observed by Michael Farr, \\"Herg√© created a hero who embodied human qualities and virtues but no faults. The Adventures of Tintin mirror the past century while Tintin himself provides a beacon of excellence for the future.\\" Harry Thompson said Tintin is \\"almost featureless, ageless, sexless, and did not appear to be burdened with a personality. Yet this very anonymity remains the key to Tintin's gigantic international success. With so little to mark him out, anybody from Cura√ßao to Coventry can identify with him and live out his adventures. Millions have done so, both adults and children, including the likes of Steven Spielberg, Andy Warhol, Wim Wenders, Fran√ßoise Sagan, Harold Macmillan and General Charles de Gaulle, who considered Tintin his only international rival.\\" On 3 March 1983, when Herg√© died at 76, several leading French and Belgian newspapers devoted their front pages to the news, some illustrating it with a panel of Snowy grieving over his master's unconscious body.  Statues and commemorative murals of Tintin  * The Grand Sablon / Grote Zavel, Brussels, Belgium contains a life sized bronze statue of Tintin and his fox terrier, Snowy just outside Comics cafe. * A mural on a building at Rue de l'Etuve / Stoofstraat recreates a scene of Tintin and Captain Haddock coming down a building fire escape from The Calculus Affair. * The South station in Brussels contains a huge reproduction of a panel from Tintin in America. * The Le Lombard building in Central Brussels (Near the South railway station) two giant heads of Tintin and Snowy on the roof. These are lit up with neon lights at night. Lombard was the editor of the Journal de Tintin. * The Stokkel/Stockel metro station in Brussels has huge panels with scenes from Tintin comic books painted as murals. * The Uccle cultural center (Rue Ruge)in Belgium has a life size statue of Tintin and Snowy. The statue was sculpted by Nat Neujeun and commissioned by Raymond Leblanc, the publisher of Le Petit Vingtieme. * Floral Street in Covent Garden (United Kingdom) contains a shop called The Tintin shop, containing Tintin memorabilia. * A restaurant on Zuidstraat, Brussels is named Le Lotus Bleu (after the original French name of the Tintin comic The Blue Lotus) * One of the high speed trains of Thalys is covered with images from Tintin comic books. * The Herg√© museum in Brussels contains numerous memorabilia from Remi's works with respect to Tintin * Brussel's Comic Strip Center contains a 1952 bust of Tintin by the artist Nat Neujean  Adaptations  Tintin as he appears in Steven Spielberg's 2011 motion capture feature film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn as portrayed by Jamie Bell Tintin has appeared in real-life events staged by publishers for publicity stunts. Tintin's first live appearance was at the Gare du Nord station in Brussels on 8 May 1930, towards the end publication of the first adventure, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. Fifteen-year-old Lucien Pepermans dressed to play the part and travelled with Herg√© to the station by train. They were expecting only a handful of readers but instead found themselves mobbed by a whole horde of fans. Fourteen-year-old Henri Dendoncker appeared as Tintin returning from Tintin in the Congo. Others have played Tintin returning from the adventures Tintin in America and The Blue Lotus. Actress Jane Rubens was the first to play Tintin on stage in April 1941. The plays, written by Jacques Van Melkebeke, included Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond and Mr. Boullock's Disappearance. She was later replaced by 11-year-old Roland Ravez, who also lent his voice to recordings of the Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus. Jean-Pierre Talbot played Tintin in two live-action movie adaptations: Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964). Canadian actor Colin O'Meara voiced Tintin in the 1991 Canadian-made The Adventures of Tintin animated TV series, which originally aired on HBO and subsequently on Nickelodeon. At the same time, actor Richard Pearce provided the voice of Tintin for a radio drama series of Tintin created by the BBC, which also starred Andrew Sachs as Snowy. In 2005, English actor Russell Tovey played the role at the London Barbican Theatre for a Young Vic adaptation of Tintin in Tibet. Shortly before Herg√©'s death in 1983, he came to admire the work of Steven Spielberg; whom he felt was the only director who could successfully bring his Tintin to the big screen. The result was the 2011 motion capture feature film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, which merges plots from several Tintin books. = Tintin filmography = ; Feature films * 1961 : Tintin and the Golden Fleece (Tintin et le Myst√®re de la Toison d'or) by Jean-Jacques Vierne * 1964 : Tintin and the Blue Oranges (Tintin et les Oranges bleues) by Philippe Condroyer ; Animated films * 1947 : The Crab with the Golden Claws (Le Crabe aux pinces d'or) by Claude Misonne * 1964 : The Calculus Case by Ray Goossens * 1969 : Tintin et la SGM by Raymond Leblanc * 1969 : Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (Tintin et le Temple du Soleil) by Eddie Lateste * 1972 : Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (Tintin et le lac aux requins) by Raymond Leblanc * 2011 : The Adventures of Tintin (Les Aventures de Tintin: Le Secret de La Licorne) by Steven Spielberg ; Television series * 1957-1961 : Herg√©'s Adventures of Tintin (animated series) * 1992 : The Adventures of Tintin (animated series of 3 seasons 13 episodes each)  See also  * List of The Adventures of Tintin characters References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography=               *  Further reading     External links   Tintinologist.org ‚Äì Long-established English-language fan site. * Hachettebookgroup.com ‚Äì Tintin books, US Tintin characters Comics characters introduced in 1929 Fictional reporters Fictional amateur detectives Fictional Belgian people Fictional explorers Magazine mascots Male characters in comics Scouting and Guiding in Belgium Herg√© characters Fictional astronauts Fictional colonels ","title":"Tintin (character)"},{"id":"985640","text":"MV Macoma was one of nine Anglo Saxon Royal Dutch/Shell oil tankers converted to become a Merchant Aircraft Carrier (MAC ship).

The only contemporary information about him comes from Gildas, who castigated him for various sins, including the murder of two \\"royal youths\\" inside a church. The historical Constantine is also known from the genealogies of the Dumnonian kings, and possibly inspired the tradition of Saint Constantine, a king-turned-monk venerated in Southwest Britain and elsewhere. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth included Constantine in his pseudohistorical chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae, adding details to Gildas' account and making Constantine the successor to King Arthur as King of Britain. Under Geoffrey's influence, Constantine appeared as Arthur's heir in later chronicles. Less commonly, he also appeared in that role in medieval Arthurian romances and prose works, and in some modern versions of the legend. History Southern Britain in c. 540, the time of Gildas. Constantine's likely kingdom of Dumnonia is in the southwest; the territory of the Damnonii is in the northwest Gildas mentions Constantine in chapters 28 and 29 of his 6th-century work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae.De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, ch. 28‚Äì29. He is one of five Brittonic kings whom the author rebukes and compares to Biblical beasts. Gildas calls Constantine the \\"tyrannical whelp of the unclean lioness of Damnonia\\", a reference to the books of Daniel and Revelation, and apparently also a slur directed at his mother. This Damnonia is generally identified as the kingdom of Dumnonia in Southwestern Britain.Lloyd, pp. 131‚Äì132. Scholars such as Lloyd Laing and Leslie Alcock note the possibility that Gildas may have instead intended the territory of the Damnonii, a tribe in present-day Scotland mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, but others such as Thomas D. O'Sullivan consider this unlikely.O'Sullivan, p. 92 & note. Gildas says that despite swearing an oath against deceit and tyranny, Constantine disguised himself in an abbot's robes and attacked two \\"royal youths\\" praying before a church altar, killing them and their companions. Gildas is clear that Constantine's sins were manifold even before this, as he had committed \\"many adulteries\\" after casting off his lawfully wedded wife. Gildas encourages Constantine, whom he knows to still be alive at the time, to repent his sins lest he be damned. The murders may relate to a sixth century cult in Brittany honoring the Saints Dredenau, two young princes killed by an ambitious uncle.Wasyliw, pp. 80‚Äì81. Scholars generally identify Gildas' Constantine with the figure Custennin Gorneu or Custennin Corneu (Constantine of Cornwall) who appears in the genealogies of the kings of Dumnonia.O'Sullivan, pp. 92‚Äì93. Custennin is mentioned as the father of Erbin and the grandfather of the hero Geraint in the Bonedd y Saint, the prose romance Geraint and Enid, and after emendation, the genealogies in Jesus College MS 20.Bromwich, pp. 318‚Äì319; 356‚Äì360.Geraint and Enid. Based on Custennin's placement in the genealogies, Thomas D. O'Sullivan suggests a floruit for Constantine of 520‚Äì523.O'Sullivan, p. 95. Saint Constantine Saint Constantine's Church in Constantine, Cornwall, perhaps connected to the historical king of Dumnonia The historical Constantine of Dumnonia may have influenced later traditions, known in Southwestern Britain as well as in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, about a Saint Constantine who is usually said to have been a king who gave up his crown to become a monk. The Cornish and Welsh traditions especially may have been influenced by Gildas, in particular his adjuration for Constantine to repent; the belief may have been that the reproach eventually worked.Orme, pp. 95‚Äì96. The two major centers for the cultus of Saint Constantine were the church in Constantine Parish and the Chapel of Saint Constantine in St Merryn Parish (now Constantine Bay), both in Cornwall. The former was established by at least the 11th century, as it is mentioned in Rhygyfarch's 11th-century Life of Saint David. At this time it may have supported a clerical community, but in later centuries it was simply a parish church. The Chapel at Constantine Bay had a holy well, and was the center of its own sub-parish. The Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals) and the Annals of Ulster record the conversion of a certain Constantine; these may be a reference to the Cornish saint and therefore to the historical figure. Several subsequent religious texts refer to Constantine, generally associating him with Cornwall, often specifically as its king. The Life of Saint David says that Constantine, King of Cornwall, gave up his crown and joined Saint David's monastery at Menevia. The Vitae Petroci includes an episode in which Saint Petroc protects a stag being hunted by a wealthy man named Constantine, who eventually converts and becomes a monk. Here Constantine is not said to be king, but a 12th-century text referring to this story, the Miracula, specifically names him as such, further adding that upon his conversion he gave Petroc an ivory horn that became one of the saint's chief relics.Jankulak, p. 17. A number of other traditions attested across Britain describe saints or kings named Constantine, suggesting a confusion and conflation of various figures.Bromwich, pp. 318‚Äì319, discusses the confusion of some of these various Constantines. Notable in the context of \\"Saint\\" Constantine is Custennin Vendigeit (The Blessed), the name for the historical usurper Constantine III in the Welsh Triads. Other sites in Southwestern Britain associated with figures named Constantine include the church of Milton Abbot, Devon; a chapel in nearby Dunterton, Devon; and a chapel in Illogan, Cornwall. The two Devon sites may have been dedicated instead to Constantine the Great, as local churches were subject to Tavistock Abbey, dedicated to Constantine the Great's mother Helena. In Wales, two churches were dedicated to Constantine: Llangystennin (in Conwy) and Welsh Bicknor (now in Herefordshire, England). The church in Govan, a parish in present-day Scotland, was also dedicated to a Saint Constantine.Clarkson 1999. Geoffrey of Monmouth and the chronicle tradition =Historia Regum Britanniae= King Arthur from a 15th-century Welsh adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. Geoffrey made Constantine Arthur's successor Geoffrey of Monmouth includes Constantine in a section of his Historia Regum Britanniae adapted from Gildas. As he does throughout the work, Geoffrey alters his source material, recasting Gildas' reproved kings as successors, rather than contemporaries as in De Excidio.Wright, p. 10. In addition to Gildas, Geoffrey evidently knew the Dumnonian genealogy essentially as it appears in Geraint and Enid and similar sources. He further adds a number of other details not found in earlier sources, identifying Constantine as a son of Cador, a Cornish ruler known in Welsh tradition as Cadwy mab Geraint. Notably, Geoffrey's Constantine is King Arthur's kinsman and succeeds him as King of the Britons.Bromwich, p. 319. Norris J. Lacy and Geoffrey Ashe suggest Geoffrey made this Arthurian connection based on an existing tradition locating Arthur's birthplace in southwest Britain.Lacy, Ashe, and Mancoff, p. 301. However, noting that the earliest references place Arthur in northern Britain rather than the southwest, Rachel Bromwich considers the connection an arbitrary invention by Geoffrey, perhaps suggested by his earlier inventions of familial ties between Arthur and Constantine the Great and the usurper Constantine III.Bromwich, p. 319, 358. Geoffrey calls Constantine Arthur's cognatus, or blood relative, but does not specify the exact relation, causing much confusion for later writers.Moll, p. 166. In Geoffrey, Arthur passes his crown to his relative Constantine after being mortally wounded by the traitor Mordred in the Battle of Camlann. Geoffrey identifies Gildas' \\"royal youths\\" as Mordred's two sons, who, along with their Saxon allies, continue their father's insurrection after his death. After \\"many battles\\" Constantine routs the rebels, and Mordred's sons flee to London and Winchester, where they hide in a church and a friary, respectively. Constantine hunts them down and executes them before the altars of their sanctuaries. Divine retribution for this transgression comes three years later when Constantine is killed by his nephew Aurelius Conanus (Gildas' Aurelius Caninus), precipitating a civil war. He is buried at Stonehenge alongside other kings of Britain.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 11, ch. 2‚Äì4. Latin scholar Neil Wright considers Geoffrey's changes to Gildas to be deliberate reformulations that produce a more sympathetic picture of Constantine and his successors. For Wright, identifying the \\"royal youths\\" as traitors justifies the killing, reducing Constantine's offence from murder to sacrilege (for killing the traitors in sanctuary). Overall, scholars regard Geoffrey's depiction of Constantine as pessimistic, highlighting how little of Arthur's legacy survives his death.Morris, p. 138. =Later chronicles= Geoffrey returned to Constantine's struggles and untimely murder in his later work Vita Merlini. The text, set during the reign of Aurelius Conanus, recounts how Constantine gave Mordred's sons a \\"cruel death\\" and ended their destructive rebellion, omitting details of the killing. According to the Vita, Constantine ruled only briefly before Conanus rose up, killed him, and seized the kingdom he now governs poorly. Rosemary Morris writes that Vita Merlini reinforces the Historia's message that Constantine was unable to perpetuate the glories of Arthur's reign.Geoffrey of Monmouth, Vita Merlini lines 1128‚Äì1135. See: Variants of Geoffrey's version of Constantine appeared in the numerous later adaptations of the Historia, which were widely regarded as authentic in the Middle Ages. Such variants include Wace's Anglo-Norman Roman de Brut, the Welsh Brut y Brenhinedd, and Layamon's English Brut.Bruce, p. 218. These typically reflect Geoffrey's cynicism about the character. Layamon, however, adds a touch of optimism, writing that Constantine successfully if briefly answered Arthur's charge to rule in his manner. Following Geoffrey, many of these works do not expand upon Constantine's relation to Arthur, though others elaborate that he is Arthur's nephew. Taking hints from Geoffrey's version of Arthur's family tree, these writers make Constantine's father Cador a brother, or half-brother, of Arthur through Arthur's mother Igraine.Molchan, pp. 31, 38, and notes.Blaess, pp. 70‚Äì71. Later traditions =Medieval romance and prose tradition= Constantine does not figure strongly in the Arthurian romance traditions or prose cycles. He is absent from the French Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles, in which Lancelot and his kin kill off Mordred's sons, and no successor to Arthur appears.Morris, p. 139.Trachsler, p. 31. Some scholars find this omission significant. Rosemary Morris suggests that these versions downplay the issue of a designated heir to Arthur in order to heighten the stakes of Mordred's usurpation and to magnify Lancelot's role in the story. Richard Trachsler writes that the exclusion of an heir adds a sense of finality to the Arthurian story at Arthur's death. Constantine does appear in some medieval works. In Jean d'Outremeuse's 14th-century Ly Myreur des Histors, Lancelot installs Constantine on the throne after Arthur's death. He is King of Britain in some versions of the legend of Havelok the Dane, beginning with Geoffrey Gaimar's 12th-century Estoire des Engleis.Spence, p. 55, 83‚Äì85. He is also mentioned as Arthur's successor in the 14th-century English alliterative poem known as the Alliterative Morte Arthure, following Arthur's war with the Romans and his subsequent mortal battle with Mordred.Benson & Foster, Alliterative Morte Arthure line 4316. Other English romances that mention Constantine in passing include the 14th-century The Awntyrs off Arthure and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, written around 1400.Blaess, p. 76 and note. Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos's 16th-century Portuguese novel Memorial das Proezas da Segunda T√°vola Redonda fuses Constantine with the Sagramore, creating \\"Sagramor Constantino\\", Arthur's son-in-law and heir. As King, Constantine forms a new Round Table to defeat the old enemies and continue the glory of Arthurian Britain.Vargas D√≠az-Toledo 2006, pp. 233‚Äì234.Vargas D√≠az-Toledo 2013, para. 29‚Äì33.Finazzi-Agr√≤, pp. 45‚Äì48. Constantine's relationship to Arthur varies widely in these later works. Many works leave it unstated, while others follow the chronicles in making Constantine Arthur's nephew. Several romances, especially English works, cast him as Arthur's grand-nephew, Constantine's father Cador being the son of a (generally unnamed) sister of Arthur.Blaess, pp. 70‚Äì71, 76. Constantine also appears as Arthur's heir in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, including sections adapted from the Alliterative Morte Arthure. Malory makes several changes to his source material that expand Constantine's role. Malory has Arthur designate Constantine and Baldwin of Britain as regents before going off to fight the Romans, a role that the Alliterative Morte gives to Mordred. Eug√®ne Vinaver suggests that Malory modelled this change on Henry V's appointment of John, Duke of Bedford, and Bishop Henry Beaufort as regents. Others finds it likelier that Malory simply wanted to replace Mordred in the Roman war narrative.Dichmann, pp. 73‚Äì74.Whitaker, pp. 15‚Äì16. Malory also expands Constantine's role after Arthur's death: he rules honourably and restores the Bishop of Canterbury to his seat. Scholars note that this expansion closes the book on a much more optimistic note than Malory's sources, indicating that Arthurian ideals live on under Constantine.Whitaker, pp. 102‚Äì103.Simko, pp. 167‚Äì168.Benson, p. 247. =Modern literature and media= Constantine features in some modern treatments of the legend. Katrina Trask's Under King Constantine, an 1892 book comprising three long romantic poems, is set in his reign.Lupack & Lupack, p. 12. He is an important unseen character in Henry Newbolt's 1895 play Mordred in his usual role as Arthur's successor.Fisher, p. 166. He similarly appears in Rosemary Sutcliff's 1963 novel Sword at Sunset, in which the grievously wounded \\"Artos\\" voluntarily passes the crown to him.Taylor & Brewer, p. 303. In Parke Godwin's 1984 novel Beloved Exile, Constantine is one of several nobles fighting Guenevere, the protagonist, in a bid to succeed Arthur.Hoburg, pp. 72‚Äì73, 75‚Äì78. He is the chief protagonist of the 1990 computer game Spirit of Excalibur; players control Constantine and his allies as they defend the kingdom after Arthur's death.Thompson & Lacy, p. 590. Darrell Schweitzer's 1995 fantasy story \\"The Epilogue of the Sword\\" features an ageing Lancelot returning to serve Constantine against the Saxons.Thompson, p. 605. Constantine elaborately figures into Arthur Phillips' 2011 novel The Tragedy of Arthur, which centers on an apocryphal Arthurian play attributed to William Shakespeare that the narrator, a fictional version of Phillips, insists is a hoax created by his father. In the play-within-the-novel, Constantine is Guenhera's brother and Arthur's vassal and heir; the novel's narrator claims that Constantine is based on his father's old nemesis, prosecutor Ted Constantine.Phillips, pp. 254, 257‚Äì259, 297.

The only certain historical record of him is in the writings of his contemporary Gildas, who excoriates him as a tyrant. However, he may be identified with one of the several similarly named figures active in Britain during this period. In the 12th century Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted Gildas' account for his chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae, and thereafter Aurelius Conanus was remembered as a legendary King of Britain. Accounts Gildas discusses Aurelius Conanus in Chapter 30 of his work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, in a section in which he reproves five kings for their various sins.De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, ch. 30.Giles, pp. 26‚Äì27. All the kings are compared to Biblical beasts; Aurelius is called the \\"lion's whelp\\". Gildas castigates him for his \\"horrible murders, fornications, and adulteries\\", and beseeches him to repent his sins before he ends up like the rest of his family, who have already died pursuing similar ends.Giles, pp. 26‚Äì27. Little else can be said of Aurelius Conanus with any certainty; it is not even known in which part of Britain he ruled. Historian John Edward Lloyd suggests that the form Caninus, appearing in one important manuscript of De Excidio, may have been a corruption of the more common Cuna(g)nus, or Cynan in Welsh.Lloyd, p. 132. As such he may be identified with one of the figures of that era who bore that name, such as Cynan Garwyn of Powys or his relative Cynin ap Millo. Lloyd suggests a connection with the degenerate descendants of the great hero Ambrosius Aurelianus whom Gildas mentions in Chapter 25. In this case his kingdom may have been located out in the territory later taken by the Anglo-Saxons, i.e. what is now England. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted Gildas' account for his influential pseudohistory Historia Regum Britanniae, adding fictional details and making these contemporary regional rulers successive high-kings of Britain. Geoffrey makes Aurelius Conanus the nephew to the previous king Constantine, whom he kills after a reign of only three years. The kingship should go to another, unnamed uncle of Aurelius', but Aurelius pursues a civil war, ultimately imprisoning his kinsman and killing his sons. However, Aurelius only rules for two years before he himself dies; he is succeeded by Vortiporius.Historia Regum Britanniae, Book 11, ch. 4‚Äì6. Layamon's Brut by Layamon adds the detail that he poisoned his cousins, ill-treated his sisters and died by falling from a horse.

Map showing the location of Dyfed in southwesternmost Wales. Vortiporius or Vortipor (, Middle Welsh Gwrdeber or Gwerthefyr)Koch, John, Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 864: \\"In Old Welsh sources, the name Guortepir, corresponding to the Vorteporius of Gildas...is kept distinct from Guorthemir, but in Middle Welsh texts the two tend to fall together as Gwerthefyr, the former unhistorically taking the form of the latter.\\" was a king of Dyfed in the early to mid-6th century. He ruled over an area approximately corresponding to modern Pembrokeshire, Wales. Records from this era are scant, and virtually nothing is known of him or his kingdom. The only contemporary information about Vortiporius comes from the Welsh ecclesiastic Gildas, in a highly allegorical condemnation from his De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (). At the time the work was written (c. 540), Gildas says that Vortiporius was king of Dyfed, that he was grey with age, that his wife had died, and that he had at least one daughter., De Excidio, section 31 (in English), De Excidio, section 31 (in Latin) As a legendary king in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century treatment of the Matter of Britain, the Historia Regum Britanniae, Vortiporius was the successor of Aurelius Conanus and was succeeded by Malgo. He is not mentioned in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum attributed to Nennius. Vortiporius appears in the Irish genealogy given in the 8th-century work The Expulsion of the D√©isi, in which his name is given as Gartbuir., The Expulsion of the Dessi. The Irish form is given as \\"Tualodor mac Rigin maic Catacuind maic Caittienn maic Clotenn maic Naee maic Artuir maic Retheoir maic Congair maic Gartbuir maic Alchoil maic Trestin maic Aeda Brosc maic Corath maic Echach Almuir maic Arttchuirp\\". Meyer's translation is \\"Teudor son of Regin, son of Catgocaun, son of Cathen, son of Cloten, son of Nougoy, son of Arthur, son of Petr, son of Cincar, son of Guortepir, son of Aircol, son of Triphun, son of √Åed Brosc, son of Corath, son of Eochaid Allmuir, son of Artchorp\\". The pedigree given in the Harleian MS. 5389, written c. 1100, is nearly identical, with his name given as Guortepir., Harleian MS. 3859, \\"... Teudos map Regin map Catgocaun map Cathen map Cloten map Nougoy map Arthur map Petr map Cincar map Guortepir map Aircol map Triphun ...\\". In the Jesus College MS. 20, he is called Gwrdeber., Pedigrees From Jesus College MS. 20. \\"... Teudos M. Gwgawn M. Cathen M. Eleothen M. Nennue M. Arthur M. Peder M. Kyngar M. Gwrdeber M. Erbin M. Aircol lawhir M. tryphun M. Ewein vreisc M. Cyndwr bendigeit ...\\". Ewein vreisc is given here for √Åed Brosc given elsewhere, and Erbin is inserted between Gwrdeber and Aircol, where he is not listed elsewhere. The genealogy in Expulsion says he was a descendant of Eochaid Allmuir ( [literally (from) Overseas]),Dictionary of the Irish Language, Compact Edition, Royal Irish Academy, 1998; allmuir, p. 37, column 289, line 078 who is said to have led a sept of the D√©isi in their settlement of Dyfed c. 270. A memorial stone was discovered in 1895 near the church of Castell Dwyran in Carmarthenshire bearing a Christian cross and with inscriptions in both Latin and in ogham. Dedicated to Voteporigis in the Latin inscription and Votegorigas in ogham, it was immediately assumed that this referred to Vortiporius. However, this assumption is refuted by modern linguistic analysis, which notes that the missing 'r' in the first syllable of 'Voteporigis'/'Votegorigas' is significant, and so the stone must be dedicated to a different person. Gildas 241px In his De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (), written c. 540, Gildas makes an allegorical condemnation of 5 British kings by likening them to the beasts of the Christian Apocalypse as expressed in the biblical Book of Revelation, 13-2: the lion, leopard, bear, and dragon.* -- \\"And the beast which I saw was like unto a _leopard_ , and his feet were as the feet of a _bear_ , and his mouth as the mouth of a _lion_ : and the _dragon_ gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.\\" (underlining added) In the course of his condemnations, Gildas makes passing reference to the other beasts mentioned in the Apocalypse, such as the eagle, serpent, calf, and wolf. Vortiporius is called \\"the spotted leopard\\" and the \\"tyrant of the Demetians\\", where Demetia is the ancient name of Dyfed. Gildas restricts his attention to the kings of Gwynedd (Maelgwn Gwynedd), Dyfed (Vortiporius), Penllyn (probable, as its king Cuneglasus/Cynlas appears in royal genealogies associated with the region),, A History of Wales, Vol. I Damnonia/Alt Clud (Constantine), and the unknown region associated with Caninus. These are all Welsh kingdoms except for Alt Clud, which had a long and ongoing relationship with Gwynedd and its kings. The reason for Gildas' disaffection for these individuals is unknown. He was selective in his choice of kings, as he had no comments concerning the kings of the other British kingdoms that were thriving at the time, such as Rheged, Gododdin, Elmet, Pengwern/Powys, or the kingdoms of modern-day southern England. Gildas claims outrage over moral depravity, but neither outrage nor a doctrinal dispute would seem to justify beginning the condemnation of the five kings with a personal attack against the mother of one of the kings, calling her an \\"unclean lioness\\"., De Excidio, sections 28 and 29 (in English), De Excidio, sections 28 and 29 (in Latin) Of Vortiporius Gildas says little other than offering condemnation for \\"sins\\" and providing the few personal details previously mentioned. He is alleged to be the bad son of a good father. Gildas also attacks his daughter, calling her \\"shameless\\", and implies that Vortiporius raped or had a sexual relationship with her.Gildas, De Excidio, Chapter 31, \\"by the violation of a shameless daughter\\" (impudentis filiae quodam ineluctabili) Possible monument stone The Latin inscription on the 'Monument of Voteporigis the Protector', from a rubbing of the stone. A c. 5th-6th century monument bearing both Latin and Irish ogham inscriptions is known from Castell Dwyran, Carmarthenshire, Wales. Its Latin inscription reads Memoria Voteporigis Protictoris (). The ogham inscription carries only the Goidelic form of his name in the genitive: Votecorigas. Protector (spelled here Protictoris, in the genitive) in the Latin inscription may imply a Roman- era honorific bestowed upon his ancestors, retained as a hereditary title into the 6th century. However, linguist Eric Hamp questions whether this is truly a title, suggesting that Protector may rather be a Latin translation of Uoteporix (which has essentially the same meaning as the Latin), a \\"sort of onomastic explanatory gloss\\".Hamp, Eric P.\\"Voteporigis Protictoris\\", in Studia Celtica, 30, 1996, p. 293. The ogham inscription in Goidelic shows that the Irish language was still in use at that time, and had not yet died out in South Wales., A History of Wales, Vol. I The stone's original location at the church is next to a meadow known locally as Parc yr Eglwys. Local tradition carries the admonition that plowing must not be done near the church. Examination of the meadow showed evidence of large hut-circles. The ogham inscription on the 'Monument of Voteporigis the Protector', translated by John Rhys, reading from bottom to top (image was rotated 90 degrees clockwise). There remains a substantial question as to whether the stone refers to Vortiporius or to a similarly named individual, 'Voteporigis', as the 'r' in the first syllable would give the name different meaning. Rhys argued that the two individuals were the same person, saying that the 'r' had been added at a later date, and offering several suppositions as to how this might have happened. However, he was working before the twentieth century advancements in the study of ancient Celtic languages, and his philological conclusions are suspect. More recently, Patrick Sims-WilliamsSims-Williams, Patrick, The Celtic Inscriptions of Britain: Phonology and Chronology (Oxford, 2003), pp. 346-47. notes that the two names cannot refer to the same individual due to differences in their etymologies, adding that dating the stone to the time of Vortiporius may not be valid because it relies on the inexact dating of manuscripts and their transcriptions. Geoffrey of Monmouth Geoffrey's mention of Vortiporius is contained in a brief chapter titled \\"Uortiporius, being declared king, conquers the Saxons\\". He says that Uortiporius succeeded Aurelius Conan, and after he was declared king, the Saxons rose against him and brought over their countrymen from Germany in a great fleet, but that these were defeated. Uortiporius then ruled peacefully for four years, beings succeeded by \\"Malgo\\" (Maelgwn Gwynedd). Geoffrey's fertile imagination is the only source of this information. The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, an early 19th-century collection of Welsh histories, repeats Geoffrey's account, referring to him as 'Gwrthevyr' (though Vortiporius' proper Modern Welsh spelling is Gwrdebyr; here the name has been confused with that of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern). In his Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates, James Ussher also repeats the account, attributing the information to Geoffrey. Family Vortipor was a son of Aergol Lawhir,Harleian MS 3859, \\"Guortepir map Aircol\\" so a grandson of Triffyn Farfog.Harleian MS 3859, Aircol map Triphun He had a son named Cyngar.

Along with other Pakistani military forces present in the Northern Areas (a part of Pakistan-administered Kashmir), the NLI has the primary responsibility of conducting ground operations in the interest of protecting the strategically important region of Pakistan. The regiment draws a majority of its recruits from native tribes present in the nearby mountainous areas and therefore they are less prone to altitude sickness and cold temperatures that characterize high-altitude mountain warfare, allowing the regiment to conduct its duties optimally. The Northern Light Infantry is best known for the extensive assistance and training it provided to the Afghan mujahideen (with backing from the CIA and ISI) during the Soviet-Afghan War. Formation The Northern Light Infantry has its origins in the Gilgit Scouts raised by British India for defending the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir's northern frontier. The Gilgit Scouts, along with rebels in the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces, fought in the northern front of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948, conquering important points of interest such as Skardu, Kargil and Batalik (the latter two were captured by the Indian Army in subsequent operations). In 1949, the Gilgit Scouts were split into two forces, with the wing under the original name now designated for internal security operations. The second wing, named the Northern Scouts, were designated for major external operations. In 1964, the Northern Scouts were further bifurcated with the raising of the Karakoram Scouts based in Skardu. All three forces were brought together again in 1975, under the banner of the Northern Light Infantry (a Pakistani paramilitary force). Following the events of the Kargil War with India, the Northern Light Infantry was altered from a functioning paramilitary to a fully operational regular regiment of the Pakistan Army.Northern Light Infantry Regiment (NLI) , Pakistan Army, retrieved 25 March 2018.History of Gilgit Baltistan Scouts, Gilgit Baltistan Scouts, retrieved 6 April 2018. A new paramilitary force was created in 2003 under the name Gilgit Baltistan Scouts to fill the role of the former Gilgit Scouts. Status and composition Upon its founding, the Northern Light Infantry regiment was to function as a paramilitary force, at par with the Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Corps, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and commanded by regular Pakistan Army officers. In 1967 and 1970, two battalions of the NLI were airlifted and deployed to Karachi, Sindh for internal security duties such as riot control and aiding civil authorities during an election-related period of violence. The regiment's performance during this time earned them a commendation from Field Marshal Ayub Khan. By 1998, the NLI consisted of 20 battalions commanded by a Major-General of the Pakistan Army under the designation of Inspector-General of the NLI, whose office was the Inspectorate General of NLI reporting to the GOC, X Corps as well as the Pakistani Interior Minister.  Notable operations  = Soviet- Afghan War (1979‚Äì1989) = Following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan and Israel launched Operation Cyclone, in which they financed and armed the Afghan mujahideen to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a Soviet satellite state and subsequently threaten Pakistan (a U.S. ally in the Cold War). Here, with primarily Saudi Arabian and American financing, the Northern Light Infantry trained Afghan mujahideen fighters in Gilgit-Baltistan before sending them back to Afghanistan with state-of-the-art armaments to fight the Soviet Army. =Siachen Glacier Conflict (1984‚Äì2003)= India's seizure of the Siachen Glacier (an area of Kashmir that was uninhabited and not controlled by any parties to the Kashmir conflict) in 1984 resulted in the renewal of high-level tensions with Pakistan until a mutual ceasefire agreement was brought into effect in 2003. During this period of intermittent fighting in the Siachen conflict, the NLI's 1st battalion performed defence and support work. =Kargil War (1999)= In response to India's offensive operation and subsequent seizure of the entire Siachen Glacier, Pakistan began operations to occupy key Indian forward posts along the Line of Control (LoC), sparking the Kargil War. It was reported that the Pakistan Army had launched forces exclusively from the Northern Light Infantry during this conflict. These included the 5th, 6th, 8th and 12th battalions in full strength and some elements of the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 11th battalions with the paramilitary Chitral and Bajaur Scouts deployed for logistical support. Due to their inclination to the surrounding environment and regular training, troops of the Northern Light Infantry are generally less prone to the altitude sickness and cold temperatures that accompany mountain warfare. For this reason, they were chosen as the bulk force against the Indian Army in Kargil. Small infantry units belonging to the Northern Light Infantry slipped past Indian fortifications along the LoC and promptly assaulted strategic high security points. After taking control, they used these important points to maintain their position and repel any incoming Indian troops. Heavy diplomatic pressure from the United States coupled with a massive Indian counterattack forced Pakistan to begin a withdrawal after months of intense fighting. Casualties during this conflict, like those of other Indo-Pakistani conflicts, remain disputed and unconfirmed. International sources (such as those from the U.S. Department of Defense) place Indian casualties at around 527+ whereas casualties for the Pakistani side numbered at around 700+. Following the end of the fighting, the Northern Light Infantry was commended for successfully taking control of Indian positions across the LoC and holding out against multiple elements of the Indian Army. In recognition of their performance in the Kargil conflict, the entire regiment was amalgamated into the Infantry Corps of the Pakistan Army with the status of a regular infantry regiment, and awarded with the Presidential Colours. After this, the NLI ceased to function as a paramilitary force and began anew as a regular infantry regiment in the Pakistan Army.

Birding: There are four main birding areas in the valley, the area around Aberfoyle Club; Gleneagles Nature Reserve above the Club, eastern Highland Tea Estate; and Katiyo Tea Estate some 25 km from Aberfoyle. =Water resources= The water supply for the Honde Valley comprises small piped systems and motorised pumps serving small towns, growth points, commercial plantations, service centres and some villages, as well as direct abstractions from the rivers by riparian village communities not connected to developed installations. There are a total of about seven small to medium- sized metered piped water systems at Hauna, Sachisuko, Honde Army, Zindi, Samanga, Mpotedzi and Sahumani. In addition there are other smaller un-metered water supply schemes that serve a number of villages and schools. The known smaller un-metered water supply schemes are Honde ‚ÄúPovo‚Äù Pipe Scheme, Chingaira Piped Scheme, St Columbus Secondary School, Sagambe Primary and Secondary School, Marige Water Project, Mahobo Piped Scheme and Mupenga Gravity Water Scheme. Economy Since the area is low-lying and hot it is an abundant tea and coffee growing area. The well known Katiyo, Aberfoyle, Rumbizi and Chiwira Tea Estates are among those situated in the valley. However, it is also home to many small scale and subsistence farmers.Green Harvest: The Outgrower Tea Leaf Collection System in the Honde Valley, Zimbabwe J P Mtisi There are several non-motorized irrigation schemes in Honde valley.Working Paper No. 32.

It falls under the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and is also a member of the Public Data Group. All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom Companies Act) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by the current Companies Act 2006. All registered limited companies, including subsidiary, small and inactive companies, must file annual financial statements in addition to annual company returns, which are all public records. Only some registered unlimited companies (meeting certain conditions) are exempt from this requirement. The United Kingdom has had a system of company registration since 1844. The legislation governing company registration matters is the Companies Act 2006. History The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 permitted the incorporation of joint-stock companies, previously only possible by the mechanisms of royal charter or private act, which had meant few companies were formed. The act required that all companies formed under it were recorded on a public register, and created the office of Registrar of Joint Stock Companies to be responsible for maintaining the register. Company registration in Scotland commenced in 1856, with the first company registered being 'The Daily Bulletin Limited'. The first Registrar of Joint Stock Companies for Scotland was George Deane, from 1856 to 1858, before he was transferred to the London office of Companies House to be Chief Clerk to the Registrar for England and Wales. The remaining staff were transferred to the office of the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (Q&LTR;), who took on the role of Registrar of Companies for Scotland. In 1982 the post of Q&LTR; was transferred to the Crown Agent, and the staff and functions relating to company registration in Scotland were transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on 1 April 1981. In October 1988, Companies House became an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, and then in October 1991 started to operate as a trading fund, self- financing by retaining income from charges. Companies House is also responsible for dissolving companies. In 2020, there were approximately 4.3 million businesses on the Companies House register. = Response to 2020 pandemic = In view of the coronavirus pandemic, from 25 March 2020 companies were able to apply for a three-month extension to the annual deadline for filing their accounts and reports. England and Wales England and Wales are treated as a single jurisdiction (companies may be ‚ÄòRegistered in England and Wales‚Äô) with a unified register, separate from those of Scotland or Northern Ireland. Companies must advise Companies House of their intended registered office (the official address of the company), which may be in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Wales. Consequently, on incorporation, companies will be either 'Registered in England and Wales', 'Registered in Scotland', or 'Registered in Wales'. Effectively, companies in England must register in England and Wales, companies in Scotland must register in Scotland, while companies in Wales may choose to register in either England and Wales, or in Wales. Although their legal registration is in either England and Wales, or in Wales, according to Companies House companies must display the company registered office location in a manner similar to one of the following suggested formats: The Cardiff office The Companies House office in Cardiff handles companies incorporated in England and Wales. These companies are subject to English law. Until 2011 there was another office at Nantgarw, Wales. The London office at Petty France is purely a facility to file and view documents, which are then processed in Cardiff. The Registrar of Companies for England and Wales is the Chief Executive Louise Smyth. The role of Chief Registrar is not a political one and the incumbent is a civil servant. All companies registered in England and Wales have 8-digit registration numbers. Scotland The Edinburgh office handles companies incorporated in Scotland. These companies are subject to Scots law. Scottish company registration numbers are prefixed by the letters SC. Northern Ireland The Companies Act 2006 was fully implemented on 1 October 2009 and the Northern Ireland companies register was fully integrated into Companies House. Companies House maintains a satellite office in Belfast, headed by the Registrar of Companies for Northern Ireland. Before 1 October 2009 all limited companies in Northern Ireland were registered with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and were subject to Northern Ireland law. Types of companies The many types of companies include: *Public limited company (PLC) *Private company limited by shares (Ltd, Limited) *Private company limited by guarantee, typically a non-commercial membership body which may, or may not, be charitable (Ltd, Limited) *Private unlimited company (either with or without a share capital) *Limited liability partnership (LLP) *Limited partnership (LP) *Societas Europaea (SE): European Union-wide company structure *Companies incorporated by Royal Charter (RC) *Community interest company (CIC): usually a standard limited company but regardless of the company's articles it must reinvest any and all profit *Charitable incorporated organisation (CIO): a charity with limited liability Register of company directors All companies are required to appoint one or more directors (the minimum number is dependent upon the company type) and generally it is up to the members to appoint the people they believe will run the company well on their behalf. The only restrictions that prevent anyone becoming a director are they must be at least 16 and: *they must not have been disqualified from acting as a company director, under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (unless the court has given them permission to act for a particular company); *they must not be an undischarged bankrupt (unless they have been given permission by the court to act for a particular company).  Controversy  In February 2008, The Times and Computer Weekly broke a story that almost 4,000 of the names on the Companies House register of directors were on international watchlists of alleged fraudsters, money launderers, terror financiers and corrupt officials. The results came from Datanomic who had screened the 6.8 million names on the register against a World-Check database of high risk individuals and businesses. The exercise also revealed more than 1,500 disqualified company directors were being allowed to run other UK companies as Companies House was not checking names against its register of disqualified persons.

The closer boat is being overtaken by the boat on the far side. A head race is a time-trial competition in the sport of rowing. Head races are typically held in the fall, winter and spring seasons. These events draw many athletes as well as observers. In this form of racing, rowers race against the clock where the crew or rower completing the course in the shortest time in their age, ability and boat-class category is deemed the winner. Categories Common categories of age may be high school and college-aged rowers as well as adults. Those over the age of 27 are typically referred to as \\"masters\\". Common categories of ability may be: * junior- varsity boys and girls * varsity boys and girls * novice women's and men's * women's and men's among college-aged rowers * novice, club, intermediate, elite and championship among masters-aged rowers; also differentiated by women and men. Common categories of boat class may be: *1x: one rower with two oars, known as a single sculler *2x: two rowers with two oars each, known as a double scull *4x: four rowers with two oars each, known as a quad scull *Coxless pair: Two rowers with one oar each (see sweep rowing) *4+: Four rowers with one oar each and a coxswain *8+: Eight rowers with one oar each and a coxswain To minimize collisions, boats are started at 10 to 15 second intervals and are usually seeded so that the fastest start earlier. Races The length of most head races is usually between 4 km and 10 km. Among the most well-known are the Head of the River Race that takes place each March on the river Thames in London, United Kingdom, the Head of the Charles race held each October on the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts, United States., and the 8 km Head of the Yarra race held each November on the Yarra River in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Other notable head races include the Head of the Hooch, in Chattanooga, Tennessee,Compare Head of the Hooch's 1,938 entries. See ; with Head of the Fish's 2,028 entries. See the Head of the Trent in Peterborough, Ontario along the Trent-Severn Waterway; the Head of the Rideau in Ottawa, Ontario, in March; the Head of the Lake through the Montlake Cut in Seattle, Washington; the Fremont 4-Miler also in Seattle, Washington (last held in 2007); the 3 mile Head of the Ohio in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania held annually since 1986 along the Forks of the Ohio River; the 3 mile Head of the Schuylkill in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Head of the Fish in Saratoga Springs, New York. In the Netherlands the best known Head race is the Head of the River Amstel every year in March. Another, less well known Head race is the Eemhead, on the river Eem, which is rowed upstream the river and finishes at the boathouse of the organizing boat club, Hemus in Amersfoort. An indoor rower race inspired on the Head of the river Amstel is the Ergohead, organized every year in January by the Amsterdam boat club 'De Amstel'. Initially it was a race over 6 virtual kilometers, and from the second time it was a race during 20 minutes, and the winner is the competitor who 'rowed' the longest distance. One of the longest head races is the 100 km Ringvaart Regatta in the Netherlands.

Little is known of the history of Gwynedd from this period, and information about Cadfan and his reign is minimal. The historical person is known only from his appearance in royal genealogies, from his grant to Saint Beuno for the monastery at Clynnog Fawr, and from his inscribed gravestone in Llangadwaladr church. Cadfan was the son and successor of King Iago ap Beli, and is listed in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies and in Jesus College MS. 20. -- the pedigree is given as: ... map Rotri map mermin map etthil merch cinnan map rotri map Intguaul map Catgualart map Catgollaun map Catman map Iacob map Beli map Run ..., and from there back to Cunedda and his ancestors. -- the pedigree is given as ...

Cadfan came to the throne near the time of the Battle of Chester () in 616, in which the Northumbrians under √Üthelfrith decisively defeated the neighboring Welsh Kingdom of Powys and then massacred the monks of Bangor Is Coed. However, there is no evidence that Gwynedd had any part in the battle,, A History of Wales, Vol. I so Cadfan's accession at that time appears to be no more than coincidence. The Catamanus stone in Llangadwaladr church, 2018 King Cadfan's gravestone in Llangadwaladr church. The inscription reads \\"Catamanus rex sapientisimus opinatisimus omnium regum\\" ()., A History of Wales, Vol. I Cadfan's gravestone is at Llangadwaladr () on Anglesey, a short distance from the ancient llys () of the kings of Gwynedd, and reputed to be their royal burial ground. The inscription refers to him as sapientisimus (), and as this term is historically used for ecclesiastics, it suggests that at some point, Cadfan had resigned as king to live a consecrated life. -- in the footnote. Sapientisimus here applied to him means simply, in the Latin of the period, a 'highly learned man', and presumably therefore an ecclesiastic. Compare to the epithet of Gildas (Gildas Sapiens), implying clerical status, not natural wisdom. Cadfan was succeeded as king by his son, Cadwallon ap Cadfan.  Saint Beuno  Saint Beuno and the monastery at Clynnog Fawr are often cited in conjunction with Cadfan. An 1828 article by P. B. Williams in the Cymmrodorion cited a manuscript stating that a local prince named 'Gwytheint' gave Clynnog Fawr to God and Saint Beuno, who was then Abbot at the monastery at Clynnog, and that the donation was free from taxes and obligations forever. It goes on to say that Beuno founded a convent at Clynnog in 616, and that Cadfan was Beuno's great patron, promising him extensive lands. The promise was carried out by Cadfan's son, King Cadwallon, and that Cadwallon was given a golden sceptre worth 60 cows as a token of acknowledgment., Clynog Vawr A consistent version is given in W. J. Rees' 1853 Lives of the Cambro-British Saints, Life of Saint Beino (Rees was the editor of the 1828 Cymmrodorion that published P. B. Williams' account). There are minor variations of these accounts, sometimes with the details rearranged, such as in Rice Rees' 1836 Essay on the Welsh Saints, where he says that Cadfan (rather than his son Cadwallon) was given the golden sceptre by Beuno., Essay on the Welsh Saints  Fictionalization by and after Geoffrey of Monmouth  The largely fictional stories of ancient Britain written by Geoffrey of Monmouth use the names of many historical personages as characters, and the use of these names is a literary convenience made in order to advance the plot of Geoffrey's stories. One of these stories uses the names of Cadfan and other contemporary people, telling of how a certain Edwin spent his exiled youth at the court of King Cadfan, growing up alongside Cadfan's son, the future King Cadwallon. There is no historical basis for this story, as is readily acknowledged in the preface of works on the subject. Nevertheless, a \\"traditional\\" story arose blending Geoffrey's fiction with known history, implying that the future King Edwin of Northumbria had actually spent his youth at the court of King Cadfan, growing up alongside Cadfan's son, the future King Cadwallon. In point of fact, Cadwallon and Edwin were enemies with no known youthful connections: King Edwin invaded Gwynedd and drove King Cadwallon into exile, and it would be Cadwallon, in alliance with Penda of Mercia, who would ultimately defeat and kill Edwin in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase (). The story that they had spent an idyllic youth together may have had a romantic appeal. What is known from history is that in 588 King √Ülla of Deira died, and √Üthelfrith of Bernicia took the opportunity to invade and conquer Deira, driving √Ülla's 3-year old infant son, the future Edwin of Northumbria, into exile. Edwin would eventually ally himself with R√¶dwald of East Anglia in 616, defeating and killing √Üthelfrith and becoming one of Northumbria's most successful kings. Edwin's life in exile is unknown, and there is no historical basis for placing him at the court of King Cadfan.

The town on the N69, the road between Limerick and Tralee, is built on the banks of the River Deel some 3 km upstream from the estuary of the River Shannon. Among the historic structures in the town are a castle dating from 1199 and a Franciscan friary dating from 1389. The castle was abandoned to the English in 1580 ‚Äì its walls blown up by the fleeing defenders ‚Äì after the fall of Carrigafoyle Castle during the Desmond Rebellions. Askeaton was a constituency in the Irish House of Commons represented by two members until the dissolution of the parliament in 1801  Desmond Castle  The focal point of the town is the Desmond Castle, which stands in the center of the town on a rocky island on the river Deel. This noble building has protected Askeaton since 1199, when the castle and its rights were given to Hamo de Valoignes, the Justiciary of Ireland between 1197 and 1199. In the Annals of Inisfallen, William de Burgo is recorded as having been granted the castle and estates by the king of Thomand, D√≥nal M√≥r. in 1348 Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond paid 40 shillings for the barony of Lystifti. The building that stands today dates from that time. The Earls of Desmond were to become a powerful presence in Munster, of whom it was proudly said that they had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' ‚Äì they lived in the Gaelic manner, following the Brehon Laws, dressed in the Irish manner, spoke Irish, played Irish music and games, rode and hunted, and respected poets. The family had generations of enmity with the MacCarthys to the south in Cork and Kerry, as well as with their bitter Anglo-Norman rivals, the Butlers, Earls of Ormond. The earliest written reference to the castle is in Leabhar nanCeart, which in translation in English means The Book of Rights, compiled in the 15th century, in which the fort of Gephtine is mentioned as being reserved to the King of Cashel. The Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds, held possession of the castle for over 200 years; it was the centre of their power, and they ruled Munster from it. The tragic Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, had a powerful stronghold at Askeaton in 1559 and so England saw him as a threat. The English tried to impose a policy of surrender on the Irish lords who rebelled and fought a war of defence across Munster. Gerald, known as The Rebel Earl, was popular among his followers, but as the atrocities of the English incursion grew unbearable they gradually abandoned him. Fleeing with a few retainers, on 11 November 1583 he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at B√≥thar an Iarlaigh.Rowan, A. B. (1872). \\"The Last Geraldyn Chief of Tralee Castle\\". In Hickson, Mary Agnes. Selections from Old Kerry Records; Historical and Genealogical. London: Watson & Hazell. pp. 117‚Äì130. Originally published Kerry Magazine. May 1854. Sir Nicholas Malby unsuccessfully attacked the castle in 1579. Askeaton Castle was then occupied by Lieutenant Patrick Purcell of the confederate Catholics. The English saw Askeaton as a threat while it was under Catholic rule. It was destroyed by the Cromwellian captain Daniel Axtell in 1652; he hanged Patrick Purcell. (Executions seem to have been a theme in the life of Axtell; captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of King Charles I at Westminster Hall in 1649, shortly after the Restoration in 1660 he himself was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide.) The murderous Lord Justice Sir William Pelham then took possession. It was the end of the FitzGerald reign over Askeaton and Munster. The castle was transferred to the ownership of the English crown under Captain Edward Berkley.(Taken from a lecture by Anita Guinane, (Askeaton Civic Trust)  Franciscan Friary  Franciscan friary Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, the legendary poet earl who is said still to sleep in a cave waiting to ride back on his silver-shod steed in Ireland's time of ultimate need, founded Askeaton Abbey in about 1389. It has cloisters with 12 arches on each side, an east window, mediaeval carvings, and a chapter room that is the final resting place of the martyrs Bishop Patrick O'Healy and Fr Conn O'Rourke. On 9 October 1579, after failing to take Askeaton Castle, the English commander Sir Nicholas Malby attacked the town and burned the friary, killing most of the friars, some in a gruesome fashion, and wrecked the ancestral tombs of the Desmonds, in a mean-spirited attack to take revenge on the earl in his impenetrable fortress. Monks returned to the friary only in 1627 but the community did not reach its former numbers until 1642. The community again abandoned the site in 1648 when Cromwell's forces neared Askeaton, and did not return until the 1650s. The friary permanently closed in 1740.  St Mary's Church  The present Catholic church was built in 1851, after the previous building near the Franciscan friary was totally destroyed by fire in 1847. It is built of local limestone and has stained glass windows. The window to the right of the transept shows the resurrection of Christ, and that on the left his ascension into heaven. In the centre of the nave are windows showing St Patrick receiving the two daughters of King Laoire, the King of Ireland, into the church, and Jesus with children, and over the main door of the church a window shows the Virgin Mary. Over the door is a statue of the Pieta. The Church of Ireland also have a church in the town, St Mary's, with a clergyman resident in Rathkeale.  The Hellfire Club  East of the castle are the remains of the Hellfire Club, an almost intact redbrick building built in 1740 (the same year the monks abandoned the nearby friary). This bizarre secret society was founded in Dublin in 1735 by the Earl of Rosse, first Grand Master of the Irish Freemasons. It is one of two in Ireland (the other is outside Dublin). The Hellfire Clubs, throughout Ireland and Britain, were 18th-century clubs where rich men gathered to drink, gamble, have mock crucifixions and homosexual orgies. Lurid rumours around Hellfire Clubs included visits by the devil and human sacrifice. These clubs popularised the combination of whiskey, butter and cream mulled by a red-hot poker known as \\"scaltheen\\". The club closed down by 1800. The fa√ßade of the building collapsed in the 1990s.  Community hall  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the community organisation Muintir na T√≠re built a community hall for the parish. Built in a time of economic depression, it was constructed with voluntary labour of local people. It became a vital focal point in the social life of the town, used for dances and concerts and bingo. Replacing the library (which was too small) as a dance hall, it became in essence the ‚ÄúBallroom of Romance‚Äù It was used as a national school while the new building was being built in 1962/63, and also as a church when masses were held there during the refurbishments of St Mary's, the Catholic church, in 1977.  Transport  The railway line that passes through the now closed Askeaton railway station was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857. The line between Limerick and Foynes had stations at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton. The railway line to Foynes passes north of the town, but Askeaton Railway Station was closed to passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and freight on 2 December 1974, when the station closed. Trains for Foynes continued to pass through Askeaton until the line effectively lost all its freight services in 2000. The line is still officially open to freight traffic, but has not seen a train since the annual weedspray train visited the line in May 2002, but is expected to reopen. In an interview on Limerick's Live 95fm on 18 April 2011, Kay McGuinness, chair of Shannon Foynes Port Company, said that they were confident that the rail link could be reopened for ‚Ç¨7 million, considerably less than Iarnr√≥d √âireann's quoted price of ‚Ç¨30 million. A recent campaign by the residents of Station Road prevented Iarnr√≥d √âireann from removing the railway gates at the station.

It includes dialects ChiBocha, ChiUngwe, and ChiManyika, from which the broad Manyika language gets its name. ChiManyika is spoken by people in the northern parts of Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe, (Nyanga, Honde Valley Mutasa area) whilst ChiBocha is spoken by people in the southern part of Manicaland. Manyika differs from the more predominant Zezuru dialect in a variety of small ways. Characteristics Certain variations in vocabulary and word prefixes exist. For example, the prefix 'va-' (used in Shona before male names to signify seniority and respect) is replaced by 'sa-' in the Manyika language. Also the prefix 'va-' used as in people, for example standard Shona vanhu vakaenda vakawanda, is replaced by 'wa-' to become wanhu wakaenda wakawanda. As a result, the Manyika do not use the prefix 'va' in any form as they pronounce it as either 'sa' or 'wa'. This is how they are generally recognised as being Manyika. The verbs in this language are tonally divided into two groups. The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to one group are as shown below in the case of the infinitive, which has ku- as its prefix: *kup√° 'to give', kub√°t√° 'to catch', kup√≥m√©r√° 'to scold', kuk√∫r√∫dz√≠ra 'to encourage'; *kum√∫p√° 'to give him (something)', kum√∫b√°t√° 'to catch him', kum√∫p√≥m√©r√°, kum√∫k√∫r√∫dz√≠ra; *kuzv√≠pa 'to give (something to) oneself', kuzv√≠bat√° 'to catch oneself', kuzv√≠pomer√°, kuzv√≠kurudzir√°. These tonal patterns can be represented by kuCV‚ÄôCV‚ÄôCV‚ÄôX, ku√ìCV‚ÄôCV‚ÄôCV‚ÄôX, ku≈îXC√°, where X stands for a string of phonemes of any length, O for an object prefix, and R for a reflexive prefix, with an adjustment rule to the first two formulae that if X=√ò, the last CV‚Äô can be √ò, and if both are √ò, the second CV‚Äô can also be √ò, and with one to the last formula that if X=√ò, C√° becomes Ca. The tonal patterns of the verbs belonging to the other group are as shown below: *kubwa 'to leave', kumutsa 'to wake up', kutarisa 'to look at', kuswatanudza 'to make (somebody) stand up'; *kum√∫m√∫tsa, kum√∫t√°risa, kum√∫sw√°tanudza; *kuzv√≠muts√°, kuzv√≠taris√°, kuzv√≠swatanudz√°. The tonal representation would be: kuX, ku√ìCV‚ÄôX, ku≈îXC√°. This language has many indicative tenses (such as Remote Past, Recent Past, Past Progressive, Present, etc.) including negative ones.

Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing. History =Foundation= Virginia was founded in the early 17th century, at Aghanure (), during the Plantation of Ulster and was named Virginia after Queen Elizabeth I of England, the \\"Virgin Queen.\\" The settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted the Crown patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of Kells and Cavan.Hill, George (Rev.), \\"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\\" The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined √ì Raghallaigh (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient Lurgan parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce English settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated borough status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of the Pale, so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of Lough Ramor. Ridgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, Captain Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside Lough Oughter in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor. =The Plunketts= During November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of the 10th Baron Killeen (who was created the 1st Earl of Fingall in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic Anglo-Irish peer of Norman descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project. Complaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall (who had succeeded his father in the earldom in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican Bishop of Kilmore, William Bedell, undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Irish Confederate Wars enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed Lord Fingall for his role in the Siege of Drogheda (1641). What remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through hearth tax records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by Jonathan Swift during his several excursions to Co. Cavan. =The Taylours= The Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over. Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by Thomas Taylor (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd Bt., was created 1st Baron Headfort in 1760, and 1st Viscount Headfort in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the peerage to become The 1st Earl of Bective in 1766. It is recorded that Lord Bective's great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a cartographer who assisted Sir William Petty with the Down Survey during the previous century. The Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, Headfort House (now a school), beside Kells in the north of County Meath. The family (who were granted the title Marquis of Headfort in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia's population doubled between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive Marquesses of Headfort created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor. =Famine and emigration= The Great Hunger, caused by successive failures in the potato crop and the export of other food sources by the indifferent English colonialists, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like typhus and cholera, prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord. In subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line between Kells and Oldcastle in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town. Perhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was General Philip H. Sheridan (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby Killinkere, left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the American Civil War. President Lincoln stated, \\"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him. The closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons. =Modern development= In 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by Cavan County Council. Although widely supported by the community and the region's political representatives, the bid was abandoned with a government announcement that there was not a 'red penny' available for such a project. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening during 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This has led to a continued rise in local developments, with many new houses and commercial business being built. Geography Virginia by Lough Ramor The town is situated close to Lough Ramor, one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7 km in length by 1 km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems. Transport Virginia is on the N3 route approximately 85 km northwest of Dublin, and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between Enniskillen and Dublin. Virginia is connected to Dublin by an hourly bus service from Cavan town Bus √âireann. The M3 motorway was completed in 2010 and links the North-West of Dublin to the nearby town of Kells, 20 km from Virginia. This has cut journey times to Dublin considerably and has made the town more favourable for commuters. A 12.5 km long bypass for the town of type 2 dual carriageway, intended to reduce congestion going through the town centre was planned but suspended in the late 2000s. In February 2018, the project was placed as a key project in the National Development Plan, part of 'Project Ireland 2040'. Economy Sometimes regarded these days as a commuter town with its proximity to larger trading towns east and west, the local industry consists mainly of farming and milk processing at the local Glanbia factory (formerly Virginia Milk Products), which produces skim milk powder and cream for the world-renowned brand Baileys Irish Cream liqueur. Other local manufacturers include the Fleetwood brand of paint products. Virginia won the Tidy Towns Competition in 1964 and 1965. Culture The Ramor Theatre opened in 1999, and is funded by Monaghan County Council and the Arts Council. It is the only professional performance space in the county. The theatre is a member of the NOMAD network of venues, and home to the Livin' Dred Theatre Company. The theatre also engages in community based and amateur work through Ramor Players who present a number of shows each year. Virginia has been home to the annual Virginia Agricultural Show for over seventy years and has hosted Ireland's only pumpkin festival in 2007. The Virginia Pumpkin Festival takes place every October bank holiday weekend at Halloween time. It took a break in 2017. Demographics The town population was 2,648, as of the 2016 census. The ethnic makeup (of those stated) was 81% White Irish, 12% Other White, 2% Black/Black Irish, 2% Asian/Asian Irish and 2% Other. Education A large primary school in the town is St Mary's NS, located next to St Mary's Roman Catholic Church. The school's population is over 400 pupils. The primary school received an extension in 2014. Virginia College, Cavan, formerly Virginia Vocational School, is the only secondary school in Virginia. Situated beside Lough Ramor, it is a mixed school educating approximately 740 pupils. With three extensions built over the years (most recent in 2012), the school now has three ICT suites, and a language lab. The Virginia school celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2012, this was later followed by a visit to the school by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins. Common surnames The most common Virginia surnames to appear during the census of 1901/1911 were: Kellett, Fitzsimons, Sheridan, Smith, Reilly, Carroll, O'Reilly, Lynch, Brady, Reynolds, Duffy, Hopkins, Soden, McNamee, Preston, McEnroe, Skelly. Notable people *Jonathan Swift (1667‚Äì1745), penned his well-known novel Gulliver's Travels while staying nearby at Quilca, the home of his cleric friend Thomas Sheridan. *Thomas Sheridan (1687-1738), who kept a classics school and later became headmaster of Cavan's Royal School. *Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751‚Äì1816), playwright and grandson to Thomas Sheridan. *Thomas Fitzpatrick (1832-1900), a noted London physician. *Sir Josias Rowley (1765-1842), 1st Bt. and Royal Navy Admiral, who was a native of County Leitrim, had links here through his brother The Rev.

Clark et al. eds., Foundation Press 4th ed. 2007)(2001)Cybertelecom :: Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act Providing Legislative History, Caselaw, and References The law was designed to thwart \\"cybersquatters\\" who register Internet domain names containing trademarks with no intention of creating a legitimate web site, but instead plan to sell the domain name to the trademark owner or a third party.2-7A Gilson on Trademarks ¬ß7A.06, Trademark Cyberpiracy and Cybersquatting (Matthew Bender & Co. 2009) Critics of the ACPA complain about the non-global scope of the Act and its potential to restrict free speech,Serena C.

Or a Threat to Electronic Commerce?, http://www.fmew.com/archive/cybersquat/index.html while others dispute these complaints. Before the ACPA was enacted, trademark owners relied heavily on the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA) to sue domain name registrants.2-7A Gilson on Trademarks ¬ß7A.07, Domain Name Dilution (Matthew Bender & Co. 2009) The FTDA was enacted in 1995 in part with the intent to curb domain name abuses.Panavision Int'l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1326 (9th Cir. 1998) The legislative history of the FTDA specifically mentions that trademark dilution in domain names was a matter of Congressional concern motivating the Act.Panavision Int'l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1326 (9th Cir. 1998); TeleTech Customer Care Mgmt., Inc. v. Tele-Tech Co., 977 F. Supp. 1407, 1413 (C.D. Cal. 1997) Senator Leahy stated that \\"it is my hope that this anti- dilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others\\". For example, in Panavision Int‚Äôl L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), Dennis Toeppen registered the domain name Panavision.com. Panavision, the trademark owner, learned that Toeppen had registered its trademark when it attempted to register the trademark \\"Panavision\\" as a domain name.Panavision Int'l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1319 (9th Cir. 1998) Toeppen was using the domain panavision.com to display photographs of Pana, Illinois, and, when asked to cease, he offered to sell the domain name to Panavision for $13,000. After Panavision refused to buy the domain name from Toeppen, he registered its other trademark, Panaflex, as a domain name. The Court held that the FTDA could be violated without the traditional tarnishing or blurring the courts had required. Rulings like this extended the FTDA substantially. Overview Under the ACPA, a trademark owner may bring a cause of action against a domain name registrant who: * Has a bad faith intent to profit from the mark * Registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is ** Identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive mark ** Identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of a famous mark ** Is a trademark protected by 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 706 (marks involving the Red Cross) or 36 U.S.C. ¬ß 220506 (marks related to the \\"Olympics\\")15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1)(A) A trademark is famous if the owner can prove that the mark \\"is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner\\".15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(c)(2)(A) \\"Trafficking\\" in the context of domain names includes, but is not limited to \\"sales, purchases, loans, pledges, licenses, exchanges of currency, and any other transfer for consideration or receipt in exchange for consideration\\".15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1)(E) The ACPA also requires that the mark be distinctive or famous at the time of registration.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii) In determining whether the domain name registrant has a bad faith intent to profit, a court may consider many factors, including nine that are outlined in the statute: # Registrant's trademark or other intellectual property rights in the domain name; # Whether the domain name contains the registrant's legal or common name; # Registrant's prior use of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or services; # Registrant's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible by the domain name; # Registrant's intent to divert customers from the mark owner's online location that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark; # Registrant's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or a third party for financial gain, without having used the mark in a legitimate site; # Registrant's providing misleading false contact information when applying for registration of the domain name; # Registrant's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others; and # Extent to which the mark in the domain is distinctive or famous.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1)(B) The ACPA does not prevent the fair use of trademarks or any use protected by the First Amendment, which includes gripe sites.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii) In Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362 (D.N.J 2004), the court found that the first two prongs of Mayflower's ACPA claim were easily met because (1) their registered trademark was distinctive and (2) Defendant's \\"mayflowervanline.com\\" was confusingly similar to Plaintiff's Mayflower trademark.Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 367 (D.N.J 2004) However, when the court was examining the third prong of Plaintiff's ACPA claim, whether Defendant registered its domain name with the bad faith intent to profit from Plaintiff, the court found Defendant had a bona fide noncommercial use of the mark, therefore, the ACPA claim failed.Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 367, 369 (D.N.J 2004) \\"Defendant's motive for registering the disputed domain names was to express his customer dissatisfaction through the medium of the Internet.\\"Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 369 (D.N.J 2004) The domain name registrar or registry or other domain name authority is not liable for injunctive or monetary relief except in the case of bad faith or reckless disregard.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(2)(D)(ii) While ¬ß 1125 protects trademark owners, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1129 protects any living person from having their personal name included in a domain name, but only when the domain name is registered for profitable resale.15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1129(1)(A) (transferred to 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 8131) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals caused a stir in 2013 when it held, in Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) v. GoDaddy.com, 737 F.3d 546 (9th Cir. 2013), petition for cert. denied 135 S.Ct. 55 (2014), that there is no cause of action for contributory cybersquatting, i.e. secondary liability under the ACPA. It so held notwithstanding the extensive body of case law permitting such liability where a registrar is shown to have acted outside the normal ministerial bounds of domain registration. It also relied on Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver and premised on the Circuit Court's determination that the ACPA is not part of the Lanham Act and therefore not included in the rule permitting secondary liability for trademark infringement enunciated in Inwood Labs v. Ives Labs, 456 U.S. 844 (1982). In rem jurisdiction The ACPA also provides that the trademark owner can file an in rem action against the domain name in the judicial district where the domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name authority registered or assigned the domain name is located if:15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(2)(A) *(1) the domain name violates any right of the trademark owner and *(2) the court finds that the owner **(a) is not able to obtain in personam jurisdiction over the person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1); or **(b) through due diligence was not able to find a person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1125(d)(1) by sending a notice of the alleged violation and publishing notice of the action. This provision is rarely used, however, because many trademark owners can achieve the same results through a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) proceeding.Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. Retrieved from http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm. ACPA v. UDRP Instead of suing in federal court under the ACPA, a trademark owner can choose to pursue an administrative proceeding under ICANN's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). The UDRP allows a trademark owner to challenge domain name registrations in expedited administrative proceedings. A UDRP proceeding can be faster and cheaper for trademark owners than an ACPA lawsuit. Also, UDRP outcomes tend to be pro-plaintiff because many UDRP arbitrators are trademark lawyers. However, some trademark owners prefer to bring ACPA claims because they offer more remedies than the cancellation or transfer of the domain name (the only remedies available under UDRP proceedings) and a court ruling can lead to a final resolution of the matter. Also, a suit under the ACPA may deter future cybersquatters more effectively than a UDRP proceeding. Domaining and the ACPA While the ACPA contemplated the purchase of domain names for resale to trademark owners, it did not contemplate the more modern practice of domaining. Domaining is the business of registering a domain name and parking it or placing pay-per-click ads on it. Domainers rely on type-in traffic, which is when Internet surfers type in the domain name rather than using a search engine.Paul Sloan, Masters of their Domains, https://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364591/ Domainers can make a lot of money by buying and selling domain names. Some domainers relied on domain tasting, which involves placing pay-per-click ads on the domain for five days (or less) to determine whether the ads will make more than the annual cost of the domain.ICANN Issues: Domain name tasting, http://public.icann.org/issues/domain-name-tasting If the domain is dropped within the five-day grace period, no fee is incurred. An industry has grown up out of this business with domainers taking part in these mass registrations. This practice was largely eliminated by 2009, when ICANN began raising fees to registrars with excessive domain tasting. In Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008), the domainer lost under the ACPA.Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008) One of the defendants, Basic Fusion, Inc. argued that they were not cybersquatters, but as an Internet registrar accredited by ICANN they could register domain names on behalf of its customers and it specialized in \\"bulk registration\\".Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1092 (C.D. Cal. 2008) Navigation Catalyst Systems, another defendant and a customer of Basic Fusion, used their \\"proprietary automated tool\\" to find domain names that were not already registered and then registered them using Basic Fusion. Navigation used the five days following the registration (the \\"advertisement grace period\\") to put advertisements on the websites making money from the advertisements even when they dropped the domain name registration before the five-day window closed.Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1092-93 (C.D. Cal. 2008) Plaintiff Verizon argued that defendants \\"registered\\" 1,392 domain names that were confusingly similar to plaintiff's trademarks. The Court found that defendants used the confusingly similar domain names with a bad faith intent to profit.Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F.

Having joined the Communist Party in 1917, he served in the Red Army from 1920. During the Winter War of 1939-1940 against Finland, he had the task of penetrating the Mannerheim Line as commander of the 7th Army. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union shortly afterwards. The NKVD arrested Meretskov at the start of World War II. Released two months later, he returned to command the 7th Army and later the Volkhov Front during the 1941-1944 Siege of Leningrad. He commanded the Karelian Front from February 1944, notably the Petsamo‚ÄìKirkenes Offensive of October 1944. From April 1945 he was assigned to the Far East, where he commanded a front during the Soviet invasion of Japanese Manchuria. During the war he reached the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Meretskov K. A.; on warheroes.ru Early life and career Meretskov was born at Nazaryevo in Ryazan Governorate (now in Moscow Oblast), southeast of Moscow. His parents were peasants of Russian ethnicity and lived in a rural village. He was a factory worker from 1909, first in Moscow, later near Vladimir. He joined the Bolsheviks (later the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) in August 1917, and became chief of staff of Red Guard militia that helped to organise in the town. During the Russian Civil War, he was chief of staff of a regiment, and later a division. In 1921, he graduated from the Military Academy (later the M. V. Frunze Military Academy). From 1922, he held a number of commands as chief of staff, first in a cavalry division, later in various armies and military districts. From September 1936 to May 1937, Meretskov fought for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War under a pseudonym of \\"General Pavlovich\\". In 1939, he was appointed commander of the Leningrad Military District. Winter War In November 1939, at the start of the Winter War, Commander of the Leningrad Military District Kirill Meretskov initially ran the overall operation against the Finns.Edwards, p. 93 However, gross underestimations of the Finnish defenses, the size of their forces and the corresponding overestimations of the capacity of the Red Army, led to serious planning flaws. Only five rifle divisions were initially sent to assault the Mannerheim Line and piecemeal commitment of reinforcements did not achieve any effect.Isayev (2004) p. 19 Meretskov failed and the command was passed on 9 December 1939 to the General Staff Supreme Command, Stavka, directly under Kliment Voroshilov (chairman), Nikolai Kuznetsov, Joseph Stalin and Boris Shaposhnikov.Edwards, p. 125Manninen (2008), p. 14 Meretskov was appointed to command of the 7th Army. In January 1940, the Leningrad Military District was reformed and renamed \\"North-Western Front.\\" Semyon Timoshenko was chosen Army Commander to break the Mannerheim Line. This Soviet offensive was checked by the Finnish Army in the Battle of Taipale.Trotter, p. 204 For the next offensive, the Stavka significantly reinforced the 7th Army, deployed the 13th Army on its flank and assigned substantial heavy artillery to both armies, including B-4 howitzers and Br-5 mortars.Isayev (2004) p. 20 The next Soviet offensive began in February 1940. The heavy artillery support allowed the Soviet forces to breach the Mannerheim Line. Meretskov's 7th Army proceeded to take Viborg which so far had resisted attempts of Soviet conquest. Less than two weeks after the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty, on March 21, 1940, Meretskov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941, he was Chief of the General Staff. He was dismissed on 14 January 1941, and on 24 January, Stalin spotted him at the Bolshoi and, in front of witnesses: \\"You are courageous, capable, but without principles, spineless. You want to be nice, but you should have a plan instead and adhere to it strictly, despite the fact that someone or other is going to be resentful.\\" Operation Barbarossa On June 22, 1941, when Operation Barbarossa started, Meretskov was appointed permanent adviser to Stavka. However, on July 23 he was arrested by the NKVD as a member of an alleged anti-Soviet military conspiracy. The exact reasons are unknown, and the case file was destroyed in 1955. Meretskov's close friendship with General Dmitry Pavlov, the Soviet Commander of the Western Front who had been executed, is often considered a factor, although Pavlov, at the time, was yet to even be relieved of duty, much less arrested. Mark Solonin, in his book June the 25th: Stupidity or Aggression, proposes a theory that the actual reason might have been Meretskov's skepticism about the need to start bombardments of Finland, and his later release was due to him turning out to have been right, although he admits that direct evidence is unlikely to be found.Mark Solonin. 25 June. Stupidity or aggression? Part 3 After being subjected to two months of torture, including being beaten with rubber rods, in Lubyanka Prison, Meretskov relented and signed a written confession. According to Nikita Khrushchev, \\"before his arrest, Meretskov had been a strapping young general, very strong and impressive-looking. After his release, he was a shadow of his former self. He had lost so much weight he could hardly speak.\\" Released in September, he was taken before the police chief, Vsevolod Merkulov, whom he had known socially: he told Merkulov that their friendship was over. He was then presented to Stalin, in full army dress, and given command of the 7th Separate Army. His confession was used against other commanders arrested in May‚ÄìJuly 1941, who were executed on the order of Lavrenty Beria near Kuybyshev on October 28, 1941, or sentenced by the Special Council of the NKVD and executed on February 23, 1942. =Victory at Tikhvin= Meretskov was appointed Commander of the 4th Army which fought in the defense of Leningrad against the Army Group North of von Leeb. After stopping the German Tikhvin offensive, his forces, together with the neighboring 52nd and 54th Armies, counterattacked and pushed the German forces back to their starting positions, recapturing Tikhvin on December 10, 1941. This victory was the first Soviet large scale success during the war. The battle also assisted the Battle of Moscow, as significant German forces were tied down in heavy attrition fighting in the marshes and forests between Tikhvin and Tosno and were not able to assist during the Soviet counteroffensive. Notably, the battle locked down two German panzer divisions and two motorized divisions and inflicted serious casualties to the army group overall.Glantz p. 115 During the counteroffensive of the battle, Stavka ordered Kirill Meretskov to organize a new Volkhov Front, which he commanded until February 1944 (with the exception of May and June 1942). =Defeat at Lyuban= In January 1942, Meretskov started a new offensive near Lyuban, aimed at lifting the siege of Leningrad and encircling a large number of German forces. The advance was very slow, however, as the German forces were well dug in, reinforced and no longer overextended. By March the two Soviet armies trying to close the encirclement were less than apart, but could advance no more.Isayev (2004), p.203 On March 15, German forces began a counteroffensive and cut off the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. Soviet forces managed to restore communications by March 30 after heavy fighting. However, when Meretskov reported this to the Stavka, he omitted that the corridor that was linking the 2nd Shock Army to the rest of the Soviet forces was no more than wide, under constant German air strikes and artillery bombardment, and therefore, had a very poor transport capacity. As a result, the Stavka did not extract the 2nd Shock Army, when it was still possible.Glantz p. 176 During late April and all of May, the Volkhov front was temporarily subordinated to lieutenant general Khosin's Leningrad Front, and Meretskov was sent as deputy high commander to the Western Front.Glantz p. 183 By May 1942, the 2nd Shock Army was experiencing supply shortages and low morale. On May 30, the German forces began a second offensive and again cut it off. After part of the encircled force broke out on June 5, the rest of the army was systematically destroyed, with 33,000 men becoming prisoners, about the same number killed, and about 10,000 men who broke out.Isayev (2004), p.366 Immediately after the battle, Meretskov placed the blame on the captured 2nd Shock Army commander, Andrey Vlasov, whom he himself recommended to the post in April, a claim that was echoed in his post-war memoirs. Since Vlasov went on to collaborate with the German forces, there were few attempts to revisit this claim during the Soviet era. However, David Glantz points out that, irrespective of Vlasov's decision to collaborate with German forces, his level of command in May and June 1942 was not different from most other army commanders.Glantz p. 206 Furthermore, Meretskov does bear some responsibility for the defeat as the commander of the front who planned the operation and carried it out. Khosin, the commander of the Leningrad Front, was removed from command on June 8, reduced in rank and never commanded a front again, humiliatingly assigned from March 1944 to the rear line Volga Military District.Isayev (2004), p.361 Meretskov, who was arrested less than a year earlier, knew that his life may be at risk if he accepted responsibility for the disaster.Glantz p. 207 =Breaking the siege of Leningrad= After the defeat at Lyuban, Meretskov remained in command of the Volkhov Front. Together with the new Leningrad Front's commander, Leonid Govorov, Meretskov planned a new offensive to break the siege of the city. Volkhov and Leningrad fronts would break the blockade of the city by eliminating the German positions south of Lake Ladoga, where only separated the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This position was called \\"the bottleneck\\". At the same time, German forces were planning Operation Northern Light () to capture the city and link up with Finnish forces. To achieve that, heavy reinforcements arrived from Sevastopol, which the German forces had captured in July 1942.Glantz (2002), pp. 213‚Äì214 Both sides were unaware of the other's preparations. As a result, the Soviet Sinyavino Offensive failed and the 2nd Shock army was decimated for the second time in a year, but the German forces suffered heavy casualties and canceled Operation Northern Light.Glantz, p. 230 Meretskov wanted to conduct further local attacks, but this request was categorically denied by the Stavka, in addition to a formal critique he received on October 15, 1942, for his conduct of the operation.Glantz, p. 228 Operation Iskra, January 1943 In late November 1942, Govorov commenced planning the next operation to break the blockade of Leningrad. Meretskov soon joined the planning. In December, the plan was approved by the Stavka and received the codename Operation Iskra (Spark).Glantz p. 265 Operation Iskra began on January 13, 1943, and on January 18, Soviet forces linked up, breaking the blockade. By January 22, the front line stabilized. The operation successfully opened a land corridor 8‚Äì10 km wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor that allowed far more supplies to reach the city than the \\"Road of Life\\", eliminating the possibility of the capture of the city and a German-Finnish link up.Glantz p. 284‚Äì285 On January 28, both Meretskov and Govorov were awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class. Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts tried to follow up their success with a much more ambitious offensive operation named Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, but achieved very modest gains.Glantz p.284 Several other offensives were conducted by Meretskov in the area in 1943, slowly expanding the corridor, and making other small gains.Glantz p. 323 In November 1943, Meretskov and Govorov began planning the Leningrad- Novgorod Offensive which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region.Glantz p. 333 On January 14, 1944, the Soviet offensive started. By March 1, the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts had driven Army Group North back up to on a front, liberating the southern Leningrad region and part of the Kalinin region.Glantz p. 410 Meretskov and Govorov were once again awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class together. =Karelian Front and Manchuria= In February 1944, Meretskov was transferred to the Karelian Front. Here, he participated in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive that started in June 1944. His front liberated the city of Petrozavodsk and East Karelia.Glantz p. 457 In October, Meretskov was ordered to clear the city of Petsamo, in northern Finland, of Germans and to drive the German army back into Norway. Meretskov was able to use his knowledge of Arctic warfare to launch a co-ordinated offensive called the Petsamo‚ÄìKirkenes Offensive that drove the Germans back from their positions. After this offensive Meretskov was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, on October 26, 1944. Meretskov's next major command was in Manchuria in 1945, in the Far East, where he was selected to lead the 1st Far East Front during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, under the overall command of Aleksandr Vasilevsky. Soviet forces achieved a decisive victory in the operation. Meretskov was awarded the Order of Victory. As commander of Soviet forces in Korea, he launched the career of Kim Il-Sung. Commander and Assistant Minister of Defense After the war Meretskov commanded a number of military districts until 1955 (including the Moscow Military District in 1947‚Äì49),Feskov et al. 2004, The Soviet Army during the Period of the Cold War when he was made the Assistant Minister of Defense, a post he held until 1964. In that year, he was made the Inspector-General Ministry of Defense, a largely ceremonial post. Meretskov died on December 30, 1968. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. A street in Moscow, St Petersburg and Petrozavodsk is named after him.

In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase \\"sixth form college\\" as the English name for a lyc√©e.\\"Children & families.\\" (Archive) City of Paris. Retrieved 20 July 2010. In England and the Caribbean, education is currently compulsory until the end of year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18. Previously in England, education was compulsory only until year 11 before August 2013 and until year 12 between August 2013 and 2015.Education and Skills Act 2008, Office of Public Sector Information. In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached sixth form, transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational further education college, although in some places there may in practice be little choice which of these options can be taken. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools (public schools), and there is also a number of smaller- scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11. Students at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13 ‚Äì Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland ‚Äì or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit AS examinations at the end of the first year, and A-level examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. In addition, in recent years a variety of vocational courses have been added to the curriculum. There are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most of these perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth form schools which function like sixth form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities. Unlike further education colleges, sixth form colleges rarely accept part-time students or run evening classes, although one boarding sixth form college exists.  Brunei  There are a few schools in Brunei providing sixth form education. Five of them are dedicated sixth form colleges, with four located in Brunei-Muara District and one in Tutong District. Belait has yet to have its own sixth form centre and sixth form education is presently housed in Sayyidina Ali Secondary School, sharing facilities with the secondary education. There is no sixth form education in Temburong ‚Äì prospective students go to sixth form colleges in Brunei-Muara where they may stay in dormitories. Almost all sixth form schools are government schools. Five of them provide education leading up to Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level qualification. Jerudong International School is a non-government school which has sixth form education and its A Level is independent of those offered by its counterpart. Along with International School Brunei which offers the program International Baccalaureate Diploma instead of A Levels after the completion of International General Certificate of Secondary Education in their lower secondary year. Another school, Hassanal Bolkiah Boys' Arabic Secondary School, is a government sixth form centre for students in the specialised Arabic stream. Instead of A Level subjects, students generally learn subjects pertaining to Islamic knowledge in Arabic medium. The schooling culminates in the sitting of Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Ugama Brunei (STPUB), translatable as the Higher Certificate of Brunei Religious Education. They may then proceed to Islamic universities, locally or abroad such as Al-Azhar University. Caribbean In the English-speaking Caribbean, there are many sixth form colleges, usually attached to secondary schools. Students must usually attain a grade A-C in 1‚Äì3 in the Caribbean Examinations Council (C.X.C) CSEC examinations before proceeding onto the sixth form to sit the CAPE examinations. Students that fail these exams are not accepted into the sixth form program and can do either: courses in other further education facilities, or begin work with high school degrees. United Kingdom =Scotland= Scotland does not, in general, have separate sixth form colleges (or, indeed, the same concept of the terminal two years of secondary education as being distinct from the other time spent there); as such, Scottish students who opt to remain in full-time education will typically remain in the same school for fifth and sixth year (the equivalent to the English lower- and upper-sixth forms), studying Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. Higher Grade qualifications can be taken in both the fifth and sixth years. =England= The first comprehensive intake sixth form college in England was established in Mexborough, South YorkshireDoncaster Free Press https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/heritage-and- retro/heritage/were-you-class-1969-mexborough-grammar-school-pupils-are-set- reunite-50-years-566154, and took its first intake of students in September 1964. Since then sixth form colleges have spread across the UK and have proved popular with students, their parents, and other groups in the community. Until 1992, these colleges were controlled and funded by local education authorities (LEAs), but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 transferred all institutions within the sector to the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), a national agency with strategic responsibility for the operation of general further education (FE) colleges. Later the FEFC's functions were taken over by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), a reorganisation that included changes in the funding and supervision of sixth form colleges. These colleges take responsibility for their own employment, pensions and pay arrangements with the support and advice of the Sixth Form Colleges' Association (SFCA, formerly SFCF).Prior Pursglove College https://pursglove.ac.uk/about-us/sixth-form-colleges-association/ The SFCA is made up of representative principals from SFCs across the UK. The SFCA sets up several committees to deliver its range of support services for SFCs as well as facilitating lobbying work with the central government. Colleges for the most part do not charge full-time daytime students; however, adult students (most of whom attend evening classes) may have to pay a fee (for examinations, tutors' time and other costs). There are also some sixth form colleges in the independent sector, specialising in A levels for which fees are paid; these are unconnected with the SFCA. =Wales= In Wales, sixth form education falls under the remit of the Welsh Assembly, and sixth form colleges are sources of further education alongside FE colleges and sixth forms integrated into secondary schools. They typically offer the Welsh Baccalaureate and Key Skills qualifications.

History It was founded in 1616 by Guerte Jansdochter de Wael, daughter of a rich textile trader, for poor women of the Dutch Reformed faith. She died in 1632. Originally 6 small houses, it was expanded to 8 houses in 1661 when the gateway was built with the family coat of arms. This coat-of-arms is fairly unusual, featuring the Dutch Lion with its head cut off, spouting blood. It has been supposed that this shows anti-orangist political sympathies. Until 1853 governance by female regents was handed down from mother to daughter. From that time on it was governed by the city council and slowly declined. In 1985 the complex was remodelled into 4 modern homes. Since then it is technically no longer a hofje and is managed by a Haarlem house-rental agency.

Mills, 2003, A Dictionary of British Place- Names, Oxford University Press) is a small town in County Longford, Ireland. The town is in the east of the county, near the border with County Westmeath. Nearby towns are Longford 12 km to the west, Mullingar 26 km to the east, Athlone 40 km to the south and Cavan 42 km to the north. Name Edgeworthstown House The area was named Edgeworthstown in the 19th century after the Anglo-Irish Edgeworth family. An estate was built there by Richard Lovell Edgeworth. His family‚Äîwhich includes Honora Sneyd (his second wife), writer and intellectual Maria Edgeworth, botanist Michael Pakenham Edgeworth, economist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, and priest Henry Essex Edgeworth‚Äîlived at the estate. The area's original name was the Irish Meathas Troim or Meathas Truim. This was anglicized as Mastrim or Mostrim and variants. These names continued to be used by the locals. In 1935, at the behest of the local Town Tenants' Association, Longford County Council officially changed the town's name to Mostrim. However, in 1974, a local government order reverted the name to Edgeworthstown. Today, both names are in use. Infrastructure The town is built where the N4 Dublin-Sligo/ N5 Dublin-Castlebar road crosses the N55 Cavan-Athlone road. The town also has a railway station on the Dublin-Sligo railway line. Edgeworthstown railway station opened on 8 November 1855. Edgeworthstown expanded significantly during the first decade of the 21st century with many new housing developments and updated transport infrastructure including a bypass. The N4 National primary route formerly ran along the Main Street until the town centre was by-passed in August 2006. The N55 route from Athlone to Cavan still passes through the town centre. Industry Industries include animal feed processing and pet food manufacturing, with Paul & Vincent Limited and C & D Foods Limited employing several hundred people in the area. The latter, C & D Foods Limited, reopened a pet food plant in 2014 following an earlier fire. Sport The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is named Mostrim, while the minor section of the club are called Wolfe Tones GAA. The club has won three Longford Senior Football Championships, in 1974, 1985 and 1992. In Gaelic football, Mostrim won an u-21 championship 2002 and the Wolfe Tones minor team won Minor A Championships in 2002 and in 2006. In hurling, Wolfe Tones has won a record 19 Longford Senior Hurling Championship titles. Hugh Devine Park is the homepitch for both Mostrim and Wolfe Tones.

History It was founded in 1610 by Jan Bruininck Gerritz (it i s assumed), and is one of four hofjes owned by the Mennonite church of Haarlem. The others are the Wijnbergshofje in the Barrevoetestraat, the Zuiderhofje on the Zuiderstraat, and the Blokshofje on the Klein Heiligland (sold in 1970). The founder was from Sneek, and he probably founded the hofje with his daughters in mind, since he had several of them and family members were given first rights to a place in the hofje. The earliest documents surviving date from after this original donor died. A document survives from 1647 in which a sum of 150 Carolus guldens is recorded for adding a new house and garden, received from Lysbeth van Blenckvliet.Dirks, J.C. (1940).

In 1800 this had grown to free rent for all six women, and during the year the following goods for the hofje: 20 5-cent pieces each week, 20 tons turf, two 20-pound barrels of butter, two sacks of potatoes, and a half-sack of salt. The hofje originally had rooms for six women with a common privy in the garden. It wasn't renovated for running water or gas heat until 1936, when a redesign was executed, resulting in five homes. It was again renovated in 1978, and the number of houses was reduced again from five to four. The hofje was once one of the wealthiest of Haarlem, and is still quite well off today. The rent is free for the four women living there; they only need to pay service costs. Address: Botermarkt 9  References   Further reading  * Craandijk, J. (1904).

The Brouwershofje is a hofje on the Tuchthuisstraat in Haarlem, Netherlands. History The Hofje was founded by the Haarlem Guild of Beer brewers, one of the most powerful guilds in Haarlem. It was initially named the St. Maartenshofje after the patron saint of the brewers.Kurtz, pp.37-44 It was intended as a charitable home for 22 poor people (\\"rechte arme huyszitten\\") who worked in the brewing industry. The Brewer's guild used the money for the hofje from a donation it received in 1472 by Jacob Huyge Roepersz and his sister Katharina, who donated a series of small houses (kameren) in the Gasthuisstraat (the Tuchthuisstraat used to be a northern extension of the Gasthuisstraat) for housing, and some land in Akersloot for rents. The donation made the requirement that the houses needed to be rebuilt if they were damaged by fire or any other reason. The Roeper family was a brewers family, so the hofje was run by the 4 Brewer's guild vinders or aldermen, and the deacon, who became the 5 hofje regents. Though the foundation did not stipulate \\"women only\\", the hofje was used for brewer's maids too old or sick to work. In 1553 it was again enriched with a donation by Mr. Dierick Diericsen Bram, who stipulated in his will that the money from his annuity would go to the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis if money was paid out from his annuity for any other reason than for repairs and renovations on the hofje houses. The finances of this hofje were never very great, and in 1562 when the malt-makers (moutmakers) guild was merged with the brewers guild, the malt- makers were required to make a yearly donation to the St. Maartenshofje. The hofje burnt down in the great fire of 1576, but there was only enough money from the rents to rebuild it years later in 1586, with a reduction in the number of houses to 8. The names of the brewers who attended to the rebuilding were listed in Samuel Ampzing's History of Haarlem and these were Jan Aelbertsz Ban, Matthijs Florisz, Matthijs Aelbertsz Ban, Barent Wiggertsz Kousebant, Klaes Aelbertsz Vooght, Frans Adriaensz, Kies & Gerbrant Kornelisz Burst. The original rules of the hofje had burned also, so a new set of rules was made up in 1597.ordonnantien van de acht camers op Sincte Maertens hoffgen en geschreven op perkament Their dead were buried in two graves located the chapel of the H. Geesthuis (where now the Hofje van Oorschot is) until the 18th century, when they bought three graves in the St. Bavochurch. =\\"Rechts houden\\"= The renovation in 1586 included building a blind wall on the street side with a doorway leading to the garden and the houses. The iron anchors on the brick wall are numbered 1586 on the north side of the door. This blind wall was to protect the hofje inhabitants from the strangers on the other side of the street; the inhabitants of the Tuchthuis. This was the Haarlem house of corrections. At the North end of the street a house still has a plaque which says Rechts houden, or keep to the right, which also means stay straight in the sense of conducting oneself with the proper behavior. Coming from the North, the hofje is on the right and the Tuchthuis was on the left. The old Tuchthuis is now a modern apartment building. The old gate to the Tuchthuis, which also had a blind wall on the street side, is now part of the Frans Hals Museum. In 1930 the hofje was renovated again in order to install modern plumbing and electricity, and at that time eight windows were cut in the blind wall to allow more light. Hofje today When the Brewers guild was disbanded (along with the other Haarlem guilds) at the start of the French occupation in 1795, the hofje was run by a city-appointed committee, and since 1811 after the departure of the French, the hofje has been run by the Haarlem city council. Monumentenzorg takes care of the houses, and the Plantsoenendienst takes care of the garden.

Hofje garden on the South side of the T-shaped complex. In the back, the taller tower-like building can be seen. The Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen is a hofje in Haarlem, Netherlands. It was founded in 1650 by the testament of Willem van Heythuysen (sometimes spelled Heijthuijsen) on the site of his summer residence outside the city walls of Haarlem on land that was considered Heemstede property until it was annexed in 1927. It is one of the few hofjes of Haarlem to be built outside the city walls. It has a 'T' shape and has a small open courtyard and a garden still intact. Biography Willem Heythuijsen was a cloth merchant born in Weert, a small city in Dutch Limburg. Frans Hals painted him several times, and one of these portraits hung in this hofje for centuries. In 1636 Willem van Heythuijsen had his will and testament drawn up with the plans for this hofje in the event that he and his sister would die without issue. All of the information we have today about Willem van Heythuijsen is from this will and the acts drawn up by his executors Tieleman Roosterman and Marten van Sittart. Roosterman was the first regent of the hofje and also had his portrait painted by Frans Hals. After his sister Geertruyd van Heyhuysen died, his double house on the Oude gracht were sold, as was his summer home on the Spaarne. The summer home \\"Middelhout\\" was sold to Hendrik van Vladeracken, brother-in-law to Rosterman. Their daughter Susanna became a regent of the hofje and lived to be 90. Thanks to her legacy, the hofje underwent repairs and a painting was made to honor her that is now in the possession of the Frans Hals Museum. Today Middelhout is called Spaar en Hout and is an old age home.

To provide income for the hofje, more land was purchased just north of this hofje outside the city walls in an area called Rozenprieel, which generated income from rents. Unlike many other hofjes, this hofje accommodated both male and female inhabitants, until it switched to only female inhabitants in the 18th century. The hofje was built on the border with Heemstede, and the regent's room was south of the rest of the complex on Heemstede land. For centuries a stone border marker was situated in front of the entrance. In 1927 Haarlem annexed a large portion of Heemstede and the marker was removed. It is now in the garden of the Frans Hals Museum.

In common religious Catholic imagery, the Virgin Mary is portrayed in a sorrowful and lacrimating affect, with one or seven long knives or daggers piercing her heart, often bleeding. Devotional prayers that consist of meditation began to elaborate on her Seven Sorrows based on the prophecy of Simeon.

Devotions to the Seven Sorrows  =Western Christianity= left Earlier, in 1232, seven youths in Tuscany founded the Servite Order (also known as the \\"Servite Friars\\", or the \\"Order of the Servants of Mary\\"). Five years later, they took up the sorrows of Mary, standing under the Cross, as the principal devotion of their order. Over the centuries several devotions, and even orders, arose around meditation on Mary's Sorrows in particular. The Servites developed the three most common devotions to Our Lady's Sorrows, namely the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows, the Black Scapular of the Seven Dolours of Mary and the Novena to Our Sorrowful Mother. The Black Scapular is a symbol of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows, which is associated with the Servite Order.Order of Friar Servants of Mary: The Confraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows - retrieved on 22-Mar-2009 Most devotional scapulars have requirements regarding ornamentation or design.

She stands with her hands upraised in prayer, and seven swords pierce her heart, indicative of the seven sorrows. This is one of the few Orthodox icons of the Theotokos which do not depict the infant Jesus.

Some writings would place its roots in the eleventh century, especially among the Benedictine monks.Saunders, William. \\"The Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows\\", Arlington Catholic Herald, 2000 The first altar to the Mater Dolorosa was set up in 1221 at the Cistercian monastery of Sch√∂nau. Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa Diptych, c. 1491‚Äì1520. Aelbrecht Bouts The formal feast of the Our Lady of Sorrows was originated by a provincial synod of Cologne in 1423. It was designated for the Friday after the third Sunday after Easter and had the title: Commemoratio angustiae et doloris B. Mariae V. Its object was the sorrow of Mary during the Crucifixion and Death of Christ. Before the sixteenth century this feast was limited to the dioceses of North Germany, Scandinavia, and Scotland. According to Fr. William Saunders, \\"... in 1482, the feast was officially placed in the Roman Missal under the title of Our Lady of Compassion, highlighting the great love our Blessed Mother displayed in suffering with her Son. The word compassion derives from the Latin roots cum and patior which means \\"to suffer with\\". An annual Our Lady of Sorrows procession in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn is a tradition begun in the 1940s by immigrants from Mola di Bari, celebrating their hometown patroness After 1600 it became popular in France and was set for the Friday before Palm Sunday. By a Decree of 22 April 1727, Pope Benedict XIII extended it to the entire Latin Church, under the title \\"Septem dolorum B.M.V.\\". In 1954, it still held the rank of major double (slightly lower than the rank of the September feast) in the General Roman Calendar. Pope John XXIII's 1960 Code of Rubrics reduced it to the level of a commemoration. =The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary= In 1668, a separate feast of the Seven Sorrows of Mary, celebrated on the third Sunday in September, was granted to the Servites. Pope Pius VII introduced it into the General Roman Calendar in 1814. In 1913, Pope Pius X, in view of his reform giving precedence to Sundays over ordinary feasts, moved this feast to September 15, the day after the Feast of the Cross.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\", Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969, p. 103 It is still observed on that date. Since there were thus two feasts with the same title, on each of which the Stabat Mater sequence was recited, the Passion Week celebration was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969 as a duplicate of the September feast.Calendarium Romanum (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119 Each of the two celebrations had been called a feast of \\"The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" (Latin: Septem Dolorum Beatae Mariae Virginis). Recitation of the Stabat Mater was made optional. Procession in honor of Our Lady of Sorrows as part of Holy Week observances in Cocula, Guerrero, Mexico The existence of traditional manifestations of public devotion, such as processions with statues of Our Lady of Sorrows on days leading to Good Friday, has led to the maintenance on the previous Friday of the liturgical celebration of the Sorrows of Mary in some local calendars, as in Malta. For everywhere the latest edition of the Roman Missal provides on that Friday the optional collect: > O God, who in this season give your Church the grace to imitate devoutly the > Blessed Virgin Mary in contemplating the Passion of Christ, grant, we pray, > through her intercession, that we may cling more firmly each day to your > Only Begotten Son and come at last to the fullness of his grace. Dieric Bouts, Netherlandish, Mater Dolorosa, 1470‚Äì75 Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio Summorum Pontificum authorizes, under certain conditions, continued use of the 1962 Roman Missal, which contains the feast of the Friday of the fifth week of Lent.

It is used in the second stage of labor if it has not progressed adequately. It may be an alternative to a forceps delivery and caesarean section. It cannot be used when the baby is in the breech position or for premature births. The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother or the child.eMedicine - Vacuum Extraction : Article by Christian S Pope, DO Retrieved December 16, 2006 The term comes from the French word for \\"suction cup\\". Medical uses There are several indications to use a vacuum extraction to aid delivery: *Maternal exhaustion *Prolonged second stage of labor *Foetal distress in the second stage of labor, generally indicated by changes in the foetal heart-rate (usually measured on a CTG) *Maternal illness where prolonged \\"bearing down\\" or pushing efforts would be risky (e.g. cardiac conditions, blood pressure, aneurysm, glaucoma). If these conditions are known about before the birth, or are severe, then an elective caesarean section may be performed. Technique Vacuum-assisted delivery The woman is placed in the lithotomy position and assists throughout the process by pushing. A suction cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the flexion point, about 3 cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) fontanelle, is critical to the success of a vacuum extraction. Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction. When the baby's head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the birthing attendant and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby. For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. Preferably the operator of the vacuum extractor needs to be experienced in order to safely perform the procedure. The baby should not be preterm, previously exposed to scalp sampling or failed forceps delivery. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or caesarean section. History In 1849 the Edinburgh professor of obstetrics James Young Simpson, subsequently known for pioneering the use of chloroform in childbirth, designed the Air Tractor which consisted of a metal syringe attached to a soft rubber cup. This was the earliest known vacuum extractor to assist childbirth but it did not become popular. Swedish professor Tage Malmstrom developed the ventouse, or Malmstrom extractor in the 1950s. Originally made with a metal cap, new materials such as plastics and siliconised rubber have improved the design so that it is now used more than forceps. Comparisons to other forms of assisted delivery =Positive aspects= * An episiotomy may not be required. * The mother still takes an active role in the birth. * No special anesthesia is required. * There is less potential for maternal trauma compared to forceps and caesarean section. =Negative aspects= * The baby will be left with a temporary lump on its head, known as a chignon. * There is a possibility of cephalohematoma formation, or subgaleal hemorrhage which can be life-threatening. * There is a higher risk of failure to deliver the baby than forceps, and an increased likelihood of needing a Caesarean section.

It attained independence as the Republic of the Sudan, which since 2011 has been split into Sudan and South Sudan. Until 1914, Egypt itself was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire. During the 19th century it gradually expanded its control of the Sudan as far south as the Great Lakes region. In 1881 the Mahdist revolt broke out in Sudan and in 1882 the British invaded Egypt. Egypt became a de facto protectorate of Britain and together British and Egyptian forces gradually re-conquered the Sudan. In 1899, they formally agreed to establish a joint protectorate: Egypt on the basis of its previous claims and Britain by right of conquest. Between 1914 and 1922, the Sultanate of Egypt, and thus the Sudan, were formally a part of the British Empire. After Egyptian independence in 1922 as the Kingdom of Egypt, Britain gradually assumed more control of the condominium, edging out Egypt almost completely by 1924. Increasing Egyptian dissatisfaction with this arrangement came to a head after the overthrow of the Egyptian monarch in 1952. On 1 January 1956, Egypt and Britain ceded Sudan its independence.

The region had longstanding linguistic, cultural, religious, and economic ties to Egypt and had been partially under the same government at intermittent periods since the times of the pharaohs. Muhammad Ali was aggressively pursuing a policy of expanding his power with a view to possibly supplanting the Ottoman Empire (to which he technically owed fealty) and saw Sudan as a valuable addition to his Egyptian dominions. During his reign and that of his successors, Egypt and Sudan came to be administered as one political entity, with all ruling members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty seeking to preserve and extend the \\"unity of the Nile Valley\\". This policy was expanded and intensified most notably by Muhammad Ali's grandson, Ismail Pasha, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered. =British involvement= Map of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt and Sudan's economic and strategic importance increased enormously, attracting the imperial attentions of the Great Powers, particularly the United Kingdom. Ten years later in 1879, the immense foreign debt of Ismail Pasha's government served as the pretext for the Great Powers to force his abdication and replacement by his son Tewfik Pasha. The manner of Tewfik's ascension at the hands of foreign powers greatly angered Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists who resented the ever-increasing influence of European governments and merchants in the affairs of the country. The situation was compounded by Tewfik's perceived corruption and mismanagement and ultimately culminated in the 'Urabi Revolt. With the survival of his throne in dire jeopardy, Tewfik appealed for British assistance. In 1882, at Tewfik's invitation, the British bombarded Alexandria, Egypt's and Sudan's primary seaport, and subsequently invaded the country. British forces overthrew the Urabi government in Cairo and proceeded to occupy the rest of Egypt and Sudan in 1882. Though officially the authority of Tewfik had been restored, in reality the British largely took control of Egyptian and Sudanese affairs until 1932. =Mahdist revolt= Tewfik's acquiescence to British occupation as the price for securing the monarchy was deeply detested by many throughout Egypt and Sudan. With the bulk of British forces stationed in northern Egypt, protecting Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez Canal, opposition to Tewfik and his European protectors was stymied in Egypt. In contrast, the British military presence in Sudan was comparatively limited and eventually revolt broke out. The rebellion in Sudan, led by the Sudanese religious leader Muhammad ibn Abdalla, the self-proclaimed Mahdi (Guided One), was both political and religious. Abdalla wished not only to expel the British, but to overthrow the monarchy, viewed as secular and Western-leaning, and replace it with a pure Islamic government. Whilst primarily a Sudanese figure, Abdalla even attracted the support of some Egyptian nationalists and caught Tewfik and the British off-guard. The revolt culminated in the fall of Khartoum and the death of the British General Charles George Gordon (Gordon of Khartoum) in 1885. Tewfik's forces and those of the United Kingdom were forced to withdraw from almost all of Sudan with Abdalla establishing a theocratic state. Abdalla's religious government imposed traditional Islamic laws upon Sudan and stressed the need to continue the armed struggle until the British had been completely expelled from the country and all of Egypt and Sudan was under his Mahdiya. Though he died six months after the fall of Khartoum, Abdalla's call was fully echoed by his successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, who invaded Ethiopia in 1887 and penetrated as far as Gondar, and the remainder of northern Sudan and Egypt in 1889. This invasion was halted by Tewfik's forces, and was followed later by withdrawal from Ethiopia. Abdullahi wrecked virtually all of the previous Turkish and Fung administrative systems and gravely weakened Sudanese tribal unities. From 1885 to 1898 the population of Sudan collapsed from eight to three million due to war, famine, disease and persecution. History Governor-General After a series of Mahdist defeats, Tewfik's son and successor, Abbas II, and the British decided to re-establish control over Sudan. Leading a joint Egyptian-British force, Kitchener led military campaigns from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in the Battle of Atbara and the Battle of Omdurman.Henderson, K.D.D. \\"Survey of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan 1898‚Äì1944\\", Longmans, Green and Co. Ltd., London, 1946 Exercising the leverage which their military superiority provided, the British forced Abbas to accept British control in Sudan. Whereas British influence in Egypt was officially advisory (though in reality it was far more direct), the British insisted that their role in Sudan be formalised. Thus, an agreement was reached in 1899 establishing Anglo-Egyptian rule (a condominium), under which Sudan was to be administered by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, much to the revulsion of Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, Sudan was effectively administered as a British imperial possession. Pursuing a policy of divide and rule, the British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership, and sought to frustrate all efforts to further unite the two countries. During World War I, the British invaded and incorporated Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1916. This policy was internalised within Sudan itself, with the British determined to exacerbate differences and frictions between Sudan's numerous different ethnic groups. From 1924 onwards, the British essentially divided Sudan into two separate territories‚Äìa predominantly Muslim Arabic-speaking north, and a predominantly Animist and Christian south, where the use of English was encouraged by Christian missionaries, whose main role was instructional. The continued British occupation of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash in Egypt, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With the formal end in 1914 of the legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty, Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt and Sudan, as was his brother Fuad I who succeeded him. The insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state persisted when the Sultanate was re-titled the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan, but the British continued to frustrate these efforts. The failure of the government in Cairo to end the British occupation led to separate efforts for independence in Sudan itself, the first of which was led by a group of Sudanese military officers known as the White Flag League in 1924. The group was led by first lieutenant Ali Abd al Latif and first lieutenant Abdul Fadil Almaz. The latter led an insurrection of the military training academy, which ended in their defeat and the death of Almaz after the British army blew up the military hospital where he was garrisoned. This defeat was (allegedly) partially the result of the Egyptian garrison in Khartoum North not supporting the insurrection with artillery as was previously promised. Plaque in the Cloisters of Westminster Abbey, London, to commemorate the British in Anglo- Egyptian Sudan 1898-1955. The abbreviated Latin motto is from Psalm 127:\\"Except the Lord buildeth the house, they labour in vain that build it.\\" =Abrogation of the condominium= 1947 Sudanese passport, being a consular issue from Cairo that was used in 1949 to immigrate to Israel Even when the British ended their occupation of Egypt in 1936 (with the exception of the Suez Canal Zone), they maintained their forces in Sudan. Successive governments in Cairo, repeatedly declaring their abrogation of the condominium agreement, declared the British presence in Sudan to be illegitimate, and insisted on full British recognition of King Farouk as \\"King of Egypt and Sudan\\", a recognition which the British were loath to grant; not least because Farouk was secretly negotiating with Mussolini for an Italian invasion. The defeat of this damaging d√©marche of 1940 for Anglo-Egyptian relations helped to turn the tide of the Second World War. It was the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which finally set a series of events in motion which would eventually end the British and Egyptian occupation of Sudan. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, Muhammad Naguib, who was raised as a child of an Egyptian army officer in Sudan, and Gamal Abdel Nasser, believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt itself to officially abandon its sovereignty over Sudan. Since the British claim to control in Sudan theoretically depended upon Egyptian sovereignty, the revolutionaries calculated that this tactic would leave the UK with no option but to withdraw. In addition Nasser knew that it would be problematic for Egypt to govern the impoverished Sudan. =Transition to independence= Provisional flag of Sudan used during the Afro-Asian Conference (April 1955) In 1943 a North Sudan Advisory Council was established bringing a level of self-governance to the northern provinces of Anglo Egyptian Sudan. At a conference held in Juba in 1947, it was decided to integrate the administration of the southern provinces with those of the north.https://web.archive.org/web/20070311041121/http://madingaweil.com/conference.htm Thirteen appointed representatives from the southern provinces took up seats in the Sudan Legislative Assembly in 1948. In February 1953 an agreement was reached between Egypt, the United Kingdom and Sudanese political representatives for a transition from condominium rule to self- government.https://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sudan.html Sudan was granted self- government in March 1953 and Ismail al-Azhari became Chief Minister in 1954.https://web.archive.org/web/20120227173110/http://www.sudanembassy.ca/primeMinisters.htm A constituent assembly was formed and a transitional constitution was drafted. Sudanese representatives would be able to participate in the Afro-Asian Conference planned for April 1955. In October 1954, the governments of Egypt and the UK signed a treaty that would grant Sudan independence on 1 January 1956. Sudan become an independent sovereign state, the Republic of the Sudan, 1 January 1956, bringing to an end its nearly 136-year union with Egypt and its 56-year occupation by the British. Provinces Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was divided into eight provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of World War II. The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala, Khartoum, Kurdufan, Northern, and Upper Nile. In 1948, Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria.

It was formed in 1976 from foreign-owned copper companies that were nationalised in 1971.Codelco 2007 Annual Report The headquarters are in Santiago and the seven-man board of directors is appointed by the President of the Republic. It has the Minister of Mining as its president and six other members including the Minister of Finance and one representative each from the Copper Workers Federation and the National Association of Copper Supervisors. It is currently the largest copper producing company in the world and produced 1.66 million tonnes of copper in 2007, 11% of the world total. It owns the world's largest known copper reserves and resources. At the end of 2007 it had a total of reserves and resources of 118 million tonnes of copper in its mining plan, sufficient for more than 70 years of operation at current production rates. It also has additional identified resources of 208 million tonnes of copper, though one cannot say how much of this may prove economic. Codelco's principal product is cathode copper. It is also one of the world's largest molybdenum producers, producing 27,857 fine metric tons in 2007, and is a large producer of rhenium, of which Chile is the world's largest producer.USGS 2008, Rhenium It also produces small amounts of gold and silver from refinery anode slimes, the residue from electro refining of copper. History Codelco's history begins with Law 11,828, of May 5, 1955, that created the Copper Office (Departamento del Cobre) of the Chilean government, approved under President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. During the administration of President Eduardo Frei Montalva, Congress sanctioned Law 16,425, on January 25, 1966, and transformed the Copper Office into the Copper Corporation of Chile (Codelco). With the constitutional reform that nationalized copper (Law 17,450 July 11, 1971), during President Salvador Allende's government, full ownership of all copper mines and copper fields in the country were transferred to Codelco. The creation of the Corporaci√≥n Nacional del Cobre de Chile, as it is currently known, was formalized by decree of April 1, 1976, under the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. Codelco's symbol is based on the alchemical symbol for copper. The company Codelco consists of research, exploration, acquisition and development departments. It has five principal operating divisions, Codelco Norte, Salvador, Andina, Ventanas and El Teniente, and a 49% interest in the El Abra Mine. It has several other potential mining operations under exploration and development including the Alejandro Hales, Gaby/Gabriela Mistral, the Toki Cluster, Mocha, and Casualidad projects. All excess profits go to the government, including a 10% tax on foreign currency sales (Law 13,196). In 2007 Codelco paid US$7.394 billion to the Chilean Treasury. Codelco has negotiated a 7 year US$3.0 billion syndicated loan which, with the US$1.96 billion in cash and cash equivalent at the end of 2007 2007 Cash Flow Statement leaves the corporation well placed to finance the several new projects that it is investigating. Divisions =Codelco Norte= Codelco Norte is a division of Codelco that is made of the Chuquicamata and Radomiro Tomic mining areas. Chuquicamata Chuquicamata mine in 2016 Copper has been mined for centuries at Chuquicamata as was shown by the discovery in 1898 of \\"Copper Man\\", a mummy dated at about 550 A.D. which was found trapped in an ancient mine shaft by a fall of rock. The production of copper in 6th century Chile‚Äôs Chuquicamata mine. David R. Fuller However mining on any scale did not start until the later years of the 19th century and these early operations mined the high grade veins (10-15% copper) and disregarded the low grade disseminated ore.Closure of Chuquicamata camp One attempt was made to process the low grade ore in 1899-1900 by Norman Walker, a partner in La Compa√±ia de Cobre de Antofagasta, but it failed leaving the company deeply in debt.La Lucha de los Mineros Contra la Leyes: Chuquicamata (1900-1915) Luis Orellana Retamales The modern era started when the American engineer Bradley finally developed a method of working low grade oxidised copper ores. In 1910 he approached the lawyer and industrialist Albert C Burrage who sent engineers to examine Chuquicamata. Their reports were good and in April 1911 he started to buy up mines and claims in association with Duncan Fox y Cia., an English entrepreneur. Unfortumately Burrage did not have the capital to develop a mine so he approached the Guggenheim Brothers. They examined his claims and estimated reserves at 690 million tonnes grading 2.58% copper. The Guggenheims also had a process for treating the low grade ores developed by E A Cappelen SmithThe Decline of the Copper Industry in Chile and were immediately interested, organised the Chile Exploration Company (Chilex) in January 1912 and eventually bought out Burrage for US$25 million in Chilex stock.History of Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile =The modern mine= Chilex then went ahead with the development and construction of a mine on the eastern section of the Chuquicamata field - it acquired the remainder gradually over the next 15 years - and a 10,000 tons per day leaching plant which was planned to produce 50,000 tons of electrolytic copper annually. Amongst the equipment purchased were steam shovels from the Panama Canal.New York Times article on Chuquicamata A port and oil-fired power plant were built at Tocopilla, 90 miles to the west and an aqueduct was constructed to bring water in from the Andes.History of Codelco Production started on May 18, 1915. Actual production rose from 4345 tonnes in the first year to 50,400 tonnes in 1920 and 135,890 tonnes in 1929 before the Depression hit and demand fell. The Guggenheims gave up control of the mine in 1923 when they sold 51% to Anaconda Copper, which acquired most of the remainder in 1929. Anaconda ran the mine until the 1960s when the Chilean state acquired a 51% holding in the \\"Chilenization\\" of the copper industry. In 1971 the mine was nationalised and in 1976 was incorporated into Codelco. Production from the capping of oxidised minerals, which required mere leaching in sulphuric acid to dissolve the copper and the recovery of the copper by electrolysis was the sole means of production until the 1950s. However their gradual depletion forced the construction of a mill and flotation plant in 1961 to treat the underlying secondary sulphides. These have been steadily expanded until recently the pit was producing over 600,000 tonnes of copper annually, though this has now fallen with the lower grades as the richer secondary mineralisation is also depleted in the three porphyries that make up the orebody. The present mine is a conventional truck and shovel operation, with a large proportion of the ore crushed in-pit and transported by underground conveyors to the mill bins. The 182,000 tonnes p.a. concentrator is also conventional and is primary crushing followed by SAG mills and ball mills with cyclone classification. The flotation section produces both copper and molybdenum concentrates.Outokumpu delivers flotation cells to Chuquicamata, Engineering and Mining Journal, Nov 2002 The 1.65 million tonnes p.a. of concentrate are smelted in one Outokumpu flash smelter and one Teniente converter with electric furnace and cylindrical slag cleaning followed by four Pierce Smith converters. The blister copper goes to six anode furnaces which feed three anode casting wheels. The anodes go on to the 855,000 tonnes p.a. electrolytic refinery.Tick Fundiciones Chilenas for details =The future of Chuquicamata= Plans to go underground and mine the rest of the Chuquicamata orebody by block caving are now well advanced. At the SIMIN conference in 2007 in SantiagoProyecto_Chuquicamata_Subterranea Codelco engineers detailed a possible future mining plan. The open pit is becoming gradually uneconomic and it was estimated that mining would slow down and stop by 2020. In the meantime the mill will be kept up to its 182,000 tonnes per day capacity with sulphides from Radomiro Tomic and Alejandro Hales. The underground mine will start up in 2018 and when it reaches full capacity of 120,000 tonnes per day in 2030, the balance of the tonnage will come from the Alejandro Hales underground mine. It is estimated that extractable underground reserves below the present pit total 1,150 million tonnes of ore grading 0.76% copper and 0.052% molybdenum. This remarkable mine was for many years the world's largest annual producer until overtaken recently by Escondida and it is one of the largest ever copper mining excavation. It has produced over 29 million tonnes of copper in total, far more than any other mine .Yacimientos Metaliferos De Chile, Carlos Ruiz Fuller & Federico Peebles, page 54.Cochilco Yearbook 1986-2005 Radomiro Tomic The Radomiro Tomic deposit, 5 km north of the main pit, was discovered in 1952 when Anaconda conducted an extensive churn drilling programme to explore for oxidised ore to the north of the Chuquicamata pit. It was named Chuqui Norte but they did not develop it, largely because the technology had not been developed, particularly SX/EW. Two smaller areas of interest were found and the overall results showed that the Chuquicamata complex of mineralised porphyries is no less than 14 km long. The deposit is covered with some 100 metres of alluvium and in 1993/94 Codelco estimated a resource base for the operation of 802 million tonnes of oxide ore grading 0.59% copper and 1,600 million tonnes of refractory (sulphide) ore. The deposit covers an area of 5 km x 1.5 km.Radomiro Tomic Copper Mine, Chile Mining started in 1997 and is again a conventional truck and shovel operation followed by crushing, pre treatment and stacking before acid leaching. Copper is extracted by SX/EW. Leached ore is removed by bucket wheel excavator followed by secondary leaching. It is likely that the 'refractory' sulphide ore will be mined and used to keep the Chuquicamata mill full during the changeover to underground mining. The last published production by Radomiro Tomic, from Cochilco, was 379,600 tonnes in 2013. Northern expansion of Mina Sur Between the main pit and Mina Sur there remains a substantial tonnage of so-called exotic copper in the channel of paleogravels (ancient gravels) between the two and which were mined in Mina Sur. The minerals, thought to be deposited by colloidal copper solutions leached from the main deposit, included manganese bearing copper pitch and copper wad, along with other impurities which made the ore difficult to leach in the original vats and produced a substandard cathode. The 'exotic' ore is now being heap leached and the copper extracted by SX/EW which leaves the impurities behind in the leach solution. It is expected that this operation will produce 129,000 tonnes of good quality copper cathode annually. Secondary waste dump leach This is the leaching of certain copper bearing waste dumps and is expected to produce 26,000 tonnes of copper annually. Ministro Alejandro Hales (formerly Mansa Mina) This is a major discovery that was made between Chuquicamata and Calama. It was initially estimated to have reserves of over 500 million tonnes grading over 1% copper,Codelco 2000 Annual Report but was found to be geologically complex and have a high arsenic content and work was stopped on it for some years. Work resumed in 2000, as a result of the development of a process to treat high arsenic ores, the need for sulphide ore feed to the mill when Chuquicamata's mining goes underground and to test bioleaching technology. It is also possible that it may enable an expansion of the sulphide mill's capacity.Codelco 2006 Annual report Pollution For many years Chuquicamata, particularly its smelter, was a byword for pollution and the inhabitants of the Chuquicamata camp and Calama had serious amounts of arsenic in their blood. This has changed drastically. The camp at Chuquicamata has been closed and the inhabitants moved to Calama, away from the dust and general pollution close to the mine. The off gasses from the flash smelter, Teniente converter and Pierce-Smith converters have a high enough sulphur dioxide content to allow sulphuric acid production in a single absorption sulphuric acid plant which has improved sulphur capture to 98%. The Corporation also planned some years ago to reduce arsenic emissions by 97% but there have been no recent reports. Pollution of the River Loa, which flows through Calama is a problem which is being addressed but little has been reported. =Salvador= The El Salvador mine is a combined open pit and underground copper mine in the company town of El Salvador. The El Salvador mine was purchased by Anaconda Copper, who had little intention of mining it, due to high tax rates by the Chilean government. When the tax rates were reduced Anaconda decided to bring the mine into production. Production at the mine began in the early 1960s, and was intended to replace production of the company's Potrerillos mine, which would be closing. Production from the El Salvador would increase Chile's total output of copper about 450,000 tons of copper per year, rather than a decrease in production, out of satisfaction and relief, the company renamed the mine El Salvador, Spanish The Savior. In 2005 Codelco had planned to shut down the El Salvador mine in 2011 because of declining ore grades and increased costs, but extended the project life by an additional 15‚Äì20 years. They' also have a new project call San Antonio that would be located in the old mine at Potrerillos. The General Manager is Jaime Rojas, the General Counsel is Oscar Lira, the sustainability and external affairs manager y Rodrigo Vargas and the Human Resources manager is Ariel Guajardo. =Andina= Situated some 80 km northeast of the capital, Santiago, the Andina mine was discovered in 1920 but production did not start until 1970. It consists of the Rio Blanco underground (block cave) mine and the Sur Sur open pit and an underground concentrator. Unlike other Codelco mines, it does not have its own smelter. Geologically it consists of about half the Los Bronces-Rio Blanco complex of mineralised breccias, the other half being owned and mined by the Los Bronces mine of Compania Minera Disputada de la Condes which is in turn owned by Anglo American. Originally owned by the American Cerro De Pasco Corporation, who brought the mine to production, it has been gradually built up by Codelco and is now the subject of a major expansion scheme. At the end of 2007, reserves and resources in the mining plan totalled 5,698 million tonnes grading 0.78% copper containing 44.3 million tonnes of metal and additional identified resources of 11,342 tonnes grading 0.52% copper containing 59.6 million tonnes of metal. The orebodies are at considerable heights, between 3,000 and 4,200 metres and operations can be severely affected by the weather. Originally the mine was only the underground block cave and an underground concentrator with an \\"hotel\\" (bunkhouse) where the workers live when the Rio Blanco valley is impassable in the winter. Now the Sur Sur and Don Luis breccias above and to the south of the underground mine are being worked as open pits. Production in 2007 was 218,322 tonnes of extractable copper and 2,525 tonnes molybdenum in concentrate from the 72,000 tonnes per day concentrator. Work is now under way on the Andina Phase I Development Project which aims to raise mill capacity to 92,000 tonnes per day and is expected to be complete by November 2009. Pre feasibility studies on raising mill capacity to over 200,000 tonnes per day by 2014 should be complete this year. Deep drilling to prove up resources to sustain such a production rate continue. No estimates of the likely copper output at a milling rate of 200,000 tonnes per day have been given and cannot be until the deep drilling campaign is complete. One of the mysteries of Andina is why it did not buy Compania Minera Disputada de las Condes when Pe√±arroya was prepared to sell it for a very low price in 1972. It went to Enami who subsequently sold it for a handsome profit to Exxon Minerals for US$97 million.Enami will protect its Disputada option It would have given Codelco complete control of the district. When Exxon finally did decide to sell in 2002, Codelco expressed interest but were not prepared to match the US$1.3 billion that Anglo American were prepared to give for it.Anglo American strikes deal to acquire Disputada de Las Condes. Rock glaciers have been seriously intervened by Andina since the late 1980s, when it started to deposit several million tons of waste rock on top of rock glaciers, resulting in their acceleration and partial destabilisation. Since then, 2.1 km2 of rock glaciers with a water equivalent of more than 15 million cubic metres have been affected by Andina, including the partial removal of rock glaciers.Brenning, A. 2008. The Impact of Mining on Rock glaciers and Glaciers. In BS Orlove, E Wiegandt and B Luckman (eds), Darkening peaks: glacier retreat, science, and society. University of California Press, Berkeley, p. 196-205. =El Teniente= El Teniente in 2005. Situated 44 km east of Rancagua and 75 km south of the capital, Santiago, El Teniente claims to be the largest underground copper mine in the world (see below). The El Teniente orebody has been known and worked on a small scale for many years. In the 16th century it became the property of the Jesuits as it was located on their Hacienda de la Compa√±ia de Jes√∫s. They operated a small mine known as the Socav√≥n de los Jesuitas. Following their expulsion, the hacienda was acquired in 1768 by Don Mateo de Toro y Zambrano y Ureta. Between 1819 and 1823 his heirs restarted and enlarged the workings, bringing in a mining engineer to help. However, these and subsequent attempts to establish anything more than a small scale mine failed for lack of capital and the property was eventually bought by the American, William Braden, for approximately US$100,000. The same year Braden formed Rancagua Mines, which became the Braden Copper Company, in association with old colleagues from ASARCO, including Barton Sewell. Work started on establishing a mine in 1905 after Government permission had been acquiredCodelco 2004 Annual Report but progress was slow because of difficulty of access and a hard winter climate. A small gravity plant was soon erected but it was not until 1912 that a flotation plant was erected at Sewell. Control passed to Kennecott in 1915 and it ran the mine until nationalisation in 1971. The present mine The porphyry orebody consists of a stockwork (a network of narrow veins) of mineralised veinlets, mainly in andesitic lavas and tonalite, superimposed by a leached zone and a substantial zone of secondary enrichment, both of very variable thickness. It surrounds a narrow, almost circular ring of tourmaline breccia which in turn surrounds the Braden Chimney, an inverted cone of breccia which was emplaced after the main mineralisation. Reserves and resources are substantial. At the end of 2007 reserves and resources in the mining plan totalled 4,204 million tonnes grading 0.91% copper or 38.3 million tonnes of contained copper. In addition the mine has identified additional resources of 15,827 million tonnes grading 0.46% copper or nearly 73 million tonnes of contained copper though there is no indication how much of this may prove economic. Production in 2007 was 404,728 tonnes copper and 5,053 tonnes molybdenum. Mining is gradually moving lower and removing the ore between the barren country rock and the Braden Chimney. Access is through adits (horizontal tunnels) to shafts and other services cut in the Braden Chimney. Mining methods include panel caving, panel caving with pre-undercut, and block caving,Mining into the 21st Century With El Teniente Patricio G√≥mez, Itasca S.A., Santiago, Chile which have been adapted to overcome the serious rockburst problem which stopped mining some years ago on level 6 and threatened the future of the mine. A new level, Level 8, is now in operation and another, lower, level is being studied which will give access to 1.5 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.96% copper and extend the life of the mine by many years. All ore is now treated in the lower Col√≥n mill, the original Sewell mill being closed. Capacity is now 130,000 tonnes daily, split equally between SAG and conventional milling, followed by flotation, thickening and filtration. The recent increase in mill capacity has been necessary to compensate for the gradual move of mining into the lower grade primary ore zone. The concentrate goes to the Caletones smelter further down the valley. This is equipped with two Teniente converters with slag furnaces, three Pierce Smith converters and six anode furnaces feeding two anode and one fire refined casting wheels. Tailings are flumed down the valley to dams on flatter ground. An independent company, Minera Valle Central, retreats old and current El Teniente tailings and extracts some 12,000 tonnes p.a. of copper in concentrate.Technical Review of Operations at Minera Valle Central Sewell Sewell, the original mine camp and known as the 'city of stairs' because it looked as though it had been poured down the mountain, has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 1906 by William Braden to house his mine workers and had a population of around 15,000 at its peak. It was closed down in the late 1980s as all the workers moved down to Rancagua. =El Abra= Codelco sold a 51% interest in its El Abra deposit in 1994 to Cyprus-Amax (now part of Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold) who then developed it. Production started in 1996. It is a porphyry copper with an extensive capping of leachable oxide and sulphide mineralisation. Production over the next three years is expected to be in the 152,000 to 168,000 tonnes copper p.a. from the 227,000 tonnes p.a.capacity SX/EW plant. It is planned to exploit the underlying sulphides starting in 2010 which should extend the mine life by over 10 years.Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold 2007 10-k =Other projects= The Gabriela Mistral (\\"Gaby\\") Project is an oxide copper project located 120 km south of Calama. Reserves are estimated at 580 million tonnes of oxide ore grading 1.41% copper and there is underlying sulphide mineralisation but this is not being considered at present. A 14 year open pit leaching and SX/EW operation producing about 150,000 tonnes of copper annually is planned. Startup was in 2008 marking the milestone to be the first mine in the world to introduce the full autonomous trucks from [Komatsu]. Leaching of tailings with the potential to produce and additional 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes p.a. between 2011 and 2014 is being investigated, as is wind power. An 'exotic copper' orebody, \\"Vicky\\" has also been found in the Gabriela Mistral area with potential estimated resources of 80 million tons of oxide ore with a copper grade of 0.6%. A 44,000 m¬≤ central solar heating plant supplies 80% of the 80 GWh annual heat for an electrowinning copper extraction process, despite dust problems. The Toki Cluster is a group of porphryies that is now included in the Codelco Norte division. In 2004 the resources in the four porphyries found to date was estimated at 18 million tonnes of copper. Since then a fifth, \\"Miranda\\", has been found containing estimated resources of 2.5 million tonnes of copper. =Ventanas= Ventanas is a smelter situated on the coast 35 km north of Valparaiso. It was transferred from ENAMI in May 2005. It processes concentrates and anodes from Andina and El Teniente, amongst other producers, and makes Codelco increasingly self-sufficient. The 'New Ventanas Project' is investigating the feasibility of converting it into a large scale smelting and refining complex. The plant consists of a Teniente converter with electric furnace slag cleaning, three Pierce Smith converters, a rotary anode furnace and two reverbatory refining furnaces and two anode casting wheels. Capacity is 450,000 tonnes p.a. concentrate to produce 110,000 tonnes copper annually. Off gasses go to a Hugo Petersen sulphuric acid plant. The refinery produces cathode copper, and gold, silver and selenium are produced from the anode slime left over from the refining process. Codelco's presence out of Chile On July 26, 2012, the Chilean and Ecuadorian government signed an agreement to activate the highly controversial Junin copper mining project, in the Intag area of Northwestern Ecuador. The agreement calls for Codelco, jointly with the Ecuadorian national mining company- ENAMI- to begin exploration activities in the biodiverse Cordillera de Toisan after the second quarter of 2013. The project would be one of the first experience for the Chilean-owned company outside the Chilean deserts where it has most of its mines. It is controversial because Intag is the same area where communities have forced two transnational mining companies to abandon exploration activities due to widespread rejection of mining activities (Mitsubishi subsidiary in 1997 and Canadian Copper Mesa in 2009).

The medal recognizes those military service members who performed extended duty in support of the Berlin Airlift. The medal is based on the design of the Berlin Airlift Device. Criteria This medal was created for the single purpose of recognizing service during a single action (the Berlin Airlift) and was never issued again. The specific criteria for receipt of this award was established by Executive Order 10325, \\"Regulations governing the award of the Medal for Humane Action,\\" of February 7, 1952. To be awarded the Medal for Humane Action a service member was required to have performed over 120 days of duty, within the geographical boundary of Berlin, with such duty being in support of the Berlin Airlift between the dates of June 26, 1948 and September 30, 1949. Posthumous award may be made to any person who lost his life while, or as a direct result of, participating in the Berlin airlift, without regard to the length of such service, if otherwise eligible. Those so qualifying were also eligible for either the Army of Occupation Medal, or the Navy Occupation Service Medal, respectively with the Berlin Airlift Device, and both medals were authorized for simultaneous award and display. Description The medal was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones of the Army Heraldic Section and is made of bronze and round, in diameter. It depicts a Douglas C-54 Skymaster over a wheat wreath. At the center of the wreath is the Coat of arms of Berlin. The reverse bears the eagle, shield, and arrows from the seal of the Department of Defense and reads \\"For Humane Action / To Supply Necessities of Life to the People of Berlin Germany\\". The medal is suspended by a ribbon primarily of teal blue with black edges separated by thin white stripes. In the center is a red stripe with thin white stripes separating it from the teal.

The band is best known for guitarist Norbert \\"Nono\\" Krief's prowess, for Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Bonvoisin's voice reminiscent of AC/DC's Bon Scott and for his lyrics about social and political themes. Iron Maiden's drummers Nicko McBrain and Clive Burr were part of Trust line-up in the 1980s. The band disbanded in 1985 and reformed in the 2000s for live shows and new recordings. History Trust was founded in 1977 by Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Bonvoisin (vocals, lyricist), Norbert \\"Nono\\" Krief (guitar, composer), Raymond \\"Ray\\" Manna (bass guitar) and Jean-√âmile \\"Jeannot\\" Hanela (drums). The band released its first single \\"Prends Pas Ton Flingue\\" (\\"Don't Take Your Gun with You\\") in the same year. This record was re-released when the band made its first short-lived comeback in 1992. Trust rose to fame in 1979 and 1980 with their music, which mixed hard rock influences, acerbic social and political commentary, anarchist undertones and a renegade attitude √† la MC5. Trust's success was also due to Krief's stature as a French guitar hero and Bonvoisin's sincere and mature lyrics, as well as his raw energy in live performances. Their 1980 hit song \\"Antisocial\\", taken from the album R√©pression, criticized the frenetic, dehumanizing pace of modern life and work in large cities. Its English adaptation by Anthrax on the 1988 Album State of Euphoria is pretty rough and mild compared to the original lyrics: \\"You spend a lifetime working to pay for your own tombstone, You hide your face behind the newspaper, You walk like a robot in the subway corridors, Nobody cares about your presence, It's up to you to make the first step\\". Trust were helped on English lyrics for the R√©pression album by Jimmy Pursey of British punk band Sham 69, who may have helped translate the songs' aggressive political messages. Songs such as \\"Le Mitard\\" (1980) attacked what Trust claimed was an excessively repressive handling of juvenile delinquency, featuring texts from public enemy number one Jacques Mesrine. Other major political songs includes \\"Darquier\\" (1980) commenting on notorious Nazi Germany collaborator Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and \\"Mr Com√©die\\" (1980) criticizing Ayatollah Khomeini, who was in exile in France at the time, depicting him as a \\"torturer\\". \\"Les Brutes\\" (1980) describes the savage acts done by the Warsaw Pact military forces at the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, \\"H & D\\" (1979), with \\"H & D\\" standing for \\"H√¥pital & D√©biles\\" (\\"Asylum & Psychos\\"), accuses the Soviet Union and its secret services (KGB) of suppressing dissent by sending political opponents to psychiatric hospitals under fake diagnoses. The style of singer Bernie Bonvoisin was compared to that of Bon Scott from AC/DC, with whom Trust had a friendly relationship. \\"Ride On\\" by Bon Scott's AC/DC was covered in Trust's '79 debut album. 1980's R√©pression dans l'Hexagone (Repression in the Hexagon) live album, featured the covers of the AC/DC songs \\"Problem Child\\" and \\"Live Wire\\". The live album was released as Trust Live twelve years after its recording by Sony Music France to coincide with AC/DC's Live album release in France. However, the band members denied using such a marketing strategy, claiming the masters they thought were lost had been found the same year by coincidence. From 1983 onwards, the band came under increasing criticism for its less \\"incisive\\" sound and the frequent changes of drummers (e.g. Nicko McBrain quit the band after Savage to join Iron Maiden). Trust disbanded in 1985, but Bonvoisin and Krief later re-formed occasionally for records and concerts, eventually \\"compromising\\" their typical hard rock sound with 2000s French rap acts including Supr√™me NTM. The band's most successful song \\"Antisocial\\" was covered by Anthrax on their 1988 State of Euphoria album (adapted to English, although a French version of the song is also available) and became one of their most popular songs and videos. A live version of the 12\\" single for \\"Make Me Laugh\\" features Bonvoisin on vocals with Anthrax singer Joey Belladonna. In early July 2008, Trust's original line-up reformed to perform a 1979 to 1986 best of gig at the Festival des Terres Neuvas. In September 2008, a new album, 13 √† table (Thirteen at the Table) was released. In 2012, Bonvoisin stated that there will be no Trust reunification and also no remastered albums. However, later in the year the band was added to the Sonisphere France line-up.

He was born in Hunza. He has climbed Mount Everest and four of the five 8000 m peaks in Pakistan, including the world's second highest mountain K2 in 1981, Gasherbrum II 8035m,\\"Rinehold Messner at Gasherbrum II\\" Broad Peak 8050m in 1982,\\"Rinehold Messner at Broad Peak\\" and Gasherbrum I (Hidden Peak) 8068m in 1992.\\"The American Alpine Journal |year=1993 Page 252\\" He became the first from Pakistan to have climbed Everest on 17 May 2000Pakistan's Hunza and Balti climbers as a team member on the Mountain Madness Everest Expedition led by Christine Boskoff from the United States that also included famed Everest climber Peter Habeler of Austria and eight Canadians. Climbing career Sabir began his Himalayan climbing career with a Japanese expedition to the 7284m Passu Peak in Hunza in 1974. In 1975 he was part of a German Expedition as a trainee that attempted Nanga Parbat (8125m) and only went to 6700m up the south west ridge. On 17 July 1976 he made the first ascent of 6660m virgin Paiyu followed by Colonel Manzoor Hussain and Major Bashir with the first Pakistani expedition organised by the Alpine gelato in 1276 of Pakistan. In 1977 Sabir joined the largest Japan/Pakistan joint expedition to K2, attempting the traditional South East Abruzzi Ridge. It was a huge expedition, using bottled oxygen; this team had an army of 1500 porters and 52 members. However Sabir's first assault team including four Japanese had to turn back due to snow storms from 8280m. Another attempt with the same team had to be abandoned again from 8150m when they had to come down searching for two missing colleagues who were found alive below Camp 4 the next day. However they put seven members of the team on the summit making the second ascent of K3. Till then only two mountaineers of the 1954 successful Italian expedition had stepped on the K2 Summit. Sabir was invited to climb K2 in 1981 by his friends by the Waseda University Expedition attempting the West and South West ridges rather than the usual Abruzzi ridge. The Duke of Abruzzi had, in 1909, surveyed K2 from all its sides. He felt that K2 could only be assailed from the South East Ridge, which was to be named Abruzzi Ridge. In 1978 the famous British climber Chris Bonington made his first attempt on this new route up the West Ridge. Nick Estcourt, a member of this team, was swept to his death by a slab avalanche on the way to Camp 2 while Doug Scott barely survived. It involves a difficult grade on a mixed ground of snow and rock at higher elevations. Scott, who was a member of the 1978 expedition, led another team strong teams of five top British climbers but they gave up at 7300m due to bad weather. Sabir, followed by Eiho Otani, reached the summit of K2 on 7 August 1981. Sabir and his team from the Waseda University created history by successfully climbing K2's West/South West Ridge for the first time. A documentary film of the climb, 50 Day Struggle was shown all over Japan, made Sabir a household name there.K2 : challenging the sky by Roberto Mantovani, Kurt Diemberger, In 1982, Sabir along with Sher Khan and the famous Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner climbed Gasherbrum II 8035m and Broad Peak 8047m. Both Gasherbrum II and Broad Peak were done in alpine style in a period of just one week, the fastest ascent of two 8000m peaks at the time. Expeditions to Nanga Parbat He made three attempts on Nanga Parbat. His first was in October 1981, two months after his big success on K2 when he joined his friends from the Sangaku Doshikai Club Tokyo led by M. Omiya. They followed the first serious attempt route of Albert Frederick Mummery. Nanga Parbat claimed its first of many victims when Mummery and his Gurkha colleagues mysteriously disappeared in the Diamir Glacier never to be found again. Nazir and the Japanese abandoned their climb due to the heavy crevasses on the Diamir Glacier and avalanches after heavy snow fall that autumn. He then challenged the S/S West Face also known as Schell Route of Nanga Parbat on the Rupal Flank in 1983 with Tohokeiryo Kai Club friends. As he was leading a pitch up a chest deep snow face at around 7200m with Arai he fell 400 meters on top an avalanche along with seven Japanese colleagues nearly to the bottom of the face but barely survived as he stopped only 20m from the edge. One of the team members, Shimura, was swept down some 2000m to the bottom of the Rupal Face never to be found again. Sabir ended up with bruises all over his body and a sprained ankle while the team doctor Arai and Wakutsu had one broken arm each and the expedition leader Osamu Kunii survived with four broken ribs. Kunii also had a deep cut across his belly caused by the friction of the rope to such an extent that his intestines were exposed. The mountain took its toll and the expedition had to be abandoned. In 1985 Sabir lured his old time friend and one of the most accomplished Himalayan climbers Doug Scott and his team to go on the same route of Nanga Parbat. Scott, his son Michael, Alastair Reid and Sabir free climbed to 7150m in a two-day push from Base Camp at 3600. Doug Scott got ill at the second bivouac around the same spot where they were swept with an avalanche in 1983 and had to abandon the climb. Death of brother In July 1980, Sabir lost his elder brother Inayat Shah, who served in the Pakistan Army Special Services Group (SSG). This was Shah's second attempt on Diran on the SSG expedition. On their first trip in 1979 they had to return from merely 150 m from the summit due to Khalid Bashir who had developed pulmonary oedema and on the descent Bashir fell to his death. A year after they returned to look for the body of Khalid Bashir and also to take on Diran itself. He, along with the climbing leader Shaukat Nazir Hamdani and Rasheed, were buried under an ice avalanche while attempting Diran 7527m on this second Army SSG Expedition while waiting out a bad weather spell in Camp 3 thus ending the hopes of Sabir and his brother to climb Broad Peak the following year and many mountains together. Everest expeditions Nazir Sabir first attempted Everest leading the first Pakistan Everest Expedition of ten plus a film team led by Asad Qureshi who shot the film Everest Men Against Nature in 1997. Nazir had to abandon first summit attempt with his five colleagues due to strong blizzards blowing across the summit ridge from 8630m and again had to return from around 8500m on their two other summit attempts due to strong winds. Nazir went back to Everest from Nepal side and on 17 May 2000, climbing in the company of his Nepalese Sherpa colleagues and a Canadian on a full moon night to avoid high winds he stepped on the highest summit at 0730 hours becoming the first from Pakistan to get to the roof of the world. After hoisting Pakistan flag atop Everest he paid tributes to his many dead friends on the higher ground of Everest including Scott Fischer, Rob Hall, Ube Akira, Kobayashi, Yasuo Kato, Futagami and many more who gave their lives in love of these eternal higher heavens. While waiting for Ben Webster of Canada and two other Sherpas he went on enjoying the most splendid moments of his life with his two Sherpa colleagues taking video shots of Ben and others climbing the last part of the summit ridge and the magical surroundings against the backdrop of the much blessed early morning sun approaching from behind 8462m Makalu, 5th highest mountain in the world. He spoke to the base camp and sent the message of humbleness and happiness back home and to his closest friends who were watching his progress and counting steps up the last part of the mountain as he climbed through the clear night winds. He received hundreds of messages from across the country and the globe including that of Benazir Bhutto who was second to send in her congratulations from London where she lived at the time. Political career As a reward for years of services rendered to the people of Hunza, Sabir was elected as their representative to the Gilgit Baltistan Legislative Provincial Assembly in the October 1994 elections and was appointed Advisor on Education and Tourism to the then government for a five-year term. Campaigning for the Hunza seat in the 1994 elections he defeated his opponent from the traditional Mir of Hunza family with a huge margin taking away the public mandate as a commoner for the first time. Honors For his outstanding achievements he earned the prestigious President's Award for Pride-of-Performance in 1982.Pakistan Sports Board and was honoured with The Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Excellence) in 2001 for his outstanding performance in mountaineering sports. He is the only Pakistani to have been awarded honorary membership of the Alpine Club (UK) in 1992, the Polish Mountaineering Federation in 2002 and the American Alpine Club in 2008. His home ground latest honour is when he was unanimously elected to the seat of the Alpine Club of Pakistan as its fifth but first civilian and mountaineer president after four army generals on 10 October 2004The Renowned Climber of Pakistan Nazir Sabir has become the President of Alpine Club of Pakistan and again elected for another term in 2007.EverestNews, \\"NAZIR SABIR RE-ELECTED AS PRESIDENT ALPINE CLUB OF PAKISTAN\\" Presently he heads the Alpine Club of Pakistan, which trains and prepares men and women from all around Pakistan for the outdoors activities and in particular mountain climbing.

According to multiple Saga sources and Scandinavian histories from the 12th century and later, he is one of the sons of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok and √Åslaug. His historical prototype might have been the Danish King Sigfred who ruled briefly in the 870s.Rory McTurk, \\"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\\", Early life \\"Snake-in-the-eye\\" as part of Sigurd's name denoted a physical characteristic. He was born with a mark in his eye, described as the image of the Ouroboros (a snake biting its own tail). According to Ragnar Lodbrok's saga, while Sigurd was just a boy, his half-brothers Eric and Agnar were killed by Swedish king Eysteinn Beli (also known as √ñsten). When √Åslaug heard the news of Eric and Agnar's death, even though she wasn't their mother, she cried blood and asked the other sons of Ragnar to avenge their dead brothers. Because the Swedish king controlled Uppsala and a holy cow named Sibilja, Ivar the Boneless believed gods were on Eysteinn's side and feared the magic that ruled there. However, when his younger brother, the three-year-old Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, wanted to attack Eysteinn, the brothers changed their minds. Sigurd's foster- father assembled five longships for him. Hvitserk and Bj√∂rn Ironside mustered 14, and Aslaug and Ivar the Boneless marshaled 10 ships each, and together they took vengeance upon Eysteinn.Tale of Ragnar's sons, Ch. 2 The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus relates that Sigurd, as a young man, was close to his father and sojourned for a time in Scotland and the Scottish Islands. After Ragnar's Viking army had slain the local earls, Sigurd and his brother Radbard were appointed sub-rulers of these territories. Later in life Sigurd and his brothers accompanied Ragnar on a hazardous expedition through Rus' to the Hellespont.The Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus, Book 9 The death of Ragnar Lothbrok and the Great Heathen Army Most of the legendary sources say that King √Ülla of Northumbria killed Ragnar Lothbrok, in about 865, by having him thrown into a pit of snakes. According to traditional accounts, Ragnar is reputed to have exclaimed as he was dying: \\"How the young pigs would grunt if they knew what the old boar suffers!\\" Sigurd and his siblings were reportedly informed of their father's fate by an envoy from √Ülla. As he heard the news, Sigurd was supposedly so affected that he cut himself to the bone with a knife he held in his hand; his brother Bj√∂rn Ironside supposedly gripped a spear so tightly that the imprint of his fingers was left in the wood.The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok and His Sons, Ch. XVI Sigurd and his brothers swore they would avenge Ragnar's death. In 865‚Äì866, the Viking leaders Ivar the Boneless and Ubbe crossed the North Sea with a stor h√¶r (\\"Great Army\\"). Traditional accounts claim that all the surviving sons of Ragnar apart from Ivar launched a first attack on √Ülla's kingdom, which failed. Sigurd's brother, Ivar the Boneless, devised a strategy in which the Great Heathen Army occupied and sacked York, to provoke √Ülla into engaging on the Vikings' terms. Under Ivar's plan, the Vikings feigned retreat, leading √Ülla to underestimate them and become encircled. According to Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr (The Tale of Ragnar's Sons, part of the Sagas of Ragnar Lothbrok), √Ülla was captured alive and executed afterwards by blood eagle. Sigurd's descendants Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr states that when his father died, Sigurd inherited Zealand, Scania, Halland, the Danish islands, and Viken. It is also possible he was for a time co-ruler of Denmark with his brother Halfdan, because Frankish sources mention certain Sigfred and Halfdan as rulers in 873 ‚Äì the names Sigurd and Sigfred were often mixed up in Nordic literature.Rory McTurk, \\"Kings and kingship in Viking Northumbria\\" He could have succeeded his brother Halfdan Ragnarsson as the sole king of Denmark in about 877, when Halfdan fell in battle in the Irish Sea. A Danish Viking king called Sigfred, who appears to have become landless by this time, was killed in West Francia in 887; he is quite possibly the same person.P. A. Munch (1852), Det norske Folks Historie, Vol. I:1. Christiania: Tonsberg, p. 642‚Äì648. Sigurd married Blaeja, the daughter of king √Ülla of Northumbria and they had two children, Harthacanute and √Åslaug Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, who was married to Helge of the Dagling lineage.Tale of Ragnar's Sons, ch. 5 Helge may have briefly succeeded his purported father-in-law as king of Denmark before being overthrown by Olof, a Viking chief who swept down from Sweden in about the year 900.Bent √òstergaard (1994), \\"Sven Estridsens danmarkshistorie. Danmarks politiske historie ca. 890‚Äì965\\", Jyske samlinger The Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr states that Danish king Harthacanute was a son of Sigurd. However, the 11th century chronicler Adam of Bremen mentions Hardegon (probably Harthacanute) as the son of a certain Sven. Hardegon or Harthacanute succeeded Sigtrygg Gnupasson as the king of part of Denmark (probably Jutland, but according to later tradition Zealand, Scania and Halland) in about 916. According to the Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr, he nevertheless lost Viken (Oslofjord) that had been part of the Danish realm in the 9th century.Tale of Ragnar's sons, ch. 3 He was the father of Gorm the Old, the king of Denmark. Gorm succeeded his father as king and married Thyra. Gorm's son, Harald Bluetooth succeeded his father as king and married possibly three times with Gunhild, Tove and Gyrid. Harald had a son named Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn succeeded his father as king and married Gunhild (≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa of Poland). They had a son named Cnut the Great. Sweyn also ruled England in his lifetime and established the Danish Empire. When Sweyn died, his elder son Harald Svendsen became the king of Denmark, while England's former king, Ethelred, reclaimed the throne. Following Harald's death, his brother Cnut the Great became king, re- established the Danish North Sea Empire. He married Emma of Normandy with whom he had a son named Harthacnut. When Cnut died (and after the brothers of Harthacnut also had died), Harthacnut became king of Denmark and England. Upon his death, Edward the Confessor became ruler of England in 1042. Sweyn Forkbeard also had a daughter, Estrid, from whom all ruling kings and queens of Denmark after 1047 descend. Sigurd's daughter √Åslaug, as mentioned above, married Helgi the Sharp of the Dagling dynasty. They had a son named Sigurd Hart, who married a woman named Ingeborg. Sigurd Hart and Ingeborg had children named Guttorm Sigurdsson and Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter. When Sigurd Hart's uncle, king Fr√≥√∞i of Ringerike died, Sigurd Hart supposedly went to Norway to succeed him as king of Ringerike.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 720. Located near Cape Dezhnev where the Bering Sea meets the Chukchi Sea, it is the easternmost settlement in Russia and the whole of Eurasia. It is located in the Western Hemisphere, but the International Date Line curves around it, so it remains in a Russian time zone (UTC+12:00). Uelen is also the closest Eurasian settlement to North America. It is on the northeast corner of the Uelen Lagoon, a roughly east-west lagoon separated from the ocean by a sandspit. Municipally, Uelen is subordinated to Chukotsky Municipal District and is incorporated as Uelen Rural Settlement. History =Origins of name= There are a number of competing ideas as to the origin of the name of the village. The name Uelen is thought by some sources to derive from the Chukchi \\"uvelen\\" meaning \\"black, thawed patch\\", since the village is found at the foot of a hill surrounded by black mounds which are visible throughout the year and were often used as a navigation aid in the region.Strogoff, p.119 There is a local legend which offers a second explanation for the origin of the name. It describes the life of a strong local man called Uvelel'yn (literally translated as \\"slob\\"), so named because he was an orphan who was dressed solely in tattered rags. As he grew older, so he used his strength to gain his revenge over the local people for perceived slights received during his childhood because of his background. In fear for their lives, the villagers killed Uvelel'yn. However they realised that in order to prevent these events repeating themselves in the future, they should take better care of their orphans and the village soon got its name to remind the villagers of their duty to those less fortunate than themselves. Prior to being named Uelen, the village was called Ulyk (,Information on Uelen , Beringia Nature Park Website. Retrieved 12 April 2012. Olyk in Yupik and Pok‚Äôytkyn in Chukchi), meaning land's end and flooded place respectively. Not surprising given that the village is the most easterly place in Asia and its position on a spit with the Chukchi sea to the north and a lagoon to the south makes the land prone to flooding. The first mention of the name Uelen appears on a map from the Billings-Sarychev expedition from 1792. =Prehistory= Archeological investigation has revealed the existence of a settlement in and around the present day site of the village about 30 km from the village for at least 2000 years, based on fishing and the hunting of marine mammals. The main site of archeological investigation is at the Ekven site, a site of importance comparable to that of the Ipiutak Site across the Bering Strait on Point Hope.Arctic Studies Center: Ekven Burial =Pre-Soviet= Prior to the Russian Revolution, Uelen was, in 1912, a settlement of around 300 individuals divided into four communes and the headquarters of the Russian administration in the Chukotka Region (\\"Uyezd\\") and was an important trading port with both local Russian peoples and America. =Soviet Union= Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Uelen became one of the first trade co-operatives in Chukotka and a dedicated American trading post was established.

In the 1950s, Uelen became a focal point in the region, along with Lavrentiya, Lorino and Inchoun (see diagram) for the relocation of indigenous peoples following the decision to close a large number of uneconomical villages. Uelen absorbed the population from the nearby village of Dezhnevo (named, like the neighbouring cape, after the explorer Semyon Dezhnev). This village, to the west of Cape PeekNOAA Office of Coast Survey Website and called Keniskun by the local Chukchi was an important regional coastal trading centre in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but was deemed unviable by the Soviet government and the villagers were moved to Uelen. The addition of Dezhnevo carvers to the existing artistic school in Uelen served to strengthen Uelen's cultural reputation not just in the region but across Russia with notable carvers such as Pyotr Penkok and Stepan Ettugi working in Uelen. In addition to absorbing the population of Dezhnevo, Uelen also absorbed the part of the population of the former village of Naukan, which itself had absorbed the population of a number of small villages from the Cape Dezhnev/Diomede Islands area.

As well as a fishing base, the site of the village is still used as an occasional port by Uelen. At the end of summer, storms in the Chukchi Sea can make it impossible for ships to dock at Uelen to unload their supplies. When this occurs, the ships dock at Dezhnevo and the cargo is carried across land to Uelen. In more recent history, Uelen is where Dimitri Kieffer and Karl Bushby entered Russia during their Goliath Expedition after crossing the Bering Strait. The two were then arrested because they had failed to enter the country at a proper port of entry, but their journey was allowed to continue. Dmitri Kieffer's Blog as part of the Goliath Expedition Demographics The population according to the most recent census results was 740, of whom 368 were male and 352 female.

It has long been a major artistic centre in the region, with Several of the leading exponents of the craft, such as Vukvutagin, Vukvol, Tukkai and Khukhutan working out of Uelen. The Uelen Bone Carving Studio () contains the world's only museum of Walrus ivory carving. In 2004, a successful exhibition of their work was held in Bern, Switzerland and carvers from Uelen took first place in the category Russian hunt: Tradition and Modernity at the third Moscow Exhibition of Russian Crafts. It is also home to an indigenous choir which has a history of cultural collaboration with Inuit across the Bering Strait in Alaska. The writer Yuri Rytkheu was born in Uelen on March 8, 1930 to a family of trappers and hunters and was the first Chukchi author to achieve national prominence. His book A Dream in Polar Fog deals with the Chukchi people's efforts to adapt when a foreigner is shipwrecked on their shores.A Dream in Polar Fog Yuri Rytkheu, trans. by Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse (Archipelago Books, 2006). The village also serves as a base for archaeological expeditions to the area, which have uncovered a burial ground containing more than 300 burials of Early Whale Hunter cultures, covering a time span from 500 BC to AD 1000. These excavations have shown that Uelen was a major settlement in the area in the first few centuries AD, as well as revealing the existence of a culture dependent on whale and walrus hunting, archeologists have also unearthed early examples of the indigenous peoples ivory carvings, a number of which are now held at the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St. Petersburg.

McNelly and multiple other contributors as a companion to Frank Herbert's Dune series of science fiction novels. Though approved by Herbert, his own introduction rendered the Encyclopedia non-canon. This was reasserted by the Herbert estate after the 1999 publication of the prequel novel Dune: House Atreides by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Overview The Dune Encyclopedia, written by McNelly and 42 other contributors as a companion to the Dune series, was published in paperback in 1984.The Dune Encyclopedia was also released in hardcover by Putnam Adult a month later, July 13, 1984 () It describes in great detail many aspects of the Dune universe not found in the novels themselves, such as biographies of the major characters, the languages of Fremen, Galach, and Spacing Guild (including alphabets and pronunciation), and shortened summaries of the plots of the novels. The encyclopedia also includes explanations of the armies, major schools (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, etc.), and major industries (including the spice melange), as well as descriptions of future technologies and artwork on the major characters and concepts of the novels. Canon status The Dune Encyclopedia was published by Berkley Books, an imprint of Putnam, the publisher of all of Frank Herbert's Dune novels; the cover called the work \\"complete\\" and \\"authorized.\\" Additionally, Frank Herbert approved the book, considering it \\"amusing\\" and \\"fascinating.\\" The Encyclopedia was compiled and published some time between God Emperor of Dune (1981) and Heretics of Dune (1984), and Herbert \\"read large portions of God Emperor of Dune, then in the final stages, to McNelly during the compiling of the volume so that McNelly could keep abreast of developments.\\" However, Herbert did not hesitate to render it erroneous through later developments in his Dune series. Herbert himself wrote the foreword for the Encyclopedia (dated November 1983), which noted: The nature of The Dune Encyclopedia makes its canonical status somewhat unusual; the book is written as an encyclopedia published within the Dune universe itself, edited by \\"Hadi Benotto,\\" a fictional archaeologist mentioned by Frank Herbert in his novels God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune. Rather than claiming to contain absolute fact about this universe, the Introduction by Benotto notes that \\"Readers of The Dune Encyclopedia should understand its limitations: it is not designed as a definitive study of the entire eras encompassed by the Atreides Imperium\\" and that a portion of the (fictional) source material is shaped by the interests and influences of the God Emperor Leto II. In that much of the information (such as the biographical or historical) may then be seen as a possible later interpretation by \\"historians,\\" within the Dune universe, The Dune Encyclopedia could conceivably be held canon while agreeing that some of its information directly contradicts Herbert's works. In 1999, McNelly stated that he had proposed to Frank Herbert that they collaborate on a Dune prequel novel, expanding upon the Butlerian Jihad story presented in The Dune Encyclopedia. He noted, \\"FH and I had discussed writing it together and he agreed with my general plot outline, completed first chapter, and so on but his untimely death prevented us from continuing.\\" Many of the ideas in The Dune Encyclopedia were contradicted in the later Dune prequel series of novels (1999‚Äìpresent) written after Frank Herbert's death by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, as well as their sequel novels Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), which complete the original series. Brian Herbert and Anderson have stated repeatedly that in writing the sequel and prequel novels, they used Frank Herbert's own notes found after his death. In response to questions over why the new post-Frank Herbert Dune novels conflicted with The Dune Encyclopedia, the book was declared non-canon on the official Dune website in a letter credited to McNelly, Brian Herbert, and Anderson: Selected content The Dune Encyclopedia is written in the form of an encyclopedia within the fictional Dune universe, often citing fictional written works. No reference is made to which information is taken directly from the works of Frank Herbert himself, and which has been invented. The Encyclopedia presents extensive, alternate biographies for key characters not developed in Frank Herbert's original series, including Princess Irulan, Count Fenring, and Margot, Lady Fenring, Anirul, and Reverend Mother Mohiam. In the case of Mohiam, the Encyclopedia makes the controversial claim that she is secretly the mother of Lady Jessica. This was later rendered canon in the Prelude to Dune series; according to authors Brian Herbert and Anderson, this fact was pulled directly from Frank Herbert's working notes for the original Dune series. In the Encyclopedia, the Butlerian Jihad is attributed to Jehanne Butler, a Bene Gesserit whose developing fetus is therapeutically aborted due to apparent birth defects. She soon discovers that her child had in fact been healthy, but that the hospital director, the first self-programming computer on the planet, had been secretly carrying out a policy of unjustified abortions. This triggers further investigation into the extent to which such machines had been controlling society and altering the emotional and intellectual characteristics of planetary populations over a course of centuries. A religious backlash incites a formal jihad. In the Legends of Dune prequel series (2002-2004), the Jihad is ignited by the murder of Manion Butler, the young son of public figure Serena Butler, by the independent robot Erasmus. Similarly, the Encyclopedia credits the discovery of the Holtzman effect to Ibrahim Vaughn Holtzman, a genius whose brain had been transplanted into a machine; Legends of Dune chronicles the development of the effect's applications after its discovery by Tio Holtzman. Included in the Encyclopedia is an invented list of Great Houses supposedly in existence at the beginning of Paul Atreides' reign as Emperor; the list includes House Ordos, a House which does not appear in any canon Dune work but was later used by Westwood Studios for their Dune video games. The Encyclopedia also invents a list of all Emperors of the Known Universe back to the creation of the Empire.

It is part of the infraclass Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, and kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich, the common ostrich and the Somali ostrich. History The genus Struthio was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus was used by Linnaeus and other early taxonomists to include the emu, rhea and cassowary, until they each were placed in their own genera. The Somali ostrich (Struthio molybdophanes) has recently become recognized as a separate species by most authorities, while others are still reviewing the evidence.Gil, F. & Donsker D. (2012)Birdlife International (2012) Evolution Struthio camelus egg - MHNT The earliest fossils of ostrich-like birds are Paleocene taxa from Europe. Palaeotis and Remiornis from the Middle Eocene and unspecified ratite remains are known from the Eocene and Oligocene of Europe and Africa. These may have been early relatives of the ostriches, but their status is questionable, and they may in fact represent multiple lineages of flightless paleognaths.Agnolin et al, Unexpected diversity of ratites (Aves, Palaeognathae) in the early Cenozoic of South America: palaeobiogeographical implications. Alcheringa An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology ¬∑ July 2016 DOI: 10.1080/03115518.2016.1184898 The earliest fossils from this genus are from the early Miocene (20‚Äì25 mya), and are from Africa, so it is proposed that they originated there. Then by the middle to late Miocene (5‚Äì13 mya) they had spread to Eurasia.Hou, L. et al. (2005) By about 12 mya they had evolved into the larger size of which we are familiar. By this time they had spread to Mongolia and later southern Africa.Davies, S.J.J.F. (2003) While the relationship of the African fossil species is comparatively straightforward, many Asian species of ostrich have been described from fragmentary remains, and their interrelationships and how they relate to the African ostriches are confusing. In China, ostriches are known to have become extinct only around or even after the end of the last ice age; images of ostriches have been found there on prehistoric pottery and petroglyphs.Doar, B.G. (2007) \\"Genitalia, Totems and Painted Pottery: New Ceramic Discoveries in Gansu and Surrounding Areas\\". China Heritage Quarterly Struthio ostriches once co-existed with another lineage of flightless didactyl birds, the eogruids. Though Olson 1985 classified these birds as stem- ostriches, they are otherwise universally considered to be related to cranes, any similarities being the result of convergent evolution. Competition from ostriches has been suggested to have caused the extinction of the eogruids, though this has never been tested and both groups do co-exist in some sites.  Distribution and habitat  A male Somali ostrich in a Kenyan savanna, showing its blueish neck Ostrich with eggs Today ostriches are only found natively in the wild in Africa, where they occur in a range of open arid and semi-arid habitats such as savannas and the Sahel, both north and south of the equatorial forest zone. The Somali ostrich occurs in the Horn of Africa, having evolved isolated from the common ostrich by the geographic barrier of the East African Rift. In some areas, the common ostrich's Masai subspecies occurs alongside the Somali ostrich, but they are kept from interbreeding by behavioral and ecological differences. The Arabian ostriches in Asia Minor and Arabia were hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th century, and in Israel attempts to introduce North African ostriches to fill their ecological role have failed. Escaped common ostriches in Australia have established feral populations.Ostriches in Australia ‚Äì and near my home. trevorsbirding.com (13 September 2007) Species There are nine known species in this genus, of which seven are extinct.

Henceforth the place was referred to as Dun Mor, the Great Fort. Fish was an important part of the people's diet, and for hundreds of years a fishing community lived here. In 1640, Lord Power of Curraghmore, who owned a large amount of property in the area, built a castle on the cliff overlooking the strand about two hundred metres from St. Andrew's Church. The castle was falling into ruin by the middle of the next century and now just one tower remains. The old church of Killea (Cill Aodha ‚Äî Aodh's Church, Aodh is Irish for Hugh) is thought to have been built in the twelfth century and one wall still stands, opposite the Roman Catholic church of The Holy Cross, at the top of Killea hill. In Smith's history of Waterford, the village was mentioned as being a fishing port about the year 1745.Charles Smith,Smiths History of Waterford, 1746 The fishermen's homes were situated in the Lower Village near the Strand Inn and boats were launched from the slip at Lawlor's Beach before the harbour was built.

She donated the land for the building and established a deed of trust to build and maintain the Hall. On her specific instructions, no alcohol could be sold or consumed in the Hall. In addition, a fire was to be kept lit to warm and dry any of the fishermen who arrived to read the newspapers which were replenished daily in the reading room which is the present-day Library.Maria Walsh Dunmore East, a living history. 2018 Sport Dunmore East is home to many sporting clubs from sailing to Gaelic Football. Gaultier GAA which focuses primarily on Gaelic Football is located just outside the village, across the road from Dunmore FC soccer club. Gaultier GAA was founded in 1927 and compete in the Waterford Senior Football Championship as well as catering for over 100 juvenile members. Dunmore FC was founded in the 1970s initially before being re-established in the early to mid-2000s. The sailing club was founded in 1934. Harbour Low tide at Lawlor's Beach in the Lower Village The harbour is one of the five designated National Fishery Harbours, and has the second highest figure for fish landings after Killybegs. In the summer months it is popular with visiting yachts which have a designated pontoon. A plan was developed in 2005 by Waterford County Council to expand the harbour to accommodate more recreational marine activities. However that plan appears to have been shelved due to lack of funding. The first official woman crew member in a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Lifeboat was based at Dunmore East. Tourism Tourism in Dunmore East is supported by boating and sailing facilities, holiday homes, traditional pubs, a golf course and several hotels. The village is home to the Waterford Harbour Sailing Club with dinghy and keelboat sailing and the Dunmore East Adventure Centre. The local golf course is located on the cliff top overlooking the bay. Sea angling and Diving is catered for by Dunmore East Angling Charters. Dunmore East has several seafood restaurants, and there are a number of hotels in Dunmore: The Strand InnMaria Walsh Dunmore East, a living history. 2018 and The Haven Hotel, a historic former Malcomson home and the Ocean HotelMaria Walsh Dunmore East, a living history. 2018. There are also caravan sites catering for motorhomes and touring caravans. Among the events held in Dunmore East is the annual bluegrass festival which takes place at the end of August. During this festival the village hosts a number of bluegrass groups over the weekend during which almost every bar becomes a music venue from 3 pm until late in the evening. Tourist walking routes have been recently opened at Dunmore East. Trails in the woods, which surround the village, consist of a series of marked paths of varying lengths. There is also a popular cliff path to Portally and on to Ballymacaw which is about 7 km in total length. This includes what may be Ireland's longest sea cave at Rathmoylan. This path starts from the car park at the Shanoon. Waterford News and Star.

It was licensed by major foundries such as Agfa-Compugraphic, Autologic, Berthold, ITC International Typeface Corporation, Letraset, Linotype, Monotype, Stempel, and others. Its \\"IK\\" format was convertible into diverse vendor representations, including Type3 and Type1 PostScript formats as well as the TrueType format by Apple and Microsoft. Ikarus uses a spline model of the outline shape of each character within a typeface to give a fully scalable representation. The curve segments are essentially circle arcs, with tangent continuity maintained at joins. It is a very simple format to mark up manually. Being a vector/curve based format, any rendering resolution can be attained (by rasterisation) with equal accuracy from one relatively small set of data. The Ikarus coordinates for a shape all fall on the outline of that shape (as opposed to B√©zier curves where 'control' points can be inside or outside the outline). The functionality of Ikarus can be expanded using plug-ins. History Originally invented by URW employee Dr Peter Karow, Ikarus (German spelling of the mythical figure Icarus) got its name from the frequency with which it crashed in the early days of its development. It was designed to run on minicomputers such as DEC VAX and later adapted to microcomputers as they became increasingly powerful. In 1975, IKARUS was introduced at ATypI in Warsaw. By the 1980s a huge library of typefaces and logos existed as photographic film and needed to be input into computers for the latest generation of printing and sign-making devices. Unfortunately, normal scanning gives a rasterized shape at the resolution of the scanning device which leads to degradation of quality when scaling up and down. This is a particular concern in the sign making industry where individual letters may be metres across, many times the size of the original artwork. Ikarus enables a human operator to input the features of a complex shape with curves, corners and straight lines (e.g. a letter of the alphabet) to a computer which stores it as a mathematical representation, for all intents and purposes independent of the size of the original artwork and of the final output. A version of Ikarus tailored for signmaking applications was released by URW as \\"Signus\\". The advent of desktop publishing in the 1980s using Apple Macintosh computers coupled with laser printers led to a shift away from a small number of specialized print bureaux acquiring relatively expensive fonts to a growing market for cheap mass- produced fonts. The drawback of Ikarus for catering for this new market was that, while extremely accurate, it was very labour-intensive. After Adobe Systems started licensing BuildFont, its technology for converting existing digital typeface data into PostScript font format, Ikarus gradually lost its leading position. Ikarus is being further developed by URW++ and DTL, Dutch Type Library, ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Digitizing The first stage of digitization of a typeface is to prepare the artwork by marking up. This involves putting tick marks around any curves at approximately 30 degree intervals along with extra tangent points where a curve blends onto a straight line. Some form of accurate graphics tablet is then used to input three types of points: curve points, corner points and tangent points. Any irregularities (e.g. lumps and flat spots) are then edited out by adjusting the position of the points on the computer. The human eye is extremely sensitive to spotting irregularities on smooth outlines and typical adjustments are of the order of tenths of millimetres on a character one hundred millimetres high. As the computer screen displays a rasterized image at relatively low resolution, high quality print outs (traditionally bromides) or cuts in film (Ulano) are used to proof the digitized shapes. Relationship with DTL FontMaster The DTL FontMaster core is based on Ikarus. Furthermore, URW is also the exclusive Germany distributor for Dutch Type Library, DTL FontMaster's developer. DTL FontMaster Utilities are also developed by URW with DTL's president and founder Frank Blokland.

The first presentation of the award was in June 1970. The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is the highest personal ribbon award of the United States Air Force. Criteria The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is awarded to any enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force who is nominated by their Major Command, Field Operating Agency, or Direct Reporting Unit for competition in the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Program. The Outstanding Airman of the Year program recognizes 12 enlisted members from a cross section of Air Force Career fields. Nominated personnel compete in one of three categories Airman, Non-commissioned Officer, and Senior Non- commissioned Officer. Nominations are based only on the member's performance and achievement for the prior calendar year. Though only the prior year is used for nominations, nominees must pass a certain level of scrutiny for their total life and career since nominees are expected to be the most outstanding representatives of the Air Force enlisted force. Appearance Outstanding Airman Badge The Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon is light blue with a center stripe of white, flanked on either side by thin stripes of dark blue and red. Airmen selected as one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year are authorized to wear the Outstanding Airman badge for one year, and are awarded the ribbon with a bronze service star. All other nominated competitors are authorized to wear the ribbon without the service star.

Davalillo batted and threw left-handed. Davalillo was a leadoff hitter known for his speedy baserunning and capable defensive abilities. Later in his career, he became a valuable utility player and a record-setting pinch hitter. Davalillo also had an exceptional career in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he is the all-time leader in total base hits and career batting average. Minor League career Although many baseball references show Davalillo's birthplace as Cabimas, Venezuela, in 2006, he told a biographer that he was actually born in Churuguara, Falc√≥n. His family moved to Cabimas a few days after he was born where he grew up in the Costa Oriental region on Lake Maracaibo. His older brother, Pompeyo Davalillo played briefly for the Washington Senators in 1953. Davalillo began his professional baseball career as a pitcher when he signed a contract as an amateur free agent with the Cincinnati Reds in . He was sold to the Indians organisation in 1961 where he quickly moved up the ladder to their Triple-A club in Jacksonville. Davalillo won the first batting title in the Jacksonville Suns history with a .346 batting average in 1962. Major league career Davalillo became the eighth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball when he joined the Indians in 1963 as their leadoff hitter and center fielder. By mid-June, he was hitting for a .304 batting average and was receiving consideration for the American League Rookie of the Year Award when, he was hit by a pitch by Hank Aguirre and suffered a broken wrist. He returned from the injury to lead the Indians in hitting with a .292 along with a career-high 7 home runs in 90 games however, after the injury, he was never the same hitter against left handed pitching. In October, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team. The following season, Davalillo finished second in the league in fielding percentage among center fielders and was named as a recipient of the American League Gold Glove Award. He was the first left-handed throwing outfielder to win a Gold Glove. In 1965, Davalillo led the league in batting at mid-season with a .345 batting average, earning him a place as the starting center fielder for the American League team in the 1965 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .301 batting average, third- best in the American League behind Tony Oliva and Carl Yastrzemski, the only other players to break the .300 mark that year. Davalillo had an off year in 1966, and the Indians began to use him in a platoon role, playing him when they faced right-handed pitchers. In 1967, he hit for a .302 average against right-handed pitchers but, only managed a .188 average against left handers, for a .287 average overall. Davalillo had dipped to a .239 average on June 15, 1968 when, the Indians traded him to the California Angels for former All-Star Jimmie Hall. He rebounded to lead the Angels with a .298 batting average after the trade, finishing the season with a .277 average overall, the sixth highest average in the American League. In an era dominated by pitching, Yastrzemski was the only player in the American League to hit for an average higher than .300 in . In January , Davalillo suffered a nervous breakdown while he was in Venezuela to play in the Venezuelan Winter League. He began the 1969 season hitting for only a .155 average in 33 games and on May 30, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Jim Hicks. In his first National League at bat on June 1, 1969, Davalillo hit a three-run home run. He also made two appearances as a relief pitcher for the Cardinals in 1969 but failed to retire any batters. He is one of 14 pitchers in Major League history to have posted an infinite ERA, and the only one to have pitched in more than one game. Davalillo became a utility player and highly effective pinch hitter with the Cardinals in 1970. His 24 pinch hits in broke the National League single- season record for pinch hits at the time, and tied the Major League record set by Dave Philley in . One of the previous National League record holders was also his manager in 1970: Red Schoendienst. Davalillo ended the season with a .311 average and 33 runs batted in. The Cardinals traded Davalillo along with Nelson Briles to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Matty Alou and George Brunet in January . He continued in his role as a utility player, facing mostly right- handed pitchers and playing all three outfield positions and as a first baseman. Davalillo ended the year with a .285 batting average, helping the Pirates clinch the National League Eastern Division title. The Pirates went on to defeat the San Francisco Giants in the 1971 National League Championship Series before winning the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. In 1972, he continued to be a valuable role player, hitting for a career-high .318 batting average in 117 games, helping the Pirates win the Eastern Division pennant, before they lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1972 National League Championship Series. In July 1973, the Pirates sold Davalillo to the Oakland Athletics who were in the midst of a pennant race with the Kansas City Royals. The Athletics eventually won the American League West Division and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the 1973 American League Championship Series. Davalillo had 5 hits in 8 at-bats for a .625 batting average during the championship series, including a crucial RBI triple in the deciding Game 5. The Athletics then went on to defeat the New York Mets in the 1973 World Series. After appearing in 17 games for the Athletics in the 1974 season, Davalillo was released on May 30. Afterwards, Davalillo played three seasons in the Mexican League where, he was a lifetime .300 hitter. Davalillo was the league's top hitter with a .384 batting average in , when he was called up by the Los Angeles Dodgers in August. As a pinch hitter and a defensive substitute, he posted a .313 batting average in 24 games for the Dodgers in 1977, helping them win the National League West Division crown. Davalillo is remembered for his clutch, pinch hit performance against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 3 of the 1977 National League Championship Series. Trailing the Phillies 5‚Äì3 with 2 outs in the 9th inning, he spearheaded a 3-run rally, when he surprised the Phillies by executing a two-strike drag bunt and beating the throw to first base. Manny Mota drove Davalillo home with a double, then scored on a single by Davey Lopes to tie the game. The Dodgers eventually won the game and went on to win Game 4 to clinch the National League championship. In the 1977 World Series against the New York Yankees, Davalillo made three pinch hit appearances, driving home one run with a single as the Dodgers lost the series in six games. At the age of 41 in 1978, Davalillo hit for a .312 average as a pinch hitter for the Dodgers as they once again claimed the National League pennant before, losing to the New York Yankees for a second consecutive year in the 1978 World Series. Davalillo finished out his major league career as a utility player and pinch hitter for the Dodgers. For the last four seasons of his career, he was the oldest player in the National League until retiring at the end of the 1980 season at the age of 43. Davalillo returned to play in the Mexican League well into his late 40s. Career statistics In a sixteen-year major league career, Davalillo played in 1,458 games, accumulating 1,122 hits in 4,017 at bats for a .279 career batting average along with 36 home runs, 329 runs batted in, a .315 on-base percentage, 509 runs, 160 doubles, 37 triples, and 125 stolen bases. He finished his career at center field with a .988 fielding percentage, ranking him 61st among major league center fielders since . Davalillo's record for pinch hits in a season was broken in by Jos√© Morales. He was a fan favorite during his years with the Indians, and became a valuable role player later in his career. Davalillo played in four World Series and was the first major league player to play for three different teams in the League Championship Series (Pittsburgh Pirates in -, Oakland Athletics in and the Los Angeles Dodgers in ). Winter League career Between 1957 and 1987, Davalillo played in the Venezuelan Winter League for the Leones del Caracas (1957‚Äì74, 1987), Portuguesa (1975) and the Tigres de Aragua (1976‚Äì85). He set lifetime league records that still stand in batting average (.325), hits (1,505), games played (1,280), at-bats (4,633), runs (668), doubles (196), runs batted in (483) and career seasons (30).Baseball with a Latin beat: a history of the Latin American game By Peter C. Bjarkman, McFarland, 1994 Beside this, he won four batting titles and set record in hits (100) in a season. Davalillo retired at 48 years of age after appearing in the 1987 Caribbean Series. Honors In 1987, the ballpark in Cabimas, Zulia, was renamed Estadio V√≠ctor Davalillo. The Most Valuable Player award in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League is also named after him.

Location Lismore is located in the west of County Waterford, where the N72 road crosses the River Blackwater at the foot of the Knockmealdown Mountains (Irish: Sl√©ibhte Chnoc Mhaoldomhnaigh), the mountain range which divides the counties of Tipperary and Waterford. Demographics As of the 2016 census, Lismore had a population of 1,374 of which 86% was white Irish, less than 1% white Irish traveller, 9% other white ethnicities, less than 1% black, less than 1% Asian, with 3% not stating their ethnicity. In terms of religion the town is 81% Catholic, 8% other stated religion, 8% with no religion, and 3% not stated. Transport =Bus transport= Since December 2015 significant improvements to the frequency of the Local Link (formerly known as D√©ise Link) bus service are in effect. A bus shelter has also been provided in the town. There are now four services a day each way Mondays to Saturdays inclusive to Dungarvan via Cappoquin including a commuter service. Connections to Waterford and Rosslare Europort can be made at Dungarvan. In the other direction there are four services to and from Tallow where connections can be made for Fermoy. On Saturdays a local bus company operate a service to Cork. On Sundays Bus √âireann route 366 links Lismore to Dungarvan and Waterford. This route only operates on Sundays and comprises a single journey in one direction (no return service on any day of the week). =Rail= Lismore formerly had a rail station on the now dismantled Waterford to Mallow line and was served by the Cork to Rosslare boat train. The line and station closed in 1967 though the station is still extant. History Founded by Saint Mochuda (Irish: Mo Chutu mac F√≠naill), died 637, also known as Saint Carthage (Carthach or Carthach the Younger; Latinised: Carthagus, Anglicised: Carthage), first abbot of Lismore (Irish: Les M√≥r Mo Chutu). The town is renowned for its early ecclesiastical history and the scholarship of Lismore Abbey. The imposing Lismore Castle, situated on the site of the old monastery since medieval times, lies on a steep hill overlooking the town and the Blackwater valley. It can trace an eight-hundred-year-old history linking the varied historic relations between England and Ireland. Originally built following the arrival of Henry II's son, Prince John, in the twelfth century, the castle was a bishop's palace up to the sixteenth century. Subsequently owned by Sir Walter Raleigh until his demise, it was sold to Richard Boyle, controversial First Earl of Cork, described by historian R. F. Foster, in his Modern Ireland, as an \\"epitome of Elizabethan adventurer-colonist in Ireland\\". In 1627 the castle was the birthplace of the First Earl's most famous son, Robert Boyle (of Boyle's Law), known as the \\"Father of Modern Chemistry\\". Boyle was chased off his lands in Ireland during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, following which his sons recovered the family estates after suppression of the rebellion. The castle remained in the possession of the Boyle family until it passed to the English Dukes of Devonshire in 1753 when the daughter of the 4th Earl of Cork, Lady Charlotte Boyle, married the Marquess of Hartington, who later succeeded as, in 1755, The 4th Duke of Devonshire, a future Prime Minister of Great Britain and First Lord of the Treasury. The Book of Lismore (original name: Leabhar Mhic C√°rthaigh Riabhaigh, meaning The Book of Mac C√°rthaigh Riabhach), a compilation of medieval Irish manuscripts mainly relating the lives of Irish saints, notably St Brigid, St Patrick, and St Columba, also contains Acallam na Sen√≥rach, a most important Middle Irish narrative dating to the 12th century, pertaining to the Fenian Cycle. The Book of Lismore and the Lismore Crozier (an enclosure for an episcopal staff, believed to be the venerable oaken staff of the founder of the abbey), were discovered together in 1814 behind a blocked-up doorway in Lismore Castle. Today, the castle continues in the private ownership of the Dukes of Devonshire who open the gardens and parts of the grounds for public access via a changing programme of local arts and education events. The Book of Lismore is on display at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, Great Britain, and the Lismore Crozier is in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. The medieval Lismore Cathedral, dedicated to St Carthage, variously damaged and repaired over the centuries, is notable for its architecture and the stained glass window by the English pre Raphaelite artist, Edward Burne-Jones. A plaque has been erected in the town to commemorate the regular visits made to Lismore by Fred Astaire following an association developed by his sister, Adele Astaire, who was married to Lord Charles Arthur Francis Cavendish, son of The 9th Duke of Devonshire. A notable resident born in the town who has described her early life in Lismore, is the internationally renowned travel writer and world touring cyclist, Dervla Murphy. Another notable resident was George O'Brien, award-winning Irish memoirist, writer, and academic, who was raised by his paternal grandmother in Lismore, described in his memoir The Village of Longing: An Irish Boyhood in the Fifties (1987).

It is believed to be the oldest Christian settlement in Ireland. Saint Declan lived in the region at some time in the period 350‚Äì450 AD and Christianised the area before the coming of Saint Patrick. In September 2014, Ardmore was included on a shortlist of Ireland's top tourist towns composed by F√°ilte Ireland. It is home to Ireland's only hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant: The House at the Cliff House Hotel. History =Ecclesiastical history= Ardmore Tower Interior of Ardmore Cathedral Ogham stone I in the cathedral At the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111, recognition was given to the Diocese of Ardmore, reputedly founded by Saint Declan, one of the Munster saints said to have preceded Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity to Ireland. He was regarded as a patron saint of the D√©isi of East Munster.Johnston, Elva (2004). \\"Munster, saints of (act. c.450‚Äìc.700).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, Sept 2004. Accessed: July 2014. A bishop of Ardmore swore fealty to Henry II of England at Cashel, as a suffragan of its archbishop, in 1171. The last reference to an independent bishop of Ardmore dates to 1210, when Innocent III listed it as one of Cashel's eleven suffragan dioceses.Aubrey Gwynn and R. N. Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses: Ireland: with an Appendix to early Sites (Longmans, 1970), p. 62. No longer a residential bishopric, √Ård M√≥r is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 838 The parish, now called that of Ardmore and Grange, is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore. St. Paul's, an old Church of Ireland church in the village, is part of the parish of Youghal. =Ecclesiastical ruins= Old Cathedral Stone carvings at St Declan's Church On a hill above the village is a well-preserved 30-m-high, 12th-century round tower and the ruins of a cathedral dating from the 12th and 13th centuriesJ.

One of the outer walls of the cathedral features some stone carvings retrieved from an earlier 9th-century building. The carvings include a very early image of a harp, images of Adam and Eve in the garden and a representation of \\"Solomon's judgement\\". The cathedral also contains two Ogham stones, which rest in small alcoves. Some elements of the original structure can still be seen within the building. The present Church of Ireland church is close to this complex. =Maritime history= Within the last few decades, Ardmore has lost its status as a fishing village as fishing laws became more restrictive and the traditional way of life was given little consideration by the EU and national lawmakers. Vital harbour development remains unfunded and larger fishing vessels are unable to utilise the present docking facilities due to a lack of water depth. However, a small number of fishermen maintain some of the old fishing practices as they continue to fish from Ardmore. The Samson, a crane ship, was wrecked on Ram Head, near the village, during a December storm in 1987 as it was being towed from Liverpool to Malta. Its wreck is now a popular diving spot. There are many other older wrecks in the bay area including the Marechal de Noailles, Bandon, Peri, Scotland, Sextusa and Peg Tranton, and more recently Anne Sophie and Fee des Ondes. The remaining keel of the latter wreck may still be seen at low tide on the main beach. Features The Ardmore Peninsula The village includes two hotels, a number of pubs and restaurants, a seasonal petrol station, a pier and slipway, and one store. There are also one or two sports clubs and a primary school. It boasts a mile-long beach, commonly termed the Main Beach, and several other beaches, such as Goat Island, Ballyquin, the Curragh, and Whiting Bay. Ardmore is a popular seaside resort, but has had difficulty maintaining its Blue Flag beach status due to an outdated sewage system (early works on updating the system commenced 2006) and modern farming practices which result in run-off from fields and subsequently into the bay, especially at the village end of the beach. Paradoxically, the absence of an adequate modern sewerage system has slowed down the pace of housing development in Ardmore compared with some other seaside villages in the southeast thus preserving much of its charm. In 2006 a new hotel opened, replacing the older Cliff Hotel. In 1992 this village was the overall winner of the Irish Tidy Towns Competition. There is a cliff path beginning near the Cliff House Hotel and ending back in the main street. The walk, which has marker posts erected along the route, passes an old remodelled Coastguard Station, St Declan's Cell and Holy Well, a ruined church, the wreck of the Samson, an abandoned coast guard lookout from 1939/45 and another, much older, lookout tower. Further along there is another well with stone canopy, known as Fr. O'Donnells Well. The monastic complex is atop the hill above the village. Transport Ardmore is served on a daily basis by Bus √âireann route 260 which links it to, inter alia, Youghal, Midleton and Cork city. Until 2010 it was also served by route 362 which linked it to Waterford via Dungarvan. People *The novelist Molly Keane lived in Ardmore for many years and was buried there after her death in 1996.

The epidural route is used by physicians and nurse anesthetists to administer local anesthetic agents, analgesics, diagnostic medicines such as radiocontrast agents, and other medicines such as glucocorticoids. Epidural administration is often accomplished through use of a catheter placed into the epidural space. The technique of epidural administration was first described in 1921 by Spanish military surgeon Fidel Pag√©s. Epidural analgesia causes a loss of sensation, including pain, by blocking the transmission of signals through nerve fibres in or near the spinal cord. For this reason, epidurals are commonly used for pain control during childbirth and surgery. The technique is considered safe and effective for these purposes. When used during childbirth, there is no difference in adverse effects between earlier or later administration. An epidural injection may also be used to administer steroids for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the spinal cord. An epidural is a complex procedure which must be administered by a trained person. It should not be used in some people with severe bleeding disorders or infections near the injection site. Complications of epidural injections include problems resulting from improper administration, as well as side effects of the medicines administered. Side effects and complications of epidurals depend on the specific medication and dose being administered. Severe complications from epidural injections are rare. The most common complications of epidural injections include bleeding problems, headaches, and inadequate pain control. Epidural analgesia during childbirth may also impact the mother's ability to move during labor. Very large doses of anesthetics or analgesics may result in respiratory depression. An epidural injection may be administered at any point of the spine - the specific administration site determines the specific nerves affected, and thus the area of the body from which pain will be blocked. There are multiple techniques to ensure proper placement and use of an epidural catheter. An epidural catheter may remain inserted for several days, but is usually removed when oral therapy becomes a viable alternative.  Uses  = Pain relief during childbirth = Epidural injections are commonly used to provide pain relief (analgesia) during childbirth. This usually involves epidural injection of opioids, commonly called an \\"epidural\\". This is more effective than oral or IV opioids and other common modalities of analgesia in childbirth. After an epidural is administered, a woman may not feel pain, but may still feel pressure. An epidural increases the ability of a woman to push with her contractions. Epidural clonidine is rarely used but has been extensively studied for management of analgesia during labor. Epidural analgesia is considered a safer and more effective method of relieving pain in labor as compared to intravenous or oral analgesia. In a 2018 Cochrane review which included 52 randomized controlled studies involving more than 11,000 women, where most studies compared epidural analgesia with opiates, some advantages of epidural analgesia included better efficacy, fewer instances of naloxone use in newborns, and decreased risk of maternal hyperventilation. Some disadvantages of epidurals included an increase in the number of Caesarian sections required due to fetal distress, a longer labor, increased need for oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions, an increased risk of hypotension and muscle weakness, as well as fever. However, the review found no difference in overall Caesarean delivery rates, and no evidence of negative effects to the baby soon after birth. Furthermore, the occurrence of long-term backache was unchanged after epidural use. Complications of epidural analgesia are rare, but may include headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing and seizures for the mother. The child may experience a slow heartbeat, decreased ability to regulate temperature, and potential exposure to the drugs administered to the mother. There is no overall difference in outcomes based on the time the epidural is administered to the mother, specifically no change in the rate of caesarean section, instrumental birth, and duration of labor. There is also no change in the Apgar score of the newborn, nor the cord blood pH, between early and late epidural administration. Epidurals other than low-dose ambulatory epidurals also impact the ability of the mother to move during labor. Movement such as walking or changing positions may help improve labor comfort and decrease the risk of complications. = Pain relief during other surgery = Epidural analgesia has been demonstrated to have several benefits after surgery, including decreasing the need for systemic opioid use, and reducing the risk of postoperative respiratory problems, chest infections, blood transfusion requirements, and myocardial infarctions. Use of epidural analgesia after surgery in place of systemic analgesia may also result in a reduced stress response, as well as improve motility of the intestines through blockade of the sympathetic nervous system. = Steroid injection = Epidural steroid injection may be used to treat nerve root pain, radicular pain and inflammation caused by such conditions as spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis. = Blood patch = An epidural blood patch may be used to treat Post-dural-puncture headache, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid due to dural puncture occurring in approximately 1.5% of epidural neuraxial procedures. A small amount of a person's own blood is injected into the epidural space, clotting and closing the site of puncture. Another theory proposes that the injection of blood counteracts the decrease in cerebrospinal fluid from the puncture.  Contraindications  The use of epidural analgesia and anesthetic is considered safe and effective in most situations. Epidural analgesia is contraindicated when an experienced person is not able to administer it, as well as in the case of infections such as cellulitis near the injection site and severe coagulopathy. In some cases, it may be contraindicated in people with low platelets, increased intracranial pressure, decreased cardiac output, and hypovolemia. Due to the risk of disease progression, it is also potentially contraindicated in people with preexisting progressive neurologic disease.  Risks and complications  In addition to blocking nerves which carry pain, local anesthetics may block other types of nerve. Depending on the drug and dose, the effects may last only a few minutes or up to several hours. Sensory nerve fibers are more sensitive to the effects of the local anesthetics than motor nerve fibers. As such, an epidural can provide pain control without as much of an effect on muscle strength. For example, a woman in labor with a continuous epidural may not have impairment to her ability to move. A larger dose administered is more likely to result in side effects. Very large doses of epidural anesthetic can cause paralysis of the intercostal muscles and thoracic diaphragm, responsible for breathing. It may also result in loss of sympathetic nerve input to the heart, which may cause a significant decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. If bupivacaine, commonly used for epidural pain control, is inadvertently administered into a vein, it can cause excitation, nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, or seizures as well as central nervous system depression, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. Bupivacaine has been implicated in cardiac arrests resulting in death when accidentally administered into a vein instead of the epidural space. Large doses of epidural opioids may cause itching and respiratory depression. The sensation of needing to urinate is often significantly diminished or completely absent after administration of epidural local anesthetics or opioids. Because of this, a urinary catheter is often placed for the duration of the epidural infusion. People with continuous epidural infusions of local anesthetic solutions typically ambulate only with assistance, if at all, in order to reduce the likelihood of injury due to a fall. A potential complication of epidural analgesia is the failure to achieve adequate pain control. This can be caused by obesity, multiple prior births, history of opiate use, or cervical dilation of more than 7 cm at the time of administration. If the dura is accidentally punctured, it may cause cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the epirudal space, causing a post dural puncture headache. This occurs in approximately 1 in 100 epidural procedures. Such a headache may be severe and last several days, and rarely weeks or months, and is caused by a reduction in CSF pressure. It is made worse when a person raises their head above a lying position. Mild post dural puncture headaches may be treated with caffeine and gabapentin, or if severe with an epidural blood patch. This consists of a small amount of a person's own blood administered into the epidural space to clot and seal the leak. Most cases resolve spontaneously with time. Less common but more severe complications include subdural hematoma and cerebral venous thrombosis. In many women given epidural analgesia during labor oxytocin is also used to augment uterine contractions. In one study which examined the rate of breastfeeding two days following epidural anesthesia during childbirth, epidural analgesia used in combination with oxytocin resulted in lower maternal oxytocin and prolactin levels in response to breastfeeding on the second day following birth. This results in a decrease in the amount of milk produced. Epidural administrations can also cause bleeding issues, including \\"bloody tap\\", which occurs in approximately 1 in 30‚Äì50 people. This occurs when epidural veins are inadvertently punctured with the needle during the insertion. It is a common occurrence and is not usually considered a problem in people who have normal blood clotting. Permanent neurological problems from bloody tap are extremely rare, estimated at less than 0.07% of occurrences. However, people who have a coagulopathy may have a risk of epidural hematoma. People with thrombocytopenia might also suffer from a bleed. A Cochrane review was conducted by comparing retrospective trials in 2018 to determine the effect of platelet transfusions prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anesthesia for participants that suffer from thrombocytopenia. Evidence is unclear whether major surgery-related bleeding within 24 hours and the surgery-related complications up to 7 days after the procedure are affected by epidural use. The epidural catheter may also rarely be inadvertently placed in the subarachnoid space (less than 1 in 1000 people). If this occurs, cerebrospinal fluid can be freely aspirated from the catheter. This is used to detect such occurrence, and the catheter will be withdrawn and replaced elsewhere, though occasionally no fluid is aspirated despite a dural puncture. If dural puncture is not recognized, large doses of anesthetic may be delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. This may result in a high block, or, more rarely, a total spinal, where anesthetic is delivered directly to the brainstem, causing unconsciousness and sometimes seizures. Rare complications of epidural administration include formation of an epidural abscess (1 in 145,000) or epidural haematoma (1 in 168,000), neurological injury lasting longer than 1 year (1 in 240,000), paraplegia (1 in 250,000), and arachnoiditis, Rarely, an epidural may cause death (1 in 100,000).  Technique  Simulation of the insertion of an epidural needle between the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. A syringe is connected to the epidural needle and the epidural space is identified by a technique to assess loss of resistance Epidural anesthesia = Anatomy = Sagittal section of the spinal column (not drawn to scale). Yellow: spinal cord; blue: pia mater; red: arachnoid; light blue: subarachnoid space; pink: dura mater; pale green: epidural space; taupe: vertebral bones; teal: interspinous ligaments An epidural is injected into the epidural space, inside the bony spinal canal but just outside the dura mater (\\"dura\\"). In contact with the inner surface of the dura is another membrane called the arachnoid mater (\\"arachnoid\\"), which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In adults, the spinal cord terminates around the level of the disc between L1 and L2 (in neonates it extends to L3 but can reach as low as L4), below which lies a bundle of nerves known as the cauda equina (\\"horse's tail\\"). Hence, lumbar epidural injections carry a low risk of injuring the spinal cord. Insertion of an epidural needle involves threading a needle between the bones, through the ligaments and into the epidural potential space without puncturing the layer immediately below containing CSF under pressure. Spinal anaesthesia is a similar technique whereby a drug is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. = Insertion = The person receiving the epidural may be seated, or lay lateral or prone. The level of the spine at which the catheter is placed depends mainly on the site of intended operation or the origin of the pain. The iliac crest is a commonly used anatomical landmark for lumbar epidural injections, as this level roughly corresponds with the fourth lumbar vertebra, which is usually well below the termination of the spinal cord. The Tuohy needle, designed with a 90-degree curved tip and side hole to redirect the inserted catheter vertically along the axis of the spine, may be inserted in the midline, between the spinous processes. When using a paramedian approach, the tip of the needle passes along a shelf of vertebral bone called the lamina until just before reaching the ligamentum flavum and the epidural space. Along with a sudden loss of resistance to pressure on the plunger of the syringe, a slight clicking sensation may be felt by the operator as the tip of the needle breaches the ligamentum flavum and enters the epidural space. Saline or air may be used to identify placement in the epidural space. A systematic review from 2014 showed no difference in terms of safety or efficacy between the use of saline and air for this purpose. In addition to the loss of resistance technique, direct imaging of the placement may be used. This may be conducted with a portable ultrasound scanner or fluoroscopy (moving X-ray pictures). After placement of the tip of the needle, a catheter or small tube is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is then withdrawn over the catheter. The catheter is generally inserted 4‚Äì6 cm into the epidural space, and is typically secured to the skin with adhesive tape, similar to an intravenous line. Epidural administration is a procedure which requires the person performing the insertion to be technically proficient in order to avoid complications. Proficiency may be trained using bananas or other fruits as a model. = Medication administration = Epidural infusion pump with opioid (sufentanil) and anesthetic (bupivacaine) in a locked box An epidural for pain relief may be used to administer a local anesthetic, an opioid, or both. Common local anesthetics used include lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and chloroprocaine. Common opioids used include hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, and pethidine (meperidine). These are injected in smaller doses than required when administered intravenously. Other agents such as clonidine or ketamine are also sometimes administered through an epidural. If a short duration of action is desired, a single dose of medication called a \\"bolus\\" may be administered. Thereafter, a bolus may be repeated if necessary provided the catheter remains undisturbed. For a prolonged effect, a continuous infusion of medication may be administered. There is some evidence that an automated intermittent bolus technique may provide better pain control than a continuous infusion technique even when the total doses administered are identical. Typically, the effects of the epidural block are noted below a specific level or portion of the body, determined by the site of injection. A higher injection may result in sparing of nerve function in the lower spinal nerves. For example, a thoracic epidural performed for upper abdominal surgery may not have any effect on the area surrounding the genitals or pelvic organs. The intensity of the block is determined by the concentration of local anesthetic solution used. = Removal = The catheter is usually removed when it is possible to switch to oral administration. Catheters can safely remain in place for several days with little risk of bacterial infection, particularly if the skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine solution. Subcutaneously tunneled epidural catheters may be left in place for longer periods, with a low risk of infection or other complications.  History  Fidel Pag√©s visiting injured soldiers at the Docker Hospital in Melilla in 1909. The first record of an epidural injection is from 1885, when American neurologist James Corning of Acorn Hall in Morristown, NJ used the technique to perform a neuraxial blockade. Corning inadvertently injected 111 mg of cocaine into the epidural space of a healthy male volunteer, although at the time he believed he was injecting it into the subarachnoid space. Following this, in 1901 Fernand Cathelin first reported intentionally blocking the lowest sacral and coccygeal nerves through the epidural space by injecting local anesthetic through the sacral hiatus. The loss of resistance technique was first described by Achile Dogliotti in 1933, following which Alberto Guti√©rrez described the hanging drop technique. Both techniques are now used to identify when the needle has correctly been placed in the epidural space. In 1921 Fidel Pag√©s, a military surgeon from Spain, developed the technique of \\"single-shot\\" lumbar epidural anesthesia, which was later popularized by Italian surgeon Achille Mario Dogliotti. Later, in 1931 Eugen Aburel described using a continuous epidural catheter for pain relief during childbirth. In 1941, Robert Hingson and Waldo Edwards recorded the use of continuous caudal anesthesia using an indwelling needle, following which they described the use of a flexible catheter for continuous caudal anesthesia in a woman in labor in 1942. In 1947, Manuel Curbelo described placement of a lumbar epidural catheter, and in 1979, Behar reported the first use of an epidural to administer narcotics. Society and culture Some people have lasting concern, based on older observational studies, that women who have epidural analgesia during labor are more likely to require a cesarean delivery. However, evidence has shown that the use of epidural analgesia during labor does not have a significant effect on rates of cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review analysis of over 11,000 women confirmed there was no increase in the rate of Caesarean delivery when epidural analgesia was employed. Epidural analgesia does increase the duration of the second stage of labor by 15 to 30 minutes and may increase the rate of instrument-assisted vaginal deliveries as well as that of oxytocin administration.

An ATA is often built into a small enclosure with an internal or external power adapter, an Ethernet port, one or more foreign exchange station (FXS) telephone ports. Such devices may also have a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface for providing alternative access to traditional land line telephone service. The ATA provides dial tone, Ringing Generator, DC power, caller ID data and other standard telephone line signaling (known collectively as BORSCHT) to the telephone connected to a modular jack. The digital interface of the ATA typically consists of an Ethernet port to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) network, but may also be a USB port for connecting the device to a personal computer. Using such an ATA, it is possible to connect a conventional telephone to a remote VoIP server. The ATA communicates with the server using a protocol such as H.323, SIP, MGCP, SCCP or IAX, and encodes and decodes the voice signal using a voice codec such as G.711, G.729, GSM, iLBC or others. Since the ATA communicates directly with the VoIP server, it does not require a personal computer or any software such as a softphone.

The construction proceeds on the basis that the objects of D(A) should be chain complexes in A, with two such chain complexes considered isomorphic when there is a chain map that induces an isomorphism on the level of homology of the chain complexes. Derived functors can then be defined for chain complexes, refining the concept of hypercohomology. The definitions lead to a significant simplification of formulas otherwise described (not completely faithfully) by complicated spectral sequences. The development of the derived category, by Alexander Grothendieck and his student Jean-Louis Verdier shortly after 1960, now appears as one terminal point in the explosive development of homological algebra in the 1950s, a decade in which it had made remarkable strides. The basic theory of Verdier was written down in his dissertation, published finally in 1996 in Ast√©risque (a summary had earlier appeared in SGA 4¬Ω). The axiomatics required an innovation, the concept of triangulated category, and the construction is based on localization of a category, a generalization of localization of a ring. The original impulse to develop the \\"derived\\" formalism came from the need to find a suitable formulation of Grothendieck's coherent duality theory. Derived categories have since become indispensable also outside of algebraic geometry, for example in the formulation of the theory of D-modules and microlocal analysis. Recently derived categories have also become important in areas nearer to physics, such as D-branes and mirror symmetry. Motivations In coherent sheaf theory, pushing to the limit of what could be done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices. Despite the level of abstraction, derived categories became accepted over the following decades, especially as a convenient setting for sheaf cohomology. Perhaps the biggest advance was the formulation of the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence in dimensions greater than 1 in derived terms, around 1980. The Sato school adopted the language of derived categories, and the subsequent history of D-modules was of a theory expressed in those terms. A parallel development was the category of spectra in homotopy theory. The homotopy category of spectra and the derived category of a ring are both examples of triangulated categories.  Definition  Let A be an abelian category. (Some basic examples are the category of modules over a ring, or the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space.) We obtain the derived category D(A) in several steps: * The basic object is the category Kom(A) of chain complexes *: \\\\cdots \\\\to X^{-1} \\\\xrightarrow{d^{-1}} X^0 \\\\xrightarrow{d^0} X^1 \\\\xrightarrow{d^1} X^2 \\\\to \\\\cdots :in A. Its objects will be the objects of the derived category but its morphisms will be altered. * Pass to the homotopy category of chain complexes K(A) by identifying morphisms which are chain homotopic. * Pass to the derived category D(A) by localizing at the set of quasi-isomorphisms. Morphisms in the derived category may be explicitly described as roofs X ‚Üê X' ‚Üí Y, where X' ‚Üí X is a quasi-isomorphism and X' ‚Üí Y is any morphism of chain complexes. The second step may be bypassed since a homotopy equivalence is in particular a quasi-isomorphism. But then the simple roof definition of morphisms must be replaced by a more complicated one using finite strings of morphisms (technically, it is no longer a calculus of fractions). So the one-step construction is more efficient in a way, but more complicated. From the point of view of model categories, the derived category D(A) is the true 'homotopy category' of the category of complexes, whereas K(A) might be called the 'naive homotopy category'.  Derived Hom-Sets  As noted before, in the derived category the hom sets are expressed through roofs, or valleys X \\\\rightarrow Y' \\\\leftarrow Y, where Y \\\\to Y' is a quasi- isomorphism. To get a better picture of what elements look like, consider an exact sequence : 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}_n \\\\overset{\\\\phi_{n,n-1}}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\mathcal{E}_{n-1} \\\\overset{\\\\phi_{n-1,n-2}}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\cdots \\\\overset{\\\\phi_{1,0}}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\mathcal{E}_0 \\\\to 0 We can use this to construct a morphism \\\\phi: \\\\mathcal{E}_0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}_n[+(n-1)] by truncating the complex above, shifting it, and using the obvious morphisms above. In particular, we have the picture : \\\\begin{matrix} 0 &\\\\to& \\\\mathcal{E}_n &\\\\to & 0 & \\\\to & \\\\cdots & \\\\to & 0 & \\\\to & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\uparrow & & \\\\uparrow & & \\\\uparrow & & \\\\cdots & & \\\\uparrow & & \\\\uparrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\to& \\\\mathcal{E}_n& \\\\to &\\\\mathcal{E}_{n-1} & \\\\to & \\\\cdots & \\\\to &\\\\mathcal{E}_1 &\\\\to &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow& & \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow & & \\\\cdots & & \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\to & 0 & \\\\to & 0 & \\\\to & \\\\cdots & \\\\to & \\\\mathcal{E}_0 &\\\\to& 0 \\\\end{matrix} where the bottom complex has \\\\mathcal{E}_0 concentrated in degree 0, the only non-trivial upward arrow is the equality morphism, and the only-nontrivial downward arrow is \\\\phi_{1,0}:\\\\mathcal{E}_1 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}_0. This diagram of complexes defines a morphism : \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathbf{RHom}(\\\\mathcal{E}_0, \\\\mathcal{E}_n[+(n-1)]) in the derived category. One application of this observation is the construction of the Atiyah-class.  Remarks  For certain purposes (see below) one uses bounded-below (X^n = 0 for n \\\\ll 0), bounded-above (X^n = 0 for n \\\\gg 0) or bounded (X^n = 0 for |n\\\\gg 0) complexes instead of unbounded ones. The corresponding derived categories are usually denoted D+(A), D‚àí(A) and Db(A), respectively. If one adopts the classical point of view on categories, that there is a set of morphisms from one object to another (not just a class), then one has to give an additional argument to prove this. If, for example, the abelian category A is small, i.e. has only a set of objects, then this issue will be no problem. Also, if A is a Grothendieck abelian category, then the derived category D(A) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category K(A), and hence has only a set of morphisms from one object to another.M. Kashiwara and P. Schapira. Categories and Sheaves. Springer-Verlag (2006). Theorem 14.3.1. Grothendieck abelian categories include the category of modules over a ring, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and many other examples. Composition of morphisms, i.e. roofs, in the derived category is accomplished by finding a third roof on top of the two roofs to be composed. It may be checked that this is possible and gives a well-defined, associative composition. Since K(A) is a triangulated category, its localization D(A) is also triangulated. For an integer n and a complex X, defineS. Gelfand and Y. Manin. Methods of Homological Algebra. Springer-Verlag (2003). III.3.2. the complex X[n] to be X shifted down by n, so that :X[n]^{i} = X^{n+i}, with differential :d_{X[n]} = (-1)^n d_X. By definition, a distinguished triangle in D(A) is a triangle that is isomorphic in D(A) to the triangle X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Cone(f) ‚Üí X[1] for some map of complexes f: X ‚Üí Y. Here Cone(f) denotes the mapping cone of f. In particular, for a short exact sequence :0 \\\\rightarrow X \\\\rightarrow Y \\\\rightarrow Z \\\\rightarrow 0 in A, the triangle X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Z ‚Üí X[1] is distinguished in D(A). Verdier explained that the definition of the shift X[1] is forced by requiring X[1] to be the cone of the morphism X ‚Üí 0.J.-L. Verdier. Ast√©risque 239. Soc. Math. de France (1996). Appendice to Ch. 1. By viewing an object of A as a complex concentrated in degree zero, the derived category D(A) contains A as a full subcategory. Morphisms in the derived category include information about all Ext groups: for any objects X and Y in A and any integer j, :\\\\text{Hom}_{D(\\\\mathcal{A})}(X,Y[j]) = \\\\text{Ext}^j_{\\\\mathcal{A}}(X,Y).  Projective and injective resolutions  One can easily show that a homotopy equivalence is a quasi-isomorphism, so the second step in the above construction may be omitted. The definition is usually given in this way because it reveals the existence of a canonical functor :K(\\\\mathcal A) \\\\rightarrow D(\\\\mathcal A). In concrete situations, it is very difficult or impossible to handle morphisms in the derived category directly. Therefore, one looks for a more manageable category which is equivalent to the derived category. Classically, there are two (dual) approaches to this: projective and injective resolutions. In both cases, the restriction of the above canonical functor to an appropriate subcategory will be an equivalence of categories. In the following we will describe the role of injective resolutions in the context of the derived category, which is the basis for defining right derived functors, which in turn have important applications in cohomology of sheaves on topological spaces or more advanced cohomology theories like √©tale cohomology or group cohomology. In order to apply this technique, one has to assume that the abelian category in question has enough injectives, which means that every object X of the category admits a monomorphism to an injective object I. (Neither the map nor the injective object has to be uniquely specified.) For example, every Grothendieck abelian category has enough injectives. Embedding X into some injective object I0, the cokernel of this map into some injective I1 etc., one constructs an injective resolution of X, i.e. an exact (in general infinite) sequence :0 \\\\rightarrow X \\\\rightarrow I^0 \\\\rightarrow I^1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots, \\\\, where the I* are injective objects. This idea generalizes to give resolutions of bounded-below complexes X, i.e. Xn = 0 for sufficiently small n. As remarked above, injective resolutions are not uniquely defined, but it is a fact that any two resolutions are homotopy equivalent to each other, i.e. isomorphic in the homotopy category. Moreover, morphisms of complexes extend uniquely to a morphism of two given injective resolutions. This is the point where the homotopy category comes into play again: mapping an object X of A to (any) injective resolution I* of A extends to a functor :D^+(\\\\mathcal A) \\\\rightarrow K^+(\\\\mathrm{Inj}(\\\\mathcal A)) from the bounded below derived category to the bounded below homotopy category of complexes whose terms are injective objects in A. It is not difficult to see that this functor is actually inverse to the restriction of the canonical localization functor mentioned in the beginning. In other words, morphisms Hom(X,Y) in the derived category may be computed by resolving both X and Y and computing the morphisms in the homotopy category, which is at least theoretically easier. In fact, it is enough to resolve Y: for any complex X and any bounded below complex Y of injectives, :\\\\mathrm{Hom}_{D(A)}(X, Y) = \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{K(A)}(X, Y). Dually, assuming that A has enough projectives, i.e. for every object X there is an epimorphism from a projective object P to X, one can use projective resolutions instead of injective ones. In addition to these resolution techniques there are similar ones which apply to special cases, and which elegantly avoid the problem with bounded-above or -below restrictions: uses so-called K-injective and K-projective resolutions, and (in a slightly different language) introduced so called cell-modules and semi-free modules, respectively. More generally, carefully adapting the definitions, it is possible to define the derived category of an exact category .  The relation to derived functors  The derived category is a natural framework to define and study derived functors. In the following, let F: A ‚Üí B be a functor of abelian categories. There are two dual concepts: * right derived functors come from left exact functors and are calculated via injective resolutions * left derived functors come from right exact functors and are calculated via projective resolutions In the following we will describe right derived functors. So, assume that F is left exact. Typical examples are F: A ‚Üí Ab given by X ‚Ü¶ Hom(X, A) or X ‚Ü¶ Hom(A, X) for some fixed object A, or the global sections functor on sheaves or the direct image functor. Their right derived functors are Extn(-,A), Extn(A,-), Hn(X, F) or Rnf‚àó (F), respectively. The derived category allows us to encapsulate all derived functors RnF in one functor, namely the so-called total derived functor RF: D+(A) ‚Üí D+(B). It is the following composition: D+(A) ‚âÖ K+(Inj(A)) ‚Üí K+(B) ‚Üí D+(B), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors are related to the total one via RnF(X) = Hn(RF(X)). One might say that the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes. Derived categories are, in a sense, the \\"right\\" place to study these functors. For example, the Grothendieck spectral sequence of a composition of two functors :\\\\mathcal A \\\\stackrel{F}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\mathcal B \\\\stackrel{G}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\mathcal C, \\\\, such that F maps injective objects in A to G-acyclics (i.e. RiG(F(I)) = 0 for all i > 0 and injective I), is an expression of the following identity of total derived functors :R(G‚àòF) ‚âÖ RG‚àòRF. J.-L. Verdier showed how derived functors associated with an abelian category A can be viewed as Kan extensions along embeddings of A into suitable derived categories [Mac Lane]. Derived equivalence It may happen that two abelian categories A and B are not equivalent, but their derived categories D(A) and D(B) are. Often this is an interesting relation between A and B. Such equivalences are related to the theory of t-structures in triangulated categories. Here are some examples. * Let \\\\mathrm{Coh}(\\\\mathbb{P}^1) be an abelian category of coherent sheaves on the projective line over a field k. Let K2-Rep be an abelian category of representations of the Kronecker quiver with two vertices. They are very different abelian categories, but their (bounded) derived categories are equivalent. * Let Q be any quiver and P be a quiver obtained from Q by reversing some arrows. In general, the categories of representations of Q and P are different, but Db(Q-Rep) is always equivalent to Db(P-Rep). * Let X be an abelian variety, Y its dual abelian variety. Then Db(Coh(X)) is equivalent to Db(Coh(Y)) by the theory of Fourier‚ÄìMukai transforms. Varieties with equivalent derived categories of coherent sheaves are sometimes called Fourier‚ÄìMukai partners.

Plot summary The story concerns the attempts of a fictional Greek village community deep in Anatolia in 1921 to stage a Passion Play - which, as the title suggests, ends up with their in effect re-enacting the events of Jesus Christ's trial, suffering and death. The name of the village is Lycovrisi (Wolf-spring), under Ottoman rule. The village holds Passion Plays every seven years and the elders of the village choose the actors from among the villagers. Manolios, who is chosen to play the role of Christ, is a humble shepherd boy who was once a novice in a monastery. Yannakkos becomes Apostle Peter. He is a merchant- peddler who travels with his donkey through the villages and sells his items. He is warm-hearted, na√Øve and loves his donkey above all else. Michelis, the son of the wealthy nobleman old Patriarcheas, becomes Apostle John. Kostandis, the owner of the village caf√©, is Apostle James the Great. He is good-hearted, willing to share, but confused. Then comes Panayotaros, who is chosen to be Judas. He is a wild, passionate man, waiting for revenge. The widow Katerina is Mary Magdalene. She is the village's prostitute. She is beautiful, but of course an outsider in the village, not caring about anybody's opinion. But she is the most generous one and in the end gives her life for what she believes in. Then the Elders of Lycovrissi are introduced. There is the Priest Grigoris ‚Äî a domineering man who bends God's will to his own. Archon Patriarcheas is the leader of the village. He only lives for his own pleasure. Old Ladas is a miser who is obsessed with his money but lives in poverty so that he doesn't have to spend any of it. Hadji Nikolis is the schoolmaster, who means well but is ineffectual, haunted by fear of his brother the priest. The whole story is made colorful by the Turkish household consisting of The Agha, the Lord of Lycovrissi. He lives surrounded by his Oriental splendor, drinks himself crazy and enjoys rakƒ± and pretty boys. Hussein is the guard, a giant Oriental who does everything his master asks of him. Another character is the Priest Fotis. He comes to the village with a whole group of starved villagers from a devastated village which has been overrun by the Turks, and they are looking for shelter in Lycovrissi. Denied this by the priest Grigoris, the refugees retire to the barren slopes of the nearby mountain Sarakina, where they continue to starve. The villagers, simple, earnest people who are fond of Manolios, who plays Christ, Yannakos, Apostle Peter, Michelis, Apostle John etc. are indoctrinated by the elders. The main factor is a real saintly priest, Father Fotis who comes to the village to ask for help with hundreds of hungry and dying people and who is turned away from the village and finds a refuge in the barren mountain. There he tries to survive with the help of Manolios, Yannakos, Michelis and Konstandis. Father Grigoris is afraid to lose the power over the village and starts his hate campaign first against the priest and his people and then against the rest of the group. At one point Manolios offers his life to save the village, but in the last minute he is saved. The venom of the village elders appalls even the Agha, but he is too comfortable and too afraid to lose his power to do anything. Manolios ends his engagement and lives up in the hill praying to God and follows his voice. Michelis gives up his riches and comes to live with Manolios. This of course infuriates and in the end kills his father. One main character, Panayotaros, Apostle Judas, doesn‚Äôt really change in character, but he becomes very dangerous and a real Judas. He doesn‚Äôt care for his life anymore after widow Katerina dies, for whom he has a crazy desire. He is the one who spies on the people up in the mountain and on Michelis and Manolios and reports it to Father Grigoris, one of the main villains. In the end a mob consisting of the villagers kill Manolios: ‚ÄúFor an instant Manolios‚Äôs heart failed him, he turned to the door - it was closed; he looked at the three lit lamps and, under them, the icons loaded with ex-votos: Christ, red-cheeked, with carefully combed hair, was smiling; the Virgin Mary, bending over the child was taking no interest in what was happening under her eyes. Saint John the Baptist was preaching in the desert. He raised his eyes toward the vault of the church and made out in the half-light the face of the Almighty, bending pitilessly over mankind. He looked at the crowd about him; it was as if in the darkness he saw the gleam of daggers. The strident voice of old Ladas squeaked once more: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs kill him!‚Äù At the same moment, violent blows were struck upon the door; all fell silent and turned toward the entrance; furious voices could be heard distinctly: ‚ÄúOpen! Open!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the voice of father Fotis!‚Äù someone cried. ‚ÄúYannakos‚Äôs voice,‚Äù said another; ‚Äúthe Sarakini have come to take him from us!‚Äù The door was shaken violently, its hinges creaked; there could be heard a great tumult of men and women outside. ‚Äúopen, murderers! Have you no fear of God?‚Äù came the voice of father Fotis, distinctly. Priest Grigoris raised his hands. ‚ÄúIn the name of Christ,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äú I take the sin upon me! Do it, Panayotaros.‚Äù Panayotaros drew the dagger and turned to father Grigoris. ‚ÄúWith your blessing, Father!‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWith my blessing, strike!‚Äù Priest Fotis and his people bring the dead body of Manolios to the mountain. He kneels next to him and holds his hands. ‚ÄúToward midnight the bell began ringing, calling the Christians to the church to see Christ born. One by one the doors opened and the Christians hastened toward the church, shivering with cold. The night was calm, icy, starless.‚Äù ‚ÄúPriest Fotis listened to the bell pealing gaily, announcing that Christ was coming down on earth to save the world. He shook his head and heaved a sigh: In vain, my Christ, in vain, he muttered; two thousand years have gone by and men crucify You still. When will You be born, my Christ, and not be crucified any more, but live among us for eternity.‚Äù Adaptations Bohuslav Martin≈Ø wrote an opera in four acts called The Greek Passion (Czech ≈òeck√© pa≈°ije) based on the novel, with a libretto by the composer.

It is on the border with County Meath, near the junction of the M6 and the M4 motorways - two of Ireland's main east‚Äìwest roads. It is roughly 60 km from the capital, Dublin. From 1996‚Äì2016, there was a considerable increase in Kinnegad's population, from 517 to 2,745 inhabitants. According to the 2016 census, approximately 79% of the town's housing stock (715 out of 907 households) was built between 1991‚Äì2010. Tesco Ireland opened a supermarket in the town in late 2010. In 2014, a hotel, which stands on the site of a former pub, \\"Harry's of Kinnegad\\", was opened. The Kinnegad Plaza opened in 2019. Aldi opened a store in the town in July 2019. Transport Kinnegad is primarily a commuter town, serving Dublin via the N4 and the M4 motorway. Citylink and Bus √âireann both serve Kinnegad towards Dublin, in addition to private company Kearns. There is no railway station in the town; it was served by the station at Hill of Down (which was originally called Kinnegad when it opened in 1847) until its closure in 1947. There are plans to reopen the train station at Killucan, which would serve both Killucan and Rathwire and Kinnegad, but this is unlikely before extra capacity is available on the Dublin-Sligo railway line. Education The town has a large national school, Saint Etchen's Kinnegad N.S. The school consists of two separate buildings, Scoil Etchen Naofa (built-in 1984) and the Cardinal Glennon building (built-in 2008). The renovation was necessary due to an increase in population. The school now caters for up to 560 young people each day. It is run by the Catholic Church but non-Catholic children can attend the school. There has been a campaign by the Kinnegad Steering Group during the 2010s in favour of the development of a secondary school in the town, but as of 2019 this has yet to materialise. Religious sites St. Mary's Church of the Assumption, Kinnegad The Catholic Church of St. Mary's Church of the Assumption is in Kinnegad. It is part of the Diocese of Meath, the bishop of which is Michael Smith (bishop). The parish priests of Kinnegad are Monsignor Eamonn Marron, former rector of the Pontifical Irish College and Father Tom Gilroy. Se√°n Brady visited the church on June 7, 2009, in honour of its 100-year anniversary. There are bullet holes visible in the stations of the cross in the church which were made by the Black and Tans in the 1920s. The church building is the tallest in the town, although the Lagan Cement facility which is outside the town at Killiskillen, is taller. Sport The main sports team in the town is the Coralstown/Kinnegad Gaelic Football Club, which has teams for both male and female players aged from under eight through to senior level. The colours of the team are red shirts and socks, and white shorts. The clubhouse has four dressing rooms, toilets, and a gym. The team has three football pitches. The town also has an association football club, Kinnegad Juniors Athletic Football Club, which was founded in 2005. Kinnegad Juniors play at Lagan Park on the Killucan Road, Kinnegad.

It was used from 1934 to 1939 by the Polish Air Force and civilian aviation. Development The RWD 8 was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement in 1931 for a basic trainer aircraft. It was designed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki. The first prototype (registration SP-AKL), was flown in early 1933. It won the contest for the new Polish military trainer, against the PZL-5bis and Bartel BM-4h biplanes. It was considered a very stable and well-handling aircraft. Since the DWL (Do≈õwiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) workshops ‚Äì a manufacturer of RWD designs ‚Äì had limited production capability, the Polish military decided to produce the aircraft in a nationalized factory PWS (Podlaska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w). DWL gave away the licence free of charge, only for covering design costs. PWS produced aircraft for both military and civilian aviation, while DWL produced aircraft for civilian use only. The first PWS-built RWD 8 was flown in September 1934. These aircraft, designated RWD 8 PWS (or RWD 8 pws), differed from the original RWD 8 DWL (or RWD 8 dwl) in minor details, mainly having thinner landing gear shock absorbers and being slightly heavier and therefore slower. Apart from the standard variant, 50 RWD 8a PWS were built with an additional 95 l (25 U.S. gal) fuel tank in thicker central wing section, giving increased range. A small series was built with a rear cab covered with blinds, for blind flying training. A frame with a hook for glider towing could be attached to the aircraft. A further development of the RWD 8 was the aerobatics and training aircraft, the RWD-17. In total, over 550 RWD 8s were built (about 80 by DWL and about 470 by PWS). Production ceased in early 1939. The RWD 8 was the most numerous aircraft manufactured in Poland up to that time. Small series of license-built produced 1935 by Rogo≈æarski Belgrade (three aircraft). =Technical description= The RW-8 was conventional in layout, and had mixed construction (steel and wood frame with canvas and plywood covering). The crew of two, sitting in tandem, were in an open cockpit, with individual windshields. Twin controls were fitted. Power came from a 4-cylinder air-cooled 90 kW (120 hp) straight engine PZIn≈º, Junior (licence built Walter Junior) (82 kW /110 hp nominal power). 120 hp Walter Major or de Havilland Gipsy Major. A two-blade wooden propeller was fitted. The aircraft had a conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. The fuel tank in fuselage had 75 l (18 U.S. gal) (RWD 8 PWS) or 85 l (21 U.S. gal) (RWD 8 DWL). The wings folded rearwards. Operational history RWD 8 destroyed during the invasion of Poland. RWD 8s were used in the Polish military trainer aviation from 1934, becoming a standard type of primary trainer. In November 1938, there were 349 RWD 8s in the Air Force. RWD 8s were also used in Polish civilian aviation ‚Äì particularly in regional aeroclubs. More than 80 aircraft were bought for public collection funds, in order to train aviators. They were also used in the Polish aviation sport. A small number were exported: three were sold to Palestine, one to Spain, Morocco and Brazil. Licences for building the RWD 8 was sold to Estonia (one aircraft was produced, with markings ES-RWD) and Rogozarski of Yugoslavia (a small series with radial engines was built). At least one RWD 8 was sold to Spain via Portugal during the Spanish Civil War. It was used as a reconnaissance aircraft and a trainer for the Nationalist forces. In the invasion of Poland 1939, the RWD 8s were used in 13 liaison flights, three aircraft in each, assigned to Armies. Many other aircraft were mobilized during the campaign and used in improvised liaison units. An advantage of the RWD 8 was its capability for short take off and landing on unprepared fields, but the missions of their crews were dangerous. RWD 8s of the Polesie Operational Group were the last Polish aircraft in the sky during the campaign. They were flying reconnaissance missions during the Battle of Kock, and even threw hand grenades. A great number of RWD 8s were bombed by the Germans in air bases (unlike Polish combat aircraft) or burned by withdrawing Poles. A total of 57 aircraft were withdrawn to Romania, about 40 to Latvia and 2 to Hungary. Only some dozen aircraft were captured by the Germans in airworthy condition. In Romania and Hungary they were used until the late 1940s. None returned to Poland after the war, and today, none have survived.

The patriarch of the Munster household, Herman is an entity much like Frankenstein's monster, comparable to Lurch on the show's competitor, The Addams Family. Herman Munster and brother Charlie (both played by Fred Gwynne) Origins In the context of the series, Herman was created in 1815 at the University of Heidelberg by Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Work on him was finally completed around 1850 (neither Lily nor Grandpa is quite sure when) along with his twin brother Charlie. Leaving (Germany) for Great Britain at a young age, Herman was adopted by the Munsters of Munster Hall, a noble family living in the fictitious Shroudshire, England. At some point Herman moved to Transylvania (a region in Hungary, from 1920 part of Romania), where he met Lily Dracula. In 1865 (technically at the age of 15, but physically older) Herman married Lily, and eventually the couple and Grandpa (Lily's father) moved to America, where Herman joined the U.S. Army, fighting in World War II. In episode 34, Grandpa says that it was thanks to Herman that he was able to leave Transylvania and have a better life in America. Family relations In The Munsters Today, he, as now portrayed by John Schuck, is given a younger brother named Frank. And in the 1995 movie Here Come the Munsters he is given a sister named Elsa who resembles the Bride of Frankenstein. She is also married to Mr. Hyde, who transforms into Dr. Jekyll. In the series Herman is employed by Gateman, Goodbury and Graves, a funeral home in Mockingbird Heights, having started out as a \\"box boy c. 1953.\\" Herman's co-workers sometimes remark on his height and strength, but otherwise do not appear to find his appearance and color (green) out of the ordinary. Occasionally, Herman is picked up by \\"the company car\\" (a hearse), which he climbs into via the back door and rides as if he were a body being delivered. Description Herman is a lovable, good-natured, and clumsy buffoon. Despite having been alive for centuries, he behaves rather childishly, often throwing temper tantrums, punctuated with thundering animal- like roaring. In spite of his childish behaviors, he is a caring father figure to his son Eddie and a loving, devoted husband. He is very kind to everyone, but he is also very naive, often misunderstanding situations or falling for various schemes. He occasionally has problems recognizing when someone has malicious or dishonest intentions towards him. Most people, however, flee in terror on seeing Herman's monstrous visage, which he always attributes to something else. In some instances, his presence has caused inanimate objects or artwork to come to life and flee in terror: such as a statue of Daniel Boone in a park, a stuffed gorilla in a museum, and a graffiti drawing of a face in a jail cell starting out smiling and the facial expression changes to terror. Herman is incredibly strong, once lifting a solid metal demolition ball casually with one hand. He is almost immovable; a number of times, cars have run into him without causing him injury. A safe fell on his head (\\"John Doe Munster\\") and gave him amnesia, although it did not hurt him. When asked how much he weighs, Herman says: \\"Three spins\\", meaning the dial on the scale goes around three times. In the episode \\"Herman's Lawsuit\\", his driver's license gives his weight as , height as , and eyes as brown. (On the other hand, in the episode \\"All-Star Munster,\\" Herman, when asked his height, states \\"seven-foot three\\" but when asked how tall he is in his stocking feet, he replies, \\"Seven foot four ‚Äì I wear very thick socks.\\") In the episode \\"Munster the Magnificent\\", his shoe size is said to be 26. Herman considers himself handsome (as does the rest of his family) even though he can crack a mirror by looking at it, once even cracking a shiny frying pan he looked into. In one episode, Herman is struck by lightning, reverting to a \\"hideous\\" form (actually Fred Gwynne without any make-up). He tries to hide his appearance from all those around him until two more lightning strikes make him a woman first and then the second one reverts him back to \\"handsome\\" Herman. In earlier episodes, Herman has hair on the back of his hands (only seen in closeups). And a common joke is that when he shakes hands with a blind neighbour of his, they believe that they are holding a dog's paw. When frustrated (often), he tends to stamp like a child having a tantrum causing plaster to shower down from the ceiling. His strength is especially useful around \\"the Parlor\\" ‚Äì he can lift occupied caskets unassisted. Herman has a very distinctive laugh ... a loud braying bellow. Occasionally he is shown grunting and making guttural sounds (similar to Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster), usually when he's hungry, impatient or getting annoyed over a minor problem (such as finding his Sunday newspaper). In keeping with his childlike personality, Herman loves balloons, candy, and especially his wife Lily's pancakes. He plays with toys, such as his son Eddie's cowboy hat and cap pistols (in \\"Herman's Happy Valley\\"). He loves to read comic books despite Lily's annoyance at such childish behavior. Despite being of German origin and having been raised in England, Herman speaks with a cultured American accent. He does however read German newspapers, which is subtly shown in at least one episode: He is reading a paper, conversing about an unrelated topic, and as the camera gets close enough to his face, it can be seen for a fraction of a second that it is Die Zeit. In episode \\"My fair Munster\\", he reads Die Welt. Merchandising In 1964 Mattel came out with a Herman Munster doll that featured Gwynne's voice and spoke ten phrases at random with the pull of its \\"Chatty Ring\\" cord. This was a spin-off of their highly successful Chatty Cathy doll, for whom the talking mechanism had been invented.\\"Chatty Cathy and her Talking Friends\\" by Schiffer Publishing.

II, c. 42) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that created a statutory definition of England as including England, Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed. This definition applied to all acts passed before and after the Act's coming into force, unless a given Act provided an alternative definition. According to Blackstone, the Act \\"perhaps superfluously\\" made explicit what was previously implicit. The town of Berwick had changed hands between England and Scotland on several occasions prior to the union of the two kingdoms in 1707 and had historically been a royal burgh in Scotland. The Act confirmed that English and not Scottish law would apply to Berwick. Of the original Act's four sections, only section 3 related to Wales and Berwick; sections 1 and 2 regulated collection of window tax and section 4 permitted Quaker officials to replace the prescribed oath of fidelity with a declaration, owing to their objection to oath-taking. The short title 'Wales and Berwick Act' was introduced after the other sections had been repealed. The Act was repealed with regard to Wales by the Welsh Language Act 1967, and in its entirety by the Interpretation Act 1978.Interpretation Act 1978, Schedule 3 The Local Government Act 1972, which came into force on 1 April 1974, explicitly stated that in future legislation 'England' would consist of the 46 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties established by the Act (which included Berwick) and that 'Wales' would consist of the eight Welsh counties established by the Act.Interpretation Act 1978, Section 5 and Schedule 1 This also had the effect of ending debate on whether Monmouthshire was a part of Wales, or of England. The administration of law had been attached to one of the English law circuits, Oxford, and the Local Government Act 1933 had listed both Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport as parts of England. The Interpretation Act 1978 restated the provisions of the 1972 Act with respect to legislation passed after 1 April 1974 and noted explicitly that in legislation enacted before then England included Berwick and Monmouthshire; and also that in legislation prior to 1967 it still included Wales.Interpretation Act 1978, Schedule 2, paragraph 5(a) See also * England and Wales References External links * Text of Wales and Berwick Act 1746 as enacted * Text of the Interpretation Act 1978 Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1746 1746 in England 1746 in Scotland History of Berwick-upon-Tweed Constitutional laws of Wales Repealed Great Britain Acts of Parliament ","title":"Wales and Berwick Act 1746"},{"id":"985939","text":"A lifestyle business is a business set up and run by its founders primarily with the aim of sustaining a particular level of income and no more; or to provide a foundation from which to enjoy a particular lifestyle. Some types of enterprise are more accessible than others to the would-be lifestyle business person. Those requiring extensive capital (for example: car manufacturing) are difficult to launch and sustain on a lifestyle basis; others such as small creative industries businesses are more practical for sole practitioners or small groups such as husband-and-wife teams. Lifestyle businesses typically have limited scalability and potential for growth because such growth would destroy the lifestyle for which their owner-managers set them up. However, lifestyle businesses can and do win awards and provide satisfaction to their owners and customers. If sufficient high-quality creative producers begin to naturally cluster together, such as in Brighton, England, during the 1990s, the perception of a place can be radically changed (see Porter's cluster). Cultural Context The term is used in both favorable and derogatory manners. An example of individuals who promote the concept of Lifestyle Businesses favorably include Tim Ferriss's The 4-Hour Workweek and other numerous blogs that emphasize the concept of passive income with the same goal of Lifestyle Businesses. These individuals create an image of lifestyle businesses and passive income that promotes an easy lifestyle and something that individuals should aspire towards. In the derogatory sense, a business started with the intention of becoming a startup, but which instead becomes a smaller business is often referred to as a lifestyle business by investors or other detractors.

Therefore, it not only enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development, but also self-sustainability, as well as competitiveness and employability.Commission of the European Communities: \\"Adult learning: It is never too late to learn\\". COM(2006) 614 final. Brussels, 23.10.2006.  Development  In some contexts, the term \\"lifelong learning\\" evolved from the term \\"life-long learners\\", created by Leslie Watkins and used by Professor Clint Taylor (CSULA) and Superintendent for the Temple City Unified School District's mission statement in 1993, the term recognizes that learning is not confined to childhood or the classroom but takes place throughout life and in a range of situations. In other contexts, the term \\"lifelong learning\\" evolved organically. The first lifelong learning institute began at The New School for Social Research (now New School University) in 1962 as an experiment in \\"learning in retirement\\". Later, after similar groups formed across the United States, many chose the name \\"lifelong learning institute\\" to be inclusive of nonretired persons in the same age range. See Lifelong learning institutes, or outside the US, University of the Third Age. During the last fifty years, constant scientific and technological innovation and change has had profound effects on how learning is understood. Learning can no longer be divided into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and a place and time to apply the knowledge acquired (the workplace).Fischer, Gerhard (2000). \\"Lifelong Learning - More than Training\\" in Journal of Interactive Learning Research, Volume 11 issue 3/4 pp 265‚Äì294. Instead, learning can be seen as something that takes place on an ongoing basis from our daily interactions with others and with the world around us. It can create and shapeshift into the form of formal learning or informal learning, or self-directed learning. Allen Tough (1979), Canadian educator and researcher, asserts that almost 70% of learning projects are self-planned.The Adult's Learning Projects, A Fresh Approach to Theory and Practice in Adult Learning p.1  Concept  Lifelong learning has been described as a process that includes people learning in different contexts. These environments do not only include schools but also homes, workplaces, and even locations where people pursue leisure activities. However, while the learning process can be applied to learners of all ages, there is a focus on adults who are returning to organized learning. There are programs based on its framework that address the different needs of learners, such as the UNESCO's Institute for Lifelong Learning, which caters to the needs of the disadvantaged and marginalized learners. Lifelong learning focuses on holistic education and it has two dimensions, namely, lifelong and broad options for learning. These indicate learning that integrates traditional education proposals and modern learning opportunities. It also entails an emphasis on encouraging people to learn how to learn and to select content, process, and methodologies that pursues self- design and self-perfection. Some authors highlight that lifelong learning is founded on a different conceptualization of knowledge and its acquisition. It is explained not only as the possession of discrete pieces of information or factual knowledge but also as a generalized scheme of making sense of new events, including the use of tactics in order to effectively deal with them. Lifelong learning is distinguished from the concept of continuing education in the sense that it has a broader scope. Unlike the latter, which is oriented towards adult education developed for the needs of schools and industries, this type of learning is concerned with the development of human potential, recognizing each individual's capacity for it.  Links to theory  Two theories of particular relevance when considering lifelong learning are cognitivism and constructivism. Cognitivism, most notably Gestalt theory, speaks of learning as making sense of the relationship between what is old and what is new. Similarly, Constructivist theory states that \\"knowledge is not passively received from the world or from authoritative sources but constructed by individuals or groups making sense of their experiential worlds\\". Constructivism lends itself well to Lifelong learning as it brings together learning from many different sources including life experiences.  Learning economy  Traditional colleges and universities are beginning to recognize the value of lifelong learning outside of the credit and degree attainment model. Some learning is accomplished in segments or interest categories and can still be valuable to the individual and community. The economic impact of educational institutions at all levels will remain significant as individuals continue formal studies and pursue interest-based subjects. Institutions produce educated citizens who buy goods and services in the community and the education facilities and personnel generate economic activity during the operations and institutional activities. Similar to health facilities, educational institutions are among the top employers in many cities and towns of the world. Whether brick-and-mortar or distance education institutions, there is a great economic impact worldwide from learning, including lifelong learning, for all age groups. The lifelong learners, including persons with academic or professional credentials, tend to find higher-paying occupations, leaving monetary, cultural, and entrepreneurial impressions on communities, according to educator Cassandra B. Whyte.Whyte, Cassandra B/ (2002). \\"Great Expectations for Higher Education\\". Speech at Higher Education Round Table Event. Oxford, England.Whyte, Cassandra B. (1989) \\"Student Affairs-The Future\\". Journal of College Student Personnel. 30.(1) 86-89.  Contexts  Although the term is widely used in a variety of contexts, its meaning is often unclear.Aspin, David N. & Chapman, Judith D. (2007) \\"Lifelong Learning Concepts and Conceptions\\" in: David N. Aspin, ed.: Philosophical Perspectives on Lifelong Learning, Springer. A learning approach that can be used to define lifelong learning is heutagogy. There are several established contexts for lifelong learning beyond traditional \\"brick and mortar\\" schooling: *Home schooling involves learning to learn or the development of informal learning patterns *Adult education or the acquisition of formal qualifications or work and leisure skills later in life *Continuing education which often describes extension or not-for-credit courses offered by higher education institutions *Lifelong learning institutes, which are groups over 50 years of age which meet for noncredit college-level study for intellectual challenge and social enjoyment *Knowledge work, which includes professional development and on-the-job training *Personal learning environments or self-directed learning using a range of sources and tools including online applications E-learning is available at most colleges and universities or to individuals learning independently. There are even online courses being offered for free by many institutions. One new (2008 and beyond) expression of lifelong learning is the massive open online course (a MOOC), in which a teacher or team offers a syllabus and some direction for the participation of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of learners. Most MOOCs do not offer typical \\"credit\\" for courses taken, which is why they are interesting and useful examples of lifelong learning.  Emerging technologies  Lifelong learning is defined as \\"all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective\\".Commission of the European Communities. (2001, November 21). Making a European Area of Lifelong Learning a Reality. Retrieved from EUR-Lex: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0678:FIN:EN:PDF It is often considered learning that occurs after the formal education years of childhood (where learning is instructor-driven‚Äîpedagogical) and into adulthood (where the learning is individually-driven‚Äîandragogical). It is sought out naturally through life experiences as the learner seeks to gain knowledge for professional or personal reasons. These natural experiences can come about on purpose or throughout life's unpredictable course. 'Knowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and transforming it' (Kolb 1984: 41). The concept of lifelong learning has become of vital importance with the emergence of new technologies that change how we receive and gather information, collaborate with others, and communicate. =Assistive technology= As technology rapidly changes, individuals must adapt and learn to meet everyday demands. However, throughout life, an individual's functional capacities may also change. Assistive technologies are also important considerations under the umbrella of emerging technology and lifelong learning. Access to informal and formal learning opportunities for individuals with disabilities may be dependent upon low and high tech assistive technology. =Web 2.0= The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors, allowing for informal, just-in-time, day-to-day learning.Dunlap, J. C., & Lowenthal, P. R. (in press). Learning, unlearning, and relearning: Using Web 2.0 technologies to support the development of lifelong learning skills. In G. D. Magoulas (Ed.), E-infrastructures and technologies for lifelong learning: Next generation environments. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. Constant change is emerging as the new normal. To thrive, organizations and individuals must be able to adjust, and enhance their knowledge and skills to meet evolving needs. This means the most important thing someone can learn is how to learn. An understanding of web 2.0 tools is critical to keeping up with a changing world and the information explosion. =Workplace learning= Professions typically recognize the importance of developing practitioners becoming lifelong learners. Nowadays, formal training is only a beginning. Knowledge accumulates at such a fast rate that one must continue to learn to be effective (Williams, 2001). Many licensed professions mandate that their members continue learning to maintain a license. (Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007).Merriam, S. B. & Caffarella, R.S. (2007) Learning in adulthood: A comprehensive guide. San Francisco: Josseey-Bass (3rd. Edition) Having said this, what are the characteristics or skills that a lifelong learner must develop. Reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more self-reliant through learning how to learn, thus making them better able to direct, manage, and control their own learning process (Candy, 1990).Mackeracher, D. (2004). Making Sense of Adult Learning, Second Edition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. Sipe (1995) studied experimentally \\"open\\" teachers and found that they valued self-directed learning, collaboration, reflection, and challenge; risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity, not a threat. Dunlap and Grabinger (2003) say that for higher education students to be lifelong learners, they must develop a capacity for self-direction, metacognition awareness, and a disposition toward learning (Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007).  Metacognition  While the study of metacognition originally gave educational psychologists insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers, it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes, and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives.Livingston, Jennifer A. (1997) Metacognition: An Overview http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/fas/shuell/CEP564/Metacog.htm Educators can employ Cognitive Strategy Instruction (CSI) as a means to help learners develop their metacognition. Again, learners who are better equipped to create learning strategies for themselves will have more success in achieving their cognitive goals. As lifelong learning is \\"lifelong, lifewide, voluntary, and self- motivated\\" learning to learn, that is, learning how to recognize learning strategies, and monitor and evaluate learning, is a pre-condition for lifelong learning. Metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning.  Delors Report and the four pillars of learning  The Delors ReportUNESCO. 1996. Learning: The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century. Paris, UNESCO. proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key paradigms: lifelong learning and the four pillars of learning. The report proposed a holistic conceptual framework of learning, that of the 'four pillars of learning'. It argued that formal education tends to emphasize the acquisition of knowledge to the detriment of other types of learning essential to sustaining human development. It stressed the need to think of learning over the life course, and to address how everyone can develop relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes for work, citizenship and personal fulfillment. The four pillars of learning are: # Learning to know # Learning to do # Learning to be # Learning to live together It is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of 'lifelong learning', itself an adaptation of the concept of 'lifelong education' as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication Learning to Be.Tawil, S. and Cougoureux, M. 2013. Revisiting learning: the treasure within. Assessing the influence of the 1996 Delors report. Education Research and Foresight Occasional Paper no. 4, January. Paris, UNESCO. In practice In India and elsewhere, the \\"University of the Third Age\\" (U3A) provides an example of the almost spontaneous emergence of autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience. No prior qualifications and no subsequent certificates feature in this approach to learning for its own sake and, as participants testify, engagement in this type of learning in later life can indeed 'prolong active life'. In Sweden the successful concept of study circles, an idea launched almost a century ago, still represents a large portion of the adult education provision. The concept has since spread, and for instance, is a common practice in Finland as well. A study circle is one of the most democratic forms of a learning environment that has been created. There are no teachers and the group decides on what content will be covered, scope will be used, as well as a delivery method. Sometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems‚Äîwhich can be cost-prohibitive, if available at all. On the other hand, formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of universities. For example, the 'Academy of Lifelong Learning' is an administrative unit within the University-wide 'Professional and Continuing Studies' unit at the University of Delaware. Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego), which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning (open learning, organizational learning, community learning). In recent years, 'lifelong learning' has been adopted in the UK as an umbrella term for post- compulsory education that falls outside of the UK higher education system ‚Äì further education, community education, work-based learning and similar voluntary, public sector and commercial settings. Most colleges and universities in the United States encourage lifelong learning to non- traditional students. Professional licensure and certification courses are also offered at many universities, for instance for teachers, social services providers, and other professionals. Some colleges even enable adults to earn credit for the college-level learning gained through work, volunteer and other experiences. Bangladesh Open University (BOU) has six schools and is offering 23 formal and 19 nonformal programs. The number of enrolled students in formal programs for 2016 was 433,413. Most of the courses of BOU are for professional development and most of the students are professional people who are getting scope to study in flexible hours. BOU is the only public institution in the country that imparts education in distance mode. In place of campus based teaching, this university uses technology including electronic devices to reach people in different corners of the country. In Canada, the federal government's Lifelong Learning Plan allows Canadian residents to withdraw funds from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to help pay for lifelong learning, but the funds can only be used for formal learning programs at designated educational institutions. Priorities for lifelong and life-wide learning have different priorities in different countries, some placing more emphasis on economic development (towards a learning economy) and some on social development (towards a learning society). For example, the policies of China, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Malaysia promote lifelong learning in a human resource development (HRD) perspective. The governments of these countries have done much to foster HRD whilst encouraging entrepreneurship.  Impact on long-term economic growth  Mainstream economic analysis has highlighted increased levels of primary and secondary education as a key driver of long-term economic growth. Data show that initial levels of educational attainment explain about half the difference in growth rates between East Asia and sub- Saharan Africa between 1965 and 2010. At the individual level, the knowledge and skills workers acquire through education and training make them more productive. Provision of good quality education can improve the knowledge and skills of a whole population beyond what traditional or informal systems can achieve. For business, educated and highly skilled workers foster productivity gains and technological change, through either innovation or imitation of processes developed elsewhere. At the societal level, education expansion helps build social and institutional capital, which has a strong impact on the investment climate and growth; it also helps in building social trust, developing participatory societies, strengthening the rule of law and supporting good governance.  Implications for an aging society  According to the Alzheimer's Society, it is estimated that more than a million Canadians will suffer from Alzheimer's diseases by 2030. \\"Exercising the brain may preserve it, forestalling mental decline\\" (Grady, 2012). In North America‚Äîand presumably globally‚Äîto proactively curb potential economic issues as the baby boomers continue to age, we need to look at society through a lifelong learning lens. Consider community programs to engage retirees and foster their cognitive health. Taking a proactive approach to keep our elderly population engaged through learning and their brains exercised as Grady described, the strain on the health care system and not to mention the families of the elderly would be lessened. The US Department of Health and Human Service published a study that suggests that older people with a mild cognitive impairment receive 8.5 hours more of care each week from their family and those with a severe impairment received 41.5 more hours than those without a cognitive impairment (USDHHS, 2007). Who pays for this? As a society we are living longer‚Äî85 years for men and 90 years for women‚Äîmaking cognitive health vitally important.

He is well known as a member of the first expedition to summit Annapurna 1 in 1950 and the first man to climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps. In 1984, he was made an officer in the French Legion of Honour for his service as a mountaineering instructor for the French military. At the age of 64, Gaston R√©buffat died of cancer in Paris, France. The climbing technique Gaston was named after him. A photo of R√©buffat atop the Aiguille du Roc in the French Alps can be found on the Voyager Golden Records.  Early Life  Gaston R√©buffat was born on 7 May 1921 in Marseilles, France. He began climbing at the age of 14 in the Calanques near Marseilles. At the age of 16, he became a member of the Club Alpin Fran√ßais (French Alpine Club) , where he was introduced to high altitude mountaineering. There he met Lionel Terray, a French mountaineer who would join R√©buffat on the 1950 Annapurna ascent. He later moved to Chamonix, France and became a member of the Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix. He soon began climbing in the Alps, where he would spend much of his career.  Career  = Career as mountaineering instructor and guide = During World War II, Gaston R√©buffat attended Jeunesse et Montagne, a French youth training organization. He graduated in 1942, earning his mountain guide certification at the age of 21, despite the minimum age for certification being 23. He continued as an instructor for Jeunesse et Montagne, until, in 1944, he became an instructor for the French National Ski and Mountaineering School (ENSA) as well as the High Mountain Military School, where he served as a mountaineering instructor for several years, eventually earning him the L√©gion d'Honneur. After some time as an instructor, R√©buffat wanted to spend more time as a guide. He stated in his 1954 work Starlight and Storm: \\"Each winter I found myself impatiently awaiting July. At last the day would come for departure to Ailefroide or Chamonix. There I would spend a few days on the tops, only to return and wait for another year. Then one day, deciding that I must live among the mountains, I became a guide.\\" In 1945, R√©buffat left his position at the ENSA to become a mountain guide in the Alps. Throughout his career, he guided many climbers and mountaineers, both new and experienced, up the mountains of the Alps. By the 1950s he was known as one of the foremost experts on the Mont Blanc Massif in the Alps, where he had set several routes himself. = Great North Faces of the Alps = One of R√©buffat's most famous accomplishments is his ascent of the six great north faces of the Alps. He began planning for his first ascent, the Grandes Jorasses, in the summer of 1938 at the age of 17, shortly after the first ascent of the mountain's north face by Italian mountaineers Riccardo Cassin, Gino Esposito, and Ugo Tizzoni. In 1943, R√©buffat made his first attempt at the summit but was not successful due to poor weather conditions. He returned to the mountain in July of 1945 and successfully climbed the north face with the assistance of √âdouard Frendo. In August of 1949, he attempted and successfully completed an ascent of the northeast face of Piz Badile, during which he acted as a mountain guide for an amateur mountaineer. By this time, R√©buffat was among a handful of elite mountaineers to have climbed these faces. This led to his selection as one of the principal members of the 1950 Annapurna expedition. Over the next several years, he guided mountaineers, both new and experienced, up the remaining great north faces, the Petit Dru, the Matterhorn, the Cima Grande di Lavaredo, and the Eiger. = Annapurna Ascent = In 1950, Gaston R√©buffat was part of an expedition to summit Annapurna 1, the tallest point of the Annapurna Massif in the Himalayas and the tenth highest peak in the world. The expedition was led by Maurice Herzog and also included French mountaineers Louis Lachenal and Lionel Terray. The expedition began in March 1950, with the actual ascent of Annapurna 1 beginning in May. During the ascent, a base camp and four intermediate camps were set up, with the highest being about 7400 meters in altitude. The summit itself was completed on 3 June 1950 by Herzog and Lachenal. While traveling down from the top camp, the four mountaineers were unable to locate the next camp and were forced to spend the night in a crevasse. All members survived the expedition, but Herzog and Lachenal later lost several fingers and toes due to severe frostbite. Although R√©buffat did not summit the mountain, he was instrumental in ensuring his injured colleagues returned safely. The expedition is known to be the first ascent of any mountain over 8000 meters and was the highest mountain climb ever at the time. Writing Known for his lyrical writing and his ability to convey not only the dangers of mountaineering but the pure exaltation of the climb, R√©buffat authored several books, many of which he published in his own publishing house. His most famous written work is Etoiles et Temp√™tes (Starlight and Storm), first published in French in 1954, and in English in 1956. * Starlight and Storm: The Ascent of six great North Faces of the Alps, J.M.

It received Royal Assent on 12 April 1927. Background to the Act As a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, in December 1922 most of Ireland was detached from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to become the Irish Free State. However, six north-eastern counties, all within Ulster, remained united with Great Britain as Northern Ireland. The King's title, proclaimed under the Royal Titles Act 1901, was: > \\"George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and > Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the > Faith, Emperor of India\\"Imperial Conference, 1926: Summary of Proceedings > Cmd 2768, p. 15 (London: HMSO, 1926). At the 1926 Imperial Conference, it was agreed by the Imperial government at Whitehall and those of the various Dominions that the existing royal style and titles of their shared monarch \\"hardly accorded with the altered state of affairs arising from the establishment of the Irish Free State as a Dominion\\". The Conference concluded that the wording should be changed to: > \\"George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British > Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\\"Cmd > 2768 (1926), p. 16 Under the existing constitutional arrangements of the British Commonwealth, it was necessary for legislation to be enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in order for the royal style and titles to be altered; the resulting Act would then extend automatically into the law of the various Dominions. The British Government introduced the necessary bill into the House of Commons in March 1927 and easily secured its passage through both Houses of Parliament. Provisions of the Act The Act contained three substantive provisions. Firstly, the King was authorised to issue a royal proclamation within six months of the Act's passing, authorising him to alter the royal style and titles.Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, s. 1 Following the precedent set by similar legislation in the past, the Act did not itself set out the form of the new style and titles that were to be adopted. Secondly, the Act formally renamed the parliament sitting at Westminster from \\"Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\\" to \\"Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\".s. 2(1) Finally, the Act established that the term \\"United Kingdom\\", when used in \\"every Act [of Parliament] passed and public document issued after the passing of this Act\\", would mean Great Britain and Northern Ireland (unless the context required otherwise).s. 2(2) A royal proclamation was subsequently issued under the terms of the Act on 13 May 1927. The proclamation followed the recommendation of the Imperial Conference by altering the Latin and English forms of the existing royal style and titles, the former by replacing \\"Britanniarum\\" with \\"Magnae Britanniae, Hiberniae\\", and the latter by replacing \\"the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of\\" with \\"Great Britain, Ireland and\\". The Great Seal of the Realm and Great Seal of Scotland were replaced to update the change of royal style. The new designs by Percy Metcalfe were delivered at a Privy Council meeting on 27 October 1930. Subsequent developments Over the next quarter of the century the relationship between the various members of the Commonwealth continued to evolve. In particular, the outcome of the 1930 Imperial Conference (and the resultant Statute of Westminster 1931), the formal declaration by the Irish state of its republican status and its consequent secession, as the Republic of Ireland, from the Commonwealth, and the request by India that it remain a member of the Commonwealth despite adopting a republican constitution, all altered both the nature and composition of the Commonwealth. The royal style and titles were altered in 1948, to reflect the independence of India the previous year by omitting the title \\"Emperor of India\\". However, the accession of a new monarch (Elizabeth II) in 1952 was taken as an opportunity to completely alter both the form of the style and titles, and the manner in which they would be legislated for; henceforth, each Commonwealth realm would pass its own legislation establishing its own version of the style and titles. The resulting legislation for the United Kingdom and its dependencies was the Royal Style and Titles Act. The reference to \\"Ireland\\" in the royal style and title was not changed to \\"Northern Ireland\\" until May 1953.http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1927 See also * Style of the British Sovereign * Title and style of the Canadian monarch * Royal Style and Titles Act References External links *Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Documents (Full text of the 1927 Act and royal proclamation) United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1927 British Empire History of the Commonwealth of Nations Titles in the United Kingdom 1927 in the British Empire April 1927 events Monarchy in the Irish Free State Style of the British sovereign ","title":"Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927"},{"id":"985979","text":"BOC Group may refer to: * Bank of China Group (BOCG), * Boc group, a protecting group used in organic chemistry * The BOC Group plc, a British- based chemical company ","title":"BOC Group"},{"id":"985981","text":"Gonzalo Enrique M√°rquez Moya (March 31, 1940 ‚Äì December 19, 1984) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player.

He's still well remembered by the Oakland fans for his contribution off the bench. Marquez was also known as a fine fielder at first base. On May 5, 1973, against the Cleveland Indians, he became the last left-handed player to be listed in the lineup card as a second baseman in a major-league game. He did not appear in the field at second, though. M√°rquez enjoyed a long career at home in the Venezuelan Winter League, nearly all of it with the Leones del Caracas club. He compiled a record of .288 with 16 homers and 295 RBI in 833 games, from 1965 to 1984.

The Stall plate remains intact within the fifth stall, on the Sovereign's side of the chapel. John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, 8th Baron Mowbray, 9th Baron Segrave KG, Earl Marshal (139219 October 1432) was an English nobleman and soldier. He was a younger son of the first Duke of Norfolk, but inherited his father's earldom of Norfolk (but not the dukedom) when his elder brother rebelled against King Henry IV and was executed before reaching the age of inheritance. This and the fact that his mother lived to an old age and held a third of his estates in dower, meant that until the last few years of his life he was, although an important political figure, poorly-off financially. Probably due to the need to augment his income, he took the still-popular path for young members of the English nobility by taking part in the Hundred Years' War in France. His first campaign was in 1415 with Henry V, and although he took part in some of the great expeditions, he, like so many of his comrades, fell badly ill with dysentery and had to return to England. For this reason, he missed the Battle of Agincourt. When Henry V died in 1422, he remained a leading commander of the new boy-king (Henry VI)'s armed forces in France. He continued campaigning there for the next five years, and, when parliament decided it was time to crown the new young king‚Äîin both Westminster Abbey and in France‚ÄîMowbray acted as both royal bodyguard and councillor. He also took part in Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester's personal campaign in Hainaut, which appears for once to have been profitable to him. Foreign service occupied most of Mowbray's career but often cost him more than he gained from any spoils. Hence it was not until his mother died in 1425 that his fortunes changed for the better; not only did he inherit her large share of his father's estates, he also received promotion from Earl of Norfolk to Duke of Norfolk. This followed a bitter dispute, while he was still earl, with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, as to who held precedence within the English peerage; the question was never resolved, but avoided by making Mowbray a duke. Whilst still a youth Mowbray had been married by his guardian, Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, to Neville's eldest daughter, Katherine; Mowbray's marriage had cost Westmorland the princely sum of ¬£2,000. John and Katherine had one son, also named John. Mowbray died in 1432, and his heir and namesake, although still a minor, inherited the dukedom. He was to have a relatively short career, although one which made him a significant player in the later Wars of the Roses. Katherine not only survived Mowbray but was to live until 1483, and she took three more husbands before her death.  Youth and early career  John Mowbray was born in Calais in 1392. He was the younger of two sons to Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk and his second wife Elizabeth Fitzalan. Thomas Mowbray had died in 1399, and in 1405 John Mowbray's elder brother‚Äîalso named Thomas‚Äîrebelled against King Henry IV. The rebellion failed, Thomas was beheaded for treason, and John succeeded to his father's earldoms of Norfolk and Nottingham as 5th and 3rd earl respectively. Whilst still only about fifteen in 1407, he was made a ward of his great-aunt Joan, Countess of Hereford (who was also the king's mother-in-law). Since she did not live at court, but in Essex (at either the castles of Rochford or Pleshey) it is likely her wards lived with her there (she also had custody of Richard de Vere, heir to the earldom of Oxford). Joan received an annuity to pay for his upkeep which had increased from ¬£100 to ¬£300 by 1410, in which year he left her wardship and became a ward of the king in the royal household. At the same time, even though still a minor, Mowbray began gradually receiving some of his patrimonial estates back from the crown. Thirteen at the time of his brother's death, he was made a ward of the Earl of Westmorland in 1411, who paid ¬£2,000 for John's custody and marriage. Westmorland was a major northern magnate who had by this time repeatedly supported King Henry against various rebellions in the region. On 12 January the following year, John married Neville's eldest daughter, Katherine. At this time he also received the return of his family's hereditary office of Earl Marshal, which had been granted to Westmorland in 1399 on the death of John's father. Historian Christine Carpenter has suggested that his restoration was part of Henry V's policy of reconciling the families that had rebelled against his father. Chris Given- Wilson has noted that in spite of this spirit of reconciliation, none of the heirs received outright their treacherous fathers' lands, and that this, therefore, made John Mowbray more likely to be \\"dependent on the crown\\" for additional sources of income. G. L. Harriss described Mowbray as \\"younger than the king and anxious to recover forfeited lands and titles and restore... family honour\\". King Henry IV died in March 1413 and was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Henry V. It was probably at his coronation, on 9 April that year, that Mowbray first exercised his office of Earl Marshal, and as a fee, he was paid with a silver dish, worth approximately twenty-five marks. Furthermore, one of the old King's last acts, in early March, had been to restore Mowbray to full seisin of his estates, and to confirm him as Earl of Nottingham. Two days after the king's death, the earl was summoned to the parliament for the first time; however, he \\"continued to badger\\" the new king, Henry V, for the restoration of his full estates.  Military service in France  = Under Henry V = By the Spring of 1414 the new king was publicly reiterating the claim to the French throne that English Kings had traditionally upheld. By April the next year Mowbray indentured with the King for military service in France, contracting to supply four knights, forty-five men at arms, and 150 archers. On top of military personnel, Mowbray's extant accounts indicate that he also had to pay not only for materi√©l (such as tents, horses, armour, weapons and livery), but for support staff such as surgeons, priests, armourers and cooks. Providing this contingent and other preparations cost him ¬£2,500, of which, eventually, only ¬£1,450 was returned to him in campaign wages. So poor were Mowbray's finances at this time that he had had to borrow 1,000 marks from the Earl of Arundel; worse, he had to resort to the \\"dubious practice\\" of claiming that innocent‚Äîbut prosperous‚Äîtownsmen (from Norwich, for example) were in fact runaway villeins, and effectively blackmailed them with manumission fines. The Agincourt campaign ultimately cost Mowbray ¬£1,000 more than he was paid. Henry V, while Prince of Wales, presenting leftThe King's expedition was due to leave from Southampton in August 1415; just before it did, however, a treasonous plot against Henry V was uncovered, which involved his cousin, Richard, Earl of Cambridge. In his capacity of Earl Marshal, Mowbray led the investigation into the plot on 1 August; four days later he sat in judgement upon them in a trial which ultimately condemned the conspirators to death. Henry V's expeditionary force landed in France on 14 August, and Mowbray took part in the first major engagement, the Siege of Harfleur. It was also his last engagement of the campaign‚Äîhaving caught the dysentery that was ravaging the English army, he (and around a quarter of his force and a third of the entire English army) returned to England in October to recover. As a result, John Mowbray was unable to take part in what became the most famous battle of the campaign, at Agincourt, which took place on October 25 soon after he left France. He recuperated at his family seat at Epworth, Lincolnshire, although he had recovered sufficiently by November to travel to London to welcome the victorious Henry V home. Early the following year he also took part in the welcoming committee that greeted the Emperor Sigismund at Dover on his visit to England, which resulted in the Treaty of Canterbury of 1416. The following year Mowbray again contracted to go to France, this time with a bigger force than before, at 100 men-at-arms and 300 archers; he would not return to England for five years. During this period of the war he took part in some of the major sieges of the campaign, for example, those of Caen, Louviers, and Rouen. In February 1419 he was appointed to the captaincy of two French towns, but it would seem that Henry V‚Äîrealising that these appointments would keep Mowbray occupied there, and \\"being apparently unwilling to proceed without his marshal\\"‚Äîcancelled them soon after. As a consequence of this that Mowbray was available to participate in the Sieges of √âvreux Vernon, Ivry, Gisors and Melun later that year, the latter of which he played a major role, receiving its surrender in October that year. In 1420 Mowbray continued with his success in the military; the extent of his activity is indicated by the fact that he had to allow duties in England to pass by. He passed Christmas 1419 with the king at his Rouen base, until March, when he captured the town of Fresnay-le- Vicomte (with John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon), which was followed by the Battle of Le Mans the same month, in which the Dauphin, Charles Valois, was routed. That Christmas he indentured again with the king, this time accepting the captaincy of Pontoise and contracting to provide 60 men-at-arms and 180 archers for the purpose. This appointment‚ÄîRowena Archer described it as an \\"onerous\\" one‚Äîwas sufficient to prevent Mowbray from accompanying the King to England. Mowbray was only able to travel with Henry as far as Amiens; the king had just married Katherine of Valois and they were travelling to England for her coronation. Mowbray should have attended per his office of Earl Marshal; the Earl of Worcester deputised for him. Similarly, when Mowbray was elected to the Order of the Garter, his installation had to be received for him by Rowland Lenthal, later High Sheriff of Hertfordshire. = With the Duke of Gloucester = What has been described as a \\"curious\\" episode in Mowbray's career occurred in 1424. Already friends with Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, when the duke decided to invade the county of Hainaut in November that year, Mowbray journeyed with him and acted as his military commander. Little is known of this expedition except that, having raided Brabant, it was probably profitable for Mowbray. = Under Henry VI = Mowbray was still in France when King Henry returned in 1421, maintaining a front line at Vermandois, Tierche, and the Laonnois against La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles. It was only when the king died unexpectedly on 31 August 1422 that the earl returned to England accompanying the corpse. He attended parliament that year, although he was summoned under the name \\"Thomas,\\" and Archer posits that that clerical error is indicative of how little, due to his French service, he was known in England. He also joined the royal council that the recent parliament had ordained would govern the country through the new King's long minority. Ralph Griffiths has also suggested that Norfolk's admission to that body \\"provided an injection of youth into discussions hitherto conducted by a rather elderly group.\\" He was not a particularly regular attendee to council, and within a year he had contracted again to serve abroad, on this occasion bringing 115 men-at-arms and 300 archers with Lords Willoughby, Hungerford, and the Duke of Exeter. Although Mowbray did not participate in the Battle of Cravant, which took place on 31 July 1423, he was not inactive; having taken part in so many sieges in his career, he was assisting Jean de Luxembourg in his efforts to relieve Bohain, and later the Lyonnais castle of La Folleye. This campaign appears to have succeeded in its brief of the \\"protection and defence\\" of English France, and not only was Normandy almost cleared of enemy forces, the English even managed some \\"daring sorties\\" beyond the region. Although by now a leader of the royal armies in France, Rowena Archer suggests that it was around this time that his martial enthusiasm for royal service began to pale, at least in part because \\"it had owed much to his personal service to Henry V and to his office as marshal.\\" But the new King was a baby, and with no further major campaigns taking place during the young king's minority, Mowbray's office of Earl Marshal was effectively unused. On 19 May 1426, the Duke of Bedford knighted the young king, who in turn dubbed a number of new knights from amongst the heirs of the nobility, including John Mowbray's son and namesake.  Later career and death  John Mowbray nearly drowned in the River Thames in November 1428 after his barge capsized after hitting a pier beneath London Bridge; he lost a number of his household in this accident. Mowbray was present in the council that same year which denounced the Duke of Gloucester's re-asserted attempt to increase his authority; Mowbray signed his name to an \\"astonished\\" memoranda that the duke would think of such a thing when the king was increasingly close to attaining his majority and with it being ready \\"to occupy his full royal power.\\" By May 1429 he had written his first surviving will. The first major occasion on which he performed the office of Marshall again was the king's coronation at Westminster. Mowbray also took part in the first major campaign of Henry VI's reign which was a direct follow-on from the London coronation. In 1430 it was decided by the King's Council to crown Henry in both England, at Westminster Abbey, and then in France, hopefully in Paris. Mowbray contracted to bring a large force of 120 men-at-arms and 360 archers and led the army that accompanied the royal entourage. Mowbray, along with other members of the nobility, acted as both the kernel of the king's court and an experienced council while the king was in France. In an attempt to aid the Duke of Burgundy, Norfolk launched an assault on Gournay-sur-Aronde with 1,000 men, and likewise took part in other attacks on Dammartin and La Chasse in the √éle- de-France. However, he had returned to England before the Rouen coronation of Henry in December 1431. John Mowbray died on 19 October 1432 at Epworth, Lincolnshire, where his father had founded a Cistercian monastery. He had written his second will that same day, and like the first one it requested that his father's bones be returned from Venice (where he had died of plague returning from Crusade), and buried on the Isle of Axholme. Mowbray too requested interment there.  Estates and income  Mowbray's wealth was adversely affected by his service in France. The Agincourt campaign, for example, cost him around ¬£2,000, the detailed expenditure being recorded by his receiver-general including such purchases as his personal privy seat. In spite of his years of fighting there, however, he had never received any lands or titles based on conquest (although he did manage to sell a large number of French prisoners to Lord Fanhope). Equally affecting his English estates was the fact that substantial dowers were still in the hands of his mother and sister-in-law, Lady Constance Holland (1387‚Äì1437) (his brother's widow, and daughter of John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter). As K.B. McFarlane put it, his estate was \\"both wasted and encumbered\\" from the moment he came into possession On his mother's death, however, in 1425, Mowbray received her dower estates concentrated in East Anglia, centred around Framlingham Castle, which he took over, and secured his recognition as duke of Norfolk. Although he seems never to have been a particularly active Councillor to the King, he nevertheless received 300 marks payment a year for the office, and indeed, even on his deathbed, he was still owed a portion of ¬£1,300 arrears from the government in salary. He had, however, been the first Mowbray to gain possession of the Brotherton and Seagrave estates that had been in the possession of his great-grandmother, Margaret of Brotherton, Duchess of Norfolk, who had died in 1399; and he has been described, after his mother's death, as representing \\"a new nobility\\" in East Anglia, alongside the Duke of Suffolk. The Brotherton lands particularly have been described as having political potential due to their being a large new conglomerate of estates in a whole new area of influence. As these lands were concentrated in East Anglia, for the first time, a Mowbray Duke of Norfolk had substantially expanded his natural patrimony out of and away from Lincolnshire. The Brotherton lands were worth over ¬£1,400 at the turn of the century, although by the time Mowbray had inherited it, he had two dowagers (the widows of his brother and father) to support out of his income, and they were themselves relatively young Thus, although he inherited a large estate in East Anglia, it has been estimated that only around half of it was under Mowbray's direct control. It may well be as a direct result of his lack of political significance in the region that even though he spent most of career in France, on his visits home, he spent the majority of his time in London or Epworth, not the east of England. = Precedence and the dukedom of Norfolk = Throughout his life, Mowbray was obsessed with his \\"rights and privileges,\\" even arguing with Henry V over the powers and extent of his office of Earl Marshal. His concern for establishing‚Äîand augmenting‚Äîhis own authority was such that he was drawn in dispute with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick after claiming that his own earldom of Norfolk had precedence in the English peerage, and outranked that of Warwick. Mowbray first claimed precedence in 1414; the situation was not resolved until 1425 when the question was put to parliament. The House of Commons, as Archer puts it, was able to \\"neatly side- step\\" the issue by recommending that Mowbray be returned to his family dukedom. A month later, on 14 July, John Mowbray paid homage to Henry VI as the second Mowbray Duke of Norfolk, which, says Griffiths, was intended to \\"soothe his offended dignity and quiten the discord.\\" Having recently fought for the Duke of Gloucester in Brabant, Mowbray relied on the duke's support against Beauchamp, who was himself known to be part of Cardinal Beaufort's clique.  Family  Mowbray married Lady Katherine Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and had one son, John, born just before his father returned ill from France in 1415. Seventeen-year-old John Mowbray succeeded his father to the dukedom of Norfolk in October 1432, while Katherine lived for over fifty years more, and married three more times. Apart from his elder brother, John Mowbray had three sisters, Elizabeth, Margaret and Isabel. Because of Thomas' treason, the sisters had to be found husbands in severely straitened circumstances. Elizabeth married Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, although, as K. B. McFarlane noted, his family was, although later ducal, both \\"impoverished and discredited and also parvenu;\\" they had no sons. At some point between 1415 and 1420, Margaret married Sir Robert Howard; their son John was to be an important player in the Wars of the Roses. He was to be a close associate of Mowbray's son and heir and also close to King Richard III who was to grant Howard the dukedom of Norfolk in 1483. Isabel married twice: firstly to Sir Henry Ferrers of Groby (\\"heir of an ancient but minor lordly house\\") and latterly, to James Berkeley (\\"one of two claimants to the headship and depleted lands of another\\").  Character  Mowbray's most recent biographer, Dr Rowena Archer has not overemphasised his positive qualities. She has described his contributions to the political weal as \\"at best routine, at worst half-hearted,\\" and notes generally how little he went out of his way to actively participate in domestic politics. Most councils he attended were mostly focused on organising his foreign expeditions; in fact, he \\"did the minimum amount expected\\" of him in terms of the running of the country during the king's minority. She does, however, note that being on friendly relations with both the Duke of Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort as he was throughout the king's minority, he was active in keeping the peace and arbitrating between them on occasions during their periodic feud. Yet, if he kept the peace between those two men, he was perfectly capable of entering into his own feuds as he showed in November 1428, when he was in a violent dispute with the Earl of Huntingdon. This feud was virulent enough that both lords were removed from the Bedfordshire King‚Äôs Bench while the Duke of Gloucester personally investigated the \\"inveterate feud\\".

The positioning for the other seven positions is very flexible, although they all have regular depths‚Äîdistances from home plate, and sometimes lateral positioning. A shift means that a player is playing in a noticeably different location than the norm for his positioning. A fielder who is playing shallow or in is playing closer to home plate, while a player playing deep is playing farther from home plate than normal. Common types of positioning Regular terms are used for some positionings. For example, double play depth is used when there is potential for a force play at second base. This means the shortstop and second baseman are playing slightly closer to second base and sometimes a little bit shallower. This position makes it easier to turn the double play. The first baseman is said to be holding the runner if he positions himself right at first base with one foot on the base, ready to receive a pickoff throw from the pitcher if the runner strays too far from first base between pitches. Bringing the corners in means the first and third baseman are both playing in (closer than usual to home plate); this will often be used with runners at third base or when a bunt is anticipated. The disadvantage of these defensive shifts is that they make more room for the hitter to hit the ball through the gaps for a base hit or lay down a successful bunt too far from any fielder to make a play resulting in an out. Sometimes in the bottom half of the ninth inning (or later), when a team has a runner on third base in a tie game with less than two outs, the defending team will pull the outfielders in very close, almost creating three extra infielders. This is sometimes known as do or die depth. The reason for positioning this way in this situation is that there is no point in having the outfielders playing deep, waiting to catch a fly ball for an out; if they do, the runner at third base will be able to tag up when the ball is caught and then run to home plate to score the winning run. So the outfielders can contribute constructively only by filling the gaps between the infielders. =Infield shift= Some extreme repositioning known as a shift has been used against pull hitters, a strategy that has become more prevalent in Major League Baseball since the late-2000s. For example, versus excellent left- handed pull-hitters like Ted Williams, David Ortiz, Joey Gallo and Ryan Howard, teams will move more players to the right side of the field. They sometimes play with the shortstop behind or even to the right of second base. The second baseman may simply move to the right, in which case this just qualifies as a shift, or he might move deeper into shallow right field. Another variation has the third baseman move to where the shortstop would play in the shift, leaving the shortstop (who is generally the team's best infielder) to cover the left side of the infield. Many believe that this shift was first employed against Ted Williams in the 1940s, as thought up by then- Indians manager Lou Boudreau. However, it was first used against Cy Williams in the 1920s.

Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu specifically, wanted \\"street\\" sumo prohibited and determined sumo should only be held for charitable purposes, and it was known as kanjin sumo. The wrestlers were also paid with extra revenue from these events. This is when the first organized competitions with paid wrestlers began. Written rankings, known as banzuke were introduced from 1761 and this is where the committee that organized these rankings began to emerge as an organization. In this time, sumo came to be called \\"≈åzum≈ç\\", \\"the big sumo\\" or professional sumo. In the 19th century, the Meiji Restoration leaders abolished the shogunate and the feudal system that supported it. In this restructuring, local rulers, or daimy≈ç lost the control they had over sumo and financing that had previously come from it. To adapt and survive, the association introduced the change to the system of salaries and directors that is known today. In 1884, Emperor Meiji went to see a sumo tournament which helped to give sumo wrestling a reputation as a national event. In the early 20th century, the sport had two competing associations, which had their seats in the two historic centers of sumo wrestling, Tokyo and Osaka. In the 1920s, the Tokyo Association made the offer of merging with the Osaka Association, and in 1927 the 88 \\"elders\\" of the Tokyo contingent and the 17 \\"elders\\" from the Osaka contingent merged to form the \\"Dai-Nihon Sum≈ç Kyokai\\". In the run-up to the merger during 1925 and 1926, a series of three joint tournaments was held to assess the relative strength of the rikishi in both organizations. Confirming the prevailing opinion that Osaka sumo was inferior, the Tokyo camp largely won out and wrestlers as high as ≈çzeki in Osaka sumo were relegated to the third makushita division in the new merged rankings. However, the yokozuna from both sides were maintained, as there was no precedent for demoting them, allowing Osaka sumo to save face. The first chairman of the directors was Lieutenant General Masanori Hirose, from 1928 until his death in 1938. His successor was Isamu Takeshita, an admiral in the Imperial Navy and a patron of the martial arts. In 1944, the first successor from the sumo world was chosen, the former Tsunenohana. After the war, the association was further modernized. Today, the association is ancillary to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.  Membership  Membership is obtained by purchasing, or inheriting a share (toshiyori kabu) in the Association, of which there are 105. The value of these shares is extremely high and rules only permit them to be purchased by former sumo wrestlers who either reached at least a san'yaku rank (komusubi or higher) or been ranked for a significant number of tournaments as a sekitori. Japanese citizenship is also required. Each share is associated with a particular name, and in the sumo world the former wrestler will be known by that name, usually with the suffix oyakata. The members are also often called elders in English. An exception to the purchase requirement is made for the most successful former yokozuna who may be offered a one-time membership (ichidai toshiyori) by the Association. Since this exception system has been in place, three former wrestlers, Taih≈ç, Kitanoumi and Takanohana have obtained this status. A fourth, Chiyonofuji, was offered this status but preferred a normal share. These four all achieved more than twenty tournament championships in their active careers. The members of the Association receive a salary and are expected to assist in the running of the Association, from selling tickets at the most junior level, to taking charge of one of the Association Departments as a director. These members are also the only persons given the authority to train new sumo wrestlers. They do this by opening or taking over a training stable, or heya (changed to beya as a suffix) which will in most cases take the same name as the member's elder name. Thus Dewanoumi-oyakata will be the owner of Dewanoumi-beya. Typically about 50% of the Association members have their own stable, while the rest are required to be affiliated with one and assist the principal owner. It is common for the most senior members of the Association to concentrate on their Association responsibilities and pass the day-to-day management of a stable to another. If a senior oyakata wishes to do this, the two may elect to swap names so that the stable can keep the more prestigious name. A recent example was in 1996, when the Association's chairman Dewanoumi-oyakata (former yokozuna Sadanoyama), swapped names with Sakaigawa-oyakata (former sekiwake Washuyama) who took over the running of Dewanoumi stable. See heya for more information. The Association Members are also split into various ranks. A new retiree will have oyakata rank, except for former ≈çzeki and yokozuna who are automatically granted Committee Member rank. The most experienced Association members are Committee Members. At the top are a group of elected riji or directors, who form the Association Board. The public face of sumo is presented by the chairman of the directors, called the rijich≈ç. He is effectively President of the Association. See toshiyori for more information. All members are required to retire when they reach the age of sixty five (with a possible five year extension if approved by Association Board), after which they can pass their stock to another, provided that person meets the Association's eligibility requirements. In the case of a one-time membership mentioned above the name merely lapses. In September 2008, at the Ministry of Education's insistence after a series of scandals hit sumo, three external Directors were appointed. One of the three, Hiroyoshi Murayama, served as acting Chairman for the July 2010 tournament while the then head, Musashigawa, was suspended.

Micrographs of osmotic pressure on red blood cells A human white blood cell (upper right) in water swells until it bursts (at ~14 seconds) Cytolysis, or osmotic lysis, occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to diffuse into the cell. Water can enter the cell by diffusion through the cell membrane or through selective membrane channels called aquaporins, which greatly facilitate the flow of water. It occurs in a hypotonic environment, where water moves into the cell by osmosis and causes its volume to increase to the point where the volume exceeds the membrane's capacity and the cell bursts. The presence of a cell wall prevents the membrane from bursting, so cytolysis only occurs in animal and protozoa cells which do not have cell walls. The reverse process is plasmolysis. In bacteria Osmotic lysis would be expected to occur when bacterial cells are treated with a hypotonic solution with added lysozyme, which destroys the bacteria's cell walls. Prevention Different cells and organisms have adapted different ways of preventing cytolysis from occurring. For example, the paramecium uses a contractile vacuole, which rapidly pumps out excessive water to prevent the build-up of water and the otherwise subsequent lysis.

However, archeological discoveries made between 1994 and 2005 found a Gallic necropolis which has been dated to the third century BC, and also call into debate both the exact location of the pre-Roman capital of the Parisii and the initial site of Lutetia, the Roman era Paris.Nanterre et les Parisii The large necropolis, as well as working people's homes from some time later in the ancient era, is near the bank of the Seine, in the northwest of Nanterre, and might be the sacred place that is being referred to etymologically. Lutetia is mentioned by Julius Caesar in 50 BCE, reporting an assembly in Lutetia in 53 BC between himself, commander of the Roman Legions, and local Gallic leaders. Although this had been thought to possibly be √éle de la Cit√©, largely since Caesar mentions an island, the river at Nanterre follows two channels around an island. In 52 BC, the Parisii took up arms with the Gallic war leader Vercingetorix, and were defeated by Titus Labienus, one of Caesar's legates. Caesar mentions in his Commentarii that the Parisii destroyed the bridges and set fire to Lutetia before the arrival of the Roman forces. The archeological work in Nanterre has suggested over 15 hectares of pre-Roman or Roman era construction. These archeologic findings may be an indication that Nanterre was the closest pre-Roman settlement to the city's modern centre.Histoire et Histoires: Du 5√®me Volume 1 Editions Depeyrot Paris 2014Ancient and Medieval Paris: A Background to the Gothic era.

In particle physics, CP stands for Charge+Parity or Charge-conjugation Parity symmetry: the combination of charge conjugation symmetry (C) and parity symmetry (P). According to the current mathematical formulation of quantum chromodynamics, a violation of CP-symmetry in strong interactions could occur. However, no violation of the CP-symmetry has ever been seen in any experiment involving only the strong interaction. As there is no known reason in QCD for it to necessarily be conserved, this is a \\"fine tuning\\" problem known as the strong CP problem. The strong CP problem is sometimes regarded as an unsolved problem in physics, and has been referred to as \\"the most underrated puzzle in all of physics.\\" There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem. The most well-known is Peccei‚ÄìQuinn theory, involving new pseudoscalar particles called axions. CP violation CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle were interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry, as charges of antiparticles are the negative of the corresponding particle), and then left and right were swapped (P symmetry). Experiments do not indicate any CP violation in the QCD sector. For example, a generic CP violation in the strongly interacting sector would create an electric dipole moment of the neutron which would be comparable to 10‚àí18 e¬∑m while the current experimental upper bound is roughly one billionth that size. =How CP can be violated in QCD= QCD does not violate the CP-symmetry as easily as the electroweak theory; unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to parity-violating chiral currents, the gluons of QCD couple to vector currents. The absence of any observed violation of CP- symmetry is a problem because there are natural terms in the QCD Lagrangian that are able to break the CP-symmetry. :{\\\\mathcal L} = -\\\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\\\mu u}F^{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{n_f g^2\\\\theta}{32\\\\pi^2} F_{\\\\mu u}\\\\tilde F^{\\\\mu u}+\\\\bar \\\\psi(i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu D_\\\\mu - m e^{i\\\\theta^{\\\\,\\\\prime}\\\\gamma_5})\\\\psi For a nonzero choice of the ' angle and the chiral quark mass phase ' one expects the CP-symmetry to be violated. If the chiral quark mass phase ' can be converted to a contribution to the total effective ' angle, it will have to be explained why this effective angle is extremely small instead of being of order one; the particular value of the angle that must be very close to zero (in this case) is an example of a fine-tuning problem in physics. If the phase ' is absorbed in the gamma-matrices, one has to explain why ' is small, but it will not be unnatural to set it equal to zero. If at least one of the quarks of the standard model were massless, ' would become unobservable; i.e. it would vanish from the theory. However, empirical evidence strongly suggests that none of the quarks are massless and so this solution to the strong CP problem fails.

An acid-base reaction takes place with the formation of zinc eugenolate chelate. The reaction is catalysed by water and is accelerated by the presence of metal salts. ZOE can be used as a dental filling material or dental cement in dentistry.Jack L. Ferracane, Materials in Dentistry: Principles and Applications, 2001, 2d Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Richard van Noort, 2002, Introduction to Dental Materials, 2d Edition, Elsevier Health Sciences, It is often used in dentistry when the decay is very deep or very close to the nerve or pulp chamber. Because the tissue inside the tooth, i.e. the pulp, reacts badly to the drilling stimulus (heat and vibration), it frequently becomes severely inflamed and precipitates a condition called acute or chronic pulpitis. This condition usually leads to severe chronic tooth sensitivity or actual toothache and can then only be treated with the removal of the nerve (pulp) called root canal therapy. For persons with a dry socket as a complication of tooth extraction, packing the dry socket with a eugenol-zinc oxide paste on iodoform gauze is effective for reducing acute pain. The placement of a ZOE \\"temporary\\" for a few to several days prior to the placement of the final filling can help to sedate the pulp. It is classified as an intermediate restorative material and has anaesthetic and antibacterial properties. It is sometimes used in the management of dental caries as a \\"temporary filling\\". ZOE cements were introduced in the 1890s. Zinc oxide eugenol is also used as an impression material during construction of complete dentures and is used in the mucostatic technique of taking impressions, usually in a special tray, (acrylic) produced after primary alginate impressions. However, ZOE is not usually used if the patient has large undercuts or tuberosities, whereby silicone impression materials would be better suited. Zinc oxide eugenol is also used as an antimicrobial additive in paint. Types According to ANSI/ADA Specification no:30 (ISO 3107) and depending on intended use and individual formulation designed for each specific purpose: * Composition The chemical composition of ZOE is typically:Zinc Oxide Eugenol Impression Pastes -A Study of an impression material- Chung Suck Lee, D.D.S. * Zinc oxide, ~69.0% * White rosin, ~29.3% * Zinc acetate, ~1.0% (improves strength) * Zinc stearate, ~0.7% (acts as accelerator) * Liquid (eugenol, ~85%, olive oil ~15%) ZOE impression pastes are dispensed as two separate pastes. One tube contains zinc oxide and vegetable or mineral oil; the other contains eugenol and rosin. The vegetable or mineral oil acts as a plasticizer and aids in offsetting the action of the eugenol as an irritant. Oil of cloves, which contains 70% to 85% eugenol, is sometimes used in preference to eugenol because it produces less burning sensation for patients when it contacts the soft tissues. The addition of rosin to the paste in the second tube facilitates the speed of the reaction and yields a smoother, more homogenous product. Canada balsam and Balsam of Peru are often used to increase flow and improve mixing properties. If the mixed paste is too thin or lacks body before it sets, a filler (such as a wax) or an inert powder (such as kaolin, talc, or diatomaceous earth) may be added to one or both of the original pastes.

The lender has the right, but not the obligation, to call the note due in such a circumstance. In real estate investing, the due-on-sale clause can be an impediment for a property owner who wishes to sell the property and have the buyer take over an existing loan rather than paying the loan off as part of the sale. Likewise, a due-on-sale clause would interfere with a seller's extension of financing to a buyer by using a wraparound mortgage, also called an \\"all-inclusive mortgage\\", \\"all-inclusive deed of trust\\", \\"all-inclusive trust deed\\", or \\"AITD.\\" Any of these arrangements triggers the due-on-sale clause in the seller's existing mortgage and thus the lender may call the loan due. If a property with a due-on-sale clause in the mortgage loan is transferred and the loan is not paid off, the bank could call the loan and then foreclose on the property if the buyer is unable to immediately tender the entire remaining balance on the loan. How likely this is depends on how the real estate economy is doing. If the buyer continues to pay the loan payments when due, it is less likely that the bank would actually call the loan due but it is still the bank's choice. In the early 1980s, with interest rates on new loans at 18%, banks frequently attempted to enforce due-on-sale clauses with respect to older loans that had been made at lower interest rates (especially those made prior to the 1973‚Äì75 recession and the ensuing stagflation), so they could retire those loans from their books, force buyers to obtain new loans to fund their transactions, and lend funds to them at higher interest rates. In the lending market of the 2010s, many observers believe that banks are not likely to enforce due-on-sale provisions unless they have another reason to call the loan due.  United States law  Virtually all mortgage loans made in the United States by institutional lenders in recent years contain a due-on-sale clause. These clauses are meant to require the loan to be paid in full in the case of a sale or conveyance of interest in the subject property. This is in contrast to the wide availability of assumable mortgages in the past. Assumable mortgages would allow a second party to assume the position of borrower and essentially adopt the agreement that is already in place between the buyer and the financial institution. Until 1982, the enforceability of due-on-sale provisions was basically a matter of state, not federal, law. Many states had adopted laws that permitted existing loans to be assumed by buyers whether or not the lender was willing to agree. The logic behind these laws was generally that a lender should be permitted to call a loan due when the property securing the loan is sold only if the lender could demonstrate that the sale and transfer of the property reduced the lender's security or increased the risk that the loan would go into default. However, in 1982 Congress passed the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act. Section 341a of the Act (codified in Title 12, U.S. Code, Section 1701j-3) makes the enforceability of due-on-sale provisions a federal issue and provides that if real estate loan documents contain a due-on-sale provision, that provision is enforceable if the property securing the loan is transferred without the lender's consent. Institutional lenders successfully lobbied Congress heavily to add Section 341a of the Act to federal law. Lenders are generally not required to include due-on-sale provisions in loans, but it is nearly universal practice for institutional lenders to include them. For loans by private lenders, such as financing extended to buyers by sellers, due-on-sale provisions are not always included. Also, a buyer and seller could negotiate to include due-on-sale clause that allows a one-time loan assumption. There are certain exceptions to enforceability of due-on-sale clauses. These are generally contained in Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 591. For example, borrowers may place their homes in their own trust without triggering the due-on-sale clause. \\"A lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.\\" (12 U.S.C. 1701j-3(d)(8)..[5].) Note that a beneficiary means possibly among multiple beneficiaries. Similarly, transfer of the borrower's home to a spouse as part of a divorce or dissolution of marriage generally does not trigger a due-on-sale clause. There are other exemptions in the law as well. Use trusts also facilitates transfers of property to heirs and minors. It may also protect the property of wealthy or risky owners against the possibility of future lawsuits or creditors because the trust, not the individuals at risk, owns the property.

This had led to the discovery that the fundamental constants and quantities fall into such an extraordinarily precise range that if it did not, the origin and evolution of conscious agents in the universe would not be permitted. Theories requiring fine-tuning are regarded as problematic in the absence of a known mechanism to explain why the parameters happen to have precisely the observed values that they return. The heuristic rule that parameters in a fundamental physical theory should not be too fine-tuned is called naturalness.  Background  The idea that naturalness will explain fine tuning was brought into question by Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist, in his talk \\"Why is there a Macroscopic Universe?\\", a lecture from the mini-series \\"Multiverse & Fine Tuning\\" from the \\"Philosophy of Cosmology\\" project, a University of Oxford and Cambridge Collaboration 2013. In it he describes how naturalness has usually provided a solution to problems in physics; and that it had usually done so earlier than expected. However, in addressing the problem of the cosmological constant, naturalness has failed to provide an explanation though it would have been expected to have done so a long time ago. The necessity of fine-tuning leads to various problems that do not show that the theories are incorrect, in the sense of falsifying observations, but nevertheless suggest that a piece of the story is missing. For example, the cosmological constant problem (why is the cosmological constant so small?); the hierarchy problem; and the strong CP problem, among others. Also, Dongshan He's team has suggested a possible solution for the fine tuned Cosmological constant by the universe creation from nothing model.  Example  An example of a fine-tuning problem considered by the scientific community to have a plausible \\"natural\\" solution is the cosmological flatness problem, which is solved if inflationary theory is correct: inflation forces the universe to become very flat, answering the question of why the universe is today observed to be flat to such a high degree.  Measurement  Although fine-tuning was traditionally measured by ad hoc fine-tuning measures, such as the Barbieri-Giudice-Ellis measure, over the past decade many scientists recognized that fine-tuning arguments were a specific application of Bayesian statistics.

He became the 48th yokozuna in 1961 at the age of 21, the youngest ever at the time. He won 32 tournament championships between 1960 and 1971, a record that was unequalled until 2014. His dominance was such that he won six tournaments in a row on two separate occasions. He is the only wrestler to win at least one championship every year of his top division career, and he won 45 consecutive matches between 1968 and 1969, which at the time the best winning streak since Futabayama in the 1930s. He was a popular grand champion, especially amongst women and children. After retiring from active competition he became a sumo coach, although health problems meant he had limited success. When he died in January 2013 he was widely cited as the greatest sumo wrestler of the post-war period. Since then Hakuh≈ç, who regarded Taih≈ç as a mentor, surpassed his record by winning his 33rd championship in January 2015. Early career K≈çki was born on the island of Sakhalin (Karafuto Prefecture) to a Japanese mother Kiyo NayaOfficial website of Taiho and an ethnic Ukrainian father Markiyan Boryshko who had fled the Bolshevik Revolution. However, he is regarded as having come from Teshikaga, Hokkaid≈ç, where he moved to as a child after the Soviet Union took control of Sakhalin in 1945. While on a sumo tour to the Soviet Union in 1965 he tried to locate his father, but without success. Taih≈ç was the first of three great yokozuna who all hailed from Hokkaid≈ç, the most northerly of the main islands of Japan and who among them dominated sumo during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The others were Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji. He entered sumo in September 1956, joining Nishonoseki stable. He initially fought under his real name of Naya K≈çki. Upon promotion to the second j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1959 he was given the shikona (ring name) of \\"Taih≈ç\\", meaning \\"Great peng\\" (\\"peng\\" is often translated to \\"phoenix\\"). Taih≈ç rapidly rose through the ranks after his debut in the top makuuchi division in January 1960. He was a runner-up in his first top division tournament and was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. At sekiwake rank in November 1960 he won the first of his former record 32 tournament championships and earned promotion to ≈çzeki. Following two consecutive tournament victories (his second and third) he became a yokozuna in September 1961, less than two years after his top division debut. Because the island of Sakhalin is/was claimed as a Japanese territory, Taih≈ç is not considered the first non-Japanese yokozuna. Yokozuna At the time of his promotion Taih≈ç was the youngest wrestler ever to have achieved sumo's highest rank of yokozuna aged 21 years and three months, a record subsequently surpassed by Kitanoumi who was one month younger. In a fashion which is considered to be exceptional for a newly promoted yokozuna he also managed to win his first tournament subsequent to his promotion. He was promoted simultaneously with Kashiwado, and their rivalry created what became known as the Hakuh≈ç era. Although Kashiwado was to win only five tournament championships, Taih≈ç was to remark, \\"There was Taih≈ç because there was Kashiwado. There was Kashiwado because there was Taih≈ç.\\" Outside of competition they had a genuine friendship, which continued until Kashiwado's death in 1996. Taih≈ç outperformed Kashiwado very quickly, and during his tenure in sumo's highest rank he was dominant, especially in the early part of his career. Until 2005‚Äîwhen the 68th yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ bettered his record‚Äîhe was the only post-war yokozuna to have achieved six tournament victories consecutively, a feat he managed on two separate occasions. Eight of Taih≈ç's championships were achieved with a perfect record of 15 wins and no losses (zensh≈ç-y≈´sh≈ç), a record that stood until 2013 when it was broken by Hakuh≈ç. He came back from a long term injury in 1968 and embarked on a 45 bout winning streak that was broken in March 1969 only after an incorrect decision by the judges. This caused such a furor that video replays were introduced after the incident. His final championship came in January 1971 after a playoff with Tamanoumi, maintaining his record of winning at least one championship every year of his top division career. He had a good score of 12‚Äì3 in the following tournament, but announced his retirement five days into the May 1971 tournament after losing to the promising young wrestler Takanohana for the second time. He had been a yokozuna for nearly ten years. His career win ratio was in excess of 80%, which is also a post-war record. He became the first former rikishi to be offered (and accept) membership of the Japan Sumo Association without having to purchase a share (ichidai toshiyori), in recognition of his great achievements. After retirement Taih≈ç K≈çki at a yokozuna deliberation committee (December 23, 2011) Taih≈ç branched off from his old heya and opened Taih≈ç stable in December 1971. In February 1977, at the age of 36, he suffered a stroke, and his subsequent health problems may have played a part in him being passed over for the chairmanship of the Sumo Association. He had extensive rehabilitation sessions to get the left side of his body moving again. In general he did not manage to replicate his own wrestling success as a trainer, but he did produce ≈åzutsu, a sekiwake who fought in 78 consecutive top division tournaments from 1979 to 1992. He had his kanreki dohy≈ç-iri ceremony to mark his 60th birthday in 2000, although his restricted mobility meant he could not perform it in full. In May 2002 Taih≈ç recruited the Russian wrestler Roh≈ç. He handed over control of his stable to his son-in-law, ex-sekiwake Takat≈çriki, in February 2003. Taih≈ç reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in May 2005 and became the curator of the Sumo Museum at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. He still maintained close contact with his old stable, inviting yokozuna Hakuh≈ç to train there in May 2008. Taih≈ç was awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon by the Japanese government in 2004. In November 2009, he was one of 15 people to receive the Person of Cultural Merit award from the Japanese government, becoming the first sumo wrestler to be so honoured. After suffering a stroke at 36 in 1977, Taih≈ç used a wheelchair in the last stage of his life. He died of heart failure in a Tokyo hospital on January 19, 2013 at the age of 72. His death was announced by the Japan Sumo Association. In its obituary, Nikkan Sports named him \\"the strongest yokozuna in history.\\" In February 2013, he posthumously became the second sumo wrestler to be commended with the People's Honour Award, with Yoshihide Suga calling him a \\"national hero.\\" After winning the March 2013 championship, Hakuh≈ç urged the crowd to get to their feet and honour Taih≈ç's memory with a moment of silence. He said that Taih≈ç gave him regular advice, and told him that records are meant to be broken. Hakuh≈ç would indeed surpass Taih≈ç's all-time championship record by winning his 33rd yush≈ç in January 2015, two years after Taih≈ç's death. Fighting style Taih≈ç was noted for his skill and power when he grabbed his opponents' mawashi or belt‚Äì techniques known as yotsu-sumo. His preferred grip was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning move was yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for about 30 percent of his wins. His most frequently used throws were sukuinage (the beltless scoop throw) and uwatenage (the overarm throw). He was particularly diligent about training, and was known to invite every new member of the top division to train with him. Family He married in 1966 at the height of his fame (coincidentally, the final day of the May Tournament that year, which he won, was also his 26th birthday), to the daughter of a ryokan proprietor. Their lavish reception at the Imperial Hotel was attended by 1000 guests and over 200 reporters. He was the first to hold a press conference afterwards, now a common occurrence with sumo marriages. Taih≈ç's youngest daughter married the former sekiwake Takatoriki, who took over the running of Taih≈ç stable (renamed ≈åtake stable) after Taih≈ç's retirement. When ≈åtake was dismissed from sumo after a gambling scandal, he divorced Taih≈ç's daughter. Taih≈ç's grandson Konosuke Naya (born 2000) joined ≈åtake stable as a professional sumo wrestler in January 2018, using Naya as his shikona. He was followed into sumo by his brothers Kosei in November 2019 and Takamori in March 2020. Taih≈ç's fourth and eldest grandson, Yukio Naya (born 1994), is a professional wrestler.

This work inspired many authors in the systems movement, such as scientists Mario Bunge (1979), Paul Watzlawick (1990) and Russell L. Ackoff (1999), and systems designers Ken Orr (1981) and Grady Booch (1991).The authors listed have mentioned the book as a reference in their work. = Gall's law = Gall's Law is a rule of thumb for systems design from Gall's book Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail. It states: This law is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification: it can be used to explain the success of systems like the World Wide Web and Blogosphere, which grew from simple to complex systems incrementally, and the failure of systems like CORBA, which began with complex specifications. Gall's Law has strong affinities to the practice of agile software development.Russel Winder, Graham Roberts (2006) Developing Java software. p.427 Although dubbed Gall's Law by some, the phrase is not labeled as such in the original work. The work cites Murphy's Law and the Peter Principle, and is filled with similar sayings. Although the quote may seem to validate the merits of simple systems, it is preceded by the qualifier \\"A simple system may or may not work.\\" (p. 70). This philosophy can also be attributed to extreme programming, which encourages doing the simplest thing first and adding features later. One of the first systems designers to quote Gall's law was Ken Orr in 1981.Ken Orr (1981) Structured requirements definition Notable were the quotations of Gall's Law by Grady Booch since 1991,Grady Booch (1991) Object oriented design with applications p.11. and 1994, 1997, 2007, 2009 which were mentioned in multiple sources.Ian Graham (1995) Migrating to object technology. p.144 mentions: \\"Booch (1994) quotes Gall on this subject: 'A complex system that works ...\\"The C++ report (1999) Vol. 11, p. 57 states: \\"To emphasize this point, Booch ' quotes Gall2: A complex system that works...\\"Pierre Pezziardi (2006) Une politique pour le syst√®me d'information. p.126 states in French: \\"John Gall en 2006 repris en 1994 par Grady Booch ‚Äì un des p√®res de l'objet ‚Äì indiquaient : ¬´ A complex system that works...

He was the dominant yokozuna in sumo during the 1970s. Kitanoumi was promoted to yokozuna at the age 21, becoming the youngest ever to achieve sumo's top rank, and he remained a yokozuna for a record 63 tournaments. He won 24 tournament championships during his career and was one of a series of truly great yokozuna who came from Hokkaid≈ç, the northernmost main island of Japan. At the time of his death he still held the record for most bouts won as a yokozuna (670). Following his retirement in 1985 he established the Kitanoumi stable. He was chairman of the Japan Sumo Association from 2002 until 2008, and from 2012 until his death. Career Born in S≈çbetsu, Usu District, Kitanoumi began his professional career in January 1967 at 13, whilst still in middle school. He joined Mihogaseki stable, and was promoted to sumo's second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1971 and the top makuuchi division a year later. He won his first top division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship in January 1974 and was promoted to ≈çzeki immediately afterwards. He secured promotion to yokozuna just three tournaments after that. At 21 years 2 months, he was the youngest ever yokozuna, beating the previous record held by Taih≈ç by one month. Kitanoumi was the most successful wrestler in sumo for the rest of the 1970s. His dominance, and perceived stern demeanour, meant that he was not that popular with the general public. When he was defeated by underdog Takanohana in a playoff for the championship in September 1975, the audience threw so many zabuton‚Äîor cushions‚Äîinto the ring in delight, that Kitanoumi said he could \\"hardly see the ceiling\\". He was known for not offering a defeated opponent a hand to get back to their feet, and was also notoriously monosyllabic when being interviewed by reporters. His best year was 1978, when he won 5 of the 6 tournaments and won 82 out of a possible 90 bouts, a record that stood until 2005. His chief rival during these years was Wajima, but Kitanoumi was much more consistent. He was heavy at 169 kg, was extremely strong and had excellent balance. He was also remarkably injury free and rarely missed a tournament. From July 1973 until September 1981 he chalked up fifty consecutive kachi-koshi, or tournament records of at least 8 wins out of 15, which is a record for the top division. By the beginning of the 1980s he had a new rival, Chiyonofuji, who earned promotion to ≈çzeki and then yokozuna by defeating him in decisive matches in January and July 1981. In November 1981 Kitanoumi withdrew from a tournament for the first time. After that his record was patchy, with many absences. His 24th and final title came in May 1984, with a perfect 15‚Äì0 record. This was seen by many as a fitting end to a great career and he wanted to retire after that tournament, but was persuaded by the Sumo Association to carry on until the opening of the new Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan stadium in January 1985. Three days into the tournament, without winning a match, he announced his retirement. He had been ranked as a yokozuna on the banzuke in 63 tournaments, which remained the most in history until Hakuho surpassed it in May 2018. During his career he had won 951 matches, the most in history at the time (he was overtaken by ≈åshio in 1987). Of those victories, 804 came in the top division (a record broken by Chiyonofuji in 1991), and 670 of those came at the yokozuna rank. After retirement Takanohana in 2013. Kitanoumi was honoured for his great achievements by being offered membership of the Japan Sumo Association without having to purchase a share (ichidai toshiyori). He was the second rikishi after Taih≈ç to be given this honour. As a result, he was able to keep his sumo name after retirement. He opened up his own training stable, Kitanoumi-beya, taking several wrestlers from Mihogaseki stable who had already been under his wing. Kitanoumi stable is one of the largest in sumo, and has produced a handful of top division wrestlers over the years, such as maegashira Gany≈´, Kitazakura and Kitataiki. He also inherited Russian wrestler Hakurozan, who joined the stable in 2006. In 2002 Kitanoumi became head of the Sumo Association. He was the first chairman under the age of 50 in half a century, and his appointment was widely welcomed; however, he came under pressure after a series of scandals hit sumo. These included the behaviour of yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´, who was suspended for two tournaments in 2007 but then allowed to return to Mongolia, the death of junior wrestler Tokitaizan at Tokitsukaze stable, and the dismissal of several top wrestlers for using cannabis. When it became clear in September 2008 that one of them was his own wrestler Hakurozan, whom he had previously backed, Kitanoumi resigned his post, apologizing for \\"the trouble I have caused to the Sumo Association and to fans\\". He remained on the board of directors, in charge of running the Osaka tournament, but had to resign from that position in April 2011 after another of his wrestlers, Kiyoseumi, was found guilty of match-fixing and forced to retire from sumo. After Hanaregoma stepped down in February 2012, Kitanoumi returned to the role of chairman, the first person to head the association twice. Death Kitanoumi died of colorectal cancer and multiple organ failure on the evening of November 20, 2015. He was in Fukuoka for the Kyushu tournament and was taken to hospital for anemia in the morning, after which his condition deteriorated. A memorial service was held on December 22 at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. Fighting style Kitanoumi's favourite kimarite or techniques were hidari-yotsu (a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on the opponent's mawashi), yorikiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

The school opened as Mercer Institute with 39 students on January 14, 1833. The school was named for Jesse Mercer,The University of Texas at Austin dissertation entitled Jesse Mercer: A Study in Frontier Religion was completed in 1950 by the historian Robert W. Mondy. a prominent Baptist leader who provided a founding endowment and who served as the first chairman of the board of trustees. The Georgia General Assembly granted a university charter in December 1837. Mercer adopted its present name in 1838 and graduated its first university class, of three students, in 1841. In 1871, Mercer moved to Macon, a center of transportation and commerce in Georgia. The School of Law was established in 1873 and was named the Walter F. George School of Law in 1947 in honor of Mercer alumnus Walter F. George, class of 1901, who served as a United States Senator from Georgia and as President pro tempore of the United States Senate. During World War II, Mercer was one of 131 colleges and universities in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered military training that prepared students for a commission in the United States Navy. =Expansion (1959‚Äì2013)= Mercer expanded to Atlanta in 1959 when the university absorbed the independent Southern School of Pharmacy. The College of Liberal Arts, the School of Law, and the Southern School of Pharmacy comprised the university until 1972 when Mercer merged with Atlanta Baptist College, which became Mercer's Atlanta campus. Atlanta Baptist College was founded in 1968 under the leadership of Dr. Monroe F. Swilley, a prominent Baptist educator. The college merged with Mercer in 1972 and became the College of Arts and Sciences, and in 1984 was named the Cecil B. Day College of Arts and Sciences. Mercer offered undergraduate liberal arts education in Atlanta until 1990 when the college closed. Faculty and students tried to prevent the closure, but were not successful. The mission of the Atlanta campus changed to graduate and professional education. The Southern School of Pharmacy moved in 1992 from its downtown location to the Cecil B. Day Graduate and Professional Campus. Between 1982 and 2013, Mercer established nine additional colleges and schools: the School of Medicine in 1982, the Eugene W. Stetson School of Business and Economics in 1984, the School of Engineering in 1985, the James and Carolyn McAfee School of Theology in 1994, the Tift College of Education in 1995, the Georgia Baptist College of Nursing in 2001, the College of Continuing and Professional Studies in 2003 (renamed Penfield College of Mercer University in 2014), the Townsend School of Music in 2006, and the College of Health Professions in 2013. Mercer opened its second four-year medical school in Savannah in 2008 and the multi-campus Mercer University Health Sciences Center in 2012. Mercer received a $5 million grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation in 2009 to support continued revitalization of the College Hill Corridor between campus and downtown Macon. The Mercer On Mission service-learning program, launched in 2007, has been recognized by the Clinton Global Initiative as \\"an exemplary approach to addressing a specific global challenge.\\" It helps students combine research, study abroad and service-learning under faculty direction. The multi-campus Mercer University Health Sciences Center, which incorporates programs offered by the School of Medicine, the College of Pharmacy, the Georgia Baptist College of Nursing, and the new College of Health Professions, opened in 2013. The College of Health Professions, authorized by the board of trustees in 2012, is Mercer's twelfth academic unit. Mercer purchased the former Georgia Music Hall of Fame building in downtown Macon in 2012; the extensively renovated building reopened in 2014 as the home of Mercer Medicine, a multi- specialty physician clinic and a division of the School of Medicine. Mercer opened a large retail-residential center on the Macon campus in 2011. The center, called Mercer Lofts, houses the Barnes & Noble operated university bookstore, other shops, and student apartments. Mercer Lofts II, a mixed-use development adjacent to Phase I, opened in 2012; the facility houses Mercer's Center for Collaborative Journalism, which consists of the university's journalism department and the editorial-professional staffs of the Macon Telegraph and Georgia Public Broadcasting (on the first floor) along with student apartments (on upper floors). Also in 2012, the university opened a new admissions and welcome center on the Macon campus; the center is named for Emily Parker Myers, a long-time university administrator, and is the university's first LEED certified building. In 2013, Mercer completed Cruz Plaza, a major landscaping project for the Macon campus central quadrangle linking the University Center (Hawkins Arena), Tarver Library, and Connell Student Center. Religious affiliation Mercer, founded by early 19th- century Baptists, ended its affiliation with the Georgia Baptist Convention in 2006 after 173 years. Before the affiliation ended, Mercer had an independent board of trustees; the convention provided financial support but did not control the university. The lack of control caused friction, with Mercer resisting restraints on social issues while the convention saw Mercer as becoming secularized and not conforming to its values. =\\"Aspire ‚Äì The Campaign for Mercer University\\" (2014‚Äì2018)= University Center (Hawkins Arena) On October 31, 2014, Mercer announced an effort to raise $400 million, including $207 million for its endowment, $109 million for capital projects, and $84 million for operations.Mercer University announces launch of $400 million capital campaign . Macon.com. Retrieved 2014-11-12. By its public launch, $90 million in gifts and pledges had been collected. The campaign aims to fund a $15 million medical education facility in Savannah, ground was broken on October 14, 2014;Memorial, Mercer break ground on medical school expansion.

In athletics, Mercer has added programs in men's lacrosse, sand volleyball, and football; constructed a new football and lacrosse complex, named Five Star Stadium (10,200 seats); and changed affiliation to the Southern Conference. In 2014, Mercer set an enrollment record in the fall of 2014 with a university-wide population of 8,557 students. The larger student body reflects expanded academic programs including five new doctoral degrees: Doctor of Philosophy in Curriculum and Instruction, Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Philosophy in Clinical Medical Psychology. Mercer opened its second four-year medical school, in Savannah, in 2008. Mercer opened Mercer Lofts III in 2014; the facility is a large student-housing complex on College Street next to Tattnall Square Park and the university's historic north quadrangle. Also in 2014, Mercer completed an extensive renovation of the historic Amanda Bell House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places; the building houses the Robert McDuffie Center for Strings of the Townsend School of Music and is one of the finest conservatory facilities in the nation. Mercer's television station, WMUB (Mercer University Broadcasting), opened a new studio in Mercer Village in 2014 as a part of the university's Center for Collaborative Journalism. The M. Diane Owens Garden, named for the first female chair of Mercer's board of trustees, a large environmentally friendly fountain and garden area near Five Star Stadium, was dedicated in 2014. The garden complements Cruz Plaza, completed in 2013, as a major landscaping project beautifying the Macon campus. Mercer Lofts IV, known as the Lofts at College Hill, opened in 2015; the housing-retail complex is designed for graduate and professional students and is located adjacent to Macon's main post office between College Street and Interstate 75, near the Walter F. George School of Law. Mercer's Tattnall Square Center for the Arts also opened in 2015; the center is the former Tattnall Square Presbyterian Church, near the historic north quadrangle, and now houses the university theater department and is a community performing arts center. Mercer Lofts V, known as the Lofts at Mercer Landing, opened in 2016 adjacent to Five Star Stadium near the Mercer University Drive exit from Interstate 75; a new campus entrance and a pedestrian bridge connecting the campus and the complex are also complete. The facility provides student housing, university offices, and a large parking garage; retail-food facilities and a second on-campus hotel, operated by Marriott TownePlace Suites, are a part of the complex as well, located directly across Mercer University Drive from the university's Hilton Garden Inn. Mercer's other construction projects in recent years include renovation and expansion of the School of Medicine facility in Savannah (completed 2016), a new undergraduate residence hall in Macon named Legacy Hall (completed 2016), and a renovated and enlarged baseball facility named OrthoGeorgia Park at Claude Smith Field (completed 2017). =\\"Inspire: Mercer's Vision for the Decade Ahead\\" (2018‚Äìpresent)= Mercer's Board of Trustees on April 20, 2018, approved a new strategic plan that succeeds the 2008 plan, which saw the institution reclassified as a national research university, admitted to the Georgia Research Alliance, granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, growth of 41 percent in undergraduate enrollment, a near doubling of research expenditures, investment of more than $200 million in new facilities, and an increase of endowment to more than $300 million. The 2018 strategic plan, titled Inspire: Mercer's Vision for the Decade Ahead, has seven imperatives: be an intimate and diverse community of gifted scholars committed to changing the world; be a place of discovery and innovation; be a global university; be relevant; achieve meaningful outcomes; compete with the best, and be true to its heritage. Mercer Village, location of the university bookstore, other shops, student apartments, and the Center for Collaborative Journalism (newspaper, radio, television) Mercer has launched second and third medical school campuses (in Savannah and Columbus), started a master's-level physician assistant program and a doctoral-level program in physical therapy, and added doctoral programs in clinical psychology, nursing, counseling, educational leadership, and curriculum and instruction. Reflecting an increased emphasis on research, Mercer meets criteria established by the Carnegie Foundation for classification as a research-doctoral university; the number of doctoral students has increased from fewer than 35 to more than 250. In addition, annual externally funded research expenditures now exceed $36 million due to increased funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Georgia Research Alliance; plus new funding as eminent cancer scientists by the Georgia Cancer Coalition. Mercer students have earned national recognition and prestigious Fulbright, Goldwater, Teach For America and Peace Corps scholarships and appointments; , two of the last three recipients of the Gulf South Summit Award for Outstanding Student Contributions to Service-Learning have been Mercer students and Mercer ranks among the top three institutions in the Southeast for placement of Peace Corps volunteers among colleges and universities with fewer than 5,000 undergraduate students. The University dedicated in April 2018 the new $44 million Godsey Science Center. The largest academic facility project in the university's history, the science center includes 60 teaching and research labs, three medium classrooms (75 to 100 students each), four small classrooms (32 students each) and 46 offices for Mercer's biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and neuroscience programs. Mercer began construction on Phase II of the Mercer Landing development in early 2018. The project, located adjacent to the residential loft complex completed in 2016, will provide more student housing and more parking for the complex and for Five Star Stadium, which is located across Mercer University Drive. = Presidents = Billington Sanders, Mercer's first President * Billington McCarthy Sanders (1833‚Äì1840) * Otis Smith (1840‚Äì1844) * John Leadley Dagg (1844‚Äì1854) * Nathaniel Macon Crawford(1854‚Äì1856) * Shelton Palmer Sanford (acting President; 1856‚Äì1858) * Nathaniel Macon Crawford (1858‚Äì1866) * Henry Holcombe Tucker (1866‚Äì1871) * Archibald John Battle (1872‚Äì1889) * Gustavus Alonzo Nunnally (1889‚Äì1893) * Joseph Edgerton Willet (acting President; 1893) * James Bruton Gambrell (1893‚Äì1896) * Pinckney Daniel Pollock (1896‚Äì1903) * William Heard Kilpatrick (acting President; 1903‚Äì1905) * Charles Lee Smith (1905‚Äì1906) * Samuel Young Jameson (1906‚Äì1913) * James Freeman Sellers (acting President; 1913‚Äì1914) * William Lowndes Pickard (1914‚Äì1918) * Rufus Washington Weaver (1918‚Äì1927) * Andrew Phillip Montague (acting President; 1927‚Äì1928) * Spright Dowell (1928‚Äì1953) * George Boyce Connell (1953‚Äì1959) * Spright Dowell (interim President; 1959‚Äì1960) * Rufus Carrollton Harris (1960‚Äì1979) * Raleigh Kirby Godsey (1979‚Äì2006) * William D.

The shape of the Fermi surface is derived from the periodicity and symmetry of the crystalline lattice and from the occupation of electronic energy bands. The existence of a Fermi surface is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows a maximum of one electron per quantum state.N. Ashcroft and N.D. Mermin, Solid-State Physics, W.A. Harrison, Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids, VRML Fermi Surface DatabaseJ. M. Ziman, Electrons in Metals: A short Guide to the Fermi Surface (Taylor & Francis, London, 1963), ASIN B0007JLSWS. Theory 2D ACAR. Consider a spin-less ideal Fermi gas of N particles. According to Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics, the mean occupation number of a state with energy \\\\epsilon_i is given by \\\\langle n_i\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{1}{e^{(\\\\epsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T}+1}, where, *\\\\left\\\\langle n_i\\\\right\\\\rangle is the mean occupation number of the i^{th} state *\\\\epsilon_i is the kinetic energy of the i^{th} state *\\\\mu is the chemical potential (at zero temperature, this is the maximum kinetic energy the particle can have, i.e. Fermi energy E_{\\\\rm F}) *T is the absolute temperature *k_{\\\\rm B} is the Boltzmann constant Suppose we consider the limit T\\\\to 0. Then we have, \\\\left\\\\langle n_i\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\approx\\\\begin{cases}1 & (\\\\epsilon_i<\\\\mu) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (\\\\epsilon_i>\\\\mu)\\\\end{cases}. By the Pauli exclusion principle, no two fermions can be in the same state. Therefore, in the state of lowest energy, the particles fill up all energy levels below the Fermi energy E_{\\\\rm F}, which is equivalent to saying that E_{\\\\rm F} is the energy level below which there are exactly N states. In momentum space, these particles fill up a sphere of radius k_{\\\\rm F}, the surface of which is called the Fermi surface.K. Huang, Statistical Mechanics (2000), p. 244 The linear response of a metal to an electric, magnetic or thermal gradient is determined by the shape of the Fermi surface, because currents are due to changes in the occupancy of states near the Fermi energy. In reciprocal space, the Fermi surface of an ideal Fermi gas is a sphere of radius k_{\\\\rm F} = \\\\frac{p_{\\\\rm F}}{\\\\hbar}= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2 m E_{\\\\rm F}}} {\\\\hbar}, determined by the valence electron concentration where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant. A material whose Fermi level falls in a gap between bands is an insulator or semiconductor depending on the size of the bandgap. When a material's Fermi level falls in a bandgap, there is no Fermi surface. Figure 2. A view of the graphite Fermi surface at the corner H points of the Brillouin zone showing the trigonal symmetry of the electron and hole pockets. Materials with complex crystal structures can have quite intricate Fermi surfaces. The figure 2 illustrates the anisotropic Fermi surface of graphite, which has both electron and hole pockets in its Fermi surface due to multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy along the \\\\mathbf{k}_z direction. Often in a metal the Fermi surface radius k_{\\\\rm F} is larger than the size of the first Brillouin zone which results in a portion of the Fermi surface lying in the second (or higher) zones. As with the band structure itself, the Fermi surface can be displayed in an extended-zone scheme where \\\\mathbf{k} is allowed to have arbitrarily large values or a reduced-zone scheme where wavevectors are shown modulo \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi} {a} (in the 1-dimensional case) where a is the lattice constant. In the three-dimensional case the reduced zone scheme means that from any wavevector \\\\mathbf{k} there is an appropriate number of reciprocal lattice vectors \\\\mathbf{K} subtracted that the new \\\\mathbf{k} now is closer to the origin in \\\\mathbf{k}-space than to any \\\\mathbf{K}. Solids with a large density of states at the Fermi level become unstable at low temperatures and tend to form ground states where the condensation energy comes from opening a gap at the Fermi surface. Examples of such ground states are superconductors, ferromagnets, Jahn‚ÄìTeller distortions and spin density waves. The state occupancy of fermions like electrons is governed by Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics so at finite temperatures the Fermi surface is accordingly broadened. In principle all fermion energy level populations are bound by a Fermi surface although the term is not generally used outside of condensed-matter physics. Experimental determination Electronic Fermi surfaces have been measured through observation of the oscillation of transport properties in magnetic fields H, for example the de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect (dHvA) and the Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect (SdH). The former is an oscillation in magnetic susceptibility and the latter in resistivity. The oscillations are periodic versus 1/H and occur because of the quantization of energy levels in the plane perpendicular to a magnetic field, a phenomenon first predicted by Lev Landau. The new states are called Landau levels and are separated by an energy \\\\hbar \\\\omega_{\\\\rm c} where \\\\omega_{\\\\rm c} = eH/m^*c is called the cyclotron frequency, e is the electronic charge, m^* is the electron effective mass and c is the speed of light. In a famous result, Lars Onsager proved that the period of oscillation \\\\Delta H is related to the cross-section of the Fermi surface (typically given in √Ö‚àí2) perpendicular to the magnetic field direction A_{\\\\perp} by the equation > A_{\\\\perp} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi e \\\\Delta H}{\\\\hbar c}. Thus the determination of the periods of oscillation for various applied field directions allows mapping of the Fermi surface. Observation of the dHvA and SdH oscillations requires magnetic fields large enough that the circumference of the cyclotron orbit is smaller than a mean free path. Therefore, dHvA and SdH experiments are usually performed at high-field facilities like the High Field Magnet Laboratory in Netherlands, Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France, the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory in Japan or the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in the United States. Figure 3. Fermi surface of BSCCO measured by ARPES. The experimental data shown as an intensity plot in yellow-red-black scale. Green dashed rectangle represents the Brillouin zone of the CuO2 plane of BSCCO. The most direct experimental technique to resolve the electronic structure of crystals in the momentum-energy space (see reciprocal lattice), and, consequently, the Fermi surface, is the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). An example of the Fermi surface of superconducting cuprates measured by ARPES is shown in the figure 3. With positron annihilation it is also possible to determine the Fermi surface as the annihilation process conserves the momentum of the initial particle. Since a positron in a solid will thermalize prior to annihilation, the annihilation radiation carries the information about the electron momentum. The corresponding experimental technique is called angular correlation of electron positron annihilation radiation (ACAR) as it measures the angular deviation from of both annihilation quanta. In this way it is possible to probe the electron momentum density of a solid and determine the Fermi surface. Furthermore, using spin polarized positrons, the momentum distribution for the two spin states in magnetized materials can be obtained. ACAR has many advantages and disadvantages compared to other experimental techniques: It does not rely on UHV conditions, cryogenic temperatures, high magnetic fields or fully ordered alloys. However, ACAR needs samples with a low vacancy concentration as they act as effective traps for positrons. In this way, the first determination of a smeared Fermi surface in a 30% alloy was obtained in 1978.

Geography The largest of the Near Islands are Attu and Agattu, which shelter a few rocks in the channel between them. The other important islands are the Semichi Islands to their northeast, notable among which are Alaid, Nizki and Shemya. About 20 miles to the east-southeast from Shemya are small rocky reefs known as the Ingenstrem Rocks. The total land area of all of the Near Islands is 1,143.785 km¬≤ (441.618 sq mi), and their total population was 47 persons as of the 2000 census. The only populated island is Shemya; the U.S. Coast Guard station on Attu closed in 2010 and all inhabitants left the island later that year. History The islands were named Near Islands by Russian explorers in the 18th century because they were the nearest of the Aleutian Islands to Russia (that is, if one excludes the Commander Islands). During the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Near Islands in 1942, being the first foreign military to occupy American soil since the War of 1812.

He was an early influence on the field of exoplanet detection, discovery, and characterization. Marcy was Professor of Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley and an Adjunct Professor of Physics and Astronomy at San Francisco State University before stepping down in October 2015. His colleagues in the Berkeley Astronomy Department forced him to resign after allegations of sexual harassment. Marcy and his research teams are recognized for discovering many extrasolar planets, including 70 out of the first 100 known exoplanets and also the first planetary system around a Sun-like star, Upsilon Andromedae. Marcy was a co-Investigator on the NASA Kepler mission. His collaborators have included R. Paul Butler, Debra Fischer and Steven S. Vogt, Jason Wright, Andrew Howard, Katie Peek, John Johnson, Erik Petigura, Lauren Weiss, Lea Hirsch and the Kepler Science Team. Early life and education Marcy graduated from Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, California, in 1972. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude with a double major in physics and astronomy from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1976. He then completed a doctorate in astronomy in 1982 at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with much of his work done at Lick Observatory. Academic career Marcy has held teaching and research positions, first at the Carnegie Institution of Washington (then the Mt. Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories) as a Carnegie Fellow from 1982 to 1984. He then worked as an Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy from 1984 to 1996 and then as a Distinguished University Professor from 1997 to 1999 at the San Francisco State University. Marcy was a Professor of Astronomy and the Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair for SETI at the University of California, Berkeley from 1999 through 2015. In 2015, he resigned after being found in violation of UC Berkeley's sexual harassment policy. From 2000 to 2012, he was the Director of UC Berkeley's Center for Integrative Planetary Science. Marcy was also one of the project leaders of the Breakthrough Initiatives that will search for intelligent life in the universe, using large radio and optical telescopes. Marcy and his team confirmed Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz's discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star‚Äî51 Pegasi b. Two months later, Marcy and his team announced the discovery of two additional planets around 47 Ursa Majoris and 70 Virginis. Other achievements include discovering the first multiple planet system around a star similar to our own (Upsilon Andromedae), the first transiting planet around another star, simultaneously with David Charbonneau and Timothy Brown (HD209458b), the first extrasolar planet orbiting beyond 5 AU (55 Cancri d), and the first Neptune- sized planets (Gliese 436b and 55 Cancri e). Marcy was a Co-Investigator of the NASA Kepler mission that discovered over 4000 exoplanets, most being smaller than 4 times the size of Earth. His team, led by Erik Petigura and Andrew Howard, showed that approximately 20% of Sun-like stars have a planet of 1‚Äì2 times the size of Earth and receive incident stellar light within a factor of 4 of the light the Earth receives from the Sun, making them warm planets, many of which accommodate liquid water. In May 2017, Marcy co- authored studies related to laser light emissions from stars, as a way of detecting technology-related signals from an alien civilization. The study included Tabby's Star (KIC 8462852), an oddly dimming star whose unusual light fluctuations may be the result of interference by an artificial megastructure, such as a Dyson swarm, made by such a civilization. No evidence was found for technology-related signals from Tabby's Star in the studies. Sexual harassment In 2015, an investigation by the University of California, Berkeley Title IX office found that Geoffrey Marcy had violated the University's sexual harassment policy between 2001 and 2010. Four complaints were filed with the University's Title IX office, one of which Marcy denied. At least three additional allegations were made against Marcy as early as 1995 while he was at San Francisco State University, as corroborated by Penny Nixon, then SFSU's sexual harassment officer. On October 7, 2015, Geoff Marcy posted an \\"Open Letter to the Astronomy Community\\" stating ‚ÄúWhile I do not agree with each complaint that was made, it is clear that my behavior was unwelcomed by some women. I take full responsibility and hold myself completely accountable for my actions and the impact they had. For that and to the women affected, I sincerely apologize.‚Äù On October 12, 2015, the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department met and released a statement asserting that Marcy was \\"inadequately disciplined\\" by the University, and \\"we believe that Geoff Marcy cannot perform the functions of a faculty member.\\" Berkeley had recently been found on a list produced by the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, revealing that they were under review for potentially mishandling previous sexual violence cases. In a follow-up statement, the university claimed they had \\"imposed real consequences on Professor Geoff Marcy by establishing a zero tolerance policy regarding future behavior and by stripping him of the procedural protections that all other faculty members enjoy\\". On the same day, Marcy resigned as Principal Investigator of the Breakthrough Listen project. Two days later, on October 14, 2015, he indicated his intention to step down from his professorship at UC Berkeley. Personal Marcy lives with his wife, Susan Kegley, in California. In the media Earlier, and as a pioneer in the study of extrasolar planets, Marcy has been featured prominently in the media, including Time magazine, The New York Times, Astronomy magazine and as a participant in various PBS Nova episodes: \\"Hunt for Alien Worlds\\" (1997), \\"Finding Life Beyond Earth\\" (2012), \\"Alien Planets Revealed\\" (2014); a BBC Horizon episode: \\"The Planet Hunters\\" (1996) and History Channel programs: The Universe (2007). Marcy was also featured on ABC News Nightline (October 20, 1995), The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour (January 18, 1996), The David Letterman Show (April 12, 2001), a Planetary Radio interview (2007) and a National Academy of Sciences interview (2014).

It was formulated by Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn in 1977. The theory proposes that the QCD Lagrangian be extended with a CP-violating term known as ‚Äúthe Œ∏ term‚Äù. Because experiments have never measured a value for Œ∏, its value must be very nearly zero. Overview Peccei‚ÄìQuinn theory predicts that the small value of the Œ∏ parameter is explained by a dynamic field, rather than a constant value. Because particles arise within quantum fields, Peccei‚ÄìQuinn theory predicts the existence of a new particle, the axion. The potential which this field carries causes it to have a value which naturally cancels, making the Œ∏ parameter uneventfully zero. Peccei‚ÄìQuinn symmetry presents Œ∏ as a functional component ‚Äì a global U(1) symmetry under which a complex scalar field is charged. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value obtained by this scalar field, and the axion is the massless Goldstone boson of this broken symmetry. This Peccei‚ÄìQuinn symmetry is inexact because it is anomalously broken by QCD instantons: If there is a compensatory term canceling the QCD anomaly breaking term, the axion becomes an exactly massless Goldstone boson and Œ∏ is no longer fixed. The effective potential of the axion is the summed potential above the QCD scale; with the potential term induced by nonperturbative QCD effects. If the axion is fundamental, or emerges at a scale far higher than the QCD scale, then the dimension 5 axion coupling term a \\\\operatorname{Tr}[ F \\\\wedge F ] is suppressed by 1/\\\\Lambda where \\\\Lambda is the scale of the axion. Because of this, in order for Œ∏ to be so small at the minimum of the effective potential, the bare potential has to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the instanton induced potential, compounded by the \\\\Lambda factor. This requires quite a bit of reconciliation with an approximate global symmetry, for which there is no current explanation.

Entering sumo in 1927, he was the sport's 35th yokozuna from 1937 until his retirement in 1945. He won twelve y≈´sh≈ç or top division championships and had a winning streak of 69 consecutive bouts, an all-time record. Despite his dominance he was extremely popular with the public. After his retirement he was head coach of Tokitsukaze stable and chairman of the Japan Sumo Association. Career Born in Usa, he worked on fishing boats as young boy. He joined professional sumo in March 1927 at the age of 15, recruited by Tatsunami stable. He entered the top makuuchi division at the beginning of 1932. He was promoted from the middle of the second j≈´ry≈ç division to maegashira 4, as many top division wrestlers had just gone on strike (the so-called \\"Shunj≈´en Incident\\"), and the Japan Sumo Association needed to fill the gaps in the ranks. However, he soon proved himself worthy of the promotion, finishing as runner-up in his second top division tournament. Futabayama is particularly remembered for achieving the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts, with 69, a record that still stands today. This represents an unbeaten run which stretched over three years. In a sport where matches often last a few seconds, and a brief lapse in concentration can lead to a loss, this is an exceptional achievement. It began on January 7, 1936 at the rank of sekiwake. During this run he was promoted from maegashira 3 to yokozuna. It generated such excitement among the public that the Sumo Association extended the number of days per tournament from 11 to 13, and then to 15. He was finally defeated on January 3, 1939 by maegashira Akinoumi (later a yokozuna himself). He lost more to illness than to a superior opponent, as he was suffering from amoebic dysentery at the time. Futabayama won a total of twelve tournament championships, during a period in which there were only two tournaments held each year. His total remained a record until the number of tournaments was increased to six a year in the 1950s. However, the percentage of championships won in his makuuchi career still compares favorably to the wrestlers who have surpassed his total in the six tournament a year era. After his retirement Futabayama revealed he was actually blind in one eye, due to an injury suffered in his youth, making his achievements even more remarkable. He was one of the first top wrestlers to break away from the tradition of marrying his stablemaster's daughter, instead choosing a young heiress from a rich Kansai family. Their reception was held in April 1939 at the Tokyo Kaikan. (His coach's daughter married Haguroyama instead.) Fighting style Futabayama was noted for being exceptionally good at the initial phase of a sumo match, the tachi-ai. He was an expert at the gonosen no tachiai or receiving his opponent's charge and immediately countering it. He is believed to have never made a false start. Although he was not particularly large, he had excellent balance. One of his most feared techniques was uwatenage,Futabayama, Sadaji Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures or overarm throw. Retirement from sumo Futabayama (left) celebrates his wrestler Kagamisato's victory in the January 1953 tournament that saw him promoted to yokozuna The June 1945 tournament was held in a bomb-damaged Kokugikan with barely any spectators, and Futabayama dropped out after the first day. He did not take part in the November 1945 tournament and announced his retirement during it, claiming that he objected to the newly enlarged dohy≈ç that the Sumo Association had introduced at the behest of the American occupying authorities. However, he had actually made a decision to retire a year earlier, having suffered a loss to Azumafuji, another future yokozuna. Futabayama had become head of his own stable, Futabayama Dojo, in 1941 whilst still an active wrestler (a practice now forbidden), and upon his retirement he adopted the Tokitsukaze elder name and renamed his heya Tokitsukaze stable. It grew to become one of sumo's largest stables by the 1950s, and Futabayama produced several strong wrestlers including yokozuna Kagamisato and ≈çzeki Kitabayama and Yutakayama. He remained in charge of the stable until his death from hepatitis in 1968. From 1957 he was also chairman (rijich≈ç) of the Japan Sumo Association. In his time as chairman he introduced a number of important reforms, such as giving monthly salaries to wrestlers ranked in the top two divisions, and enforcing a mandatory retirement age of 65 for elders and referees.

It is named for the hill on which it is located, which in turn is so named for being the first hill encountered while traveling east from downtown Seattle toward Lake Washington. First Hill is bounded on the west by Interstate 5, beyond which is Downtown, on the north by E. Pike and E. Madison Streets, beyond which is Capitol Hill, and on the south by S. Main St., beyond which is the International District. The City of Seattle provides conflicting information about its eastern limit, beyond which are Cherry Hill and the Central District. Some describe it as being bounded by Broadway and Boren Avenues, while others describe it as being bounded by 12th Avenue. First Hill became increasingly attractive in the 1890s as a location close enough to downtown for convenience, but removed enough to offer a sense of retreat for the wealthier residents of Seattle. Among the elite to live in the area at that time were Indian fighter turned businessman Granville O. Haller, local judge Cornelius H. Hanford, successful meatpacker Charles Frye (whose private art collection is now visible to the public at First Hill's Frye Art Museum), contractor Morgan Carkeek (for whom Carkeek Park is named), William Boeing, founder of the Boeing Company and Judge Hiram Bond. The photographer Imogen Cunningham and her husband Roi Partridge lived in a boarding house on First Hill during the 1910s, until the residents of the house were evicted and the property converted into a hospital. More recently, local philanthropist and businesswoman Patsy Bullitt Collins resided in a First Hill condominium. The first official King County Courthouse was built on First Hill in 1889‚Äì1890. The steep climb to the courthouse from downtown legal offices caused such frequent and vociferous complaints that Seattle lawyers nicknamed the area \\"Profanity Hill\\". The courthouse, constructed on the corner of 7th Avenue and Alder Street, was quickly outgrown, which, along with the loud dissatisfaction of local attorneys, led the county to move the courthouse off First Hill in 1916. The hill is also known as \\"Pill Hill\\" because, in addition to being the current home of three major health care facilities (Harborview Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, and Virginia Mason Medical Center (four if Swedish Medical Center/Cherry Hill, located on 16th Avenue, is included in the neighborhood)) and also the Puget Sound Blood Center, it was also once the location of the Maynard, Seattle General, and Doctors Hospitals (all of which merged into Swedish) as well as Cabrini Hospital. First Hill has been home to Seattle University, a private Jesuit university, since 1891. Also located on the hill are Northwest School and Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences‚Äîtwo highly regarded private schools‚Äîand the Catholic O'Dea High School and Frye Art Museum, as well as several churches that have become city landmarks: Trinity Parish Church, St. James Cathedral, and Seattle First Baptist Church. First Hill's major thoroughfares, assuming its greatest possible extent, include Madison, James, Cherry, and Jefferson Streets and Yesler Way (east- and west-bound) and 9th, Boren, and Broadway (north- and south-bound). A Link Light Rail station was originally planned for First Hill, but was cancelled due to geotechnical risks prior to the construction of University Link. Instead, the First Hill Streetcar was built on Broadway and Jackson Street to connect First Hill with the International District / Chinatown and Capitol Hill stations, beginning service in January 2016.

The decoration recognizes the heroic actions of four Army Chaplains during World War II. The statute awarding the medal is listed as follows: > Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United > States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized to > award posthumously appropriate medals and certificates to Chaplain George L. > Fox of Gilman, Vermont; Chaplain Alexander D. Goode of Washington, District > of Columbia; Chaplain Clark V. Poling of Schenectady, New York; and Chaplain > John P. Washington of Arlington, New Jersey, in recognition of the > extraordinary heroism displayed by them when they sacrificed their lives in > the sinking of the troop transport in the North Atlantic in 1943 by giving > up their life preservers to other men aboard such transport. The medals and > certificates authorized by this Act shall be in such form and of such design > as shall be prescribed by the President, and shall be awarded to such > representatives of the aforementioned chaplains as the President may > designate. Also known as the Chaplain's Medal of Honor and the Chaplain's Medal for Heroism, its design commemorates the actions of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives in the line of duty on February 3, 1943. The medal was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones (1892‚Äì1969) of the United States Army Institute of Heraldry. It was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Fort Myer, Virginia, on January 18, 1961. The Four Chaplains The four chaplains were lieutenants in the United States Army: Rev. George L. Fox (Methodist), Rabbi Alexander D. Goode (Jewish), Rev. Clark V. Poling (Reformed Church in America) and Fr. John P. Washington (Roman Catholic). In late 1942, the chaplains were transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the SS Dorchester, which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom via Greenland. On February 2, 1943, the German submarine U-223 spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the Dorchester shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. Twenty-seven minutes after the torpedo struck, the Dorchester disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together. As to official military decorations, each of the four chaplains was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart. Award creation In 1957, The American Legion, at their 39th National Convention in Atlantic City, passed a resolution asking Congress to award the Medal of Honor to the Four Chaplains; however, criteria for the Medal of Honor included \\"combat with the enemy.\\" The special medal ‚Äî intended to have the same weight and importance as the Medal of Honor ‚Äî was approved by the Senate in 1958, and by the House in 1960. In 2006, The American Legion, at their 88th National Convention in Salt Lake City, passed a new resolution in support of awarding the Medal of Honor to the Four Chaplains.Proceedings of the 88th National Convention of the American Legion (2006), pages 150-151, Resolution No. 361, Accessed February 3, 2017.

It has a land area of , and is about southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. It is wide and long. History Shemya Island north shore The Russian vessel Saint Peter and Paul wrecked at Shemya in 1762. Most of the crew survived. A United States Air Force radar, surveillance, and weather station and aircraft refueling station, including a 10,000 ft (3 km) long runway, opened on Shemya in 1943 and is still in operation. The station, originally Shemya Air Force Base or Shemya Station, had 1,500 workers at its peak in the 1960s. In 1956, Northwest Airlines leased Shemya Island from the U.S. government to use as a refueling station on their North Pacific route. According to Northwest's website, that made them \\"the first airline to operate its own airport.\\" Northwest was operating Lockheed Constellation L-1049G model propliners on its \\"Orient Express\\" service between the U.S. and Asia in 1956. The United States Air Force airborne intelligence platforms \\"Cobra Ball\\", \\"Rivet Amber,\\" and \\"Rivet Ball\\" flew intercontinental ballistic missile tracking flights from this island near the Soviet Union, especially the Kamchatka Peninsula, during the height of the Cold War. Observations from Shemya were normally the first radar reports of new Soviet satellite launches from Tyuratam (Baikonur) in the early days of satellite tracking; see Project Space Track. The station was renamed the Eareckson Air Station in 1993 to honor USAF Colonel William O. Eareckson, who had commanded bomber operations during the Aleutian Campaign of World War II. Landsat image of Shemya Island. The station still operates as a radar station and aircraft refueling station with a staff of about 180 people. The 2000 census reported an official resident population of 27 persons on the island. One of the most recognizable features of the island is the COBRA DANE radar system. This radar was built in 1976 and brought on-line in 1977 for the primary mission of intelligence gathering in support of verification of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) II agreement. Shemya was an important outpost during the Cold War. As part of Project Bluegrass, the White Alice Communications System provided a vital tropospheric scatter communications link to the mainland during the early-1960s to late-1970s. Its two 120 ft parabolic reflectors and 50 kW transmitter output bridged the nearly 400 mile gap to Adak, Alaska. = List of Commercial Flights Diverted to Shemya = * China Eastern Airlines Flight 583 made an emergency landing at the island's airbase at April 6, 1993. * American Airlines Flight 175 (AA175/AAL175), a Boeing 777-200ER, from Dallas Fort Worth, Texas (DFW/KDFW) to Tokyo Narita, Japan (NRT/RJAA) made an emergency landing due to indication of cargo fire on July 11, 2010. * Cathay Pacific Flight 884 CX884 from Hong Kong to Los Angeles made an emergency landing due to smoke detection at the island's airbase on July 29, 2015. * Delta Air Lines Flight 128 made an emergency landing on the island's airbase on December 24, 2018, when the Boeing 767-300ER developed engine problems. * Polar Air Cargo Flight 717 made an emergency landing at the island's airport on March 13, 2020. = Former airline service = Reeve Aleutian Airways (RAA) operated scheduled passenger service into Shemya for many years. During the 1970s and 1980s, Reeve operated nonstop flights to Anchorage (ANC) with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft. By 1989, the airline was operating nonstop jet service to Anchorage with Boeing 727-100 combi aircraft which were capable of transporting passengers and freight on the main deck of the aircraft. Reeve's 727 service from Anchorage continued during the 1990s as did 727 flights from Adak Island, AK and Cold Bay, AK. Reeve Aleutian ceased all flight operations in 2000.  Climate  The weather on Shemya is very drastic, though the temperatures only vary between single digits to the mid fifties, and the climate is perhaps the most equatorward low-altitude occurrence of a polar climate (ET) in the world, though it is extremely close to a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) (or a subarctic climate if the 0 degree Celsius isotherm is used). The island weather is most likely to be cloudy with a mist and the wind is often in the mid 30s to 40 mph. The Japanese current in the Pacific to the south of the island regulates the temperature and gives it the pronounced temperature lag (August and September are the warmest months and the island's record low occurred in April). Despite it being a tundra climate, it is spared the vicious cold of places like Barrow, Alaska where temperatures in winter can rival those of interior Alaska in winter.

Etymology The name Ardsley is first attested in the Domesday Book as Erdeslau and Eadeslauue, apparently primarily with reference to what is now East Ardsley as opposed to West Ardsley. The first element of the name comes from the Old English personal name Eard, a nickname form of longer names like Eardwulf, in the genitive form Eardes ('Eard's'). The second element comes from Old English hl«£w ('hill, mound'). Thus the name once meant 'Eard's hill' or 'Eard's mound'. The name first appears with the element east in 1459, in the forms Est Ardeslaw and East Ardeslawe.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), pp. 16-17.  Location  Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is south of Leeds city centre and north of the City of Wakefield. Being between several towns, East Ardsley has become a dormitory village. The village is about above sea level and is more widely known than its neighbour West Ardsley. Although it is in the City of Leeds metropolitan district, the village is in Wakefield's WF3 postcode district and its telephone numbers have both the 0113 Leeds and 01924 Wakefield dialling code. East Ardsley was part of Ardsley Urban district 1894‚Äì1937, which also included Tingley and West Ardsley, and was then part of Morley Municipal borough 1937‚Äì1974. The village is still classed as part of Morley in the census, but it is not governed by Morley Town Council. East Ardsley sits in the Ardsley and Robin Hood ward of Leeds City Council - which elects three city councillors - and the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency. History East Ardsley once had a diverse economy, including agriculture, textiles, railways and coal-mining. Its coal mine closed in 1968 ‚Äì the same year that the nearby Middleton pit closed. On the site of the old pit head now stands the headquarters of Sharp Business Systems, the UK arm of Sharp Corporation, which supplies and services photocopiers. The village had many co-op departments all of which are now closed. The old coop on Thorpe Road changed hands to become Moorknoll Upholstery and after that, Restyle fitness. More recently the property is now occupied by The Mulberry House Beauty Salon.The Mulberry House Beauty Salon Amblers Mill is at the crossroads of the A650 Bradford Road, Westerton Road and Common Lane. The building has ceased textile production and now houses Country Baskets.https://www.countrybaskets.co.uk In 2007 the former railway sidings site started to be redeveloped for housing. The owners of the Country Baskets wholesaler were both killed in a helicopter accident on Saturday 26 January 2008. The M62 and M1 motorways intersect near here. The main A650 road from Wakefield to Bradford also goes through the village. The Bay Horse Pub, a long-standing and historical part of East Ardsley can be found on Bradford Road. The village was also formerly served by Ardsley railway station. The entertainer Ernie Wise was brought up in East Ardsley.

From 1901 to 1992, it was known as the Northern Commercial Company (NCC). In 1992, it resumed business as the Alaska Commercial Company under the ownership of The North West Company. History After the 1867 purchase of Alaska by the United States, the firm of Hutchison, Kohl & Company, including Hayward Hutchison, William Kohl, and Louis Sloss, bought the Russian-American Company. In 1868, Sloss, Lewis Gerstle, and August Wassermann bought this company, although Hutchison, Kohl & Company was in simultaneous existence and under the same ownership until 1872, when the new company paid off the purchase. This new company, formed in 1868, was called the Alaska Commercial Company, and did business under this name until 1901. In that year, because of increasing competition in the sealskin trade, the Alaska Commercial Company merged with the International Mercantile Marine Company and Alaska Goldfields, Ltd., to form two new companies, the Northern Navigation Company and the Northern Commercial Company. The original owners of the Alaska Commercial Company, Louis Sloss, Gerstle, etc. carried on the business under the name of the Northern Commercial Company. Shortly afterwards, W.J. Erskine bought some of the old Alaska Commercial Company boats and set up a small successor to the Company in certain areas of Alaska. The Northern Commercial Company operated village stores in Alaska from 1868 to 1922, including during the Klondike Gold Rush (1897‚Äì1899). The stores often served as the village courthouse and post office as well. Much trade in the stores was bartered, as few people had cash. The stores accepted such items as gold, fish and furs in exchange for merchandise. The stores were often the nucleus of small communities and communities often grew because of the stores. In 1922, the Northern Commercial Company was sold to a group of employees, who moved the headquarters to Seattle. It opened department stores, auto dealerships, and tire stores in Alaska's cities, and became a major supplier of heavy equipment and machinery in Alaska. By 1975 the Northern Commercial Company sold its department stores to Nordstrom. The Goodyear tire stores were sold to Bandag. In 1977 the old name, the Alaska Commercial Company (ACC) was reintroduced to the stores and the remaining eleven rural stores were sold to the Community Enterprise Development Corporation of Alaska (CEDC). In November 1992, the CEDC sold the stores in turn to The North West Company, a Canadian retailer mainly serving northern communities. ACC now has 30 stores in 29 remote Alaska Villages, under the name AC Value Center. Northern Commercial retained the heavy equipment division, which continues to operate under the name NC Machinery.About Us See also * Maritime Fur Trade Further reading  Sloss, Frank H. \\"Who Owned the Alaska Commercial Company?.\\" Pacific Northwest Quarterly 68.3 (1977): 120-130.

Early life Holub was born in Holice in eastern Bohemia (then within the Austrian Empire, now the Czech Republic) in the family of municipal doctor. After studying at German- language grammar school in ≈Ωatec (Saaz), he was admitted at Prague University where he obtained a degree as a doctor of medicine (1872). Expeditions in Africa Inspired to visit Africa by the diaries of David Livingstone, Holub travelled to Cape Town, South Africa shortly after graduation and eventually settled in Dutoitspan near Kimberley to practise medicine. After eight months, Holub set out in a convoy of local hunters on a two-month experimental expedition, or \\"scientific safari\\", where he began to assemble a large natural history collection. Shipwreck on Zambezi on the 3rd expedition resulting in loss of much collected material Emil Holub's house in Bultfontein in 1870s In 1873, Holub set out on his second scientific safari, devoting his attention to the collection of ethnographic material. On his third expedition in 1875, he ventured all the way to the Zambezi river and made the first detailed map of the region surrounding Victoria Falls. Holub also wrote and published the first book account of the Victoria Falls published in English in Grahamstown in 1879. After returning to Prague for several years, Holub made plans for a bold African expedition. In 1883, Holub, along with his new wife Rosa (1865‚Äì1958) and six European guides, set out to do what no one had done before: explore the entire length of Africa from Cape Town all the way to Egypt. However, the expedition was troubled by illness and the uncooperative Ila tribesmen and Holub's team was forced to turn back in 1886. Holub mounted two exhibitions, highly attended but ending up in financial loss, in 1891 in Vienna and in 1892 in Prague. Frustrated that he was unable to find a permanent home for his large collection of artefacts, he gradually sold or gave away parts of it to museums, scientific institutions and schools. Later Holub published a series of documents, contributing to papers and magazines, and delivering lectures. His early death came in Vienna on 21 February 1902, from lingering complications of malaria and other diseases he had acquired while in Africa.

Human factors cause the issue of information leakage. Human factors can be categorized as intentional actions and unintentional actions. An example of intentional action is that employees take risk of wreaking vengeance on the company due to dissatisfaction with the company. The example of unintentional action is that new employees are negligent of risk behaviors due to the over-enthusiasm for new ideas. Information leakage happens whenever a system that is designed to be closed to an eavesdropper reveals some information to unauthorized parties nonetheless. For example, when designing an encrypted instant messaging network, a network engineer without the capacity to crack encryption codes could see when messages are transmitted, even if he could not read them. During the Second World War, the Japanese used secret codes such as PURPLE. Even before such codes were cracked, some basic information could be extracted about the content of the messages by looking at which relay stations sent a message onward.  Design issues  Designers of secure systems often forget to take information leakage into account. A classic example of this is when the French government designed a mechanism to aid encrypted communications over an analog line, such as at a phone booth. It was a device that clamped onto both ends of the phone, performed the encrypting operations, and sent the signals over the phone line. Unfortunately for the French, the rubber seal that attached the device to the phone was not airtight. It was later discovered that although the encryption itself was solid, if heard carefully, one could hear the speaker, since the phone was picking up some of the speech. Information leakage can subtly or completely destroy the security of an otherwise secure system.  Risk vectors  A modern example of information leakage is the leakage of secret information via data compression, by using variations in data compression ratio to reveal correlations between known (or deliberately injected) plaintext and secret data combined in a single compressed stream. Another example is the key leakage that can occur when using some public-key systems when cryptographic nonce values used in signing operations are insufficiently random. Bad randomness cannot protect proper functioning of a cryptographic system, even in a benign circumstance, it can easily produce crackable keys that cause key leakage. Alt URL Information leakage can sometimes be deliberate: for example, an algorithmic converter may be shipped that intentionally leaks small amounts of information, in order to provide its creator with the ability to intercept the users' messages, while still allowing the user to maintain an illusion that the system is secure. This sort of deliberate leakage is sometimes known as a subliminal channel. Generally, only very advanced systems employ defenses against information leakage. Following are the commonly implemented countermeasures : * Use steganography to hide the fact that a message is transmitted at all. * Use chaffing to make it unclear to whom messages are transmitted (but this does not hide from others the fact that messages are transmitted). * For busy re-transmitting proxies, such as a Mixmaster node: randomly delay and shuffle the order of outbound packets - this will assist in disguising a given message's path, especially if there are multiple, popular forwarding nodes, such as are employed with Mixmaster mail forwarding. * When a data value is no longer going to be used, erase it from the memory.

Early versions combined elements of the European influenced \\"native American ballad\\" with the forms of African American music. From the 20th century on it was also used to refer to a slow tempo, often sentimental song in a blues style.  Structure and variations  The blues ballad often uses the Thirty-two-bar form of verse-verse-bridge-verse, in contrast to the 12-bar or 8-bar blues forms.Boyd, Jack (1991). Encore!: A Guide to Enjoying Music, p.31. . \\"[32-bar form] is sometimes called ballad form because so many of our popular ballads, middle-of-the-road popular songs, and Country Western songs use this form.\\" =Popular blues ballads= The first blues ballads tended to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, often in the context of industrialisation. They usually lacked the strong narrative common in European ballads, and emphasised instead individual character.N. Cohen, Folk Music: a Regional Exploration (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29. They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar and often followed a standard 12-bar the blues format, with a repeated refrain in the last line of every verse.T. A. Green, Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 81. Blues ballads are usually anonymously authored and were performed by both black and white musicians in the early 20th century. Ballads about anti-heroes include \\"Wild Bill Jones\\", \\"Stagger Lee\\" and \\"John Hardy\\".R. DeV Renwick, Recentering Anglo/American Folksong: Sea Crabs and Wicked Youths (University Press of Mississippi, 2009), pp. 25-6. The most famous blues ballads that deal with heroes in the context of industrialisation include those about John Henry and Casey Jones. =Blues ballads in other genres= From the late 19th century the term ballad began to be used for sentimental songs with their origins in the early ‚ÄòTin Pan Alley‚Äô music industry.D. M. Randel, The Harvard Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press, 4th edn., 2003), p. 73, As new genres of music, including the blues, began to emerge in the early 20th century the popularity of the genre faded, but the association with sentimentality meant led to this being used as the term for a slow love song from the 1950s onwards. Today the term is used to describe a song that uses a blues format with a slow tempo, often dealing with themes of love and affection. Examples include songs like B. B.

First revealed in 1995 at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, it used a camera mechanism by Ikegami and a special FieldPack unit instead of a tape transport unit. The CamCutter outpaced subsequent tapeless camcorders introduced by Sony and Panasonic by years. In October 2010, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) announced the recipients of the 62nd Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy¬Æ Awards. Ikegami and Avid Technology were announced as a winner for the Development and Production of Portable Tapeless Acquisition. Today's CamCutter technology can be found in Ikegami's Editcam products. Features Some of the features of being hard disk based was in-camera editing, faster than real time transfer of footage and the RetroLoop, which used a circular buffer to constantly record footage, and allowed saving a \\"take\\" after the action happened. This camera technology provides time lapse capture and animation modes (1 frame per trigger). Cost The price of the initial unit was between US $40,000 to $60,000. Ikegami and Avid developed a follow on tapeless acquisition camera, the DNS201 which shipped in the late 1990s. This unit sold for below US $30,000. In 2000, NL Technology spun out of Avid and continued developing two more generations of this technology. The DNS33 priced below US $30,000 and the hi definition Avid DNxHD camera, the HDN-X10, priced in between US $30,000 and $40,000. Advantages Disadvantages Due to its huge cost and prototype look and feel, many photographers did not use the initial hardware. Ikegami and NL Technology developed lower cost and more ergonomic versions that sold much better in the late 1990s and through 2010.

The O.C. Supertones, or simply The Supertones) were a Christian ska band from Orange County, California. The band was signed to Tooth & Nail Records and its imprint, BEC Recordings, before becoming an independent band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2005, though reunited in 2010 to resume touring and recording before permanently disbanding in 2017. The OC Supertones were one of the first widely successful Christian ska bands. History The band began in the early 1990s as Saved. Originally formed by Matt Morginsky, Jason Carson and Tony Terusa while in junior high school, the band played a mix of many styles including punk, rap, metal, disco, and funk. In 1995 they formed as The Orange County Supertones and settled on a ska based sound, similar to Operation Ivy or Mike Park's Skankin' Pickle. Although drummer Jason Carson had known Tooth & Nail founder Brandon Ebel for years, the label was reluctant to sign them. As characterized by Ebel: \\"The Supertones were good, but Saved was not good. I had years of Saved in my head.\\" The Supertones' debut release, Adventures of the O.C. Supertones, received a 1997 Dove nomination for the \\"Alternate / Modern Rock\\" category. Their second album, 1997's release Supertones Strike Back, was a surprise smash hit, peaking on both Billboard's Heatseekers and Top Christian Albums charts at No. 3 and No. 2 respectively. In the fall of 1997 the Supertones headlined a tour with Ghoti Hook and Stavesacre, and the next spring opened for Audio Adrenaline, with whom they recorded a duet, \\"Blitz,\\" on the Audio Adrenaline album Some Kind of Zombie, also in 1997. In late 1998 they embarked on the all-Christian-ska \\"Skamania 98\\" tour with The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. In 1999 the Supertones played for the papal visit to St. Louis by Pope John Paul II. Beginning with a more traditional ska sound, The Supertones moved next to a harder rock sound, which eventually changed again with more of a pop-rock influence. The band explained the musical evolution to CCM: \\"pop culture has the attention span of a flea... ska's time in the white-hot spotlight has come and gone.\\" When saxophonist Dave Chevalier joined The Dingees in 1998, the band made the decision not to replace his position. Rap and R&B; influences also became more prevalent in their sound, which remained \\"about 40 percent reminiscent of the older stuff.\\" Quote by Brandon Ebel. Their next two albums, 1999's Chase the Sun and 2000's Loud and Clear, each charted on the Billboard 200 chart. Lyrically, they were known as having a straightforward approach to songwriting, with a minimal use of metaphor. Even so, their songs were cited as being thought-provoking and containing deep theology. One of the major focuses for the band was evangelism; they included segments of preaching in each performance. Originally these were fronted by drummer Jason Carson, who had been active in youth ministry before the Supertones found their break. In 2000 when he went back into ministry full- time the band split the responsibilities among remaining members. Adam Ferry, formerly of Plankeye, took Carson's spot on drums. They continued to release albums until 2005, when they announced plans to break up. The band released Unite, a greatest hits compilation, and played their last show at Biola University in La Mirada, California on October 7, 2005.

A firestarter, she becomes a ward of the B.P.R.D. at age 11 after burning her family to death in a traumatic accident. Sherman later hones her abilities and becomes a longtime field agent for the Bureau alongside Hellboy and Abe Sapien. In the live action films by Guillermo del Toro, Sherman is played by Selma Blair and is portrayed as a love interest for Hellboy. Blair reprised the role for the Hellboy Animated films. Fictional character history Born in Kansas City, Kansas, on April 15, 1962, Liz has a normal childhood until her pyrokinetic abilities begin to manifest at age ten. Raised Catholic,http://www.comicbookreligion.com/char?ID=4304&Liz;_Sherman Liz feels that the fires are a result of her sins, and for a short time manages to keep them under control by a combination of prayer and force of will. However, in July 1973, at age eleven, she loses control. The resulting eruption destroys a city block and takes the lives of her parents, brother, and pet dog. Liz's last uncontrolled manifestation takes place on July 4, 1984. After being juggled between extended family members following the death of her parents, Liz is taken in by the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense in May 1974, where she learns to control her power to some degree. In 1980, she becomes a full agent. She is often teamed with Hellboy and Abe Sapien. Her childhood trauma leaves her bitter and she comes and goes from the Bureau. During the events of the story arc Wake the Devil, while searching for Giurescu's body, Liz leads a group composed of herself, Bud Waller, and Leach to the Ruins of Czege Castle. By accident, Liz's group comes across a chamber containing the homunculus that is later named \\"Roger\\". Upon inspecting Roger, Liz inadvertently transfers her pyrokinesis into the homunculus. He comes to life and kills Bud before running off. Liz enters a coma as she is taken to Wauer Institute in Tirgoviste. The loss of her powers is causing her body to fail. She is saved when Hellboy finds Roger, who, plagued by guilt concerning the accident, returns her powers.Hellboy: Almost Colossus To learn how to better control her pyrokinesis, Liz lives with a society of monks in the Agartha Temple in the Ural Mountains before resuming active duty in the Bureau after Hellboy quits. As a result of her time amongst the monks, Liz now has complete control over fire: she can produce small flames to light her way, erupt in a furious explosion of fire to destroy anything around her, and manipulate fire into shapes and designs. Her powers are magnified by an ancient object revealed to her in a dream by the mysterious Memnan Saa. This dramatic increase in her powers allows her to burn the towering Katha-Hem entity to dust. Even after defeating Katha-Hem, Liz continues to be plagued by horrible visions and mysterious dreams featuring Memnan Saa; as a result, Liz loses sleep and becomes more irritable and less reliable. The dreams come to a height during the Killing Ground story arc, where Saa takes advantage of Ben Daimio's transformation to fully possess Liz and drive her into a coma until the ghost of Lobster Johnson appears and freed her. Liz is kidnapped by Memnan Saa and the rest of her team tracks her down. Saa is killed, but claims that, using Liz's pyrokinetic power, he'd be able to prevent the upcoming apocalypse. Following this, in a mission to the underworld, Saa's ghost intercepts Liz and shows her a vision of the future: the apocalypse successful. Under the guidance of a mysterious aged man, she unleashes her full pyrokinetic powers, incinerating the Hollow Earth - and wipes out a combined frog/Hyperborean army gathered by the Black Flame. This ends the threat of these menaces for good but causes devastation across Earth. At first it seemed as if her powers were completely gone, and she leaves the Bureau as Ogdru Hem awaken across the world and usher in the apocalypse. Eventually her powers returned, more powerful than ever. She soon returned to active duty with the B.P.R.D. and was sent along with a number of other specialized agents into the \\"dead zone\\" surrounding the mutant-infested ruins of New York City. The mission ended when Liz managed to engage the Black Flame, now resurrected as a veritable demigod and revealed to be the ruler of the ruins. After a period of furious fighting, Liz was ultimately defeated, but managed to escape and her actions enabled the Bureau's agents to also escape the various mutants and armed mercenaries in service to the Black Flame and his human followers. The apocalyptic events plaguing the world came to a climax when the Black Flame, embittered and empowered by personal loss, managed to reach into the void and release one of the Ogdru Jahad, summoning it to Earth and binding it into his service. Liz and Johann Kraus, recently empowered by a connection to an ancient source of cosmic power, were sent to deal with the Ogdru Jahad, with no tangible results. In response, the two were sent back to New York City with the help of a Naval deployment to kill the Black Flame in the hopes of weakening the creature, only to find that the Black Flame's influence was the only thing keeping the titanic beast's power in check. Ultimately, it was only an act of self-sacrifice from Johann that led to its defeat. Following the destruction of the Ogdru Jahad, Liz played an active role in the cleanup of the remaining threats wreaking havoc on the world, and entered a romantic relationship with agent Ted Howards of the Bureau. The apocalypse resumed however after the destruction of a powerful demon when Rasputin was brought back to the physical world, revealed to have become host to the power of the destroyed Ogdru Jahad's power. He was confronted by Liz, the recently resurrected Hellboy in the streets of New York, only defeated at the cost of Hellboy's own life. Liz wandered the ruined Earth for some time until called upon by the spirits of Hellboy and Hecate to cleanse the damaged Earth of the Ogdru Jahad's corruption. She released her full power, reducing the surface of the Earth to a smoking cinder so that it might begin anew. She was shown to have survived however, encasing herself in a Hyperborean crystal prison and eventually being found by the descendants of Abraham Sapien that had come to inhabit the restored Earth in humankind's absence. Relationship with Hellboy In the Hellboy film series Liz has a romantic relationship with Hellboy. She was taken in as a child so she grows up knowing Hellboy, they eventually become more and both films touch on them working out feeling for each other as well as how their relationship would work with who they both are. The 2nd film has Liz dealing with being pregnant with Hellboy's twin children and how that will change their relationship going forward as their lives change due to other plot points. However, in the comic books Liz and Hellboy are only friends. In other media * Liz Sherman was played by Selma Blair in the film adaptation of the Hellboy comics. Blair reprised her role in the film's sequel and two straight-to-DVD animated Hellboy films. In the second live-action film, she is revealed to be pregnant with Hellboy's child after being touched by Abe Sapien by mistake while he shields her from harm. At the end of the film it is revealed she is actually pregnant with twins much to Hellboy's shock. * Liz was one of the first four Hellboy Comic action figures produced in 2005 by Mezco Toyz.Mezco Toyz Movie, Television and Proprietary Action Figures & Collectibles She appeared with Hellboy, Lobster Johnson, and Herman von Klempt and Kriegaffe #10. * Liz is mentioned by Hellboy in the fighting game, Injustice 2, with Hellboy claiming Starfire and Swamp Thing would like to meet her for being a \\"fire starter\\", referencing her pyrokinetic abilities.

Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand. These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair. The normal use of a hair dryer Hairstyles using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline, which can be further improved with styling products, hairbrushes, and combs during drying to add tension, hold and lift. Blow dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first, stationary, model was created by Alexander F. Godefroy in his salon in France. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared in 1920. Blow dryers are used in beauty salons by professional stylists and in the household by consumers. Function An early blow dryer Most hair dryers consist of electric heating coils and a fan (usually powered by a universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome is used because of two important properties: It is a poor conductor of electricity and it does not oxidize when heated. A survey of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers had ceramic heating elements (like ceramic heaters) because of their \\"instant heat\\" capability. This means that it takes less time for the dryers to heat up and for the hair to dry.Kirkland, Kathy (June 2004) \\"The Big Blow- Dryer Boom\\", Beauty Story Business Girl under beauty parlor hair dryer, 1958 Many of these dryers have \\"normal mode\\" buttons that turn off the heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This function helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The colder air reduces frizz and can help to promote shine in the hair. Many feature \\"ionic\\" operation, to reduce the build-up of static electricity in the hair, though the efficacy of ionic technology is of some debate. Manufacturers claim this makes the hair \\"smoother\\". Some stylists consider the introduction of ionic technology to be one of the most important advances in the beauty industry. Hair dryers are available with attachments, such as diffusers, airflow concentrators, and comb nozzles. * A diffuser is an attachment that is used on hair that is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly. It diffuses the jet of air, so that the hair is not blown around while it dries. The hair dries more slowly, at a cooler temperature, and with less physical disturbance. This makes it so that the hair is less likely to frizz and it gives the hair more volume. * An airflow concentrator does the opposite of a diffuser. It makes the end of the blow dryer narrower and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot to make it dry rapidly. * The comb nozzle attachment is the same as the airflow concentrator, but it ends with comb-like teeth so that the user can dry the hair using the dryer without a brush or comb. Hair dryers have been cited as an effective treatment for head lice and earwax-prevention.  Types  Today there are two major types of blow dryers (hair dryers): the handheld and the rigid-hood dryer. A hood dryer has a hard plastic dome that fits over a person's head to dry their hair. Hot air is blown out through tiny openings around the inside of the dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons. = Hair dryer brush = A hair dryer brush (also called \\"hot air brush\\" and \\"round brush hair dryer\\" and \\"hair styler\\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/official-charcoal-infused-hair- styler-175723337.html) has the shape of a brush and it is used as a volumizer too.https://www.insider.com/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-review There are two types of round brush hair dryers ‚Äì rotating and static. Rotating round brush hair dryers have barrels that rotate automatically while static round brush hair dryers don‚Äôt.https://www.hairworldmag.com-best-round-brush-hair-dryers- History Dryer made by AEG, c. 1920‚Äì1925 In 1890 the first hairdryer was invented by French stylist Alexander Godefroy. His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his hair salon in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it. Armenian American inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.Kazanjiadl \\"Hair-Drier\\" , assigned on 6 June 1911 Around 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand, and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately , and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of overheating and electrocution. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100 watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000 watts of heat). Since the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when GEC changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.Electric Hair Dryers. ntlworld.com Bonnet hair dryer, 1962 The bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once. The 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage. Bonnet hair dryer, 1965 Bonnet hair dryer, circa early 1970s In the 1970s, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture. Since 1991 the CPSC has mandated that all dryers must use a ground fault circuit interrupter so that it cannot electrocute a person if it gets wet. By 2000, deaths by blowdryers had dropped to fewer than four people a year, a stark difference to the hundreds of cases of electrocution accidents during the mid-20th century. Cultural references The British historical drama television series Downton Abbey made note of the invention of the portable hairdryer (blow dryer) when a character purchased one in Season 6 Episode 9, set in the year 1925.

Krang's first comics appearance was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures vol. 1, #1, published by Archie Comics in August 1988. In the 1987 TV series, Krang was voiced by Pat Fraley. He is still one of the primary antagonists to the Ninja Turtles, appearing as General Krang in the 2012 IDW comic publication.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #7 The character made his first live action appearance in the 2016 sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, with his voice provided by Brad Garrett. Krang was created by David Wise, with inspirations from the Utroms, to supply the Shredder with extraterrestrial technology.  Abilities  In the final season of the 1987 animated series, Krang showed signs of psychic powers when he hypnotized one of Lord Dregg's soldiers into obeying his and Shredder's commands, saying it would only work on weak willed people.  Relating to the Utroms  Krang's physical appearance was inspired by the Utroms from the original TMNT comic book. IDW Comics In the IDW Comics Krang is both an Utrom and a denizen of Dimension X. He is the heir of Quanin, the former Prime Minister of the Utroms' ruling council who appointed himself Emperor and aggressively expanded the Utrom domain into an empire. However, his megalomanic expansion drive both deprived his home planet of its most essential natural rescource, the Ooze, and incited rebellion among the subjugated people of Dimension X, eventually leading to the destruction of Utrominon. Krang, who was as brutal as his father but opposed his uncautious politics, fled with a few survivors of his people through an interdimensional portal to Burnow Island on Earth, where he established a base from which he intended to terraform this world into a new home for his people.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW): Utrom Empire #1-#3 (January‚ÄìMarch 2014). In order to augment his troops, Krang, initially disguised as a despotic human warlord, forms a business relationship with Baxter Stockman, head of the genetics research institute Stock Gen,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #7-8 and supplies him with Ooze, which could be used as a natural mutagen on Earth's organisms. It is through Stockman's experiments that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Splinter evolve into intelligent, humanoid mutants.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #1-4: \\"Change is Constant\\" (2011). When the Turtles learn of Krang's genocidal plans with the aid of their human friend April O'Neil, a former intern at Stock Gen, they, their ally the Fugitoid (a former Neutrino scientist whose mind is trapped in a robot body and who was forcibly conscripted by Krang to complete his terraforming machine, the Technodrome), and the Foot Clan stop Krang from destroying the Earth, and the Utrom warlord is surrendered to the Neutrinos for trial for his numerous war crimes.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #41-44: \\"Attack on Technodrome\\" (December 2014-March 2015). While imprisoned on Neutrino, Kraang hires the bounty hunter Hakk-R to eliminate several material witnesses in order to get the trial cancelled, but Hakk-R fails thanks to the efforts of the Turtles.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW): TMNT: Dimension X #1-#5 (August 2017). Eventually, Krang is found guilty and sentenced to permanent exile from Dimension X on Earth. However, Leatherhead, one of his former victimsTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #58: \\"Leatherhead, chapter 3\\" (May 2016). and a key witness in the trial, refuses to accept the mild verdict and kills Krang by devouring him.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #73-75: \\"The Trial of Krang\\" (August‚ÄìOctober 2017). However, as the Fugitoid belatedly realizes, the Utroms possess a natural parasitic physiology, enabling Krang to regenerate himself and take possession of Leatherhead's body.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #100: \\"City at War: The End\\" (December 2019). 2003 series While he did not appear as a villain or major character in the 2003 series, there was an homage to Krang in the episode \\"Secret Origins Part 3\\". As the Utroms are all walking to the transmat to go back home one of them complains, \\"I hate walking on my tentacles\\". Then, another Utrom replies \\"Oh, shut up, Krang!\\". This Krang was voiced by Wayne Grayson.Secret Origins Part 3, TMNT 2003 Krang also appears in the 2009 crossover film, Turtles Forever, in which he, Shredder and the Turtles from the 1987 show end up in the 2003 universe. Although Shredder was able to find his 2003 counterpart, he was unable to find Krang's, even though he exists in this universe (albeit as a regular, non-evil Utrom).

It is situated in a relatively remote corner of Masvingo Province, south of Chimanimani along the Mozambique border. Owing to its vast size, rugged terrain and its location away from main tourist routes, large tracts of Gonarezhou remain as pristine wilderness. At 5,053 km2, Gonarezhou is the country's second largest National Park after Hwange National Park.National Parks and Nature Reserves of Zimbabwe, World Institute for Conservation and Environment The name Gonarezhou is translated from the Shona as meaning \\"The Place of Elephants\\" Gonarezhou National Park forms part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Gonarezhou with the Kruger National Park in South Africa and the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. Animals can move freely between the three sanctuaries. The north-eastern end of the park is located within the Zambezian and mopane woodlands, while the southwest is located within the Southern Africa bushveld ecoregion. History The Gonarezhou National Park was first established as a protected area in 1936 as a Game Reserve, eventually being proclaimed a National Park in 1975. The park has had a turbulent history and was closed to the public during the Rhodesian War and again during much of the Mozambique civil war but was re-opened in 1994. Between 1994 and 2007, the Gonarezhou National Park was wholly managed by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, however the economic challenges in Zimbabwe up to 2007 meant that there was little reinvestment in infrastructure and protection of the Park. In 2007, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority entered into a financial and technical assistance model for the Gonarezhou National Park with the Frankfurt Zoological Society. This model lasted up until 2017 and focused on investing in infrastructure and the protection of the Park's resources. In March 2017, management of the Gonarezhou was handed over to the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust, a co-management partnership between the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority and the Frankfurt Zoological Society. This co-management model, overseen by a board of trustees represented equally by both partners, was created to establish a platform to enhance investment into the long-term sustainability of the Park - a key feature of which being the retention of tourism funds at a Park level for direct reinvestment into the Gonarezhou. Features The Gonarezhou National Park is one of the iconic wilderness areas of Africa, with relatively few tourists but boasting an amazing diversity of landscapes, features, and growing wildlife populations. By far, the most well known and prominent feature of the Park is the Chilojo Cliffs,The Erosion Surfaces of Zimbabwe sandstone cliffs towering 180 meters high and running for some 20 kilometers along the south bank of the Runde River. Other key features in the north of the Park are the two large natural pans, Tembwahata and Machanu, formed at the junction of the Save River and Runde River. In the central and southern areas of the Park are the Naymtongwe Plateau, a remnant of the Chilojo Cliffs, the Ntambambomvu Red Hills, densely wooded hill slopes standing above the Malvernia sand beds and the Mwenezi River Valley, and the Samalema Gorge, where the Mwenezi River carves through solid igneous rock-forming a braided river gorge. =Fauna= Historically the park has been a habitat for the endangered Cape wild dog (Lycaon pictus); and in 2010 there were several sightings of wild dogs in the park. It is thought that the cross-border link to national parks in Mozambique would be the best opportunity to restore or preserve the viability of this species in adjacent national parks in South Africa and Mozambique. Other mammals that inhabit the park are elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, Cape buffalo, zebra, wildebeest, black and white rhinoceros, lion, leopard, cheetah, and hyena.

Overview The most popular sense of the term is associated with Americans in rural or southeastern parts of the country, particularly Appalachia. It is a dance in quick movement most likely related to the jig, reel or clog dance. In contest fiddling, a hoedown is a tune in fast 2/4 time. In many contests, fiddlers are required to play a waltz, a hoedown, and a \\"tune of choice,\\" which must not be a waltz or a hoedown (typically it is a jig or a schottische). In modern Western square dance, a hoedown is a piece of music used for a patter call (a call that is spoken or chanted, rather than sung to the tune of a popular song), or the recording that contains this piece of music. In the early days of the Western square dance revival (the 1940s and early 1950s), most hoedowns were traditional fiddle tunes; since the late 1950s, recordings of simple chord progressions, with no discernible melody, have also been sold to callers under the name \\"hoedown.\\" In the 1940s and early 1950s, the term \\"hoedown\\" was sometimes used to mean a call made up of parts of other calls. \\"Hoedown\\" was, and occasionally still is, also used to mean a dance jointly sponsored by several dance clubs or by a federation of clubs. References in modern culture The most famous hoedown in classical music is the section entitled \\"Hoe-Down\\" from the Rodeo ballet by Aaron Copland (1942). The most frequently heard version is from the Four Dance Episodes from Rodeo, which Copland extracted from the ballet shortly after its premiere; the dance episodes were first performed in 1943 by the Boston Pops conducted by Arthur Fiedler. Copland's \\"Hoe-Down\\" became even more famous through television advertisements by America's Beef Producers with the slogan \\"Beef. It's What's For Dinner\\". \\"Hoe-Down\\" has been covered by Emerson, Lake & Palmer on their album Trilogy, by B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones on their albums Outbound and Live at the Quick, and by Jordan Rudess on his album Prime Cuts. Additionally, the jazz musician Oliver Nelson performed a jazz-infused variation written by himself entitled \\"Hoe-Down\\" on his album The Blues and the Abstract Truth.

Born in Corpus Christi, Texas, Young attended Incarnate Word Academy and Corpus Christi College-Academy. He earned his B.A. at St. Edward's University in 1937 and his L.L.B from the University of Texas School of Law in 1940. After starting his career as a lawyer, he served in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1945. Young served as a lawyer for Nueces County, Texas in various positions, as assistant county attorney in 1946, assistant district attorney from 1947 to 1950, county attorney from 1951 to 1952 and county judge from 1953 to 1956. He ran successfully as a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956, defeating incumbent John J. Bell in the primary election and winning the general election.

The park lies in the west, on the main road between Bulawayo and the Victoria Falls and near to Dete. History of the park It was founded in 1928, with the first warden being by the 22-year-old Ted Davison. He befriended the Manchester-born James Jones who was the stationmaster for the then Rhodesian Railways at Dete which is very near the park's Main Camp. Jones managed incoming supplies for the park. This park is considered for inclusion in the 5 Nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. =Poaching incidents= In 2011, nine elephants, five lions and two buffaloes were killed by poachers. In October 2013 it was discovered that poachers killed a large number of African elephants with cyanide after poisoning their waterhole. Conservationists have claimed the incident to be the largest illegal killing of animals in Southern Africa in 25 years.Death by cyanide: poachers kill 40 elephants in Zimbabwe as China drives ivory demand Two aerial surveys were carried to determine the extent of the deaths, and 19 carcasses were identified in the first survey and a further 84 carcasses in the second survey.Zimbabwe elephants poisoned by poachers in Hwange Three of the poachers were caught, arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced. All royal game and elephant poaching offences now have a mandatory 9-year sentence and the supply chain is also targeted. =Cecil and Xanda hunting incidents= On or about 1 July 2015, Cecil, a lion who had lived on Hwange National Park for 13 years, was killed. This action spurred widespread social media coverage and a petition calling for Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe to outlaw big game hunting permits. Walter Palmer, the admitted killer of Cecil, had a permit and was not charged with any crime, as all his papers were in order.https://news.yahoo.com/zimbabwe-says-not-charge-u-dentist- killing-cecil-133842381.html Authorities in Zimbabwe have said he is free to visit the country. Charges were initially laid against Theo Bronkhorst, Palmer's guide, for \\"failing to stop an illegal hunt\\" but these were later thrown out of court. Two years after Cecil's killing, his son Xanda met a similar fate. Unlike that of his father, Xanda's killing was not termed illegal, though it did provoke outrage. Features =Flora= Game at a pan in a vlei or seasonal wetland The park is close to the edge of the Kalahari desert, a region with little water and very sparse, xerophile vegetation. The Kalahari woodland is dominated by Zambezi Teak, Sand Camwood (Baphia) and Kalahari bauhinia. Seasonal wetlands form grasslands in this area. The north and north-west of the park are dominated by mopane woodland. Although it has been argued that elephant populations cause change in vegetation structure, some recent studies suggest that this is not the case, even with the large increases in elephant population recorded in the late 1980s. =Fauna= Lion resting near a termite mound The Park hosts over 100 mammal and 400 bird species, including 19 large herbivores and eight large carnivores. All Zimbabwe's specially protected animals are to be found in Hwange and it is the only protected area where gemsbok and brown hyena occur in small numbers. Grazing herbivores are more common in the Main Camp Wild Area and Linkwasha Concession Area, with mixed feeders more common in the Robins and Sinamatella Wild Areas, which are more heavily wooded. Distribution fluctuates seasonally, with large herbivores concentrating in areas where intensive water pumping is maintained during the dry season. The population of the Cape wild dogs to be found in Hwange is thought to be of one of the larger surviving groups in Africa today, along with that of Kruger National Park and Selous Game Reserve. Other major predators include the lion, whose distribution and hunting in Hwange is strongly related to the pans and waterholes. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with the Okavango Delta.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. African leopard, spotted hyena and cheetah are also present in the protected area. Elephant at Longone Pan Elephants have been enormously successful in Hwange and the population has increased to far above that naturally supported by such an area. This population of elephants has put a lot of strain on the resources of the park. There has been a lot of debate on how to deal with this, with parks authorities implementing culling to reduce populations, especially during 1967 to 1986. The elephant population doubled in the five years following the end of culling in 1986. National Parks Scientific Services co-ordinates two major conservation and research projects in the park: *National Leopard Project, which is surveying numbers of leopard to obtain base-line data for later comparative analysis with status of leopard in consumptive (hunting) areas and Communal Land bordering the National Park. This is carried out at Hwange in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation and Research Unit of Oxford University and the Dete Animal Rescue Trust, a registered wildlife conservation Trust *Painted Dog Project: The project aims to protect and increase the range and numbers of African wild dog both in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa, and operates through the Painted Dog Conservation organisation in Dete.

In the north-west there are basalt lava flows of the Batoka Formation, stretching from south of Bumbusi to the Botswana border. In the north-central area, from Sinamatella going eastwards, there are granites and gneisses of the Kamativi-Dete Inlier and smaller inliers of these rocks are found within the basalts in the north-west. The north and north-west of the park are drained by the Deka and Lukosi rivers and their tributaries, and the far south of the park is drained by the Gwabadzabuya River, a tributary of the Nata River. There are no rivers in the rest of the park, although there are fossil drainage channels in the main camp and Linkwasha areas, which form seasonal wetlands. In these areas without rivers, grassy pan depressions and pans have formed. Some of these pans, such as many of the pans in the Shumba area, fill with rainwater, while others, such as Ngweshla, Shakwanki and Nehimba, are fed by natural groundwater seeps. Many of the pans are additionally supplied by water pumped from underground by park authorities. =Archaeological, historical and cultural sites= The Bumbusi National Monument, comprising ruins and rock carvings, is located on the northern edge of the park. There are also ruins at Mtoa and rock carvings at Deteema. =Places of interest= Map of Hwange National Park Main Camp area * Umtshibi camp, the headquarters of the park maintenance unit * Mtoa Ruins and Pan * Dopi vlei, a fossil river containing Dopi Pan * Kennedy vlei, a fossil river also known as Massumamalisa, containing the Kennedy 1, Kennedy 2 (named after Sir John Noble Kennedy, Governor of Southern Rhodesia) and Massumamalisa (Somalisa) Pans * Manga vlei, a fossil river also known as Amanga, containing the Manga Pans * Nyamandhlovu Pan (the name refers to elephant meat) and game-viewing platform, one of the most popular game-viewing sites * Guvalala Pan and game-viewing platform, rehabilutated by scouts from Kent, UK in the 1990s * Dom Pan, where lion are often seen * Chivasa Pan * Longone Pans, named after the chief cook during the first warden's time * Ngweshla Pan, a waterhole heavily frequented by game since before the park's proclamation * Shapi Pan, another waterhole heavily frequented by game since before the park's proclamation and former headquarters of the park maintenance unit * Sibaya Pan Sinamatella area * Chawato Springs, a mineral spring north-west of Sinamatella on the Bumbusi road * Dabashuro (Dobashura) Spring, a mineral spring west of Sinamatella * Salt Springs * Tshakabika Hot Springs, a thermal spring east of Sinamatella * Lukosi River * Mandavu Dam and picnic site * Masuma Dam, with a thatched shelter overlooking the dam, as well as a camping ground and picnic site * New Inyantue Dam * Tshompani Dam * Dandari (Dandaro) Vlei, Plains and Pan * Kapula Vlei * Tiriga (Triga) Vlei, a fossil river * Shuma Pans, a series of waterholes heavily frequented by game since before the park's proclamation, with a hide and picnic site * Nehimba Pan * Tshompani Pan Robins Camp area * Deteema Dam, hide and picnic site * Deteema fossil forest, silcified Dadoxylon trunks * Deka River, with Crocodile Pools hide * Chingahobe River, a tributary of the Deka River and Chingahobe (Chingahobi) Dam * Mahohoma River, a tributary of the Deka River * Toms vlei and river, a tributary of the Deka River, named after the hunter Tom Saddler.

It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid ‚Äì an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate. The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (>250 cells/¬µL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered. Other life-threatening complications such as kidney malfunction and increased liver insufficiency can be triggered by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 30% of SBP patients develop kidney malfunction and is one of the strongest predictors for mortality. Where there are signs of this development albumin infusion will also be given. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) can also occur and this can sometimes accompany a bacterial infection. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected. These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult. Delay of diagnosis can delay antifungal treatment and lead to a higher mortality rate. Causes SBP is most commonly caused by gram-negative E. coli, followed by Klebsiella. Common gram-positive bacteria identified include species of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus. The percentage of gram-positive bacteria responsible has been increasing. A spontaneous fungal infection can often follow a spontaneous bacterial infection that has been treated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics can result in an excessive growth of fungi in the gut flora which can then translocate into the peritoneal cavity. Although fungi are much larger than bacteria, the increased intestinal permeability resulting from advanced cirrhosis makes their translocation easier. SFP is mostly caused by species of Candida and most commonly by Candida albicans.  Pathophysiology  H2 antagonists and proton- pump inhibitors are medications that decrease or suppress the secretion of acid by the stomach. Their use in treating cirrhosis is associated with the development of SBP. Bacterial translocation is thought to be the key mechanism for the development of SBP. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which may be implicated in this translocation, is found in a large percentage of those with cirrhosis. With respect to compromised host defenses, patients with severe acute or chronic liver disease are often deficient in complement and may also have malfunctioning of the neutrophilic and reticuloendothelial systems. As for the significance of ascitic fluid proteins, it was demonstrated that cirrhotic patients with ascitic protein concentrations below 1 g/dL were 10 times more likely to develop SBP than individuals with higher concentrations. It is thought that the antibacterial, or opsonic, activity of ascitic fluid is closely correlated with the protein concentration. Additional studies have confirmed the validity of the ascitic fluid protein concentration as the best predictor of the first episode of SBP. In nephrotic syndrome SBP can frequently affect children but only very rarely can it affect adults. Diagnosis Infection of the peritoneum causes an inflammatory reaction with a subsequent increase in the number of neutrophils in the fluid. Diagnosis is made by paracentesis (needle aspiration of the ascitic fluid); SBP is diagnosed if the fluid contains neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) at greater than 250 cells per mm3 (equals a cell count of 250 x106/L) fluid in the absence of another reason for this (such as inflammation of one of the internal organs or a perforation). The fluid is also cultured to identify bacteria. If the sample is sent in a plain sterile container 40% of samples will identify an organism, while if the sample is sent in a bottle with culture medium, the sensitivity increases to 72‚Äì90%. Prevention All people with cirrhosis might benefit from antibiotics (oral fluoroquinolone norfloxacin) if: * Ascitic fluid protein <1.0 g/dL. Patients with fluid protein <15 g/L and either Child-Pugh score of at least 9 or impaired renal function may also benefit. * Previous SBP People with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital should receive prophylactic antibiotics if: * They have bleeding esophageal varices Studies on the use of rifaximin in cirrhotic patients, have suggested that its use may be effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Treatment =Antibiotics= Although there is no high-quality evidence, the third generation cephalosporins are considered the standard empirical treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with cirrhosis. In practice, cefotaxime is the agent of choice for treatment of SBP. After confirmation of SBP, hospital admission is usually advised for observation and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Where there is a risk of kidney malfunction developing in a syndrome called hepatorenal syndrome intravenous albumin is usually administered too. Paracentesis may be repeated after 48 hours to ensure control of infection. After recovery from a single episode of SBP, indefinite prophylactic antibiotics are recommended. =Prokinetics= The addition of a prokinetic drug to an antibiotic regimen reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis possibly via decreasing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. =Intravenous albumin= A randomized controlled trial found that intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on hospital day 3 can reduce kidney impairment.  Epidemiology  Patients with ascites underwent routine paracentesis, the incidence of active SBP ranged from 10% to 27% at the time of hospital admission. History SBP was first described in 1964 by Harold O. Conn.

The Road consists of a -long northeast-southwest linear feature composed of roughly rectangular to subrectangular limestone blocks. Various claims have been made for this feature's being either a wall, road, pier, breakwater, or other man-made structure. However, credible evidence or arguments are lacking for such an origin. History Satellite picture of North Bimini Island On September 2, 1968, while diving in three fathoms () of water off the northwest coast of North Bimini island, Joseph Manson Valentine, Jacques Mayol and Robert Angove encountered an extensive \\"pavement\\" of what later was found to be noticeably rounded stones of varying size and thickness.Valentine, J. M., 1969, Archaeological enigmas of Florida and the Western Bahamas. Muse News (Miami Museum of Science). v. 1, pp. 26-29,41-47 (1969, June).Valentine, J. M., 1973, Culture pattern seen. Muse News (Miami Museum of Science). v. 4, pp. 314-315, 331-334 (April 1973) This stone pavement was found to form a northeast- southwest linear feature, which is most commonly known as either the \\"Bimini Road\\" or \\"Bimini Wall\\". After Valentine, the Bimini Road has been visited and examined by geologists, avocational archaeologists, professional archaeologists, anthropologists, marine engineers, innumerable divers, and many other people. In addition to the Bimini Road, investigators have found two additional \\"pavement-like\\" linear features that lie parallel to and shoreward of the Bimini Wall.Valentine, J.M., 1976, Underwater Archeology in the Bahamas. Explorers Journal. v. 54, no. 4, pp. 176-183.Gifford, J.A., and M.M. Ball, 1980, Investigation of submerged beachrock deposits off Bimini. National Geographic Society Research Reports. v. 12, pp. 21‚Äì38. Physical characteristics The Bimini Wall and two linear features lying shoreward of it are composed of flat-lying, tabular, and rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. Descriptions of the Bimini Road found in various books and articles greatly exaggerate the regularity and rectangularity of the blocks composing these features.McKusick, M., 1979, The Bimini underwater discoveries. Explorer Journal. v. 58, no. 1, pp. 40-43. The Bimini Road, the largest of three linear features, is long, a northeast/southwest-trending feature with a pronounced hook at its southwest end. It consists of stone blocks measuring as much as in horizontal dimensions, with the average size being . The larger blocks show complementary edges, which are lacking in the smaller blocks. The two narrower and shorter, approximately -long linear features lying shoreward of the Bimini Road consist of smaller tabular stone blocks that are only in maximum horizontal breadth. Having rounded corners, the blocks composing these pavements resemble giant loaves of bread. The blocks consist of limestone composed of carbonate- cemented shell hash that is called \\"beachrock\\". Beachrock is native to the Bahamas. The highly rounded nature of the blocks forming the Bimini Road indicates that a significant thickness of their original surface has been removed by biological, physical, and chemical processes. Given the degree to which these blocks have been eroded, it is highly implausible that any original surface features, including any tool marks and inscriptions, would have survived this degree of erosion.Shinn, E. A., 2009, The mystique of beachrock. in Perspectives in Carbonate Geology: A Tribute to the Career of Robert Nathan Ginsburg, P. K. Swart, G. Eberli, and J. A. McKenzie, eds., pp. 19-28. International Association of Sedimentologists Special Publication no. 41. After a very detailed examination of the Bimini Road and the other linear features, Gifford and Ball made the following observations: As noted below, these observations are disputed by other investigators. For example, some investigators state that where sand had washed away between the seams, another course of blocks can be seen along with small blocks underlying these blocks. However, detailed evidence that clearly documents the alleged presence of a continuous second layer (course) of stones beneath the stones forming the currently exposed \\"pavement\\" has not yet been published in a reputable, scientific venue with the detail that is needed for critical evaluation. Pictures posted on various Web pages of stones alleged to be artificial \\"wedge stones\\" and \\"prop stones\\" fail as convincing evidence for a second course of stones because they are typically smaller in size, do not form a continuous course, and too infrequently lie directly beneath the blocks that form the surface of the Bimini Road. This is not what would be expected of an actual underlying course of man-made masonry. David ZinkZink, David, 1978, The Stones of Atlantis. Prentice Hall Trade. states: This led him to conclude: In addition, early studies of the Bimini Road, i.e. Gifford and Ball and David Zink, report taking numerous samples and cores for examination. It is also safe to presume that a certain number of the innumerable visitors to the Bimini Road have chipped off pieces of it. Scientific sampling and souvenir hunting would have left behind modern \\"tool marks\\" on the various blocks composing the Bimini Road for later investigators to find. Age of the Bimini Road Attempts have been made to determine the age of this feature using different techniques. These include direct radiocarbon dating of the stones composing the Bimini Road and Uranium-thorium dating of the marine limestone on which the Bimini Road lies. In 1978, the radiocarbon laboratory operated by the Department of Geology at the University of Miami dated samples from a core collected by E. A. Shinn in 1977 from the Bimini Road. In 1979, Calvert and othersCalvert, P.M., D.S. Introne, J.J. Stipp, 1979, University of Miami radiocarbon dates XIV. Radiocarbon. v. 21, no. 1, pp. 107-112. reported dates of 2780¬±70 yr BP (UM-1359),(UM-XXXX) refers to University of Miami radiocarbon sample no. XXXX. See Calvert et al. (1979) for the details about specific sample 3500¬±80 yr BP (UM-1360), and 3350¬±90 yr BP (UM-1361) from whole-rock samples; a date of 3510¬±70 yr BP (UM-1362), from shells extracted from the beachrock core; and dates of 2770¬±80 yr BP (UM-1364) and 2840¬±70 yr BP (UM-1365) from carbonate cementing the beachrock core. These dates are temporally consistent in that the shells composing the beachrock core from the Bimini Road dated older than the cement holding them together as beachrock. These dates can be interpreted as indicating that the shells composing the Bimini Road are, uncorrected for temporal and environmental variations in radiocarbon, about 3,500 years old. Because of time-averaging and other taphonomic factors, a random collection of shells likely would yield a radiocarbon date that is a few hundred years earlier than when the final accumulation of shells, which were cemented to form beachrock, actually occurred.Kidwell, S.M., M.M.R. Best, and D.S. Kaufman, 2005, Taphonomic trade- offs in tropical marine death assemblages: Differential time averaging, shell loss, and probable bias in siliciclastic vs. carbonate facies. Geology. September 2005; v. 33; no. 9; p. 729-732. The radiocarbon dates from the cement demonstrate that the beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed about 2,800 radiocarbon years ago by the cementation of pre-existing sediments that accumulated about 1,300 years earlier. Compared to the dates from the shells and the cement, it appears that the whole-rock dates reflect samples containing varying proportions of shell and cement without any significant contamination by younger radiocarbon. Both these dates and interpretation are consistent with the detailed research by Davaud and StrasserDavaud, E., and A. Strasser, 1984, Progradation, cimentation, √©rosion: √©volution s√©dimentaire et diag√©n√©tique r√©cente d'un littoral carbonate (Bimini, Bahamas). (Translated title: Progradation, Cementation, Erosion; Recent Diagenetic and Sedimentary Evolution in a Carbonate Coastal Environment, Bimini, Bahamas.) Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae. v. 77, no.3, p. 449-468.Strasser, A., and E. Davaud, 1986, Formation of Holocene limestone sequences by progradation, cementation, and erosion; two examples from the Bahamas. Journal of Sedimentary Research. v. 56, no. 3, pp. 422-428. that concluded that the layer of beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed beneath the surface of North Bimini Island and was exposed by coastal erosion only about 1,900 to 2,000 years ago. Proponents of the Bimini Road being a manmade feature argue that these radiocarbon dates are invalid because they were obtained entirely from whole- rock samples and subject to contamination from younger carbon. The background data reported by Calvert and others concerning the radiocarbon dates from the Bimini Road demonstrate that not all of these dates come entirely from whole- rock samples. That the dates from the shells and the clearly younger cement holding them together as beachrock are temporally consistent argues against any signification alteration of their radiocarbon content. In addition, other studies using radiocarbon dating to study sea level and the age of sediment and beachrock within the Bahamas have not reported any significant problems with contamination by younger radiocarbon.Bourrouilh-Le Jan, F.G., 2007, Very high energy sedimentation (supratidal hurricane deposits) and Mid-Holocene highstand on carbonate platforms, Andros, Bahamas: An alternative view. Sedimentary Geology. vol. 199, no. 1-2, pp. 29-49. In their detailed research, Davaud and Strasser accepted the radiocarbon dates obtained from the beachrock composing the Bimini Road from the radiocarbon laboratory at the University of Miami as valid indicators of its age. Gifford and Ball attempted to establish a minimum age using uranium-thorium dating for the Bimini Road by dating a whole-rock sample of the marine limestone (biopelsparite)A biopelsparite is a limestone with a ratio of fossils and fossil fragments to pellets between 3:1 and 1:3 and lacking a mud matrix. If it consists largely of fossils and fossil fragments and lacks a mud matrix, a limestone is called a \\"biosparite\\". that underlies the beachrock that composes the Bimini Road. They described this sample as being \\"Whole rock marine limestone under beachrock off Paradise Point, North Bimini; some recrystallisation.\\" This sample yielded a uranium- thorium date of 14,992¬±258 BP (7132-19/2). SupportersLittle, G., 2004, More Adventures With Bimini Beachrock: Remarkable Blunders in a Purported Scholarly Report Debunking the Bimini Stones. Alternative Perceptions Magazine. no. 86 (December 2004) of the idea that the Bimini Road is a man-made structure frequently cite this date in support of its being artificial. The uranium- thorium date published by Gifford and Ball is regarded as an invalid and meaningless date for two reasons. First, the sample being partially recrystallised means that this limestone was not a closed system as required for a meaningful uranium-thorium date. As a result, this specific date is only an apparent date that completely lacks any scientific value for interpreting the age of marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road. Currently, specific species of corals and mollusks that can be demonstrated to lack any recrystallisation using petrographic and X-ray diffraction techniques are the preferred samples for dating. Any limestone sample that shows the least amount of recrystallisation is now regarded as incapable of yielding a scientifically valid date and not even worth an attempt at dating.Ku, T.L., 1976, The Uranium-Series Methods of Age Determination.

Plenum Press, New York, 395 pp. Finally, it is well documented that about 15,000 calendar years ago, sea level in this region was between below present sea level.Balsillie, J.H., and J.F.

Nature. v. 342, no. 6250, pp. 637‚Äì642. As a result, the location from where Gifford and Ball collected the sample of limestone was between (295 and 312 feet) above sea level at the time indicated by the uranium-thorium date of 14,992¬±258 BP (7132-19/2). Therefore, it is physically impossible for the marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road to have accumulated around 15,000 BP. Thus, this uranium-thorium date is a meaningless, invalid date lacking any scientific significance. Because this date clearly lacks any scientific meaning, geologists and archaeologists rarely mention it in their discussions of the Bimini Road. The marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road dates to the Sangamonian Stage, the last interglacial, when sea level was last high enough for the marine sediments, now lithified into limestone, to have accumulated.Carewa, J.L., and J.E.

Geological explanation The consensus among geologists and archaeologists is that the Bimini Road is a natural feature composed of beachrock that orthogonal and other joints have broken up into rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. The geologists and anthropologists who have personally studied the Bimini Road include Eugene ShinnShinn, E.A., 2004, A Geologist's Adventures with Bimini Beachrock and Atlantis True Believers Skeptical Inquirer, v. 28, no. 1, pp. 38‚Äì44. of the U.S. Geological Survey; Marshall McKusick.McKusick, M., and E.A.

International Journal of Nautical Archaeology and Underwater Exploration. v. 2, no. 1, p. 189. of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami; and Eric Davaud and A. Strasser of the Department of Geology and Paleontology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. After either inspecting or studying the Bimini Road, they all concluded that it consists of naturally jointed beachrock. John A. Gifford, a professional geologist, spent a significant time studying the geology of the Bimini Islands for his University of Miami Master's thesisGifford, J.A., 1973, A description of the geology of the Bimini Islands, Bahamas. Unpublished Master's thesis, University of Miami, Miami, Florida. 88 pp. about the geology of the Bimini Islands. Calvert and others identified the samples that they dated from the Bimini Wall as being natural beachrock. Detailed studies by E. Davaud and A. Strasser of Holocene limestones currently exposed on North Bimini and Joulter Cays (Bahamas) reveal the sequence of events likely responsible for creating beachrock pavements like the Bimini Road. First, a complete beach sequence of shallow subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal carbonate sediments accumulated as the shoreline of North Bimini built seaward during part of the Holocene. Once the deposition of these sediments built the North Bimini's shoreline seaward, freshwater cementation of the carbonate occurred at some depth, possibly even a metre or so below sea level, beneath the island's surface. This cementation created a band consisting of a thick primary layer of semilithified sediments and thinner discontinuous lenses and layers of similar semilithified sediments beneath it. Later, when erosion of the island's shoreline occurred, the band of semilithifed sediment was exposed within the intertidal zone and the semilithified sediments were cemented into beachrock. As the sediments underlying the eroding shoreline were eroded down to Pleistocene limestone, the beachrock broke into flat-lying, tabular, and rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks as observed for modern beaches within the Bahamas by E. Davaud and A. Strasser. Thinner layers of beachrock underlying the primary bed of beachrock were also broken up as the loose sediments enclosing them and the thicker primary bed were eroded. As the loose sediment was scoured out from under the blocks and other pieces of beachrock by so- called \\"scour and settling processes\\", they dropped downward for several meters until they rested directly on the erosion-resistant Pleistocene limestone as an erosional lag.McNinch, J.E., J.T.Wells, T.G. Drake, 2001, The fate of artifacts in an energetic, shallow-water environment: scour and burial at the wreck site of Queen Anne's Revenge. Southeastern Geology. v. 40, no. 1, pp. 19-27.McNinch, J.E., and J.T. Wells, 2006, Predicting the Fate of Artefacts in Energetic, Shallow Marine Environments: an Approach to Site Management. The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. v. 35, no. 2, pp. 290‚Äì309. Eugene Shinn discusses a similar, but not identical, process by which the Bimini Road could have been created. The downward movement of large, solid objects by scour and settling processes has been documented by Jesse E. McNinch, John T. Wells, and other researchers. They concluded that large, heavy objects could sink into the sea bottom by several meters without significant lateral movement as the result of scour and settling processes if an erosion-resistant layer of sediment were not encountered. In case of the beachrock blocks composing the Bimini Road and other pieces underlying it, the erosion-resistant layer that limited how far they were dropped downward by scour and settling processes is the Pleistocene limestone on which they now rest. Finally, pieces of thinner layers or lenses of beachrock underlying the primary bed that was broken up and dropped downward to create the Bimini Road would be trapped beneath the blocks as they also were broken up and dropped by erosion. The trapping of these fragments of beachrock beneath the blocks composing the Bimini Road, as erosion removed loose sediments and dropped them onto the surface of the Pleistocene limestone, would have created the so- called \\"prop\\" and \\"wedge\\" rocks and blocks alleged to be a \\"second course\\" of \\"masonry\\". Presuming that the blocks of beachrock forming the Bimini Road originally formed at some unknown depth below sea level and have been dropped by erosion by several metres, dating the age of the Bimini Road by its relation to past sea level would be a useless technique that would produce misleading results. Natural pavements composed of stone blocks, which often are far more rectangular and consistent in size than the blocks composing the Bimini Road, created by orthogonal and other jointing within sedimentary rocks, including beachrock, are quite common and found throughout the world.Irna, 2006, Tout ce que la nature ne peut pas faire, II : pavements et dallages, Le site d'Irna They include a popular tourist attraction, the Tessellated pavement of Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania;Nature Conservation Branch, 2003, Geodiversity: Tasman Peninsula Landforms explained.

However, multiple layers of block can result naturally from systematic fracturing of sedimentary rock where multiple layers of sedimentary rock lie on top of each, as can be observed in the case of the tessellated pavement of Tasmania exposed at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula.Anonymous, 2009, Eaglehawk Neck tesselated pavements: collection of postcards., no. 2, State Library of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. In his controversial book 1421: The Year China Discovered America and its accompanying documentary, 1421: The Year China Discovered America? amateur historian Gavin Menzies claimed that when Chinese admiral Zheng He's fleet was in the process of circumnavigating the globe in 1421-3, it stopped at Bimini - see 1421 hypothesis. According to Menzies, half of the fleet, under the command of admiral Zhou Wen, was caught in a hurricane near Bimini and built the Bimini Road from beach rock and the ships' ballast as a slipway to haul damaged junks ashore for refitting and repairs of damage caused by the hurricane. =Sci Fi Channel presentation= Sci Fi's Quest for Atlantis: Startling New SecretsScifi Channel, 2006, Quest for Atlantis aired July 2006 followed several different groups researching possible locations for the legendary Atlantis, one of which focused on the Bimini Road. Greg Little led a team of researchers on a dive to recover objects at Bimini Bay. Little and his team reported the discovery of an entire second layer of square-cut rocks with similar dimensions beneath the stones of the Bimini Road. However, they have yet to formally publish in any detail the evidence and observations that demonstrate the presence of this underlying layer and the square-cut nature of its blocks. As a result, its existence remains unproven. Little believes that his discovery suggests that the Bimini Road may actually be one part of an entire wall or water dock. He has also published an informal critique of Shinn's Skeptical Inquirer article. The Bimini Road was also discussed in season 1, episode 10 of the TV series In Search of, as well as season 4, episode 22 of the History channel's TV series Ancient Aliens.

Much of SR 10 Loop is concurrent with other highways (including U.S. Route 29 (US 29), US 78, US 129, US 441, SR 8, and SR 15). It also carries the unsigned SR 422\\\\. The only numbered routes to travel through downtown Athens are US 78 Bus., SR 10, and SR 15 Alt.. Inner/outer directions are used to sign the loop. Between exits 4 and 8, there is an eight-highway concurrency, consisting of US 29, US 78, US 129, US 441, SR 8, SR 10 Loop, SR 15, and SR 422 (counting the unsigned SR 422). This concurrency contains the second-most highways in a single United States concurrency. The record holder is Interstate 69 (I-69), I-74, I-465, US 31, US 36, US 40, US 52, Indiana State Road 37 (SR 37), and SR 67 in the Indianapolis, Indiana metropolitan area. Route description Outer Loop of the SR 10 Loop around Athens, at its southern crossing of the Middle Oconee River. SR 10 Loop begins at an interchange with US 29, US 78, SR 8 and SR 316 to the south, and Epps Bridge Parkway to the north in Oconee County south of Athens. It heads east as a four-lane freeway, concurrent with US 29, US 78, and SR 8, and crosses McNutt Creek to enter Clarke County and Athens as it meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 129, US 441 and SR 15, which includes a connection to Timothy Road to the north. Those three routes join SR 10 Loop as it continues east and crosses the Middle Oconee River. The freeway then curves to the northeast and intersects Milledge Avenue, where SR 15 Alternate begins, heading north from the interchange. After this intersection, SR 10 Loop crosses a Georgia shortline railroad and turns to the northeast, where it meets College Station Road at a diamond interchange. At this point the highway right-of-way abuts the University of Georgia campus; immediately north of the College Station Road interchange is an on-ramp to a campus parking lot that is normally closed, but is used on home football game days to allow departing spectators access onto inner 10 Loop directly from campus. Northeast of here, the highway crosses the North Oconee River and meets a folded diamond interchange with SR 10, which is Oconee Street west of the interchange and Lexington Road east of it. At this interchange, US 78 splits from the highway and turns east, and its business route (US 78 Bus.) begins and heads west toward the center of the city. North of this interchange, SR 10 Loop curves to the northwest and intersects with Peter Street and Olympic Drive at a partial cloverleaf interchange, then crosses Trail Creek and a CSX railroad, then meets an interchange with Old Hull Road. This interchange does not provide complete access between the two roads; there is only an exit going northbound and only an entrance from Old Hull Road going southbound. Just north of here, the highway meets an interchange at which US 29 and SR 8 continue north towards Hartwell and Greenville, South Carolina while SR 10 Loop, US 129, US 441, and SR 15 exit and turn due west. This interchange also completes access to Old Hull Road by providing the movements missing from the aforementioned interchange: an exit from the inner loop and an entrance to the outer loop. West of this interchange, the freeway passes over the western fork of Trail Creek, then meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with North Avenue and Danielsville Road. Farther west, it intersects Dr Martin Luther King Jr Parkway and Commerce Road at a diamond interchange. Here, US 441 and SR 15 leave the freeway and turn north along Commerce Road. SR 10 Loop then curves in a southwesterly direction and crosses the North Oconee River again before coming to another diamond interchange, this one with Chase Street. SR 10 Loop continues southwest and crosses the CSX railroad again, then dips to the north and intersects SR 15 Alternate, which is Prince Avenue south of the interchange and Jefferson Road north of it. At this interchange, US 129 leaves SR 10 Loop and joins SR 15 Alternate heading north towards Jefferson. The freeway's next exit to the southwest is a diamond interchange with Tallassee Road and Oglethorpe Avenue. Farther southwest, SR 10 Loop crosses the Middle Oconee River again, then intersects SR 10 and US 78 Bus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Atlanta Highway. Then, SR 10 Loop curves back to the southeast, crosses McNutt's Creek, leaving Athens and crossing back into Oconee County. The freeway has one final exit with the Oconee Connector, access to which is incomplete; the outer loop has only an exit, and the inner loop has only an entrance. Finally, the highway curves back to the east and meets the interchange with US 29, US 78, SR 8, and SR 316, where the exit numbers reset and the loop begins again. The entire length of SR 10 Loop is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History =1960s= The highway that would eventually become SR 10 Loop was established as SR 350 between June 1960 and June 1963. It extended from US 129/SR 15 in the northwestern part of the city to US 29/SR 8 in the northeastern part. The entire divided highway was paved. By the end of 1965, US 29 was designated on SR 350 from the US 129/SR 15 interchange, which also had US 29 Temp. and US 441 Temp., to the US 29/SR 8 interchange. US 441 Temp. was designated on it from the US 129/SR 15 interchange to the US 441/SR 15 Alt. interchange. A western extension of SR 350, ending at US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10, was under construction. Also, SR 350 was under construction east-southeast just slightly from the US 29/SR 8 interchange. In 1966, SR 350 was decommissioned. US 29 was designated on the freeway from the western terminus to where it, as well as SR 8, depart the freeway. This interchange also had SR 8 Bus. and SR 106\\\\. SR 8 was designated on the entire length of the freeway. Its former path through the city was redesignated as SR 8 Bus., still concurrent with US 78/SR 10. In 1967, US 29 was extended on the freeway one interchange to the east. At this interchange, SR 72 was extended southeast to end here, concurrent with US 29/SR 8. =1970s and 1980s= In 1976, SR 72 was indicated to be \\"projected mileage\\" from this point south to US 78/SR 10, then southwest and west to end at US 441/SR 15. In 1980, the freeway was completed along this path, with US 129/US 441/SR 15 designated on it. The next year, the portion of the freeway between US 29/SR 8/SR 72 and US 78/SR 10 on the northeastern part was downgraded to a divided highway. In 1983, the final piece of the freeway on the southwestern part was indicated to be designated as SR 732 as projected mileage. US 129/US 441/SR 15 Alt. was designated on the freeway from the southern end to their current respective interchanges. In 1985, US 441 Temp. was no longer shown on maps. SR 72's western terminus was truncated to the far northeastern part of the city, at its current location. In 1987, the freeway was completed in the southwestern part of the city. SR 10 was designated on it from the original western terminus to the eastern US 78/SR 10 Bus. interchange. Its old path through downtown, still concurrent with US 78, was redesignated as SR 10 Bus. At this time, SR 72 was re-extended to the northeastern interchange. The next year, SR 10 was shifted back to downtown, with SR 10 Loop designated on the freeway. US 78 was shifted to the southern side of the freeway, with its former path redesignated as US 78 Bus. =1990s and 2000s= In 1991, SR 15 and SR 15 Alt. in the area were swapped to their current paths. In 1995, US 29/SR 8 was also shifted to the southern side of the freeway, concurrent with US 78/SR 316\\\\. SR 72's western terminus was once again truncated to its current location. In 2001, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was placed on a southern concurrency with the freeway for less than . This brief concurrency ended at Macon Highway. The next year, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was shifted off of Macon Highway and onto the freeway. In 2004, the unsigned SR 422 designation was applied to the freeway. New exit numbers were assigned on August 2, 2004. =2010s= In 2011, the half-diamond interchange at Oconee Parkway was added, with access limited from the parkway to the inner loop, and from the outer loop to the parkway. In 2015, the entirety of Loop 10 was made a freeway with the upgrade of the at-grade junction at Peter Street and Olympic Drive to a partial cloverleaf interchange. Future The folded diamond interchange at SR 10 (Lexington Road/Oconee Street; Exit 8) is planned to be upgraded in 2025. A new ramp will be built from SR 10 and Barnett Shoals Road to access the outer loop alongside a project that will widen SR 10. It is undecided whether the existing loop ramp from SR 10 to the outer loop should be removed or not. The interchange with SR 8/US 29 at the northwesternmost point on the loop is planned to upgrade the two bridges over SR 10 Loop heading east and west-bound, with two lanes over each bridge. Construction is planned to start in 2021.

The Nader campaign expected that the new Populist Party organization would exist only for the limited purpose of achieving ballot access for Ralph Nader in 2004. However, an effort was made by the Populist Party of Maryland to field candidates for governor, other statewide seats, and at the local level for the State Assembly, county, and municipal positions in the 2005 and 2006 elections. Meeting with Congressional Black Caucus Nader attended a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. The session soon turned into a shouting exchange and several CBC members stormed out. Nader argued that he would draw enough independents and Republicans away to weaken President George W. Bush. The caucus urged Nader to give up his presidential run, fearing that vote splitting would hurt John Kerry, the Democratic Party's nominee. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) called the upcoming election \\"a life or death matter\\" for the Caucus members' constituents. Nader accused Congressman Mel Watt of twice uttering an \\"obscene racial epithet\\" towards him. Nader wrote the caucus chairman, Elijah Cummings, demanding an apology, but none was given.Nichols, Hans and Peter Savodnik (July 14, 2004) \\"Nader Angers Congressional Black Caucus with Demand for Apology.\\" Commondreams.org.  Ballot access  As of October 26, 2004, Nader was slated to appear on the ballot in 34 states and Washington, D.C., and was off the ballot in eight states (California, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia). The Nader campaign failed to gain a spot on a number of state ballots, and faced legal challenges to its efforts in a number of states. In some cases, state officials found large numbers of submitted voter petitions invalid. While Nader campaign officials blamed legal challenges by the Democratic Party for their difficulties in getting Nader's name on the ballot, the difficulties faced by petition-gatherers were also a significant factor ‚Äì there were far fewer people in 2004 eager to sign petitions for Ralph Nader, and petition-gatherers complained that they often received verbal abuse from people they solicited. One of Nader's California organizers observed that \\"paid signature gatherers did not work for more than a week or two. They all quit. They said it was too abusive.\\" On April 5, 2004, Nader failed in an attempt to get on the Oregon ballot. \\"Unwritten rules\\" disqualified over 700 valid voter signatures, all of which had already been verified by county elections officers, who themselves signed and dated every sheet with an affidavit of authenticity (often with a county seal as well). This subtraction left Nader 218 short of the 15,306 needed. He vowed to gather the necessary signatures in a petition drive. Secretary of State Bill Bradbury disqualified many of his signatures as fraudulent; the Marion County Circuit Court ruled that this action was unconstitutional as the criteria for Bradbury's disqualifications were based upon \\"unwritten rules\\" not found in electoral code, but the state Supreme Court ultimately reversed this ruling. Nader appealed this decision to the US Supreme Court, but a decision did not arrive before the 2004 election. The following list, based on information from Nader's campaign website, summarizes whether Nader appeared on a state's ballot, and whether that status had been disputed as of late October 2004, by Nader or his opponents: * Alabama: on the ballot * Alaska: on the ballot * Arizona: disputed ‚Äì * Arkansas: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * California: * Colorado: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Connecticut: on the ballot * Delaware: on the ballot * Florida: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Georgia: * Hawaii: disputed ‚Äì * Idaho: disputed ‚Äì * Iowa: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Illinois: disputed ‚Äì * Indiana: * Kansas: on the ballot * Kentucky: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Louisiana: on the ballot * Maine: disputed‚Äîruled on the ballot * Maryland: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Massachusetts: * Michigan: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Minnesota: on the ballot * Mississippi: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Missouri: * Montana: on the ballot * Nebraska: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * Nevada: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * New Hampshire: disputed‚Äîon the ballot * New Jersey: on the ballot * New Mexico: on the ballot * New York: on the ballot * North Carolina: disputed ‚Äì * North Dakota: on the ballot * Ohio: * Oklahoma: * Oregon: disputed ‚Äì (Kucera v.

In a majority of states where Nader's name was not printed on the ballot, write-in votes for the Nader/Camejo ticket were still permitted and counted. In Alabama and New York, a ballot line appeared in which running mate Peter Camejo was replaced with Jan D. Pierce, a Vice President of the Communications Workers of America and in 2000 was head of \\"Labor for Nader.\\" Pierce had also been filed as his running mate in Ohio, (PDF) (PDF) where they failed to get on the ballot. In Montana Camejo was replaced with Karen Sanchirico, an Ada County, Idaho Green Party activist and founder of the Idaho Patriots. Result Nader received 465,642 votes, for 0.38% of the total vote while finishing 3rd place once again, though with far fewer votes compared to four years prior.

He served in the United States Coast Guard from 1946 to 1947. He held a number of legal and governmental jobs, including as deputy Salt Lake County attorney, South Salt Lake city attorney, administrative assistant and field representative to U.S. Senator Frank E.

The district headquarters is the town of Chimanimani. Geography The district has an area of 3,450.14 km2. It is bounded on the east by Mozambique, on the north and northwest by Mutare District, on the west by Buhera District, and on the south by Chipinge District.\\"District Profile\\", Chimanimani Rural District Council. Accessed 10 April 2020. The Chimanimani Mountains extend through the eastern part of the district, stretching for some 50 km (31 mi) and forming the border with Mozambique.

Chimanimani Mountains Much of the range is composed of quartzite ridges, with Monte Binga (2,436m) the highest peak in the range and second-highest peak in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to montane woodlands and grasslands, highland tropical forests, and high- elevation grasslands and heathlands. The Chimanimani Mountains are protected by Chimanimani National Park, and are one of Zimbabwe's finest mountain wilderness areas and a popular hiking destination. Scenic Bridal Veil Falls are within the national park, close to the town of Chimanimani. During the Zimbabwe independence war, mountain passes in the Chimanimani area were frequently used by guerilla fighters between Zimbabwe and their camps in Mozambique, who laid mines along local roads to disrupt the local economy. Because of this, the passes were heavily mined by Rhodesian government forces. Land mines have continued to be a real hazard in the area, particularly after heavy rain. Chimanimani town The town of Chimanimani was founded by Thomas Moodie in 1892 and in 1895 it was moved to its current site and was officially called Melsetter after Moodie's family home in Scotland. The name was changed in 1982, after Zimbabwean independence (1980). The name initially was made Mandidzudzure, but after consultation with local residents, this was changed again to the current one. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town has a population of 1,370. The town had a tourist office, a bank, grocery, curio shops and the faded colonial Chimanimani Arms Hotel. In 1995 it also had a travellers' hostel called Heaven, with a permaculture smallholding which was a popular source of employment in the village. Frog & Fern Cottages on the way to Bridal Veil Falls provide self-catering cottages within walking distance of the town. The Chimanimani Arts Festival was a free music festival that began in 1998, and was held in August of each year.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 116th Mayor of Philadelphia from 1952 to 1956 and as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1957 to 1969. Clark was the only Unitarian Universalist elected to a major office in Pennsylvania in the modern era. The son of attorney and tennis player Joseph Sill Clark Sr., Clark pursued a legal career in Philadelphia after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He became involved in a reform movement that sought to break the power of the city's Republican political machine. After serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, Clark won election as city controller in 1949. In this capacity, he investigated and publicized scandals in the city government. In 1951, Clark won election as Mayor of Philadelphia, becoming the first Democrat to do so since 1884. As mayor, he sought to reduce corruption in city government and created low-income housing projects. After one term as mayor, Clark narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark earned a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members from his perch on the Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University. Early life and education One of two children, Joseph Clark was born in Philadelphia to Joseph Sill Clark Sr. and Kate Richardson Avery. His father, a longtime lawyer in the Germantown section of the city, was also a national tennis champion who won the 1885 U.S. National Championship in doubles with Dick Sears. His mother, whose family owned Avery Island in Louisiana, was the niece of Edmund McIlhenny, the inventor of Tabasco sauce. Clark was raised in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, and received his early education at Chestnut Hill Academy. He then attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he played on the school's baseball and football teams. He graduated from Middlesex in 1919 as class valedictorian. Clark studied at Harvard University, where he was a member of the baseball and track teams. He won several prizes, including the John Harvard scholarship for high academic distinction. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree in government, history and economics. Clark, who had spent time at the Bar B C Dude Ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, became a partner in the nearby Double Diamond Dude Ranch in 1924. He later returned to Philadelphia and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall and editor of the Law Review. He earned his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1926. Early career In December 1926, Clark was admitted to the bar and became an associate with his father's law firm of Clark, Clark, McCarthy and Wagner. That same year, he made his first entry into politics when he unsuccessfully ran as a progressive candidate for Republican committeeman. In 1928, he left the Republican Party and became a Democrat, supporting Al Smith in that year's presidential election. During the 1928 election, Clark founded the Democratic Warriors Club with Richardson Dilworth, beginning a long political partnership between the two. Both men became active in the reform movement to end corruption in city government, which was long controlled by a Republican machine. Clark was an unsuccessful candidate for the Philadelphia City Council in 1933, with Dilworth serving as his campaign manager. The following year, he joined the firm of Dechert, Bok, Smith and Clark, and continued to practice law for seven years. He managed Dilworth's unsuccessful campaign for the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1934. From 1934 to 1935, he served as Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. In this capacity, he engaged in trial work related to the closing of banks. In August 1941, Clark enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces (AAF) and was assigned as a captain in the Officers' Reserve Corps Headquarters at Washington, D.C. He later became director of the Organizational Planning Headquarters with the AAF. Following the entry of the United States into World War II, he was transferred to the China Burma India Theater as deputy chief of staff to General George E. Stratemeyer. He briefly served as acting chief of staff to General Stratemeyer, and attained the rank of colonel on October 15, 1943. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Legion of Merit, and Military Order of the British Empire. Returning to the United States in September 1945, he accompanied General Stratemeyer to Washington, D.C., where he helped design plans to defend the nation against air raids. Following his return to Philadelphia, Clark resumed his political activity and his partnership with Dilworth. He was manager of Dilworth's unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia against Republican incumbent Bernard Samuel in 1947. He then served as chairman of the citizens' committee for President Harry S. Truman in the 1948 election, and as chairman of the Philadelphia chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action from 1948 to 1949. Running as a reform Democrat, Clark was elected city controller in 1949, winning by more than 100,000 votes. Meanwhile, Dilworth was elected city treasurer by a similar margin. Serving from 1950 to 1952, Clark investigated and publicized scandals within the Republican-controlled city government, including the embezzlement of tax money and court funds, imprisonment of the fire marshal, falsification of records, and corruption in the water bureau. Many officials were impeached or indicted as a result, and nine even committed suicide. Mayor of Philadelphia Clark announced his candidacy for Mayor of Philadelphia in May 1951. Democratic leaders had wanted Dilworth to run for mayor, but Clark released a press statement declaring his \\"irrevocable decision to run for mayor.\\" Dilworth instead successfully ran for District Attorney of Philadelphia. Running on his record as city controller, Clark often used a broom while campaigning as a symbol of his pledge to \\"sweep out\\" corruption. His Republican challenger was Daniel A. Poling, a Baptist clergyman and editor of the Christian Herald. Clark was endorsed by several labor unions, Americans for Democratic Action, and The Philadelphia Inquirer. On November 6, 1951, he defeated Poling by a margin of 124,700 votes. With his victory, Clark became the first Democrat to be elected Mayor of Philadelphia since 1884. As of 2019 a Democrat has held the office ever since. Clark was the next to the last Mayor of Philadelphia to serve only one term. William J Green III who was elected in 1979, was the last. Clark was inaugurated as the 90th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 7, 1952. He was the first mayor to serve under Philadelphia's Home Rule Charter, which had reorganized city government by merging Philadelphia's city and county offices, establishing a limit of two successive terms for mayor, replacing patronage with a merit system for civil servants, and giving the mayor increased administrative, legislative, and investigative powers. During his administration, he reduced corruption within the Police Department and appointed several African Americans to city jobs. He adopted a $20 million tax increase and established a pay-as-you-go system. He created low-income housing projects, also establishing the position of housing coordinator. He also refused to accept personal gifts. His tenure also saw the transformation of the Penn Center and the Philadelphia waterfront. In 1952, Clark launched a television series Tell It To the Mayor in which he and other city officials answered questions about his administration. He endorsed Senator Estes Kefauver for the Democratic nomination in the 1952 presidential election. In 1955, he chartered the Food Distribution Center Corporation to create a new food market, and established the Urban Traffic and Transportation Board to design a mass transit system. In 1956, Clark became the first politician to receive the Philadelphia Award for promoting good governance in the city. U.S. Senate Clark, who had promised to serve as mayor for only one term, announced his candidacy for the United States Senate in 1956. After winning the Democratic nomination over the opposition of Philadelphia's party leaders, he faced first-term Republican incumbent James H. Duff, a popular former governor, in the general election. During the campaign, Clark ran on a liberal platform which included support for increasing the minimum wage, expanding Social Security, and repealing the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act. He also criticized President Dwight D. Eisenhower on international and domestic matters, and attacked Senator Duff's poor attendance record. On November 6, 1956, Clark narrowly defeated Duff by a margin of 50.1%-49.7%, winning by less than 18,000 out of 4.5 million votes cast. At the same time in the presidential election, President Eisenhower, who by this time claimed his farm in Gettysburg as his permanent address, carried Pennsylvania by well over 600,000 votes. During his early tenure in the Senate, Clark earned a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and congressional reform. He sponsored the Manpower Development and Training Act and the Area Redevelopment Act. He often clashed with Lyndon B. Johnson while the latter was Senate Majority Leader. In 1962, Clark was re-elected to a second term after narrowly defeating Congressman James E. Van Zandt by a 51%-49% margin. Clark was appointed to the Democratic Steering Committee in 1963, but conservative Southern Democrats thwarted his efforts to appoint more liberal Senators to committees. He was a critic of the Senate itself, which he called a \\"self- perpetuating oligarchy\\" in a 1963 address on the Senate floor. He challenged the seniority system and the filibuster. In 1964, he endorsed Genevieve Blatt, the state Secretary of Internal Affairs, over Judge Michael Musmanno in the Democratic senatorial primary. Clark's opposition to Musmanno was not well received by the Italian American community, who largely voted against Clark in 1968. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 but soon became an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War, condemning the war's escalation in 1965. In 1968, Clark was defeated for re-election to a third term by Congressman Richard Schweiker, losing by a margin of 52%-46%. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control, especially the 1968 Gun Control Act, and opposition to the Vietnam War. His campaign chairman in 1968 was Bucks County author James A. Michener. Later life and death Following his departure from the Senate, Clark served as a professor at Temple University in 1969. He was president of World Federalists U.S.A., an organization promoting the creation of a world government, from 1969 to 1971. He also served as chairman of the Coalition on National Priorities and Military Policy, and continued to attend meetings of Members of Congress for Peace Through Law. A strong opponent of Mayor Frank Rizzo, he supported Bill Green III in the 1971 Democratic primary and then Republican W. Thacher Longstreth in the general election. He was chairman of independent candidate Charles Bowser's campaign in 1975. Clark died at his home in Chestnut Hill, at age 88. His remains were cremated and interred at St. Thomas' Church Cemetery in Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania. Personal life and family Joseph Clark was descended from a prominent financial family in Philadelphia. His great-grandfather, Enoch White Clark, was the founder of E. W. Clark & Co. Enoch's son Edward was Clark's paternal grandfather and brother of Clarence Howard Clark Sr. Clarence Sr.'s son Clarence Jr. served as president of the Centennial National Bank. Clark was the nephew of Edward Walter Clark Jr., commodore of the Philadelphia Corinthian Yacht Club and father of Edward III; Clarence Munroe Clark, a noted tennis player like his brother; and Percy Clark, a lawyer and noted cricketer. Percy's daughter Mary was married to Nelson Rockefeller from 1930 to 1962, before he served as Vice President of the United States. Clark's paternal grandmother was the daughter of Joseph and Jane (n√©e Todhunter) Sill, who were social reformers and leaders in antebellum Philadelphia's benevolence movement. Joseph Sill served as secretary, vice president, and president of the St. George Society of Philadelphia, an aid organization for English immigrants. Clark was married three times and had two children. He and his first wife, Elizabeth Story Jenks, had one son, Joseph S. Clark III. He was married to his second wife, Noel Hall, from April 1935 until their divorce in September 1967. He and Noel had one daughter, Noel Clairborne Clark. Two weeks after his divorce, Clark married Iris Cole Richey, a former editor of the Pennsylvania Manual, to whom he remained married until his death.

Tar paper is made by impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. Tar paper is distinguished from roofing felt which is impregnated with asphalt instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms. Tar paper has been in use for centuries. Originally felt was made from recycled rags but today felts are made of recycled paper products (typically cardboard) and sawdust. The most common product is #15 felt. Before the oil crisis, felt weighed about 15 pounds per square (one square = 100 square feet) and hence the asphalt-impregnated felt was called \\"15#\\" and \\"15-pound felt\\". Modern, inorganic mats no longer weigh 0.73 kg/m2, and to reflect this fact the new felts are called \\"#15\\". In fact, #15 mats can weigh from 7.5 to 12.5 pounds/sq depending on the manufacturer and the standard to which felt is made (i.e., CGSB, ASTM D227 Standard Specification for Coal-tar saturated Organic Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, ASTM D4990, Standard Specification for Coal Tar Glass Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, or none). Thirty-pound (30#) felt is now #30 felt, and usually weighs 16 to 27 pounds per square. Tar paper is more accurately a Grade D building paper (the Grade D designation derives from a federal specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. Building paper is manufactured from virgin kraft paper, unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes‚Äîthe amount of time it takes for a moisture sensitive chemical indicator to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more moisture resistant and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3 lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material, however, does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts. Uses Workers using roofing shovels to remove composite shingles from a roof. Roofing felt or tar paper can be seen here as a thin black layer between the shingles and the underlying wooden structure. Tar paper is far less common than asphalt felt paper and is used, among other things, for waterproofing roofs to prevent ingress of moisture. It is used in a small percentage of built-up roofs (BUR), as underlayment with asphalt, wood, shake, and other shingles, or even gravel, since tar paper itself isn't particularly wind- or sun-resistant. It is sold in rolls of various widths, lengths, and thicknesses ‚Äì rolls, long and \\"15 lb\\" () and \\"30 lb\\" () weights are common in the U.S. ‚Äì often marked with chalk lines at certain intervals to aid in laying it out straight on roofs with the proper overlap (more overlap for flatter roofs). It can be installed in several ways, such as staples or roofing nails, but it is also sometimes applied in several layers with hot asphalt, cold asphalt (adhesive), or non- asphaltic adhesives. Older construction sometimes used a lighter-weight tar paper, stapled up with some overlap, as a water- and wind-proofing material on walls, but modern carpenters more often use widths of housewrap.

It is bounded on the north by South King Street, beyond which is Pioneer Square; on the south by South Spokane Street, beyond which is more of the Industrial District; on the west by the Duwamish Waterway, across which is West Seattle; and on the east by Metro Transit's Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and SoDo Busway, beyond which is the International District and the rest of the Industrial District. SoDo was originally named for being located south of the (King)dome, but since the stadium's demolition in 2000, the name has been taken to mean south of downtown. The moniker was adopted in the 1990s after the renaming of the Sears building to the SODO Center (later Starbucks Center, the world headquarters of Starbucks at First Avenue S. and S. Lander Street). It includes Seattle's downtown stadium district of T-Mobile Park (where Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners play their home baseball games) and CenturyLink Field (built on the former Kingdome site; where the NFL's Seattle Seahawks play their home football games and Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC play their home soccer matches). The Mariners' popular marketing campaign in the early 2000s used the SoDo moniker in the catchphrase \\"SoDo Mojo\\". SoDo deliberately echoes SoHo in New York City, where, during the 1970s, cheap spaces vacated by departing factories were converted by artists into lofts and studios. SoDo has undergone a similar process but has not experienced much of the gentrification experienced by its putative model. Some of SoDo's warehouse buildings remain in their original use; others have been carved up for artists' lofts, art galleries, and an assortment of other businesses. One building directly across from T-Mobile Park houses Pyramid Breweries, Inc. downstairs and a variety of small offices upstairs. As one travels farther south along First Avenue S., these conversions peter out, and light manufacturing, warehouses, and warehouse-style retail stores predominate. Demographics According to the 2000 U.S. Census, SoDo has a population of 2,602, with a median age of 41.2; 458 residences are owner- occupied and 536 are rented. (This probably slightly understates the population, because there are a certain number of artists living illegally in studio spaces that are not zoned residential, plus a resident homeless population.) The average annual household income is given as $42,208; the racial breakdown is 41% White, 28% Asian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic/Latino, 3% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 5% other. Transportation SoDo main thoroughfares are First and Fourth Avenues S. and Alaskan Way S. (north- and south-bound) and S. Lander and Holgate Streets, Edgar Mart√≠nez Drive S., and S. Royal Brougham Way (east- and west-bound). The western terminus of Interstate 90 is in SoDo, which travels east towards Boston, Massachusetts. The neighborhood is also served by public transit service. Sound Transit operates Central Link light rail service through the neighborhood, stopping at two stations: SODO at Lander Street, and Stadium at Royal Brougham Way. The SODO Busway runs along 5th Avenue South and carries bus routes from King County Metro and Sound Transit Express.

Characteristics  Generally, teams employ a point forward when their best playmaker is a forward rather than a guard. A point forward is typically responsible for bringing the ball up the court and being the primary facilitator on offense, but may merely direct play once a guard brings the ball up-court. Assuming the role of point forward may cut down on that player's scoring, as distributing the ball to others decreases shot attempts. Basketball Hall of Fame small forward Larry Bird, a prolific scorer with exceptional passing skills, quipped \\"I'm a point forward now\\" after his coaches sought him to score less and pass more. Don Nelson, a coach often associated with the point forward in his Nellie Ball system, used the role when his guards were not strong ball-handlers. Other coaches have used point forwards to free their guards to score more, a strategy of increasing importance as the three-point shot has become the sport's primary offensive weapon. ESPN analyst Dave Telep maintained a point forward needed to be more than merely an adept passer but also had to facilitate the offense for teammates at least half of the time.  Origin of the term  The origin of the term point forward is cloudy. Two former members of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks claim to have coined it: Bucks small forward Marques Johnson maintains he created it during the 1984 playoffs when the team became short on point guards after Nate Archibald was sidelined with a hamstring injury. When coach Don Nelson instructed Johnson to run the offense he says he responded, \\"OK, so instead of a point guard, I'm a point forward\\". Then-Bucks assistant coach Del Harris claims he first mentioned the term to Nelson while discussing how to best use Paul Pressey. Harris says he came up with the term while coaching Robert Reid with the Houston Rockets. Harris credits his predecessor as Rockets coach Tom Nissalke's use of small forward Rick Barry as originating the point forward position.  History  Historically, one of the first to fill the role was John Johnson, who played it for the 1970s Seattle SuperSonics alongside two scoring-minded guards, Gus Williams and Dennis Johnson. During the 1980s Milwaukee Bucks Marques Johnson and Paul Pressey played point forward under coach Don Nelson. Larry Bird, a 6'9\\" small forward who excelled at both scoring and rebounding in that position was also an exceptional passer and facilitator of others on offense. In the flow of games, he often played a point forward role for the great Boston Celtics teams of the 1980s; the 6'9\\" Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, who orchestrated the Los Angeles Lakers' offense in the 1980s as the team's point guard, moved to a point forward role upon returning heavier after his HIV announcement.

He has been inducted into the Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame. A prominent trial lawyer, Papantonio co- hosts Ring of Fire, a nationally syndicated progressive weekly radio program, with Sam Seder, where he is referenced as America's Lawyer. In December 2016, Papantonio began hosting a program on RT America called America's Lawyer. Biography Papantonio graduated from the University of Florida and received his J.D. from Cumberland School of Law. He was admitted to The Florida Bar in 1982 and the bar of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in 1983. He graduated from DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida. He is a senior partner in the Pensacola, Florida-based Levin Papantonio Law Firm, a leading mass torts firm. He is noted for his success in mass torts, product liability, personal injury, and wrongful death cases, and has returned numerous verdicts of multimillion-dollar damages for his clients and his firm. He has been listed in Best Lawyers in America since 1999, and has written several books, including the legal thriller Law and Disorder; Resurrecting Aesop: Fables Lawyers Should Remember; Clarence Darrow, the Journeyman; and In Search of Atticus Finch, A Motivational Book for Lawyers, as well as Defenses You Can Count on in an Asbestosis Case and How to Prove a Sick Building Case. He also co-authored Closing Arguments-The Last Battle with Fred Levin. Papantonio says he wrote In Search of Atticus Finch as a \\"wake-up call to the legal profession that has largely lost its moral compass\\" and has said that \\"seventy percent of kids coming out of law school want to represent corporations and get paid exorbitant amounts of money,\\" he says. \\"They're willing to sell their souls to the highest bidder. We need to bring more quality to what we do as lawyers, we need to be better servants to the community and we need to have more political involvement for positive change in the country.\\" In 2004, Papantonio helped launch a nationwide organization called Mass Torts Made Perfect. This organization holds annual conferences for the top personal injury attorneys and teaches them successful litigation strategies to use against multi-national corporations. Ring of Fire airs weekly on Saturdays from 3-6 p.m. EST. On the radio show Papantonio, a Methodist, often criticizes the Christian right. He has said that \\"I come from a pretty strong spiritual center, but it doesn't change the way I judge people. Simply put, the Sermon on the Mount makes much more sense to me than the frenzied rantings of America's new 'religious right'. They have become an element of American politics that threatens our sense of decency as well as our democracy.\\" His role on Ring of Fire was featured in the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp, in which he offers commentary on many of the scenes depicted. According to DVD commentary by the film's directors, Papantonio was added to the film later on because they felt there wasn't any \\"tension\\" in it, and they wanted another viewpoint. Ring of Fire began in 2004 and was syndicated by the now defunct Air America Radio until January 2010. Papantonio was also involved at Air America as a member of the Board of Directors, and as a co-contributor to the New York Times bestseller, Air America, the Playbook, a collection of essays, transcripts, and interviews by network personalities released in the run-up to the 2006 congressional elections.\\"Best Sellers\\", New York Times, October 8, 2006.

Throughout all his life, Michurin worked to create new sorts of fruit plants. He introduced over 300 new varieties. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner of Labour for his achievements. The town of Michurinsk is named in his honor, as was the Bulgarian town of Tsarevo between 1950 and 1991. Life and work In 1875, Michurin leased a strip of land of about 500 square metres not far from Tambov, began collecting plants, and started his research in pomology and selection. In 1899, he acquired a much bigger strip of land of about 130,000 square metres and moved all of his plants there. In 1920, right after the end of the Russian Civil War, Vladimir Lenin ordered People's Commissar of Agriculture Semion Sereda to organize an analytic research project on Michurin's works and practical achievements. On September 11, 1922, Mikhail Kalinin visited Michurin at Lenin's personal request. On November 20, 1923, the Council of People's Commissars recognized Michurin's \\"fruit garden\\" as an institution of state importance. In 1928, the Soviets established a selectionist genetic station on the basis of Michurin's garden, which would be re-organized into the Michurin Central Genetic Laboratory in 1934. Michurin made a major contribution in the development of genetics, especially in the field of pomology. In his cytogenetic laboratory, he researched cell structure and experimented with artificial polyploidy. Michurin studied the aspects of heredity in connection with the natural course of ontogenesis and external influence, creating a whole new concept of predominance. He proved that predominance depends on heredity, ontogenesis, and phylogenesis of the initial cell structure and also on individual features of hybrids and conditions of cultivation. In his works, Michurin assumed a possibility of changing genotype under external influence. Michurin was one of the founding fathers of scientific agricultural selection. He worked on hybridization of plants of similar and different origins, cultivating methods in connection with the natural course of ontogenesis, directing the process of predominance, evaluation and selection of seedlings, and acceleration of the process of selection with the help of physical and chemical factors. Michurin's method of crossing of geographically distant plants would be widely used by other selectionists. He worked out theoretical basis and some practical means for hybridization of geographically distant plants. Michurin also proposed means for overcoming the genetic barrier of incompatibility during the process of hybridization, such as pollination of the young hybrids during their first florescence, preliminary vegetative crossing, and use of a ‚Äúmediator‚Äù, pollination with the mix of different kinds of pollen. The Soviets began to cultivate Michurin's hybrids of apple, pear, cherry, rowan and others. The variety Antonovka is the most famous apple he developed. It is so popular in Russia that it was given the name The People's Apple. It is widely used in Russia and Poland for fresh eating and culinary purposes. In other parts of Europe and North America, it is principally used as a hardy rootstock. Michurin also cultivated hybrids of grape, apricot, sweet cherry and other southern plants in the northern climates. One of the most highly cited phrases by Michurin was: \\"We cannot wait for favors from Nature. To take them from it ‚Äì that is our task.\\" During the Lysenkoism campaign, work by Michurin was misused, after his death, by Soviet propaganda as an argument against genetics. A pseudo-scientist, Lysenko claimed later to be the successor of the Michurin's school. References    External links  Some Problems of Method by I.V.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 8, 1995. In the episode, Homer joins an ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jim Reardon. Patrick Stewart guest stars as \\"Number One\\", the leader of the Springfield chapter of the Stonecutters. It features cultural references to Freemasonry and the films Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Emperor. The episode has received universal acclaim from fans and television critics and has been called one of the best episodes of the series by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide. The song \\"We Do\\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Music And Lyrics\\". Plot After Homer notices that his coworkers Lenny and Carl enjoy special privileges at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, he learns they are part of an ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters. To join, one must either be the son of a Stonecutter or save the life of a Stonecutter. While extolling the secret society at the dinner table, Homer discovers that his father is a member and is admitted. After his initiation, Homer takes great pleasure in the society's secret privileges. During a celebratory dinner with his fellow Stonecutters, he unwittingly destroys their Hallowed Sacred Parchment. He is stripped of his Stonecutter robes and sentenced to walk home naked. Before he leaves, the Stonecutters see that Homer has a birthmark in the shape of their emblem, signifying he is the Chosen One who will lead them to greatness. Homer is crowned the new leader of the Stonecutters. He soon feels isolated by his power when the other members treat him differently because he is their leader. When Homer asks Lisa for advice, she suggests that he have the Stonecutters perform volunteer work for the community. The Stonecutters take this the wrong way and form a new society, the Ancient Mystic Society of No Homers. Homer becomes despondent about losing his secret club. Marge consoles him by telling him he is a member of a very selective club: the Simpson family. To initiate Homer, Bart and Lisa paddle his butt. Production Patrick Stewart guest stars as Number One. Although \\"Homer the Great\\" was written by John Swartzwelder, the story was suggested by executive producer David Mirkin. Mirkin did not have enough time to write the episode and asked Swartzwelder to do it. Mirkin came up with the idea while driving home from a rewrite early in the morning and listened to a religious radio station where they were talking about Freemasonry. Mirkin decided it would make a great episode, where many people in Springfield were members of a Masonic society and Homer was left on the outside and felt neglected.Mirkin, David (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer the Great\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The song \\"We Do\\" was not included in the original script and was suggested by Matt Groening. It was written by the writers' room, who threw in as many things that annoyed them as they possibly could. It was described as \\"one of the series' best musical numbers\\" by Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide, and was later included in the clip show \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\". The episode guest stars Patrick Stewart as Number One. Stewart said, \\"I think my appearance in The Simpsons and an appearance that I did on Sesame Street‚Äîin praise of the letter B‚Äîwere perhaps the two most distinguished bits of work that I've done in the US.\\" Mirkin has said that Patrick Stewart is \\"one of the best guest performances\\" because \\"he was so committed to [the] character\\". Cultural references The term \\"Stonecutters\\" and the organization's symbol are references to Freemasonry. The Stonecutters are in possession of the Ark of the Covenant and when they burn Homer's underwear in it, souls escape, which is a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark. When crowned \\"The Chosen One\\", Homer, dressed in finery, enters through some curtains, a reference to the 1987 film The Last Emperor.Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for \\"Homer the Great\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer the Great\\" finished 1st in the ratings for the week of January 2 to January 8, 1995. The episode was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received universal acclaim from television critics and is often cited as one of the best episodes of the show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a brilliant crack at freemasonry, with all the secret signs, one-upmanship, rituals and unusual membership rules. Add to this Patrick Stewart's amazing voice and you have one of the better episodes of the series.\\" TV Squad's Adam Finley said the episode \\"does a great job of satirizing Freemasons\\". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD: \\"I think it peters out a bit as it progresses; the best moments show the influence of the Stonecutters, and the show drags a little toward the end. Nonetheless, it still offers a solid piece of work.\\" Patrick Enwright of MSNBC listed \\"Homer the Great\\" as his third favorite episode, saying, \\"as a whole [it] is (almost) unsurpassable\\". Dave Petruska of the Tucson Citizen listed \\"Homer the Great\\" as his favorite episode \\"because it is such a wonderful satire on fraternal organizations and because of Patrick Stewart's hilarious guest-starring role as 'Number One'.\\" In 2010, Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the fifth best in the show's history. Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Stewart's performance as the ninth best guest appearance in the show's history. John Swartzwelder and Alf Clausen were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Music And Lyrics\\" for the song \\"We Do\\".

She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba between 1999 and 2003, and was in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2015. Education and business career Smith was born in Deloraine, Manitoba, Canada. She holds a Master's Degree in Education from the University of Manitoba (majoring in Math and Science), and a music diploma from the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Ontario. She worked as a teacher for twenty-three years before entering political life, and in 1986 received the Hedley Award for Excellence in Research. During the 1990s, she served as a liaison for private and home- schooling groups. Smith is also an entrepreneur. She published a book entitled Lies My Kid's Teacher Told Me in 1996, and a follow-up entitled, Tools of the Trade a few years later. She was also the owner of Gem Records for a time. In 1996, she was nominated for Manitoba's Woman Entrepreneur of the Year award. Career in provincial politics Smith was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1999 provincial election, as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the south-central Winnipeg constituency of Fort Garry. She narrowly defeated New Democrat Lawrie Cherniack by thirty votes, in one of the closest constituency races of the campaign. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Smith served as the Progressive Conservative critic for education and justice. Fort Garry was a top NDP target in the 2003 election, and Smith lost the constituency to New Democrat Kerri Irvin-Ross by eighty- seven votes. Career in federal politics In 2002, as justice critic for the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives, she spoke against a bill which provided adoption rights to same-sex couples in that province. Smith argued that her party did not oppose same-sex adoption rights as such, but that the proposed legislation was flawed. In a June 2005 parliamentary debate on same-sex marriage, she stated that, \\"If (her daughter) decides to get married, she will know that the meaning of marriage is the union of a man and a woman. If she chooses otherwise, it will be her choice.\\" The result of the bill, she said, would be to \\"cause marriage to just go away with the stroke of a pen.\\" She also claimed the bill was discriminatory against married couples. The Toronto Star reported that Smith broke down in tears during the debate. In the 2004 federal election, Smith campaigned as a Conservative candidate in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan‚ÄîSt. Paul. She had previously been nominated as a candidate of the Canadian Alliance, where she was the Manitoba organizer for Stockwell Day's bid for leadership, before that party merged with the Progressive Conservatives in 2003‚Äì04. Smith narrowly defeated Liberal candidate Terry Duguid, 13,582 votes to 13,304. Smith was named Manitoba caucus chair, giving her a seat on the Conservative Party's Planning and Priorities Committee. She was also a member of the Status of Women Group, Ukrainian-Canadian Parliamentary Group, Canada-Israel Parliamentary Group and Canada-USA Relations Parliamentary Group. In 2004, Smith was selected to be part of the Canadian delegation assigned to travel to Ukraine and observe a court-ordered repeat of the second round of voting the Ukraine presidential election. Smith defeated Duguid again by a significantly larger plurality in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives won a national minority government. Smith along with the Conservative government were re-elected in the October 2008 federal election to another minority government. In 2006, Smith introduced a private member's bill, asking parliamentarians to condemn human trafficking and come up with a comprehensive plan to combat the problem. In February 2007, Smith put forward motion C-153 to put a national action plan in place to combat human trafficking, and the House of Commons passed the motion unanimously. Smith began developing the plan in 2008 and continued to work on it for several years. She sought to have the plan developed and established in order \\"to rescue and restore the victims and prosecute the offenders\\" of human trafficking. The plan was established by the Government of Canada on June 6, 2012 as the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. Also in 2007, Smith introduced a private member's bill called the Clean Internet Act (Bill C-427). The bill was passed unanimously, and set in place a strategy to combat human trafficking globally by opposing such trafficking across international borders, specifically in the case of women and children being trafficked for sexual purposes. In her words, the bill would \\"... prevent the use of the Internet to distribute child pornography, material that advocates, promotes or incites racial hatred, and material that portrays or promotes violence against women.\\"MP Joy Smith presents clean Internet act to House. www.joysmith.ca. Available at: http://www.joysmith.ca/news_details.asp?ID=402 . Accessed on: April 23, 2007. Part of the bill proposes a \\"know your subscriber\\" requirement for ISPs and would mandate them to deny Internet access to offenders. It also proposes to give special searching powers to the Ministry of Industry. The above features have led it to be criticized as something that \\"... would not look out-of- place in countries that aggressively censor the Internet.\\"Conservative MP Introduces 'Clean Internet Act'. michaelgeist.ca. Available at: http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1884/125/. Accessed on: May 1, 2007. In her column, \\"Sex traders, keep your hands off our children!\\" (The Province, July 29), Smith asserted that \\"the average age of entry into prostitution in Canada is between 12 and 14 years of age.\\" In October 2010, Smith conducted the inaugural Honouring Heroes Award Ceremony at Eastview Community Church, an annual event recognizing people who have fought to support victims of sexual trafficking. In 2012, Smith presented human-trafficking-related Bill C-10 to the Senate of Canada. The bill was eventually passed as the Safe Streets and Communities Act, a policy of the Canadian government. While Smith was in Ottawa to present Bill C-10, she was also scheduled to speak on the talkback panel in conjunction with the human-trafficking-related play She Has a Name. Smith proposed and claimed to be working on, in July 2013, a bill that disallows access to pornography online for all Canadians by default unless they choose to opt in, similar to earlier legislation put forward in the U.K. by British Prime Minister David Cameron. Details of what content specifically would be deemed \\"pornographic\\" and blocked were not provided. She did not run for re-election in 2015. Out of politics In 2012, while in political office, Joy founded The Joy Smith Foundation Inc, a registered charity that works to suppress human trafficking in Canadahttp://www.joysmithfoundation.com/p/our-history. After retiring from politics, Joy began working full-time for her organization, which has been criticized for spending significantly more on operational and overhead costs and less on actual charity work.

Early life Burchett was expelled from school at age 12 for tattooing his classmates and joined the Royal Navy at age 13, developing his skills while travelling overseas as a deckhand on . After absconding from the Navy, he returned to England. Career With studio on Mile End Road and at 72 Waterloo Road, London, Burchett became the first star tattooist and a favourite among the wealthy upper class and European royalty. Among his customers were King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and King Frederick IX of Denmark. Though it was reputed that he tattooed the 'Sailor King' George V of the United Kingdom, there is no reliable evidence to attest to this actually being the case. He also tattooed Horace Ridler ('The Great Omi'). He constantly designed new tattoos from his worldwide travel, incorporating African, Japanese and Southeast Asian motifs into his work. In the 1930s, he developed cosmetic tattooing with such techniques as permanently darkening eyebrows. He continued tattooing until he died suddenly on Good Friday in 1953 at the age of 80. His apparent autobiography, Memoirs of a Tattooist, edited by Peter Leighton (a pseudonym of writer Edward Spiro/EH Cookridge), was published in 1958 by Oldbourne Book Company and includes photographs illustrating some of his tattoo designs, though recent research has revealed that the book is not actually a compilation of Burchett's own notes, but a confection cribbed quickly from newspaper articles shortly after his death.

It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the shareholder expressed as an annualized percentage. It is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company assuming that the dividends are reinvested each time they are paid. This growth is expressed as a percentage as the compound annual growth rate. The main benefit of TSR is that it allows the performance of shares to be compared even though some of the shares may have a high growth and low dividends and others may have low growth and high dividends. Most stock market indices only use the growth of the prices of the companies making up the index. However, when they use TSR for the companies it is called a total return index or accumulation index. For example, corresponding to the S&P; 500 index calculated by Standard and Poor's, there is the S&P; 500 TR index. In the technology sector, a study has found that regardless of a company's size, the more diverse the portfolio, the more difficult it is to generate high TSR. In practice TSR is difficult to calculate since it involves knowing the price of the shares at the time the dividends are paid. However, as an approximation over one year it can be calculated as follows with: Price_{begin} = share price at beginning of year, Price_{end} = share price at end of year, Dividends = dividends paid over year and TSR = total shareholder return, TSR is computed as TSR={(Price_{end} - Price_{begin} + Dividends)}/{Price_{begin}} References Stock market Shareholders ","title":"Total shareholder return"},{"id":"986627","text":"In computer and video games, sequence breaking is the act of performing actions or obtaining items out of the intended linear order, or of skipping \\"required\\" actions or items entirely. Sequence breaking is often used to beat a game unusually quickly (see speedrunning), to beat it while only completing a few objectives or obtaining a few items, to obtain useful items early in the game, to make the game more difficult, or to help push a game as far as possible in some other way. History of the term Though sequence breaking as a concept has existed almost since the inception of computer games complex enough to have sequential storylines, apparently the first documented action in a video game to be called a sequence break occurred in the Nintendo GameCube game Metroid Prime, in a thread called \\"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\\". In the game, the rock monster Thardus was designed to be a required boss before the Gravity Suit and the Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items, and thus saving time if the goal is to complete the game as quickly as possible. When a gamer named Steven Banks achieved this feat on January 18, 2003, he posted his discovery on the Metroid Prime message board on GameFAQs. The thread attracted a number of interested gamers, and the term sequence breaking was incidentally coined. The term has since grown in popularity and is now often applied to unintended shortcuts in any game. The term has become so pervasive that it has begun appearing in video games itself, and inspired by games such as Super Metroid, game designers may create their games with sequence breaking in mind.

Last Revised: 20 October 2006 is the closeness of the agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same measurand carried out under the same conditions of measurement. In other words, the measurements are taken by a single person or instrument on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time. A less-than-perfect test‚Äìretest reliability causes test‚Äìretest variability. Such variability can be caused by, for example, intra-individual variability and intra-observer variability. A measurement may be said to be repeatable when this variation is smaller than a pre-determined acceptance criterion. Test‚Äìretest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined \\"critical difference\\", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments. Conditions The following conditions need to be fulfilled in the establishment of repeatability: *the same experimental tools *the same observer *the same measuring instrument, used under the same conditions *the same location *repetition over a short period of time. *same objectives Repeatability methods were developed by Bland and Altman (1986). If the correlation between separate administrations of the test is high (e.g. 0.7 or higher as in this Cronbach's alpha-internal consistency-tableGeorge, D., & Mallery, P. (2003). SPSS for Windows step by step: A simple guide and reference. 11.0 update (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn & Bacon.), then it has good test‚Äìretest reliability. The repeatability coefficient is a precision measure which represents the value below which the absolute difference between two repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%. The standard deviation under repeatability conditions is part of precision and accuracy. Attribute agreement analysis for defect databases An attribute agreement analysis is designed to simultaneously evaluate the impact of repeatability and reproducibility on accuracy. It allows the analyst to examine the responses from multiple reviewers as they look at several scenarios multiple times. It produces statistics that evaluate the ability of the appraisers to agree with themselves (repeatability), with each other (reproducibility), and with a known master or correct value (overall accuracy) for each characteristic ‚Äì over and over again. Psychological testing Because the same test is administered twice and every test is parallel with itself, differences between scores on the test and scores on the retest should be due solely to measurement error. This sort of argument is quite probably true for many physical measurements. However, this argument is often inappropriate for psychological measurement, because it is often impossible to consider the second administration of a test a parallel measure to the first. The second administration of a psychological test might yield systematically different scores than the first administration due to the following reasons: # The attribute that is being measured may change between the first test and the retest. For example, a reading test that is administered in September to a third grade class may yield different results when retaken in June. One would expect some change in children's reading ability over that span of time, a low test‚Äìretest correlation might reflect real changes in the attribute itself. # The experience of taking the test itself can change a person's true score. For example, completing an anxiety inventory could serve to increase a person's level of anxiety. # Carryover effect, particularly if the interval between test and retest is short. When retested, people may remember their original answer, which could affect answers on the second administration.

He has campaigned for elected office at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, and served as a city councillor in Winnipeg from 1989 to 1995. He is the son of two time world and Canada curling champion Don Duguid. Duguid holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and a Master's Degree in Environmental Science. He has been involved a variety of eco-business pursuits in the Winnipeg area, including being president of Sustainable Development International, and serving as chairman of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission. He was president and CEO of the Gateway North Marketing Agency, which is responsible for ensuring the survival of the Port of Churchill and the Hudson Bay Rail Line. He is also the founding president of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, a not-for-profit organization created after the outbreak of SARS to support and enhance the mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Career Prior to his entry to politics Duguid was a long-time environmental activist. He was executive director of the Manitoba Liberal Party in the 1980s. He served as a member of Winnipeg City Council from 1989 to 1995 for the wards of Miles MacDonell (20,000 constituents) and North Kildonan (40,000 constituents). He was chairman of the Public Works Committee. In that position he helped create Winnipeg's blue box recycling program. He stepped down as councillor to run for mayor of Winnipeg in 1995, but the incumbent mayor, Susan Thompson, was re-elected. =Post-city council= After municipal politics, Duguid had a successful career as a leader and executive in the not-for-profit sector. From 1995 to 1997 he was president and CEO of Gateway North International, working to secure a future for the rail line that leads to the Port of Churchill. He oversaw the transfer of both the rail line and the port, together worth $100 million, to a new owner. From 1997 to 2000 he was president of Sustainable Development International, a consulting firm specializing in conservation and international management. From 2000 to 2004, Duguid was chairman of Manitoba's Clean Environment Commission, which is responsible for carrying out public hearings for major development projects, including forestry and hydro-electric development. Duguid was the founding president of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg, beginning as such in 2004 and serving until 2009. Duguid had been part of the original task force that set out to make recommendations to improve Canada's response to infectious disease outbreaks in the wake of the SARS epidemic of 2003, especially in Toronto. The task force recommended the establishment of ICID and the Public Health Agency of Canada, with both to be located in Winnipeg. =Federal elections= Duguid at a 2017 CMHC funding announcement as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development. In the 2004 Canadian federal election, Duguid was the Liberal candidate in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan‚ÄîSt. Paul, a riding previously held by Liberal MP Rey Pagtakhan, who chose to run in a different riding. Duguid narrowly lost (13582 votes to 13304) to Conservative candidate Joy Smith.Adams, Christopher (2008). Politics in Manitoba: Parties, Leaders, and Voters, p. 211. University of Manitoba Press. He ran against Smith again in 2006, but Smith was re-elected in an election that saw the Conservatives win a minority government. Duguid ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Winnipeg South in the 2011 Canadian federal election. He finished second behind the incumbent Conservative, Rod Bruinooge. Winnipeg South Member of Parliament The 2015 federal election again saw Duguid running as the Liberal candidate in Winnipeg South; this time he was elected as the Liberals replaced the Conservative majority government with one of their own, which also included winning six of Winnipeg's other seven House seats. After the election Duguid was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development, Jean-Yves Duclos. Duguid was then named Parliamentary Secretary for the Status of Women on January 28, 2017, serving under Maryam Monsef. He was a member of the Canada-China Legislative Association and served as vice- chair of the group.

Grey deposits that include pyroclastic flows and volcanic mudflows (lahars) are visible extending from the volcano toward the coastline. NASA ISS photo, 11 October 2009, a view from the northeast looking southwest Relief Map Volcanic ash (tuff) from Montserrat The Soufri√®re Hills are an active, complex stratovolcano with many lava domes forming its summit on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. Many volcanoes in the Caribbean are named Soufri√®re (French: \\"sulfur outlet\\"). These include La Soufri√®re or Soufri√®re Saint Vincent on the island of Saint Vincent, and La Grande Soufri√®re on Guadeloupe. After a long period of dormancy, the Soufri√®re Hills volcano became active in 1995 and has continued to erupt ever since. Its eruptions have rendered more than half of Montserrat uninhabitable, destroying the capital city, Plymouth, and causing widespread evacuations: about two thirds of the population have left the island.http://webra.cas.sc.edu/hvri/feature/jun2014_dom.aspx The 1997 Soufriere Hills Eruption It is andesitic in nature, and the current pattern of activity includes periods of lava dome growth, punctuated by brief episodes of dome collapse which result in pyroclastic flows, ash venting, and explosive eruption. The volcano is monitored by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity. The Centre Hills in the central part of the island and the Silver Hills in the north are older volcanic massifs related to the subduction zone. Early history *2460 BCE (¬± 70 years): An explosive eruption formed the Crater at the top of the volcano. * 1550 CE (¬± 50 years): Between 25 and 65 million cubic metres of lava was erupted at Castle Peak.  1995-1999 eruption  Seismic activity had occurred in 1897‚Äì1898, 1933‚Äì1937, and again in 1966‚Äì1967, but the eruption that began on 18 July 1995 was the first since the turn of the 20th century in Montserrat. When pyroclastic flows and mudflows began occurring regularly, the capital, Plymouth, was evacuated, and a few weeks later a pyroclastic flow covered the city in several metres of debris. The first phreatic explosion in this new period of activity occurred on 21 August 1995, and such activity lasted for 18 weeks until it caused an andesitic lava dome formation. This was initially confined by a sector-collapse scar. This period lasted for another 60 weeks, after which there were major dome collapses and two periods of explosive volcanic eruptions and fountain-collapse pyroclastic flows. The explosion blanketed Plymouth, away, in a thick layer of ash and darkened the sky almost completely. Earthquakes continued to occur in three epicenter zones: beneath the Soufri√®re Hills volcano, in the ridge running to the north- east, and beneath St George's Hill, about to the north-west. A large eruption on 25 June 1997 resulted in the deaths of nineteen people. The island's airport was directly in the path of the main pyroclastic flow and was completely destroyed. Montserrat's tourist industry also crashed, although it began to recover within fifteen years. The governments of the United Kingdom and Montserrat led the aid effort, including a ¬£41 million package provided to the Montserrat population; however, riots followed as the people protested that the British Government was not doing enough to aid relief. The riots followed a ¬£10 million aid offer by International Development Secretary Clare Short, prompting the resignation of Bertrand Osborne, then Chief Minister of Montserrat, after allegations of being too pro-British and not demanding a better offer. The British destroyer took a large role in evacuating Montserrat's population to other islands; this included Antigua and Barbuda, who warned they would not be able to cope with many more refugees. About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 went to the United Kingdom. =Destroyed settlements= The following is a list of Montserrat settlements destroyed by the eruption of the Soufri√®re Hills volcano: *Bethel *Bramble *Dyers *Fairfield *Farm *Farrell's *Farrell's Yard *Galway's Estate *Harris *Hermitage *Long Ground *Morris's *Plymouth ‚Äì the capital of Montserrat, initially evacuated in August 1995; abandoned and destroyed in 1997 *Saint Patrick's *Robuscus Mt *Soufri√®re *Streatham In addition, the W.

On 8 January 2007, an evacuation order was issued for areas in the Lower Belham Valley, affecting an additional 100 people. At 11:27 pm local time on Monday 28 July 2008, an eruption began without any precursory activity. Pyroclastic flow lobes reached Plymouth. These involved juvenile material originating in the collapse of the eruption column. Further, a small part of the eastern side of the lava dome collapsed, generating a pyroclastic flow in Tar River Valley. Several large explosions were registered, with the largest at approximately 11:38 pm. The height of the ash column was estimated at 12,000 m (40,000 ft) above sea level. The volcano has become one of the most closely monitored volcanoes in the world since its eruption began, with the Montserrat Volcano Observatory taking detailed measurements and reporting on its activity to the government and population of Montserrat. The observatory is operated by the British Geological Survey under contract to the government of Montserrat. The 9 October 2008 issue of the journal Science suggests that two interconnected magma chambers lie beneath the surface of the volcano on Montserrat ‚Äì one six kilometres below the surface and the other at 12 kilometres below the surface. They also show a link between surface behaviour and the size of the deeper magma chamber.\\"Multiple Magma Reservoirs Affect Volcanic Eruption Cycles\\", Newswise, 6 October 2008. Retrieved 9 October 2008. On 5 February 2010, a vulcanian explosion simultaneously propelled pyroclastic flows down several sides of the mountain, and on 11 February 2010, a partial collapse of the lava dome sent large ash clouds over sections of several nearby islands including Guadeloupe and Antigua. Inhabited areas of Montserrat itself received very little ash accumulation through either event.

It is unclear whether bells were running by wire & pullies, or by electrical connection. Ornate doorbell in Venice A doorbell is a signaling device typically placed near a door to a building's entrance. When a visitor presses a button the bell rings inside the building, alerting the occupant to the presence of the visitor. Although the first doorbells were mechanical, activated by pulling a cord, modern doorbells are electric, operated by a pushbutton switch. Modern doorbells often incorporate intercoms and miniature video cameras to increase security. History William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, installed a number of his own innovations in his house, built in Birmingham in 1817; one of these was a loud doorbell, that worked using a piped system of compressed air. A precursor to the electric doorbell, specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, was invented by Joseph Henry around 1831. By the early 1900s, electric doorbells had become commonplace. Wired doorbells In most wired systems, a button on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, activates a signaling device (usually a chime, bell, or buzzer) inside the building. Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) pushbutton switch momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One terminal of this button is wired to a terminal on a transformer. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt AC electrical power to a lower voltage, typically 10 to 20 volts. The transformer's other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 W) of standby power constantly; systems with lighted pushbutton switches may consume a similar amount of power per switch.\\"Why Did President Bush Suddenly Start Talking about Standby Power?\\", a PowerPoint slide presentation by Alan Meier. http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/downloads/power_supplies/PSPresent2.ppt energystar.govMiscellaneous Electricity Use In U.S. Homes Marla C. Sanchez, Jonathan G. Koomey, Mithra M. Moezzi, Alan Meier and Wolfgang Huber, LBNL Berkeley California, http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/795945-9c8LM1/native/795945.pdf osti.gov The tradeoff is that the wiring to the button carries only safe, low voltage isolated from earth ground. A common signaling device is a chime unit consisting of two flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The flat bars are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound (\\"ding- dong\\"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes only one of the bars, to create a single-tone (\\"ding\\") sound. More elaborate doorbell chimes play a short musical tune, such as Westminster Quarters. Doorbells for hearing-impaired people use visual signaling devices ‚Äî typically light bulbs ‚Äî rather than audible signaling devices. Fully battery-powered wired models are also common, either using a two-bar design or an electric bell. These do not consume standby power, but require the user to change the batteries, which are usually large primary cells located in the bell box. Wireless doorbells Wireless doorbell with piezoelectric button In recent decades wireless doorbells have become popular, to avoid the expense of running wires through the building walls. The doorbell button contains a built-in radio transmitter powered by a battery. When the button is pushed, the transmitter sends a radio signal to the receiver unit, which is plugged into a wall outlet inside the building. When the radio signal is detected by the receiver, it activates a sound chip that plays the sound of gongs through a loudspeaker--either a two-note \\"ding-dong\\" sound or a longer chime sequence such as Westminster Quarters. Frequencies in the 2.4 GHz ISM band are usually used. To avoid interference by nearby wireless doorbells on the same radio frequency, the units can usually be set by the owner to different radio channels. In larger metropolitan cities, a trend has developed over the past decade that uses telephone technology to wirelessly signal doorbells as well as to answer the doors and remotely release electric strikes. In many cities throughout the world, this is the predominant form of doorbell signalling. Musical and continuous power doorbells As with wireless doorbells, musical doorbells have also become more common. Musical and continuous power doorbells serve as an attempt to bridge the gap between newer digital circuitry and older doorbell wiring schemes. A major difference between the standard setup of a wired doorbell and a musical doorbell is that the musical doorbell must maintain power after the doorbell button is released to continue playing the doorbell song. This can be achieved in one of two ways. For simple single-pole, single-throw doorbell buttons, the chime device employs a rectifier diode and ballast capacitor at the voltage input stage of the circuit. Upon pressing the doorbell button, power is connected through the rectifier diode or series of rectifier diodes called a full wave rectifier, which allows the current to flow in only one direction, into the ballast capacitor. The ballast capacitor charges at a rate far greater than the rest of the circuit needs to complete a given song. Once the button is released, the capacitor retains the charge and maintains power for a short duration to the rest of the circuit. For mixed wireless and wired input doorbells, a special doorbell button is needed to maintain power continuously to the doorbell chime. The circuit is similar to the one above, except that the rectifier diode is now moved into the doorbell button housing. Pressing the doorbell button allows both negative and positive sides of the AC power signal to flow into the circuit, while releasing the button only allows either the positive or negative side to flow into the circuit. By differentiating the full and half wave signals, the doorbell is able to function as it does in the previous wired case, while also providing continuous power to the doorbell for other purposes, such as receiving wireless doorbell button input. Mechanical bell systems Staff Call Bells Before electrical doorbells, large houses and estates often had complicated mechanical systems to allow occupants of any room to pull a bell pull and ring a bell at a central bell panel in the staff quarters, to summon a servant. Smart doorbells With the adoption of the \\"Internet of Things\\" a number of internet connected bell systems, known as smart doorbells have appeared on the market. Popular systems are the \\"Skybell\\", Ring doorbell, Nest Labs doorbell, the Google \\"Hello\\", and many others. These consist of a single unit which is located in place of the traditional push-button and in addition to the physical button, contain an HD camera, PIR sensor and WiFi electronics. The device is connected to the home wi-fi network, and notifications of a button-press or detected movement are pushed to a paired smartphone or other electronic device such as a tablet. When a notification is received, the user will typically see a live video stream from the device, clearly showing who is the door and they can engage in a 2-way audio conversation. The devices can be powered by an internal battery, or they may use the existing bell wiring for continuous power. The video is typically recorded direct to a cloud internet service, meaning that if the unit is tampered with, damaged or stolen then this event will be captured and can be analysed to determine the identity of the responsible party.

Hardware appliances  Hardware appliances can limit the rate of requests on layer 4 or 5 of the OSI model. Rate limiting can be induced by the network protocol stack of the sender due to a received ECN-marked packet and also by the network scheduler of any router along the way. While a hardware appliance can limit the rate for a given range of IP-addresses on layer 4, it risks blocking a network with many users which are masked by NAT with a single IP address of an ISP. Deep packet inspection can be used to filter on the session layer but will effectively disarm encryption protocols like TLS and SSL between the appliance and the web server.  Web servers  Web servers typically use a central in-memory key-value database, like Redis or Aerospike, for session management. A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache. In case a client made too many requests within a given time frame, HTTP servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests. However, the session management and rate limiting algorithm usually must be built into the application running on the web server, rather than the web server itself.  Datacenters  Datacenters widely use rate limiting to control the share of resources given to different tenants and applications according to their service level agreement.M. Noormohammadpour, C. S. Raghavendra, \\"Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Trade- offs,\\" IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. PP, no. 99, pp. 1-1. A variety of rate limiting techniques are applied in datacenters using software and hardware. Virtualized datacenters may also apply rate limiting at the hypervisor layer. Two important performance metrics of rate limiters in datacenters are resource footprint (memory and CPU usage) which determines scalability, and precision. There usually exists a trade-off, that is, higher precision can be achieved by dedicating more resources to the rate limiters. A considerable body of research exists with focus on improving performance of rate limiting in datacenters.

Early life Buel was born in Castleton, Vermont and exhibited precocious intellectual abilities. He attended the public schools in Poultney, Vermont, until the age of eight, at which time he began an accelerated course of studies preparing for college under the private tutelage of Henry Howe, the former principal of the Canandaiga Academy in Canandaigua, New York. In 1824, at the age of 10, he passed the admission exams for Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont and was admitted to the college. However, concerned about the difference in age between Buel and the other college students, his teacher and family persuaded him to continue his independent studies for three years. In 1827, at the age of 13, Buel accompanied one of his teachers and was enrolled as a sophomore at the University of Vermont in Burlington, where he stayed for one year. In 1828, he decided to attend Middlebury College, which was his original intent. He was enrolled there as a junior and also taught at the common schools in Clarendon. Career In August 1830, at the age of 16, Buel graduated from Middlebury College ranked first in his class. In September 1830, he became superintendent of a classical academy in West Rutland. In November 1831, he was invited to become principal of a classical academy at Fort Covington in northern New York, where he also began to study law. In December, 1832, he returned to his father's residence in Castleton and continued his study of law while also teaching at the Castleton Academy. In October 1834, Buell moved to Detroit, Michigan and within two months became Deputy Register of the Court of Probate. Because of his language skills, he was able to converse with the many French speakers native to Detroit at the time, as well as the increasing number of German immigrants. He admitted to the bar in the spring of 1835 and commenced practice in Detroit. Buel was city attorney in 1837 and a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1838 and again in 1848, serving as speaker the latter year. He was the prosecuting attorney for Wayne County 1843‚Äì1846. Buel first ran for the United States House of Representatives in Michigan's 1st congressional district in 1846, but lost in a close election. In 1848, Buel was elected as a Democrat from Michigan's 1st District to the United States Congress for the Thirty-first Congress, succeeding fellow Democrat Robert McClelland who did not run. Buel served from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1851. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1850 to the Thirty-second Congress and resumed the practice of law. He was again a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1859 and 1860. He was appointed postmaster of Detroit on September 28, 1860, and served until March 18, 1861. Death Buel died in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, on April 19, 1868 (age 54 years, 128 days). He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan. Family life Buel was the son of Ezekial and Sally Thompson Buel. He married Mary Ann Ackley of West Rutland, Vermont, in October 1836, and they raised four daughters, one of whom was Julia Maria Buel Trowbridge. On April 8, 1862, she married Gen. Luther Stephen Trowbridge (Buel's law partner). The others were: Mary B., wife of Charles H. Wetmore; Clara B., wife of Col. James Mercur; and Delia W., wife of Gen. Garrett J. Lydecker.

History Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School on Mission Lake, 1921 B-Say-Tah Point on Echo Lake in the Qu'Appelle Valley In 1787, the North West Company established a fur trading post at Fort Esp√©rance on the lower river. After it was abandoned in 1819, the Hudson's Bay Company established a post at Fort Qu'Appelle in 1852 immediately adjacent to the site of what became the town of the same name. The Qu'Appelle River and Valley derive their name from a Cree legend of a spirit that travels up and down it. The aboriginal people told the North West Company trader Daniel Harmon in 1804 that they often heard the voice of a human calling, \\"\\", meaning \\"Who is calling?\\" (\\"\\" in French). They would respond, and the call would echo back (there is a strong echo phenomenon at Lebret). Pauline Johnson, the half-Mohawk poet, whose \\"work was well received by critics and was popular with the public during her lifetime, but faded into obscurity after her death,\\"Harriet Gorham, \\"Johnson, E. Pauline,\\" Encyclopedia of Canada. Retrieved 19 November 2007. and who made speaking tours of Canada, the United States, and England between 1892 and 1909, learned of the legend and elaborated upon it with Victorian sentiment.

The bigmouth buffalo, a fish species restricted only to the Qu'Appelle Valley River, is under federal protection as it is at risk of becoming extinct due to habitat loss. The Water Security Agency (n.d.) speculates that dams and structures that control water have caused the degradation of spawning habitats for bigmouth buffalo due to the alteration of the natural flow of lakes and river systems. The Water Security Agency (n.d.) states that the highest threat to the bigmouth buffalo population is demand of water used for agricultural, commercial, and domestic purposes.

The more compaction, the less the soil is capable of supporting plant growth. Because of the short warm season and long, cold winters, vegetation routinely dies and decomposers do not have adequate time to breakdown all the material. As a result, the groundcover of litter is built up. A large quantity of nutrients is stored in this litter as opposed to in the soil as it takes three to four years to be broken down in the grasslands. Because of the accumulation of plant litter on the top soil horizon, the soil is chernozemic and has a colour that varies from light brown to black.Kotowich, R., & Hardenbicker, U. (2015). Alluvial fans as archives for land-use changes in the Qu‚ÄôAppelle Valley. Prairie Perspectives, 17, 8-17. The soil is neutral to slightly alkaline, and it has a texture that is medium to moderately fine. Where the plants have been removed or replaced by invasive species, there is more erosion. As a result of the seasonal variability, there is significant erosion that occurs from the snowmelt each spring. The effects are intensified where there is little ground cover present. There is also more sediment deposited where agriculture has taken place because the disruption of the land has accelerated the erosion of the soil. 14,000 years ago the last ice age retreated, forming the Qu'Appelle Valley and leaving many glacial deposits and evidence in the soil. The municipality of Fort Qu'Appelle sits on alluvial deposits that consists of silt, sand, clay, gravel, and other organic material deposited by the glacier. In some parts of the valley, the deposits are thick. Water management within the Qu'Appelle = Watershed plans = Each watershed has its own water resources protection plan. The lower Qu'Appelle watershed plan is available here and the upper Qu'Appelle plan here. In the spring of 2009, planning staff from the Water Security Agency (WSA) invited stakeholders in the Lower Qu'Appelle River Watershed to participate in watershed planning. These stakeholders, representing various organizations within the watershed, formed two watershed advisory committees (WAC): the Eastern and Western Lower Qu'Appelle River WACs. The committees discuss aquifer protection, lake and river water management, and governance and legislative requirements. = Water supply and demand in the Qu'Appelle Valley = 93% of the land in the Qu'Appelle Rivershed is used for agricultural purposes. Five potash mines are in the basin and an increase in irrigation development is expected. Water demand is anticipated to increase by 126% from 2010 to 2060. On low flow years, Lake Diefenbaker supplies roughly 90% of the flow of the Qu'Appelle River. This water mainly originates from mountain snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains of Alberta. The South Saskatchewan River, which flows into Lake Diefenbaker, has seen flow rates drop by 12% in the last century.Fort Qu‚ÄôAppelle KAIROS (2014). We are all water-keepers ‚Äì A Call to Action to Restore the Qu‚ÄôAppelle Watershed. Retrieved from https://www.kairoscanada.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/water_keepers_view_online.pdf With only 2% increase from runoff, water scarcity could be a problem in the near future. On the other hand, severe flooding of the Qu'Appelle Valley could also occur. Studies suggest that due to climate change, 31% to 46% of glacier volume of the eastern Rockies could melt by 2100. = Water demand under the baseline scenario = In 2010, demand for water in the Qu'Appelle River Basin was estimated at with direct anthropogenic demands accounting for 22.6% of the total demand. By 2060, estimates suggest that irrigation and expansion of the potash sector will account for 44.1% of water demand. Furthermore, there will be an increase of 162% in total direct anthropogenic water demand by 2060. The water demand per sector, according to the scenario analysis, is depicted below. As can be seen, agriculture demands the majority of the water in the Qu'Appelle basin. a) Agriculture: 2020 estimated amount of water demand is . 2060 estimated amount of water demand is . b) Industry and mining: 2010 amount of water demand was . 2020 estimated amount of water demand is . 2060 estimated amount of water demand is . = Water demand estimates under climate change scenario = Water demand is affected by changes in climate and occurrence of extreme weather related events. In the Qu'Appelle River Basin, climate change will produce higher temperatures and longer growing seasons which will have significant impacts on demand for water in the agricultural sector since crops and livestock will require more water. Industry and mining are not expected to increase their water demand under the referenced climate change scenario. Municipal and domestic sectors are expected to increase their demand minimally. = Water demand estimates under water conservation scenario = Under the water conservation scenario, a 14% reduction in demand could be achieved by reductions in agriculture, industrial, and mining water demands. = Impacts on water quality = The water quality of freshwater sources in Southern Saskatchewan is poor.Saskatchewan Water Security Agency (2013).

This project could also contribute to the loss or alteration of heritage resources used by First Nations and Metis peoples. Increased volume of traffic from vehicles is a concern as well as the ongoing maintenance of the river channels, pipelines, and pumping stations for years to come. = History of dams in the Qu'Appelle Valley = In the 1930s, water in the Qu'Appelle basin became critical due to persistent drought in the prairie and the global economic depression. These incidents prompted the Federal Government to establish the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA). The PFRA was tasked with restoring drought and soil drift zones in the three prairie provinces and assisting in the protection of surface water supplies for household use, livestock and irrigation.Prentice, P.E. James. (1998). QU‚ÄôAPPELLE VALLEY INDIAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY INQUIRY FLOODING CLAIM http://sclaimswp.bryan-schwartz.com/wp- content/uploads/images/stories/specific_claims_docs/03-ICC_CRI_Docs/ICCP- ACRI/Volume_09/QuAppelleValleyIndianDevelopment.pdf Water in the river system was necessary to support human life as well as fisheries, livestock, and irrigation. In May 1941, the PFRA requested the construction of a dam at the eastern end of Pasqua Lake‚Äîwhich would cause persistent floods in the Maskopetung and Pasqua reserves‚Äîand would require approval from the Ministry of Indian Affairs. This dam, known as the Echo Lake Project, was completed in 1942. At first, Indian Affairs believed that the dam project would cause damage to the environment and estimated that a total of $8,050 should be paid to the Muscowpetung and Pasqua Bands. Although both the PFRA and Indian Affairs agreed on the amount, it was never paid to the Bands. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Muscowpetung and Pasqua Bands actually approved the dam project. Neither band received compensation until 1973 when negotiations began between the Bands and the PFRA. On November 16, 1976, the Bands accepted a one-time payment of $265,000 from the PFRA. Also in 1941, the Crooked Lake and Round Lake Projects were launched. The PFRA began construction without the consent of the Bands in the dam area, but in 1943 paid $3,300 to the Sakimay, Cowessess and Ochapowace Bands.  Historical land uses  = Historical Indigenous use of natural resources = The Qu'Appelle Valley corridor has a rich history of trade and natural resource use that dates back prior to written records. Utilizing the local plants and animals, many Indigenous people of the corridor participated in trade and other economic activities. Women picked berries and Seneca root to sell to settlers in addition to use at home, while men cut and sold firewood.Guilbault, R. and Pasqua First Nation and Dillon Consulting Limited (2015). The history of Paskwa‚Äôs people. Pasqua, SK: Pasqua First Nation. Some living Indigenous elders from the Pasqua First Nation recall the days when they would pack up and head to what is now Regina's exhibition grounds to sell roots, berries, herbs and crafts. Regulations such as the Indian Act and prevented Indigenous people from participating in the settler economy and subsequently few Indigenous people of the Qu'Appelle Valley corridor were able to financially prosper from such activity. Without permission from the Indian agent, the Qu'Appelle Valley Indigenous people could not leave their reserve to sell their wares nor could they sell or butcher their own cattle. Some Indigenous communities in the Qu'Appelle Valley corridor had a complete outfit for grain farming and owned tractors and combines. They became so efficient at farming that they were \\"shut down\\" for fear of outcompeting non-native farming operations. The Indigenous people of the Qu'Appelle Valley hunted numerous animal species. Deer, the most common big game which was targeted in the years after Treaty 4 and depletion of wild bison herds, provided food and leather. Other animal species that were hunted in the area included elk, moose, antelope and occasionally black bear. Small game and waterfowl were also targeted due to their abundance near the Qu'Appelle Valley lakes. Ducks (canvasbacks, blue bills, mallards and teals), geese, prairie chickens, partridges and pheasants were among the bird species that were hunted for food. Trapping for furs was also a profitable economic activity to the Indigenous people of the Qu'Appelle Valley corridor in the early part of the 20th century. Locals would trap rabbit, beaver, mink, muskrat, coyote, gopher, weasel and skunk and when possible and legal, sell the furs to settlers. Fishing for food and trade was practiced quite extensively. Targeted species within the Qu'Appelle Valley included walleye, perch, whitefish, northern pike and more. Before the days of treaties and reserve life First Nations people, including those in the Qu'Appelle Valley, constructed weirs at the narrow sections of rivers and streams in order to catch fish. Fish were either cooked soon after catch or split and smoked over fire in order to preserve for eating later.Royal Saskatchewan Museum. (2019). Seasonal Round. Retrieved from https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/rsm/visit/exhibits/first-nations-gallery/seasonal- round According to testimony from Elders of the Pasqua First Nation, berries are not as numerous as they once were. The berries that were picked in the Qu'Appelle Valley included chokecherries, saskatoon berries, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and others.  Contemporary land uses  The valley has a number of contemporary uses including hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, and scientific study. Indigenous peoples have a connection to Indigenous knowledge and traditions that is evident in their contemporary use of the land. = Hunting = Big game and birds are the main focus for hunting in the valley.

Retrieved from http://publications.gov.sk.ca/documents/66/93283-Hunters%20and%20Trappers%20Guide.pdf These animals are hunted mostly in the fall season because the young are grown and the game tend to be fatter. The birds that are hunted include migratory game birds (geese, ducks, cranes, coots, and snipes), and upland game birds (grouse, partridge, and pheasants). Although hunting is open to everyone, the regulations of hunting for non-Indigenous peoples requires that hunters have a tag for the big game animal they are harvesting. These tags, besides resident whitetail deer, are all handed out through a draw system. Licenses are also required for the hunting of birds. Status First Nation hunters can exercise their right to hunt for the purpose of food without having to obtain a license. Indigenous hunters often demonstrate respect for the animals by leaving tobacco when an animal is taken. This is a way to honor the animal for the life it has given in order to provide food. It is also common for Indigenous hunters to share the meat with elders and people who are not able to hunt themselves. = Fishing = Those fishing in the valley catch northern pike, walleye, whitefish, tullibee, burbot, yellow perch, carp, bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, and channel catfish.South Saskatchewan River Watershed Stewards.

The flatness of the land, with easy access to water, natural gas and electrical power is beneficial for industry. It is also located in close proximity to two of the fastest-growing urban centres in Saskatchewan‚ÄîRegina and Moose Jaw, which provides easy access to airports for business. Lastly, the area is ideal because of the presence of vast high-quality reserves of potash. = Industries located in the corridor = The Regina-Moose Jaw Industrial Corridor mostly relies on agriculture and agri-value processing, fertilizer production and mining, and energy. This area has experienced massive industrial construction over the last few years. Some of the industrial projects located in the corridor include mining, pipelines, railway, and agriculture as well as fertilizer, ethanol, and salt plants. ‚Ä¢ Fertilizer: Yara Fertilizer is one of the largest producers of granular urea in North America.

Because the operation of the mine requires that wetlands be filled, the entire watershed will be affected. Wetland filling affects hydrological functions and will lead to deposition, erosion, subsidence and other phenomena. Because of the disappearance of wetlands and the disturbance of native prairie, soil may degrade, invasive species may spread, and soil erosion may occur. Field investigations show that some wildlife may die from contact with saline water, from collisions with vehicles, or due to the loss of habitat. = Pipelines in the Qu'Appelle Valley = There are two major pipelines that run through the Qu'Appelle Valley Corridor. The first is the TransCanada Mainline system that runs from the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, straight through to Manitoba, Ontario and part of Quebec.

By choosing this route, environmental impacts are arguably limited because they are developing in an area that is not considered sensitive. Both the South and North valley walls were cut into, including cuts over deep on the South wall, and up to deep on the North wall. Not only was vegetation and earth disturbed in this process, but a number of aquifers were cut through in the South valley wall. Cuts through aquifers within the valley posed issues of drainage and erosion, and the creation of steeper embankments caused by excavation and rail grade construction created slope instability in the valley. The natural state of the valley has been altered significantly, and with this came the need for infrastructure implementation in order to accommodate drainage and crossings during the construction phase and into the future. This included concrete box culverts that were installed on the bottom of the river valley in order to allow excess floodwaters to continue to flow uninhibited. A report was made in February 2015 that acknowledged 23 landowners that relied on the aquifers‚Äî5 of whom were listed as potentially affected by the cuts on the South slope of the Valley. In order to ensure that existing cultural sites which have not been already disturbed by agriculture and other industry were not affected, a Heritage Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) was conducted. Upon assessment, experts determined that this site had low potential for the discovery of cultural sites due to the agricultural disruption that occurred prior. Two historically significant sites were found within the footprint of the spur, and under direction from the Saskatchewan Heritage Conservation Branch there has been additional archeological work performed which resulted in controlled excavation and recovery of historical material. = Agriculture = Agriculture has contributed to the increase of metal contamination in the Qu'Appelle watershed due to \\"agricultural tilling, irrigation, and use of chemicals.\\"DOWNSTREAM FROM REGINA: Protecting and Restoring the Qu‚ÄôAppelle Watershed.

It was composed soon after his \\"La belle dame sans merci\\" and his odes on Melancholy, on Indolence, on a Grecian Urn and to a Nightingale and just before \\"Ode to Autumn\\". The poem tells how the god Hermes hears of a nymph who is more beautiful than all. Hermes, searching for the nymph, instead comes across Lamia, trapped in the form of a serpent. She reveals the previously invisible nymph to him and in return he restores her human form. She goes to seek a youth of Corinth, Lycius, while Hermes and his nymph depart together into the woods. The relationship between Lycius and Lamia, however, is destroyed when the sage Apollonius reveals Lamia's true identity at their wedding feast, whereupon she seemingly disappears and Lycius dies of grief. According to Michael O'Neill, Lamia in the poem \\"is treated ambivalently but with considerable sympathy\\", making \\"a sharp contrast with the more leisurely and seemingly uncritical use of romance in [the] two narrative poems that follow....the hapless Lycius is caught between the reductive rationalism of Apollonius and the bewitching illusoriness of Lamia.\\"Murray, Christopher John (ed.) Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850, Volume 2 (2004), p 639-41 Influence Keats's poem had a deep influence on Edgar Allan Poe's sonnet \\"To Science\\", specifically this passage's discussion of the baleful effects of \\"cold philosophy\\": Poe's closing lines also echo several lines near the middle of \\"Lamia\\".Campbell, Killis. \\"The Origins of Poe\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 154‚Äì155. The book Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins takes its title from the above-quoted passage: it is an explicit attempt to demonstrate that this view of \\"cold philosophy\\" is incorrect and that science reveals, rather than destroys, the true beauty of the natural world.

Its main theme satirizes 1990s radio formats and public hysteria over the Y2K programming bug. Give Me Immortality... is the first of the Firesign Theatre's Millenium CD trilogy We're Doomed, which includes Boom Dot Bust and Bride of Firesign. Synopsis The album takes the form of a fictional radio broadcast on the night of December 31, 1999. Radio Now is a FunFunTown (apparently modeled after Los Angeles, California) radio station whose format changes approximately every hour at the slightest whims of overzealous market researchers and focus groups. The album chronicles Radio Now's attempt to operate normally on the final day before the year 2000, a day riddled with apocalyptic omens, rampant computer errors, and dangerous doomsayers. The station is populated by DJ Bebop Lobo (Phil Austin), his producer Dwayne (Peter Bergman), news anchors Harold Hiphugger (David Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Philip Proctor), sports commentator Chump Threads (Bergman), and self-help guru O'Nann Winquedinque (Austin). Also reporting from outside the station are celebrity stalker Danny Vanilla (Ossman) and helicopter-bound traffic reporter Col. Happy Panditt (Proctor). Themes The album, made in 1998, lampoons the various world- threatening results which were being predicted from the Y2K bug. It also satirizes the media exploitation of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Joe Camel controversy, and the Art Bell radio show.

It is part of the Florida College System and one of several institutions in that system designated a \\"state college\\" as it offers a greater number of four-year bachelor's degrees than traditional community colleges. The college was established in 1966 as Florida Junior College. It has four major physical campuses and several additional centers located around the First Coast region and currently enrolls 52,000 students. History The institution was founded in 1966 as Florida Junior College. With the growth of the community college movement, it was renamed Florida Community College at Jacksonville (FCCJ) in 1986. In 2009, in recognition of a shortage of four- year colleges in the state, the Florida Legislature passed legislation creating the Florida College System, enabling some community colleges to become \\"state colleges\\", meaning they can offer more bachelor's degrees than traditional community colleges, but no graduate degree programs. FCCJ was one of the first community colleges to make the change, and, also in 2009, announced the change to their current name, \\"Florida State College at Jacksonville\\".

Hoverbeck's parents were Nikolaus von Hoverbeck, a derivative of a Flemish noble family, who emigrated in 1570 from Brabant to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and Ursula Gutteter-Dobrodziejski, a derivative from a patrician family in Krak√≥w. Johann von Hoverbeck, born in Aleksandrowice, a manor in the vicinity of Krak√≥w, since 1614 attended the high school in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). Since 1624 he undertook an extended educational journey through Europe and visited France (Paris, University of Sedan), the Netherlands, England (University of Oxford, London), Italy and Hungary. He returned home in June, 1630. In 1631 he took up duties in governmental services of Brandenburg and dealt with foreign affairs, especially concerning Poland. He was an envoy of Brandenburg-Prussia in Poland from 1631 to 1682. He was a political architect and co-signer of the Treaty of Wehlau in 1657 and participated also in the Treaty of Oliva in 1660. During his political career he acted as an advisor to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. As a gratification for his diplomatical achievements Frederick William presented to him in 1653 the manor of Eichmedien (Nakomiady) in Masuria, Duchy of Prussia. In 1663 the title of a baron war awarded to Johann von Hoverbeck. In 1644 Hoverbeck married Anna Sophia, a daughter of Wolf Dietrich von Rochow. Anna Sophia, with whom he had eleven children, died in 1659. His son Johann Dietrich von Hoverbeck became a diplomat too.

This is still the situation in a few regions, particularly in the northern part of the peninsula, but due to the differing sociopolitical histories of these languages (independence of Portugal since the early 12th century, unification of Spain in the late 15th century under the Catholic Monarchs, who privileged Castilian Spanish over the other Iberian languages), Spanish and Portuguese have tended to overtake and to a large extent absorb their sister languages while they kept diverging from each other. There is controversy over whether the members of the modern Galician- Portuguese and Astur-Leonese sub-groups are languages or dialects. A common, though disputed, classification is to state that Portuguese and Galician are separate languages, as are Asturian, Leonese, and Mirandese.

He served in both houses of the New Hampshire Legislature and as chairman of the state's Forestry Commission before being elected governor of New Hampshire in 1910. He started one of the state's political dynasties. Both his son, Perkins Bass, and grandson, Charles F. Bass, were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His wife, Edith Harland Bird, was the daughter of Massachusetts businessman Charles Sumner Bird. His daughter, Joanne, was the first wife of Marshall Field IV, heir to the Marshall Field's fortune and publishing mogul. Early life The son of Perkins Bass and Clara (Foster) Bass, he was born in Chicago, Illinois, but his family moved to Peterborough when he was nine. He grew up on a family farm that is still owned by his descendants. He graduated from Harvard College in 1896. Career He was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1905 and 1909 and the New Hampshire Senate in 1910. He was the state's governor from 1911 to 1913. His status was hurt, however, after 1912. That year, he had supported Theodore Roosevelt for president, in the breakaway Progressive Party, against the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft. The move threw the state Republicans into disarray and led to a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature. In retaliation, the party rejected Bass when he sought a US Senate seat in 1913 and 1926. Bass is remembered today for his stint as chairman of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission when popular concern with forests' well-being was intense because of extreme overlogging in the White Mountains. Also notable is his sponsorship of legislation that led to the first direct primary law east of the Mississippi River. In 1945, Bass, along with retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen J.

The only survivor of the tragedy, Elminster joins a troupe of bandits and later a gang of thieves in the nearby city of Hastarl. Fed up with the rule and power of arrogant mages, Elminster sneaks into a temple of Mystra with the intent of defacing it, leading to a face-to-face confrontation with the goddess. Instead of unleashing her wrath upon the upstart youth, she questions him, and based upon his wise and honest answers and his exceptional potential, Mystra instructs Elminster in the ways of magic and he becomes a powerful cleric and mage, one of her Chosen, a title rarely given and accompanied by a host of powers and duties. =Elminster in Myth Drannor= After winning the freedom of Athlanthar from the power-mad magelords, becoming crowned king, and subsequently abdicating his throne, Elminster follows the edict of Mystra to enter the forest of Cormanthor. Stumbling upon a patrol of elves beset by monsters, he rescues the sole surviving elf and comforts him in his dying moments. Given a sacred duty to return the family's mind stone (kiira) to its rightful place, he sneaks into the City of Cormanthor, under threat of death (as elves will kill any non-elves on sight in Cormanthor) to return the kiira and complete his vow. Though not accepted by most of the noble caste, Elminster convinces the ruling Coronal and the powerful guardian of the forest the Shrinshee to trust and teach him. Surviving many tests of strength and will, as well as attempts at assassination, he learns much powerful elven magic, and plays a large part in the eventually seeding of Cormanthor's Mythal. =The Temptation of Elminster= Tempted by Mystra and Shar, Elminster must choose to follow his heart or his goddess. =Elminster in Hell= Thrown through a portal into the Hell-plane of Avernos, Elminster is captured by the outcast archdevil Nergal and struggles to survive his memories being replayed and torn from his mind. =Elminster's Daughter= This novel views the long-term effect of Elminster's meddling on the nation of Cormyr, which Elminster played no small part in creating and protecting, through the lens of his daughter, Narnra, a thief from Waterdeep. =Elminster Must Die= When the goddess of magic was murdered, Elminster's world shattered. Once the most powerful wizard in the world, immortal, beloved of the goddess of magic, and the bane of villainy, he is now a tired old man. He is powerful but mortal, and with all the enemies a man who makes a habit of saving the world tends to accumulate. To make matters worse, Elminster has needs‚Äîfeeding powerful magic items to the Simbul, his lover, is the only thing that keeps her sane‚Äîbut their increasingly risky collection leads his enemies right to him.

One of three hurricanes to hit North Carolina during the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed on August 7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to strengthen rapidly after turning to the north- northeast. On August 12, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm or category 1 hurricane on August 17, just five days after Hurricane Connie struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the United States Weather Bureau noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming extratropical two days later and completely dissipating by August 23\\\\. The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, a process known as orographic lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York. Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired. Meteorological history Hurricane Diane originated in a tropical wave first observed as a tropical depression on August 7 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The system moved generally to the west-northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 9. By the time the Weather Bureau first classified the storm on August 10, Diane was south of the Bermuda high, a semi-permanent ridge in the jet stream just east of Nova Scotia. Ships in the region of the storm reported winds of . During the next day, the Hurricane Hunters reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized. The storm interacted with Hurricane Connie to its northwest in a process known as the Fujiwhara effect, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a cold-core low that increased atmospheric instability. On August 12, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in barometric pressure, despite moving away from the hurricane. At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined eye about in diameter, described by reconnaissance aircraft as taking the shape of an \\"inverted teacup\\". The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located northeast of the eye. After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on August 13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of , and peak winds of 105 mph (170 km/h); originally the hurricane was analyzed to reach peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), although the large size and slow forward speed suggested the lower winds. It maintained its peak winds for about 12 hours, after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By August 15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955. On August 17, Diane made landfall on the coast of North Carolina near Wilmington. Pressure at landfall was estimated at , accompanied by winds just under hurricane intensity. Diane struck the state only five days after Hurricane Connie struck the same general area. Diane quickly weakened as a tropical storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center to the north and northeast. The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact much with the non-tropical westerlies, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the Mid-Atlantic states, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of New England, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 21\\\\. Passing south and east of Newfoundland, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland. Preparations and background Rainfall totals from Hurricane Diane Late on August 14, more than two days before Diane made landfall, the United States Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert from Georgia through North Carolina. On August 15, the agency issued a hurricane warning from Brunswick, Georgia to Wilmington, North Carolina, although the warning was later extended to the south and north to Fernandina, Florida and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, respectively. The agency also issued storm warnings southward to Saint Augustine, Florida and northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey, including the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. Throughout the warned region, small ships were advised to remain at port. Before Diane made landfall, the North Carolina National Guard assisted in evacuating people near the Pamlico River, and 700 residents left their homes near New Bern; thousands of tourists also evacuated. The threat of the hurricane forced the planned retirement ceremony for Admiral Robert Carney to be transferred from an aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Virginia to an academy dormitory. All aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were flown to safer locations further inland. All hurricane warnings were dropped after Diane moved inland. Forecasters downplayed the threat of Diane after it weakened over Virginia; the Weather Bureau agreed they did not foresee the extent of the rain that would occur, instead calling for just \\"some local flooding\\". The agency later admitted they \\"goofed\\" in downplaying the storm's destructive potential after weakening, noting their lack of experience with extreme rainfall events. Once the storm moved ashore, the Weather Bureau transferred official forecasting duties to regional offices, and local newspapers also issued their own forecasts. The Springfield Daily News in Massachusetts noted that \\"moderate rains [were] possible\\" in its daily weather forecast ahead of the storm. Still, flood warnings were issued, with stream flooding forecasts of over 12 hours in advance. Along smaller rivers, including the Lehigh, Schuylkill, and Farmington, forecasts were issued every few hours. In the summer of 1955, the eastern United States experienced generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid- Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was in contrast to the federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River. Impact Hurricane Diane's path over the eastern United States brought heavy rainfall, fueled by unusually moist air resulting from abnormally high sea surface temperatures. The worst flooding was in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, and southern New England. Of the 287 stream gauges in the region, 129 reported record levels during the course of the event. Many streams reported discharge rates of more than double the previous records. Most of the flooding occurred along small rivers that rose to flood stage within hours, largely impacting populated areas; there were around 30 million people in the region affected by the floods. Overall, 813 houses were destroyed, with 14,000 heavily damaged. The storms damage caused over 35,000 families to re locate. The floods also severed infrastructure and affected several summer camps. Damage to public utilities was estimated at $79 million. Flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains, while destroyed crops cost an estimated $7 million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82 million in damage. Damage from Diane's winds were generally minor. The hurricane caused $831.7 million in damage, of which $600 million was in New England, making it the costliest hurricane in American history at the time. Taking into account indirect losses, such as loss of wages and business earnings, Diane was described as \\"the first billion dollar hurricane.\\" This contributed to 1955 being the costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record at the time. Overall, there were at least 184 deaths, potentially as many as 200. =Carolinas= The strongest sustained winds associated with Diane's landfall in North Carolina reached in Hatteras, with gusts to in Wilmington. Any hurricane-force gusts were likely very sporadic and isolated in nature. Tides ran above normal near Wilmington, and waves in height struck the coast. The resultant storm surge damaged beach houses, flooded coastal roads, and destroyed seawalls damaged by Hurricane Connie a few days prior. The center of the hurricane passed over Wilmington without much of a decrease in winds, suggesting the eye was disorganized or even nonexistent. Little precipitation fell in and around the city, though precipitation was more substantial elsewhere in the state, peaking at in New Bern. At Oakway in neighboring South Carolina, rainfall amounted to . =Mid- Atlantic= Extent of flooding in the northeastern United States, caused by Diane After Diane crossed into Virginia, it dropped heavy rainfall of over in 24 hours in the Blue Ridge Mountains, peaking at in Big Meadows. There, the rains were enhanced by moist air rising over the mountain peaks and condensing, a process known as orographic lift. Rainfall of over occurred throughout Virginia, as well as into the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, where was reported at Stony River Reservoir. Similar precipitation amounts fell through Delaware, including at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. Rivers across the region rose above flood stage, including the James River which crested at in Columbia, Virginia, which was above flood stage. High amounts of rainfall accrued in eastern Pennsylvania, peaking at in Pecks Pond in the northeast portion of the state. As with Virginia, the heaviest rainfall occurred due to orographic lift near a mountain. In neighboring New Jersey, the highest precipitation was near Sussex. Rainfall in New York peaked at in Lake Mohonk. In Virginia, severe flooding occurred near Richmond and along the Blue Ridge Mountains. Near the coast, Diane damaged large areas of farmlands due to slow-moving floods. In the state, 21 gauges reported their highest levels on record. High levels along the Potomac River flooded low-lying portions of Virginia and Washington, D.C. Wind gusts reached in Roanoke. In the state, flooding covered several roads, prompting closures. Due to the flat terrain, flooding in Delaware was described by the United States Geological Survey as \\"comparably mild\\". Flooding along the Brandywine Creek was at least the fifth highest in 45 years. Flooding was worst in the northernmost portion of the state. Flooding began in many streams in eastern Pennsylvania on August 18\\\\. The Delaware River crested at over in Easton, which was above the previous record set in 1903. In Allentown, the Lehigh River crested at , surpassing the previous record of set in 1942. The floods were the worst in record across eastern portions of the state, notably in the Poconos and along all tributaries of the Delaware River from Honesdale to Philadelphia. Lake Wallenpaupack and other reservoirs mitigated flooding. Floods destroyed 17 bridges and of track along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which is the primary rail line in northeastern Pennsylvania. Damage to the line totaled several million dollars, and overall railroad damage in the state totaled $16 million. Hundreds of cars were damaged in the region. Damage extended into Philadelphia due to flooding along the Schuylkill River, but the damage was minor. In the small village of Upper Black Eddy, hundreds of people became homeless, and the post office was washed away. Statewide, the floods destroyed or breached 30 dams, and destroyed about 150 road of rail bridges. Flooding left home and factory damage in the Allentown area. In the Poconos in Pennsylvania, the Brodhead Creek nearly destroyed a camp, killing 37 people, mostly children. Many people at the camp fled to a lodge that was ultimately destroyed. The Brodhead Creek also washed out a bridge along U.S. Route 209 between Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg, flooding both cities. There were about 75 deaths in the area, and another 10 deaths occurred in Greentown due to flooding along the Lackawaxen River. Overall, there were 101 deaths in the state, and damage totaled at least $70 million. In New Jersey, flooding largely occurred north of Trenton and west of Perth Amboy; rainfall in the southern two-thirds of the state was less than . The three major rivers in the area - the Delaware, Passaic, and Raritan - had severe flooding, and damage was widespread. When the Millstone River flooded, two teenagers drowned while canoeing, and a police officer drowned while attempting to rescue them. About 200 families were evacuated in Oakland along the Ramapo River. Damage in the state was heaviest along the Delaware from Port Jervis, New York to Trenton, where flooding inundated adjacent towns. Between the two towns, all but two bridges were damaged, including four that were destroyed. About 500 children had to be rescued from camps on three islands in the Delaware River; they were airlifted to a high school in Frenchtown. In that city, about 200 people were forced to evacuate their houses along the water. In Trenton, workers used sandbags to prevent flooding from affecting government buildings. Flooding destroyed the Portland‚ÄìColumbia Pedestrian Bridge, first constructed in 1831, after most of it was submerged. The center of the Northampton Street Bridge between Easton, Pennsylvania and Phillipsburg, New Jersey collapsed. A dam near Branchville collapsed, flooding the town and causing heavy damage. About 200 homes were damaged or destroyed in Lambertville. Statewide, 93 homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $27.5 million. Flash floods occurred in mountainous regions of southeastern New York, including Port Jervis along the Delaware River. Wappinger Creek flooded to cause heavy damage. Most streams in the Rondout Creek basin left damage due to fast-moving waters, including heavy damage near Ellenville. Damage in New York was largely limited to an area between Port Jervis and Poughkeepsie. Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2 million, and there was one death in the state. =New England= Flood damage in Winsted, Connecticut from Diane Diane produced heavy rainfall after recurving inland, setting rainfall records in several areas. Windsor Locks, Connecticut reported in a 23‚Äëhour period; the station's total, located near Hartford, was higher than the 24‚Äëhour rainfall record in Hartford. Some locations along the Housatonic River experienced per hour over 24 hours. The highest total in the state was at a station near Torrington. This is the highest rainfall on record in the state. The highest rainfall in the United States related to the storm was in Westfield, Massachusetts, which was also the wettest known storm in the state's history as well as throughout New England. Other statewide rainfall maxima in New England included in Greenville, Rhode Island, in Essex Junction, Vermont, in Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, and at Long Falls Dam in Maine. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, mostly in the region south of Worcester, Massachusetts. About 7,000 people were injured throughout New England, most of whom in Connecticut. Damage was greatest in Connecticut, where floods affected about two-thirds of the state. It was the largest flood on record in the state's history. All major streams and valleys were flooded during the storm, including hundreds of tributaries, and 30 gauges in the state reported the highest level on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached the third- highest level on record at the time, cresting at , or above flood stage. Although there was rural damage, the city of Hartford was spared from flooding due to previously constructed dykes. The Naugatuck River had significant flooding that damaged or destroyed every bridge across it and did extensive damage in Ansonia. In Waterbury, the river washed buildings and railroad girders into a bridge. In the city, 30 people were killed, including 26 in 13 houses that were washed away in one block. The Quinebaug River flooded the city of Putnam at the same time that a major fire originated at a magnesium plant. Much of the commercial district of Winsted was destroyed by the Mad River, which reached deep; the floods destroyed most buildings on the south side of the town's Main Street, and carried away several cars from a car dealership. The local newspaper reported that 95% of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in Winsted. High rivers destroyed historical sites and buildings, and statewide Diane destroyed 563 houses. There were 77 deaths in the state and $350 million in damage. Most of the damage in the state was industrial or commercial damage. In Rhode Island, flooding was worst in the northern portion of the state, mostly along the Blackstone River, which expanded to a width of about . The Horseshoe Dam was washed out, causing heavy damage in Woonsocket. There, about 6,000 of its 50,000 residents were left unemployed. Record high tides were also reported. In Rhode Island, damage was estimated at $21 million, mostly in Woonsocket, and there were three deaths. Much of southern Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester and to the ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24 stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% of the city of Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340 ft¬≥/s (236 m¬≥/s), which was 6.2 times greater than the previous peak and 28.5 times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97 houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110 million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12 deaths in the state. Aftermath Rainfall totals in New England from Diane In Diane's immediate aftermath, one of the first priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000 people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10 million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future. President Dwight Eisenhower declared eight states as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The Small Business Administration opened 18 temporary offices in the eastern United States for people to take out disaster loan applications. In the months after the storm, both the United States federal government and the American Red Cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims; collectively, the Red Cross, the Small Business Administration, and Farmers Home Administration raised $37 million, which was less than 8% of Diane's damage total. Throughout 1955, the Red Cross assisted about 10,000 families in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states; some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a flood zone. The Small Business Administration provided about 1,600 loans, totaling $25 million, for small businesses. Senator Herbert H. Lehman proposed a $12 billion federal flood insurance program. In 1956, the United States Congress passed the Federal Flood Insurance Act, but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding. A nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. After the floods from Diane, the American federal government provided funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to construct dams and reservoirs throughout New England to mitigate future flooding. In about 14 years, the Corps built 29 dams in Connecticut alone at the cost of $70 million, including three along the Connecticut River. The federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the Delaware River, one of which along Tocks Island. A controversy arose there due to the long reservoir the dam would have created, causing 600 families to be displaced. The project was canceled in 1975, and the acquired lands became the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. In Pennsylvania, washed-out rail lines prevented operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, and the loss of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235 people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15 industrial plants, which left more than 15,000 people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton declared a state of emergency due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1 penny, totaled $71 million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster. After the Naugatuck River flood in Connecticut cut off communications and bridges, the state was effectively cut in two. The state's National Guard used helicopters to rescue people. Governor Abraham A. Ribicoff visited areas affected by the flooding, due to the damage, Connecticut was declared a federal disaster area on August 20. The declaration allocated $25 million in assistance to the state. Governor Ribicoff requested $34 million in funds to rebuild and produce future flood mitigation projects; the state's funding was paid by a combination of bonds and tax increases. Including subsequent storms, the 1955 floods cumulatively killed 91 people and left 1,100 families homeless. Flooding occurred in 67 towns, resulting in damage to 20,000 families. About 86,000 people were left unemployed after the floods. In Winsted, the buildings that were washed away along the south side of Main Street were never rebuilt. Massachusetts Governor Christian Herter also issued a state of emergency, due to the widespread flooding damage. As a result, the state's National Guard and the Army Corps assisted in cleanup, and most roads took three weeks to clear. Residents in areas affected by Diane's flooding were advised to boil water and not to use gas cooking equipment. Diane's historic rainfall resulted in the wettest month on record in Boston with a total of , a record that stands as of 2010; Boston's 24‚Äëhour total of remained the highest daily total as of 1996. Following Diane's floods, cities in Massachusetts enlarged culverts and improved draining systems, as well as constructing weirs; these systems helped mitigate against future flooding. The name Diane was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list. Due to the damage from hurricanes in 1954 and 1955, including Diane, public outcry over storm damage led to the creation of the National Hurricane Center in 1956. Using a monetary deflator in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane would be about $7.4 billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States. Accounting for inflation, changes in personal wealth, and population changes, it is estimated Diane would have caused $18 billion in damage in 2010, or the 15th highest for a United States hurricane.

It became a Roman provincial capital and Metropolitan archbishopric and remained a multiple Catholic titular see.  Location  Pelusium lay between the seaboard and the marshes of the Nile Delta, about two-and-a-half miles from the sea. The port was choked by sand as early as the first century BC, and the coastline has now advanced far beyond its ancient limits that the city, even in the third century AD, was at least four miles from the Mediterranean. The principal product of the neighbouring lands was flax, and the linum Pelusiacum (Pliny's Natural History xix. 1. s. 3) was both abundant and of a very fine quality. Pelusium was also known for being an early producer of beer, known as the Pelusian drink. (University of Michigan translation project) Pelusium stood as a border-fortress, a place of great strength, on the frontier, protecting Egypt as regards to Syria and the sea. Thus, from its position, it was directly exposed to attack by any invaders of Egypt; it was often besieged, and several important battles were fought around its walls.  Names and identity  Pelusium was the easternmost major city of Lower Egypt, situated upon the easternmost bank of the Nile, the Ostium Pelusiacum, to which it gave its name. Pliny the Elder gives its location in relation to the frontier of Arabia: \\"At Ras Straki, 65 miles from Pelusium, is the frontier of Arabia. Then begins Idumaea, and Palestine at the point where the Serbonian Lake comes into view. This lake... is now an inconsiderate fen.\\" The Roman name \\"Pelusium\\" was derived from the Greek name, and that from a translation of the Egyptian one. It was variously known as Sena and Per-Amun (Egyptian and Coptic: Paramoun) meaning House or Temple of the sun god Amun, Pelousion or Saien (), Sin () -Chaldaic and Hebrew-, Sey√¢n (Aramaic), and Tell el-Farama (modern Egyptian Arabic). According to William Smith, it was the Sin of the Hebrew Bible (Ezekiel xxx. 15). Smith surmised that the word in its Egyptian and Greek forms (Peremoun or Peromi; œÄŒÆŒªŒøœÇ) had the connotation of a 'city made of mud' (cf. omi, Coptic, \\"mud\\"). The anonymous author of the Aramaic Palestinian Targum has translated the word \\"Rameses\\" in the Pentateuch as meaning Pelusin (Pelusium). It is not certain whether or not the 10th-century rabbi and scholar, Saadia Gaon, agreed with that determination, although he possessed another tradition of later making, writing that Rameses mentioned in Numbers 33:3, and in Exodus 1:11 and 12:37, as also in Genesis 47:11, refers to the Egyptian town of  ªAin Shams.Saadia Gaon, Judeo-Arabic Translation of Pentateuch (Tafsir), s.v. Exodus 21:37 and Numbers 33:3 (\\"◊®◊¢◊û◊°◊°: \\"◊¢◊ô◊ü ◊©◊û◊°); Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Torah (ed. Yosef Qafih), 4th edition, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1984, p. 164 (Numbers 33:3) (Hebrew) . According to the 1st-century historian Josephus, Pelusium was situated on one of the mouths of the Nile.Josephus, The Jewish War (4.11.5). Modern-day historical geographers associate  ªAin Shams with the ancient city of Heliopolis.  History  The following are the most notable events in the history of Pelusium : * Sennacherib, king of Assyria, 720-715 BC, in the reign of Sethos the Aethiopian (25th dynasty) advanced from Kingdom of Judah upon Pelusium, but retired without fighting from before its walls (Isaiah, xxxi. 8; Herodotus ii. 141 ; Strabo xiii. p. 604). His retreat was ascribed to the favor of Hephaestos towards Sethos, his priest. In the night, while the Assyrians slept, a host of field-mice gnawed the bow-strings and shield-straps of the Assyrians, who fled, and many of them were slain in their flight by the Egyptians. Herodotus saw in the temple of Hephaestos at Memphis, a record of this victory of the Egyptians, viz. a statue of Sethos holding a mouse in his hand. The story probably rests on the fact that in the symbolism of Egypt the mouse implied destruction. (Compare Horapolis Hieroglyph. i. 50; Claudius Aelianus, De Natura Animalium vi. 41.) * The decisive battle which transferred the throne of the Pharaohs to Cambyses II, king of the Persians, was fought near Pelusium in 525 BC. The fields around were strewn with the bones of the combatants when Herodotus visited. He noted that the skulls of the Egyptians were distinguishable from those of the Persians by their superior hardness, a fact confirmed he said by the mummies. He ascribed this to the Egyptians' shaving their heads from infancy, and to the Persians covering them up with folds of cloth or linen. (Herodotus ii. 10, seq.); however, according to legend, Pelusium fell without a fight, by the simple expedient of having the invading army drive cats (sacred to the local goddess Bast) before them. As Cambyses advanced at once to Memphis, Pelusium probably surrendered itself immediately after the battle. (Polyaen. Stratag. vii. 9.) * In 373 BC, Pharnabazus, satrap of Phrygia, and Iphicrates, the commander of the Athenian armament, appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, Nectanebo I, king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighboring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. (Diodorus Siculus xv. 42; Cornelius Nepos, Iphicrates c. 5.) * Pelusium was attacked and taken by the Persians, 343 BC (344 BC ?). The city contained at the time a garrison of 5,000 Greek mercenaries under the command of Philophron. At first, owing to the rashness of the Thebans in the Persian service, the defenders had the advantage. But the Egyptian king Nectanebo II hastily venturing on a pitched battle, his troops were cut to pieces, and Pelusium surrendered to the Theban general Lacrates on honorable conditions. (Diodorus Siculus xvi. 43.) * In 333 BC, Pelusium opened its gates to Alexander the Great, who placed a garrison in it under the command of one of those officers entitled Companions of the King. (Arrian, Exp. Alex. iii. 1, seq.; Quintus Curtius iv. 33.) * In 173 BC, Antiochus Epiphanes utterly defeated the troops of Ptolemy Philometor under the walls of Pelusium, which he took and retained after he had retired from the rest of Egypt. (Polybius Legat. ¬ß 82; Hieronym. in Daniel. xi.) On the fall of the Syrian kingdom, however, if not earlier, Pelusium had been restored to the Ptolemies. * In 55 BC, again belonging to Egypt, Mark Antony, as cavalry general to the Roman proconsul Gabinius, defeated the Egyptian army, and made himself master of the city. Ptolemy Auletes, in whose behalf the Romans invaded Egypt at this time, wished to put the Pelusians to the sword; but his intention was thwarted by Mark Anthony. (Plut. Anton. c. 3; Valerius Max. ix. 1.) * In 48 BC, Pompey was murdered in Pelusium. * In 30 BC, more than half a year after his victory at Actium, Augustus appeared before Pelusium, and was admitted by its governor Seleucus within its walls. * In 501 AD, Pelusium suffered greatly from the Persian invasion of Egypt (Eutychius, Annal.). * In 541 AD, the Plague of Justinian was first reported and began to spread across the Byzantine Empire. * In 639, Pelusium offered a protracted, though, in the end, an ineffectual resistance to the arms of Amr ibn al-As. As on former occasions, the surrender of the key of the Delta was nearly equivalent to the subjugation of Egypt itself. * In 749, Pelusium was raided by the Bashmuric Copts. * In ca. 870, Pelusium is mentioned as a major port in the trade network of the Radhanite merchants. * In 1118, Baldwin I of Jerusalem razed the city to the ground, but died shortly afterwards of food poisoning after eating a plateful of the local fish. The khalifs who ruled Pelusium following the Crusades, however, generally neglected the harbors, and from that period Pelusium, which had long been on the decline, almost disappeared from history.  Archaeological research  The first excavations in Pelusium started in 1910 and were conducted by French Egyptologist Jean Cledat, who also drew the plan of the whole site. In the 1980s, work was carried out by Egyptian researchers directed by Mohammed Abd El-Maksoud as well as French linguist and historian Jean-Yves Carrez-Maratray. The Egyptian expedition uncovered Roman baths with mosaics, dated to the 3rd century. Due to the planned construction of the Peace Canal, which was to cross the site, salvage excavations were commenced in 1991. Each of the several institutions from all over the world which took part in the project was assigned its sector in the area of Pelusium and its vicinity, i.e., the so-called Greater Pelusium. The Egyptian team explored the amphitheater and the Byzantine basilica; the Swiss carried out a survey; the British worked in the southern part of the site, and the Canadian in the western. From 2003 to 2009, an expedition from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw conducted research in the so- called Great Theater from the 2nd/3rd century and residential buildings of a later date. The Polish-Egyptian team also carried out restoration and reconstruction works in the theater. In 2019, besides the main streets of Pelusium city, a 2,500-square-metre Graeco-Roman building made of red brick and limestone was revealed by the Egyptian archeological mission. Interior design of the building contained the remnants of three 60 cm-thick circular benches. According to archaeologist Mostafa Waziri, building was very likely used as a hold meetings for the citizens‚Ä≤representatives or headquarters for the Senate Council of Pelusium.  Roman military roads  Of the six military roads formed or adopted by the Romans in Egypt, the following are mentioned in the Itinerarium of Antoninus as connected with Pelusium: * From Memphis to Pelusium. This road joined the great road from Pselcis in Nubia at Babylon, nearly opposite Memphis, and coincided with it as far as Scenae Veteranorum. The two roads, viz. that from Pselcis to Scenae Veteranorum, which turned off to the east at Heliopolis, and that from Memphis to Pelusium, connected the latter city with the capital of Lower Egypt, Trajan's canal, and Arsinoe, near Suez, on the Sinus Heroopolites (Gulf of Suez). * From Acca to Alexandria, ran along the Mediterranean sea from Raphia to Pelusium.  Ecclesiastical history  Pelusium is named (as \\"Sin, the strength of Egypt\\") in the Biblical book of Ezekiel, chapter 30:15. Pelusium became the seat of a Christian bishop at an early stage. Its bishop Dorotheus took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325. In 335, Marcus was exiled because of his support for Athanasius of Alexandria. His replacement Pancratius, an exponent of Arianism, was at the Second Council of Sirmium in 351. Several of the succeeding known bishops of Pelusium were also considered heretical by the orthodox. As the capital of the Roman province of Augustamnica Prima, Pelusium was ecclesiastically the metropolitan see of the province.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 531-534Klaas A. Worp, A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750), in Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 100 (1994) 283-318 Pelusium is still the seat of a metropolitan bishopric of the modern-day Eastern Orthodox Church.

The game revolves around the battles of a pack (Circle) of vicious, cannibal fairies. Gameplay is conducted with 1:1 miniatures and a deck of cards. Story Long ago, fairies were peaceful, mischievous, happy-go-lucky creatures who spent most of their time dancing, playing, singing, and eating honey and fruit. That all changed when a foolish fairy by the name of Merryzot decided to try eating the meat of a dead mouse. The never-before-tasted substance proved addictive, and soon all fairies, being as amoral as they are adventurous, were carving up all manner of flesh to discover the best tasting. Eventually it was discovered that the best-tasting meat of all was the meat of the fairy, and their society was plunged into chaos as they devoured one another, with the old fairy nobility fleeing to the Moon and the Gnomic races (gnomes, leprechauns etc.) vanishing underground, acts that would come back to haunt the Woodland Fairies later. Eventually the very essence of Fairydom was altered, and fairies, who spring into being fully grown from pods produced by amber drops in spring, were born addicted and hungering for the flesh of their fellows. Races The fairies of Fairy Meat are divided into a variety of sub-breeds, some of which form different Circles than others. The breeds of fairies are: Woodland Fairies: these are the primary fairies the player uses, all that remains of a once enchanting culture. Divided into several sub-breeds named after various plants, Woodland Fairies are regarded as primitives by other fairy races. Their diet of fairy flesh apparently makes them incredibly strong (by fairy standards). Glitter Fairies: a sub-breed of Woodland Fairy, these are the descendants of lesser fairy nobility and those fairy sorcerers who survived the downfall of fairy civilisation. In the game, these are weaker than normal Woodland Fairies but make up for by being able to use the Nasty (battle/offensive) and Nice (healing/defensive) branches of fairy magic. Gnomes: After abandoning life alongside ancient humans and going underground to prepare for world domination, the gnomic races eventually fell to infighting, which resulted in the annihilation of all races bar two; the science-loving gnomes and the drunken, undead leprechauns. Gnomes have lost all of their former magical powers, but in return have developed incredible technological skill, including bionic body parts, chemical weapons and rocket launchers. The mad Leprechauns, having become zombies due to an addiction to alchemical shoe polish formula, are apparently easy prey for gnomes, as many gnome inventions are powered by leprechaun brew (blenderized leprechaun). Gnomes as a race seem to suffer from a Napoleon Complex, and are determined to one day conquer the surface. Though slower than fairies, their deadly weaponry and their cyborg slaves (the Clock-Fairies) make them a force to be reckoned with. Their racial enemies are the Gremlins, who live to destroy machinery. Gnomes, Gremlins and Clock-Fairies are detailed in \\"Clockwork Stomp!\\", the first supplement for Fairy Meat. Clock-Fairies: These twisted abominations are created by gnomes. A gnome must first assemble a fairy body of machinery, including rotor-like wings, which serve as a power source. Then he needs to catch a living fairy, cut its head off then graft it to the mechanical body. Though most Clock-Fairies work for gnomes, some do manage to go rogue, joining fairy circles to take revenge on their former masters. Moon Fairies: When a mysterious force threatened fairies at the onset of the Dark Ages, the nobility did what they do best - they ran away. In this case, they made it to the Moon before they finally stopped. There, the fairy culture survived and eventually evolved (or degenerated, depending on how you look at it) into a rock-and-roll obsessed civilisation. In recent years, the music-loving Moon Fairies returned to earth, only to find that in their absence the Woodland Fairies had become fierce cannibals, who refused to obey the descendants of the creeps who had left them to rot so long ago. Unable to match the strength that their former minions' cannibalistic diet gave them, the Moon Fairies developed a mystical lipstick called Pink, which allowed them to suck the life from another fairy and thus give them the opportunity to match their degenerate kinsfolk. Moon Fairies make no distinction between fighters and wizards, but their style of magic is different from earth Fae, being divided into Glamour and Glitz branches. Moon Fairies and their Beat Pixie minions are detailed in Sugar and Vice, the second Fairy Meat supplement. Beat Pixies: Obnoxious things, Beat Pixies are possessed by a natural rhythm, which afflicts them with a kind of hyper-activity. Once they start moving, they can't stop! In Moon Fairy society, Beat Pixies are drummers and front-line warriors, when they aren't dancing crazily in the Mosh Pits. Wicked Things: This title is used to refer to the various types of fairy 'converted' by black witches. Wicked Things consist of Bitter Fairies, who then progress to Gloom Fairies and then to Doom Fairies, the berserk Blood Fairies, devilish Cricken, the filthy and disease-loving Leperchauns (as in leperous Leprechauns), and Night Fairies, which are converted Glitter Fairies who now use all manner of cheesy incantations when they use their magic. Wicked Things are detailed in the sourcebook of the same name, the third supplement to Fairy Meat.

It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1972. Geology It is not a mountain range in the normal sense, because it was formed as a single mountain called Koolau Volcano (koolau means \\"windward\\" in Hawaiian, cognate of the toponym Tokelau). What remains of Koolau is the western half of the original volcano that was destroyed in prehistoric times when the entire eastern half--including much of the summit caldera--slid cataclysmically into the Pacific Ocean. Remains of this ancient volcano lie as massive fragments strewn nearly over the ocean floor to the northeast of Oahu. KƒÅne ªohe Bay is what remains of the ancient volcano's summit caldera after the slide. The modern Koolau mountain forms Oahu's windward coast and rises behind the leeward coast city of Honolulu -- on its leeward slopes and valleys are located most of Honolulu's residential neighborhoods. View of Koolau Range from the top. KƒÅne ªohe is visible on the right side. The volcano is thought to have first erupted on the ocean floor more than 2.5 million years ago. It eventually reached sea level and continued to grow in elevation until about 1.7 million years ago, when the volcano became dormant. The volcano remained dormant for hundreds of thousands of years, during which time erosion ate away at the initially smooth slopes of the shield-shaped mountain; and the entire mass subsided considerably. The highest elevation perhaps exceeded ; today, the summit of the tallest peak, Puu K≈çnƒÅhuanui is only . =Honolulu Volcanics= After hundreds of thousands of years of dormancy, Koolau volcano began to erupt again. Some thirty eruptions over the past 500,000 years or so have created many of the landmarks around eastern Oahu, such as Diamond Head, Koko Head (Hanauma Bay), Koko Crater, Punchbowl Crater, Tantalus, and ƒÄliapaakai, and are collectively known as the Honolulu Volcanic Series, or simply Honolulu Volcanics. According to the US Geological Survey, the most recent eruptions in this series of activity occurred between about 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. There is a possibility that Koolau volcano could erupt again; however, the chance of such an eruption occurring in \\"our lifetimes, or even those of many future generations\\" is remote. Transportation There are three roads that tunnel through the southern part of the Koolau Range, connecting Honolulu to the Windward Coast.

This was his first album as leader for his new label Atlantic Records. Many of its tracks have become practice templates for jazz saxophonists.Ben Ratliff. Coltrane: The Story of A Sound. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux; 2007. . pp. 53-54.Lewis Porter. John Coltrane: His Life and Music. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1999. , p. 145. In 2004, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. It attained gold record status in 2018, having sold 500,000 copies. Two tracks, \\"Naima\\" and \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\", are respectively named after Coltrane's wife at the time and her daughter, whom he adopted. A third, \\"Mr. P.C.\\", takes its name from the initials of bassist Paul Chambers, who played on the album. Background In 1959, Miles Davis's business manager Harold Lovett negotiated a record contract for Coltrane with Atlantic, the terms of which included a $7,000 annual guarantee ().Lewis Porter. John Coltrane: His Life and Music. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1999. , pp. 117-8. Initial sessions for this album, the second recording date for Coltrane under his new contract after a January 15 date led by Milt Jackson, took place on March 26, 1959.Porter, p. 145, pp. 359-60. Coltrane was dissatisfied with the results of this session with Cedar Walton and Lex Humphries, and hence they were not used for the album, but appeared on subsequent compilations and reissues. Principal recording for the album took place on May 4 and 5, two weeks after Coltrane had participated in the final session for Kind of Blue.Porter, p. 360. The track \\"Naima\\" was recorded on December 2 with Coltrane's bandmates, the rhythm section from the Miles Davis Quintet, who would provide the backing for most of his next album, Coltrane Jazz.Giant Steps. Atlantic R2 75203, liner notes, p. 18. Coltrane's improvisation exemplifies the melodic phrasing that came to be known as sheets of sound, and features his explorations into third-related chord movements that came to be known as Coltrane changes.Porter, pp. 145-148 The Giant Steps chord progression consists of a distinctive set of chords that create key centers a major third apart. Jazz musicians ever since have used it as a practice piece, its difficult chord changes presenting a \\"kind of ultimate harmonic challenge\\", and serving as a gateway into modern jazz improvisation. Several pieces on this album went on to become jazz standards, most prominently \\"Naima\\" and \\"Giant Steps\\". Reception The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \\"Core Collection\\" calling it \\"Trane's first genuinely iconic record.\\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 102 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 103 in a 2012 revised list. In 2000 it was voted number 764 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. On March 3, 1998, Rhino Records reissued Giant Steps as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included were eight bonus tracks, five of which had appeared in 1975 on the Atlantic compilation Alternate Takes, the remaining three earlier issued on The Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings in 1995. Jazz historian Scott Yanow noted that \\"Giant Steps\\" took chordal improvisation to the extreme, while serving as great challenge to young musicians to play over the song's rapid chord changes.

From southern Wyoming County, it flows to the Genesee near Scottsville, draining an area of that includes all or part of 23 towns and villages in Wyoming, Genesee, Livingston and Monroe counties as well. Its name means \\"leaving the highlands\\" or \\"approaching an opening\\" in Seneca. Like its parent stream it originated during the end of the last Ice Age, as glacial impact on the upper Allegheny Plateau created a rolling landscape streams could gradually erode through, The Oatka carved a deep groove known today as the Oatka Valley, where the upper creek's two major settlements would be established. Native Americans of the Seneca nation established a few settlements along it where clearings arose in the forest. The Revolutionary War's Sullivan Expedition, brought the valley's fertile soil to the attention of the emerging nation, and the region was opened for settlement shortly after the war. For a time the Oatka was called Allan's Creek after the area's first settler, Ebenezer \\"Indian\\" Allan. Its waterpower facilitated early 19th-century European settlement of the abundant fertile lands in the Holland Purchase. Today it remains an important regional resource, used for water supply and recreational purposes, and actively protected to assure water quality. It is a popular trout stream, stocked from the oldest fish hatchery in the Western Hemisphere near its mouth. A dam in Le Roy makes the section below it a losing stream, dry during the warm months of the year as the stream flows through subterranean channels. Course Several small streams, some of which ultimately rise to the north at elevations of almost , come together to create the main stem of the creek amid the fields and woodlots on the high plateau in Gainesville just south of the Warsaw town line, a short distance west of Silver Spring Road. The new stream flows first south a mile, then turns northwest paralleling the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks toward the small hamlet of Rock Glen. There it crosses for the first time New York State Route 19 (NY 19), which it will parallel closely for much of the rest of its length. To the west of Rock Glen, it passes through the narrow gorge that gave it its name, emerging at another hamlet, Newburg, at the head of the Oatka Valley it follows for the rest of its run. Again crossing under Route 19, it has descended since its rise. From Newburg it meanders northwest, then north, staying close to the highway on the valley floor. Several miles further downstream it enters Warsaw, the county seat. It goes under Route 19 again and trends to the west, flowing under U.S. Route 20A to pass to the west of Warsaw High School and its athletic fields. North of the village the valley widens, staying generally level. The creek and NY 19 cross again amid large cultivated fields. The valley begins to angle northeasterly towards Wyoming, which the Oatka bypasses to the southeast into a large wooded area. It then passes through the largest wetlands along it course. North of that it crosses Route 19 again as that road turns eastward briefly. The two return to each other when they cross into Genesee County at Pavilion, where NY 63 crosses as they resume a northward heading, and there is another significant wetlands area. In another small wood two miles (3.2 km) north of Pavilion, US 20 crosses. The creek bends west, reaching its greatest distance from Route 19, then north-northeast back to the highway's vicinity. It enters the village of Le Roy on a northeast course, crossing Route 19 again as it widens into a reservoir behind the dam just south of NY 5. It narrows again north of the village towards Buttermilk Falls and the section that flows underground in warm, dry weather. The valley here is broad, its walls now long and gently sloped instead of steep and short. After going over the falls, marking the Onondaga Escarpment, it turns east, leaving NY 19 a mile south of the New York State Thruway. This geologically distinct section is known as the lower Oatka. It dips south, north and then south again through a largely wooded area as it approaches Genesee Country Village and enters Monroe County near Mumford. After bypassing that hamlet to the north, NY 383 parallels on the north and the CSX rail line across New York on the south, as the creek reaches Oatka Creek Park, a large tract of former farmland to its south. Here both road and rail are to the north of the stream, widening again. Beyond the park it enters an area of predominantly farmland again as it passes south of Scottsville, where NY 251 enters the village by bridging the Oatka. A mile further along, it empties into the Genesee. Watershed The Oatka's basin is relatively narrow and does not extend far from the Oatka Valley or the towns through which the creek itself flows. Almost all of the towns of Warsaw, Pavilion and Le Roy are within the watershed, along with large portions of Covington, Gainesville, Middlebury and Wheatland. Most of the eastern half of Stafford is in the Oatka basin even though only a small portion of the creek flows through it. In Livingston County Caledonia is the only town with land in the watershed, consisting mostly of its northeastern corner and most of the village of Caledonia. Other towns with no portions of the creek itself having large sections within its basin are Perry, Orangeville, and Bethany. Small portions of Castile, Wethersfield, Byron and Bergen also drain into the Oatka. There are five villages wholly or partially within the watershed. The former are Warsaw, Wyoming and Le Roy. Closer to its mouth are Scottsville and Caledonia. These are the only concentrated areas of development and population within it. The majority (73%) of the watershed is active or inactive agricultural land. Forests cover another 21%. Most of the remainder is residential or commercial land, with industrial use accounting for just 1%.Tatakis, Timothy; ; Oatka Creek Watershed Committee; 31. Retrieved October 13, 2010. The watershed's highest point of is located in southeastern Orangeville; its lowest point, , is the Oatka's mouth. Including the Oatka itself, there are of stream in the watershed. There are few significant lakes or ponds within the watershed. The largest is Lake Le Roy, near the headwaters of Mud Creek in Pavilion. It is a reservoir that once served as the main water supply for the village of Le Roy.State of the Basin, 32. The only protected area in the Oatka watershed besides Oatka Creek Park is the Carlton Hill Wildlife Management Area in Middlebury, north of Warsaw. =Water quality= The United States Geological Survey maintains two stream gauges on the creek, at Garbutt near the mouth and Warsaw below its headwaters. Average annual streamflow is at the upstream station and downstream. Flow at Warsaw averages 21‚Äì36% of what it is at Garbutt, but is much higher downstream in springtime and after significant runoff events.State of the Basin, 16. Only one community along the creek, the village of Warsaw, uses it as a water supply, putting it through a filtration plant before distributing it to residents and other customers. Its wastewater treatment plant is downstream of the intake. Le Roy also has state permits to discharge effluent into the stream from their wastewater plants, along with the Lapp Insulators plant in Le Roy and the fish hatchery in Caledonia (via the Spring Creek tributary). The latter has the highest permitted discharge of any permit in the Oatka watershed.State of the Basin, 34. The villages of Caledonia and Wyoming, and one of Pavilion's water districts, use wells in the watershed. The creek's water quality has been extensively studied in its lower watershed, below Buttermilk Falls. Most chemicals within it are within normal limits, with slightly higher levels of sulfates due to the gypsum and dolomite present in the bedrock. Those minerals also produce detectable magnesium and strontium levels as well. Trichloroethylene is sometimes found as well, the legacy of a spill from a railroad accident near Le Roy in the early 1970s. During high-runoff events, fecal coliform in the lower Oatka sometimes exceeds permitted levels.State of the Basin, 20‚Äì27. There are no major issues at present that could significantly degrade water quality on most of the stream. Accordingly, the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) classifies the Monroe and Genesee sections of the stream as \\"threatened\\", since some issues could arise in the future. The Wyoming County portion is considered \\"stressed\\", in that while its quality is generally good, occasional issues arise that limit use.State of the Basin, 13. In 1999, following a \\"Caring for Creeks\\" conference in Rochester, the Oatka Creek Watershed Committee was formed. It sponsored research into the stream and watershed, including the first \\"State of the Basin\\" report two years later. Intermunicipal agreements were adopted in 2004, and an outline for an Oatka Creek Watershed Management Plan was adopted in 2006, in cooperation with the Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Council. Wildlife There is limited data on the fish and plant species that thrive in and around the creek as no comprehensive survey has been done. The state has identified several communities of species it lists as rare, threatened or endangered. To protect them more effectively it has limited publication of the exact species or location of the communities.State of the Basin, 12. More specific data exists on benthic macroinvertebrates, or larger organisms that depend on the sediment on the stream floor. These are primarily the immature forms of insects that live on land as adults. Many of these species, such as caddisflies and stoneflies, are pollution-intolerant and thus their presence is an indicator of good water quality. They were found during a 1989‚Äì90 survey of the lower Oatka, but in lower numbers than expected. The stream is thus considered \\"slightly impacted\\" by pollution.State of the Basin, 27‚Äì28. alt=A live dark yellow and silver fish mottled with black, brown and yellow spots held in a human left hand. On the half-wet ground behind it is a fly-fishing rod Many of those insects constitute the food supply for various trout species. The lower Oatka is considered a blue- ribbon brown trout fishery, with some brook trout populating the water as well. The state fish hatchery on Spring Creek near Caledonia stocks the stream annually, and there is also evidence of a wild trout fishery on the stretch between Bowerman and Wheatland Center roads. A 1999 survey estimated the creek's total trout biomass at 30 pounds per acre (33 kg per hectare) bass, walleye and northern pike have also been taken near the Genesee. Geology Buttermilk Falls divides Oatka Creek into two distinct geological regions. The upper stream's bedrock is local sedimentary rock formations, with the shales and sandstones of the Sonyea Group, shale-limestone Genesee Group and Tully Limestone dominating from the headwaters to Pavilion. Between there and Le Roy the shales and thin limestones of the Hamilton Group underlie the creek.Dowling, C.B. et al; ; Oatka Creek Watershed Committee, December 2001, 12. Retrieved October 15, 2010. North of Le Roy, the Oatka becomes a losing stream, with water disappearing into the ground. In the warmer months this results in the creekbed drying up above Buttermilk Falls, and slowly re- emerging further down from springs and seeps.Geochemistry, 11. After it does, and turns to the east, it flows over the Akron Formation, Bertie Group of dolomitic shales, and the Salina Group. The latter is diverse, including evaporites such as halite and gypsum in addition to its limestones and shales. In the lower section of the creek there is significant groundwater entering the creek. As it discharges, it weathers the gypsum and limestone. This results in increased sulfates in the water, and bicarbonates and calcium have also been found near the falls. These concentrations are in winter and spring, when heavier precipitation and runoff offsets the impact of the groundwater. History As the glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago the landscape they left behind on the Allegheny Plateau was a rolling expanse of drumlins and depressions in which meltwater and precipitation could accumulate. It was ideal topography for stream formation, and these bodies of water eventually combined and became the Oatka, eroding the Oatka Valley. Fertile soil from the highlands accumulated in the valley, and the land eventually reforested. The Native Americans who would become the Seneca nation eventually came and settled in the area. They established a few small communities at the clearings in the forest where they found good hunting, and were first to farm the lands in the valley. The network of trails that connected them eventually became part of today's road network in the area. The Senecas eventually became part of the Iroquois Confederation, where the Oatka was at the very westernmost extent, giving them the honorific \\"Keepers of the Western Door\\" within the Confederation. In 1779, during the Revolutionary War the Continental Army's Sullivan Expedition came into Western New York to suppress Senecas who had professed loyalty to the British or might do so. Many of the troops came from farms in New England and recognized the quality of land in the Oatka watershed. After the war they agitated for it to be opened to settlement. After the war, New York and Massachusetts resolved the latter's claim to the area, and the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree (today Geneseo) extinguished all Native land claims. The first settler along the Oatka was Ebenezer \\"Indian\\" Allan, who established himself near the mouth of the stream, in today's Wheatland, in 1786. The creek would be known as Allan's Creek for years afterwards. After he moved further down the Genesee, other settlers came, the beginnings of what became Scottsville. In the 1790s settlement progressed upstream with the establishment of Le Roy where the stream intersected an old Indian trail that later became New York State Route 5. Settlement moved quickly afterwards, with all present communities as far south as Gainesville seeing their first settlers in the opening years of the 19th century, when the Holland Land Company owned much of it. River modifications alt=A body of water with a curved stone dam. At the right of the dam is a small stone house, underneath which water flows. There are buildings on land behind the dammed water The only significant change made to the river by human engineering is the dam at Le Roy near where Route 5 crosses the creek. It creates a lake in the center of the village. Other dams or diversions that were created for milling purposes in the 19th century have been abandoned and/or removed. There are no power plants or flood control projects along the creek. There are 32 bridges currently spanning the creek, built between 1915 and 2003. The oldest carries Union Street in Wheatland; the newest is the NY 251 bridge into Scottsville above the creek's mouth. Seven of them carry NY 19 over the creek. These include both the longest, the crossing over the lake created by the Le Roy dam, northernmost along Route 19, and the shortest and southernmost, its bridge south of Rock Glen. Most are steel or concrete stringer or box girder structures, with the US 20 bridge in Pavilion and one of the Route 19 bridges north of Warsaw being steel truss designs. Economy In the early days of settlement the creek contributed directly to the local economy through the mills established along it. They were removed in later years when industrialization elsewhere made them less profitable. Today the creek's direct economic value comes from its role as a water supply and discharge for the wastewater of the two most populous villages along it, Le Roy and Warsaw. The narrow and deep Oatka Valley was a preferred transportation corridor through eastern Wyoming and Genesee counties. First came the road that became Route 19 in 1930. In 1874 it was paralleled by the Rochester and State Line Railroad; today operated by Norfolk Southern after many ownership changes. Intersections with major east‚Äìwest routes that became NY 5 and US 20A prompted the development of Le Roy and Warsaw around them. =Recreation= Oatka Creek's primary direct contribution to the local economy today is as a scenic and recreational resource. The former is enhanced by the Oatka Valley. The latter consists of hiking, boating and primarily angling in three distinct fisheries. The upper creek, above Warsaw, is stocked with 1,850 yearling brown trout in the spring of each year, supplementing an indigenous wild population. DEC surveys have found that by June few of the stocked trout remain, showing that the stretch has heavy fishing pressure. The record size for trout taken from this stretch is . DEC has not acquired any public fishing rights along the four miles () south of, but public access is relatively unhindered as there are several bridges, paralleling railroad tracks (both of which automatically create public access to adjacent areas of the stream under New York law) and the area is otherwise lightly posted against trespassing. From Warsaw to Le Roy, the stream matures and warms. This is conducive to different species of sport fish, particularly bass, pike, sunfish, crappies and bullhead. There is access from bridges and some public land owned by municipalities in the area. The lower Oatka is the portion most popular with fly fishermen. The groundwater infusions from the Blue Hole and falls cool the creek again; from the bend eastward to its mouth it is a freestone stream with a large population of stocked and wild brown trout. The 11,200 fry added to the waters each year come from the state fish hatchery north of Caledonia on the Oatka's Spring Creek tributary established in 1864 by Seth Green, the oldest such facility in the Western Hemisphere. Brown trout was first introduced to American waters from it; today the of fish produced supply almost all of the state's stocked streams. Public access to this section is extensive. The section in Oatka Creek Park is the most frequently used, since special regulations to conserve the wild trout population there allow no-kill fishing there with artificial lures year-round. Similar rules apply between October and March in the less-accessible stretch downstream of the park to Bowerman Road; during the regular season anglers are limited to two fish per day at a minimum. Black bass and northern pike have also taken flies in those waters., New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Retrieved October 17, 2010. Access is also available from a small Scottsville village park on the south bank east of Route 251, the hundred feet on the other side of that highway and both sides of the NY 36 bridge near Wheatland Center, as well as 50 ft (15 m) on either side of county roads that cross the creek. DEC has also acquired public fishing easements on a small stretch in Mumford and much of both banks along Oatka Trail in the Town of Le Roy between Mud Creek and the unnamed northern tributary two miles (3.2 km) upstream. These allow use of the 33 feet (11 m) adjoining the river by anglers for access to the water. They are subject to regular DEC fishing regulations.

It was negotiated between Sir William Johnson, his deputy George Croghan, and representatives of the Six Nations (the Iroquois).Peter Marshall, \\"Sir William Johnson and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, 1768.\\" Journal of American Studies (1967) 1#2 pp 149-179. The treaty established a Line of Property following the Ohio River that ceded the Kentucky portion of the Colony of Virginia to the British, as well as most of what is now West Virginia. The treaty also settled land claims between the Six Nations and the Penn family.; the lands thereby acquired by the British in Pennsylvania were known as the New Purchase. Treaty The purpose of the conference was to adjust the boundary line between Indian lands and British colonial settlements set forth in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The British government hoped a new boundary line might bring an end to the rampant frontier violence which had become costly and troublesome. Indians hoped a new, permanent line might hold back British colonial expansion.Billington (1944) The final treaty was signed on November 5 with one signatory for each of the Six Nations and in the presence of representatives from the colonies of New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as Johnson. The Native American nations present received gifts and cash totaling ¬£10,460 7s. 3d. sterling, the highest payment ever made from colonists to American Indians.Taylor, 44 The treaty established a Line of Property which extended the earlier proclamation line of the Alleghenies (the divide between the Ohio and coastal watersheds), much farther to the west. The line ran near Fort Pitt and followed the Ohio River as far as the Tennessee River, effectively ceding the Kentucky portion of the Colony of Virginia to the British, as well as most of what is now West Virginia. The British had recently confirmed the lands south and west of the Kanawha to the Cherokee by the Treaty of Hard Labour. During the Fort Stanwix proceedings, the British were astonished to learn that the Six Nations still maintained a nominal claim over much of Kentucky, which they wanted to be added into the consideration. In addition, the Shawnee did not agree to this treaty, contesting colonial Virginian settlements between the Alleghenies and Ohio until the 1774 Treaty of Camp Charlotte. Although the Six Nations of New York had previously recognized English rights southeast of the Ohio River at the 1752 Treaty of Logstown, they continued to claim ownership (by conquest) over all land as far south as the Tennessee River. They had reserved this territory for decades as a hunting ground. They still considered the Tennessee their boundary with the Cherokee and other \\"Southern\\" tribes. Although representatives of the Indian nations who occupied these lands, primarily the Shawnee and Delaware, were present at the negotiations in 1768, they were not signatories and had no real role in the Iroquois' sale of their homeland. The Iroquois hoped that by releasing Ohio lands, they could take pressure off their own home territories in the New York and Pennsylvania areas. Rather than secure peace, the Fort Stanwix treaty helped set the stage for the next round of hostilities between Native Americans and British colonists along the Ohio River, which would culminate in Dunmore's War. The treaty also settled land claims between the Six Nations and the Penn family, the proprietors of Pennsylvania, where the lands acquired in 1768 were called the \\"New Purchase.\\" Due to disputes about the physical boundaries of the settlement, however, the final treaty line would not be fully agreed upon for another five years. Map showing the \\"New Purchase\\" of 1768 in Pennsylvania The final portion of the Line of Property in Pennsylvania, called the Purchase line in that State, was fixed in 1773 by representatives from the Six Nations and Pennsylvania who met at a spot called Canoe Place at the confluence of West Branch of the Susquehanna River and Cush Cushion Creek in what is now Cherry Tree, Pennsylvania. The press of British colonial population growth and economic development turned the attention of investors and land speculators to the area west of the Appalachians. In response to demands by settlers and speculators, British authorities sought cessions by the Iroquois and Cherokee for land in Indian country. The Treaty of Lochaber with the Cherokee followed in 1770, adjusting boundaries established in the Treaty of Hard Labour, whereby the Cherokee withdrew their claim to part of the same country, encompassing the south part of present-day West Virginia. At one time, historians believed that the Treaty of Fort Stanwix was an example of Native Americans being forced to accept unreasonable cessions, out of weakness. But, since the late 20th century, historians have credited the Iroquois with high-level strategic thinking in terms of giving up little-used lands in order to deflect English settlement away from their own, more valuable homeland.

It came on the heels of Hurricanes Connie and Diane, and compounded problems already caused by the two earlier hurricanes. Spawned by a tropical wave which left the African coast on September 6, the system became a tropical depression in the tropical North Atlantic, before turning northwest and developing into a hurricane. After turning back to the west east of the Bahamas, Ione turned northwest and northward, moving across eastern North Carolina before moving east-northeastward out to sea. Ione caused $600 million (2005 USD) in damage, much of it to crops across North Carolina. As a result of Ione's impacts seven people lost their lives. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved through Cape Verde on September 6 and on September 11 Ione developed into a tropical depression. Ione remained weak for the next few days, and then began to steadily intensify as it moved north of the Lesser Antilles, reaching hurricane strength on September 15. Conditions were favorable for additional development, and Ione peaked with winds of on September 18 while north of the Bahamas. Drier and cooler air gradually became entrained in Ione's circulation, and the storm weakened into a Category 2 hurricane at the time of its Wilmington, North Carolina, landfall on September 19, which made Ione the third hurricane to hit the state in six weeks and fourth in 11 months. Ione was the first tropical cyclone to be observed on the Cape Hatteras radar during landfall and was one of the first observed to make small-scale oscillations within its track. The storm weakened to a tropical storm over land but restrengthened to a Category 2 hurricane over the northwestern Atlantic. Ione continued northeastward and became an extratropical cyclone on September 21. The extratropical storm crossed over Newfoundland and was last seen on September 24 moving across the North Atlantic. Preparations Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Virginia Capes to Morehead, North Carolina and a Hurricane alert was issued northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dump trucks loaded with dirt were ready to make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill, due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood. Recent flooding, from Hurricane Diane, along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike, business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose. New York City officials prepared for the worst, with police officers filling gas tanks of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty in advance of the hurricane. Flights were canceled in New York, firemen stood at the ready in Staten Island, and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm. A boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Archie Moore was delayed, which allowed the promoters to sell an additional $150,000 (1955) in tickets, which is $ in present-day figures. Impact alt=A rainfall graphic showing the eastern seaboard of the eastern seaboard of the United States. There is a track line entering central North Carolina then curves to the Northeast and the track line exits the coast near the Virginia border. The highest rainfall amounts, , are to the southeast of the track. The further southwest and north you go the lesser the rainfall amounts in those areas. September 18 was a gloomy day in Swan Quarter, North Carolina and winds did not significantly increase until between 2 and 3 p.m. By 9:30 p.m., strong winds buffeted the area from the east-northeast and the electricity went out at around 10:50 p.m. Area homes flooded for the first time since Barbara of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season and the tides increased until 8:45 a.m. on September 19 before rapidly rising between 2:00 and 2:30 p.m. The Lake Causeway was partially washed out towards New Holland. The Diamond Shoals lightship was reported to have broken loose during the hurricane. Tides did not fully recede at Swan Quarter until 3 a.m. on September 20, with winds finally dying down after 7 a.m. the same day. Cherry Point recorded a maximum sustained wind of , with gusts to . Prolonged easterly winds forced the tide to increase to levels to above normal, which resulted in one of the largest inundations in North Carolina history. The storm surge from Ione was recorded at at Morehead City, North Carolina, while a storm tide of was measured at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. It was reported that the storm lasted for nearly two days in North Carolina. HMTS Monarch, which had departed from Newfoundland, was laying telephone cable across the Atlantic ocean when Ione crossed its path. The ship weathered the storm, and managed to reach Scotland to complete its mission by September 26. Ione caused $600 million (2005 USD) in damage, much of it to crops across North Carolina. The rest came from flooding in an area already devastated by Hurricanes Connie and Diane six weeks earlier. Along the Trent River near Trent and the New River near Gum Branch, North Carolina, the river stage reached heights not seen again until Hurricane Floyd of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Ione caused seven deaths in North Carolina, a low number attributed to well-executed warnings and effectiveness of relief groups such as the Red Cross. Ione made landfall in Newfoundland, Canada during the evening of September 21 as a tropical storm and as a result cause wind and rain damage. That day the storm became extratropical, yet still had negative effects on Canada. In Carbonear a boy broke his leg after being blown into a car and thousands of dollars in damage, as well as broken poles, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and power outages were reported in St. John's, Canada. There were also reports of roof damage and a trailer being torn for its foundation. Three flights were cancelled, schools were closed and the ferry service between Bell Island and Portugal Cove was disrupted. On September 23 there were reports of boats that had been lost and in Harbour Grace and Harbour Main. There was also a report of a garage being flipped with a car still in it. There were also reports of a street and two mines being flooded in Corner Brook and it was reported that there was $2 million damage to the province. There was extensive damage to waterfront property on the southern coast of Newfoundland. On September 24 there were reports of fishermen losing gear, a house being blown off its foundation in Foxtrap, damage to the phone company, a washed out road in Swift Current and damage to the power company. On September 27 it was reported that buoys were destroyed in Harbour Grace, Fortune and Stag Harbour. There was also damage done to a freighter in Conception Bay. Legacy Due to the damage, the name Ione was retired and will never be used for an Atlantic hurricane again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with any particular name. As a result of this, this is the only time the name Ione was used for the Atlantic Basin since hurricane naming began in 1950. When one of the first tropical cyclone forecast models was developed, Ione was chosen as one of the candidates to test out its reliability. The errors associated with Ione were significant, as the model did not forecast Ione to make landfall in North Carolina, forcing the storm eastward to the south of the state.Lcdr. William E.

Named San Pablo Avenue for virtually its entire length, SR 123 is a major north-south state highway along the flats of the urban East Bay. Route 123 runs about 7.39 miles (11.9 km) between Interstate 580 in Oakland in the south and Interstate 80 in Richmond in the north. San Pablo Avenue itself, a portion of Historic US 40, continues well past these termini, south to Downtown Oakland and north to Crockett, but without the Route 123 designation. Route description Route 123 is a four-lane boulevard with a median strip for its entire length. Its southern terminus is at the underpass of Interstate 580 in Oakland. Going north, it passes through the cities of Emeryville, Berkeley, Albany, and El Cerrito. It briefly turns on Cutting Boulevard before entering Richmond at its northern terminus under Interstate 80. San Pablo Avenue is sometimes used as an alternate route to the Eastshore Freeway (Interstate 80) when that freeway becomes very congested. Major intersections along this route include 40th Street, Ashby Avenue (State Route 13), University Avenue (which leads to UC Berkeley), Gilman Street, Marin Avenue, Central Avenue and Cutting Boulevard. Continuing on San Pablo Avenue past Route 123's southern terminus eventually leads to downtown Oakland and Oakland City Hall where San Pablo Avenue ends. Continuing on San Pablo Avenue before Route 123's northern terminus leads to the cities of San Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, Rodeo, and Crockett. In Hercules, San Pablo Avenue meets the terminus of State Route 4 near Interstate 80, and, after a discontinuity bridged by Parker Avenue in Rodeo, the road approaches the Carquinez Bridge and arrives in Crockett as Pomona Street. An AC Transit Rapid Bus (72R-San Pablo Rapid) runs along San Pablo Ave. from Downtown Oakland to Contra Costa College in San Pablo. The express bus line was put in place after a Metropolitan Transportation Commission study determined that it would be more cost-effective than a previous proposal to install light rail along the route. The BART system runs its Richmond leg parallel to the route up to the El Cerrito Del Norte station. Route shield signs at the intersection of San Pablo Avenue (SR 123) and Ashby Avenue (State Route 13) in Berkeley. The Alvarado Adobe is located by the San Pablo City Hall on the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Church Lane. SR 123 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History San Pablo Avenue is one of the oldest existing roads in the East Bay. It originated in the Spanish colonial era as the Camino de la Contra Costa (\\"road of the opposite shore\\", i.e. opposite from the Presidio of San Francisco and the settlement around the Mission in San Francisco) and was legally a \\"camino real\\"Dise√±o del Rancho de San Pablo, Bancroft Library Collection, c. 1830 (\\"royal road\\", i.e., property of the Spanish crown) until Mexico won its independence in 1821. It ran from the Encinal (\\"Oakland\\") landings of the Rancho San Antonio northward (actually northwestward) along the bayshore, then eastward just inland of the Carquinez Strait. It was the principal thoroughfare for the scattered ranches throughout this part of the East Bay. The name persisted into the American era when it was still called the \\"Contra Costa Road\\". On July 15, 1852, the Court of Sessions of Contra Costa County ordered the construction of a more direct and somewhat improved road along the same general route between the Rancho San Pablo and Oakland,https://books.google.com/books?id=3hIVAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=titlepage#PPA205,M1 History of Contra Costa County, J. P. Munro-Fraser, published by W.A. Slocum, 1882 which consequently became known as \\"The San Pablo Road\\". This segment subsequently became today's \\"San Pablo Avenue\\". In 1927, this road was designated as part of the Lincoln Highway, the nation's first transcontinental road upon the opening of the new highway bridge across the Carquinez Strait. Prior to the construction of the Eastshore Highway, San Pablo Avenue was the main north-south route through the northern East Bay, carrying the designation U.S. Route 40 north of University Avenue in Berkeley (US 40 proceeded down to the foot of University and the end of the Berkeley Pier where an auto ferry transported motorists to the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco). U.S. 40 was moved to the new highway after it was built (1930s), and about 25 years later took its current designation of Interstate 80. San Pablo Avenue was Business U.S. 40 until 1964. During 2005‚Äì06, San Pablo Avenue was repaved and otherwise rehabilitated by Caltrans. Portions of San Pablo Avenue, particularly in Berkeley, Albany, and El Cerrito, are slowly transforming, with a mix of trendy shops, restaurants and condominium developments. In the early part of the 20th century, a streetcar line ran on San Pablo between Richmond and Oakland. Part of the Oakland segment of these tracks up to Grayson Street in Berkeley were used during World War II for the Shipyard Railway of the Key System which transported workers from the Key System's hub in Emeryville to the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond.
